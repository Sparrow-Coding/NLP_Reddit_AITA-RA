How can we get users to explore other subreddits?
First let's look at two subreddits that have alot of
activity on it. AmItheAsshole and RelationshipAdvice.
Both allow users to post issues going on in their personal lives
and recieve comments on their post which other users offer
advice/solutions or their opinion on the given situation.

During data collection, AmItheAsshole/AITA and RelationshipAdvice/RA unditt.com was used to gather removed 
post but overall, both subreddits contained 14,000 shared words and had unique polarity with AITA being more negative
in terms of word impact as opposed to RA. With this, we can
create an algorithm that compares post with similar words and 
polarity scores in order to provide reccomendations for other subbreddits.
