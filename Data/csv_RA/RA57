It was a mutual decision, and we hated that we had to do it, but we just couldn't make things work.

We kept in touch after our break up as we still cared for each other, and would have text conversations a couple of times a week.

But, a couple of months after we broke up, I find out she has a new man (from an IG post..) which crushed me because despite having agreed to break up - in my mind, it was only due to the circumstances, and in all honesty, I was waiting until there as good news RE covid so we could start things again.

Anyway, we talk about the fact I knew she moved on, and then we stop talking. I never unfollowed her on IG (big mistake), and so spent 2 years watching her stories, and saw that she moved on with a second guy later on...

For context, after about 1.5 years of not even trying to move on from her, I finally went on some dates and was with someone for a few months myself (but deep down I knew I still wasn't over my ex).

So 2 years pass, and I move to another country. She just so happens to visit the city I'm in while on holiday with friends. Long story short, we get dinner together, I learn that she's  currently single, and within 24 hours we're back together. 

We talk about everything and I learn that she never loved the guys she was with, and had missed me for the past 2 years too. I believe her, she's not a manipulator, and we always had a healthy relationship. Basically, COVID was hard for us, we did what we did to move on (for her it was find someone new ASAP, for me it was being sad and alone for a long time).

I know LOGICALLY that what she did makes sense. I'm not here to judge her. I know that I also got with someone else during this time, which she doesn't like to think about either. I have accepted her new past - I think. But, there are moments in our conversations where she'll slip up and mention something about one of the guys she dated since me. After an awkward moment, we kind of brush it off and move on. But it sticks with me on an emotional level and days like today, I just can't focus on anything, because I'm too caught up with this new past she has. 

So my question is, **even though I understand everything that happened on a logical level - how can I cope with this situation on an emotional level?** 

When I first met her, she'd been with a few guys before me, and I'd been with a few girls. It didn't bother me one bit. I know the past is the past and she was with me, so it wasn't a concern. I am trying to frame our situation like that, as though we are just meeting for the first time, and why would I care about these ex boyfriends.

She said that for her it was normal and she didn’t think it was.

Fast forward to a few weeks after the break up and I see myself very often thinking about her in that idealised version where she didn’t deceive me and everything was great and we were both happy. We weren’t happy for a long time and even without her cheating on me this is not an accurate version of what the relationship was like. I also dream about her very often, both where I miss her and she texts me in a dream or we are just fighting and its a real nightmare. 
After I remind myself of how things were and what she did I am fine and much better and that things are better for me know. But after a short time I always start to miss the idealised version of us and miss the feeling of being loved by her that I had before discovering what she did.

Over the past 8 months things have just been not going great, we keep trying and trying and I fear that we just are going to continue to hurt each other. He is an amazing person but for a few reasons I’m not sure if we are aligned anymore.

1) he wants to move to Arkansas (I have no interest nor would I thrive there with my career) because he thinks he’ll be able to built a good job clientele there for what he does. I am very open to moving somewhere new but I just know deep down that is not the state for me. He also has family there so I can see why there’s an appeal. 

2) he’s been struggling with his sexuality and has been very indecisive because he doesn’t know what he wants. I never put pressure on him to put a label on how he views himself, however I fear his attraction to women overall has depleted. Maybe that will change over time who knows, sexuality is fluid.

3) he wants an open relationship and I’ve really tried to be open minded but I’m just not sure if that’s what I want as well. It’s hard to know if I actually want it or if I just am trying to tell myself that’s what I want. To be clear when we got together this wasn’t the agreement, but he brought it up after telling me he was bi (we both are and didn’t realize it until a few years after we started dating) and I’m just not sure if that’s the life I see myself living. 

There’s other issues on both ends, listen I’m not a perfect partner either. But our relationship has always been solid up until the open relationship convo. All these months and now he’s prioritizing therapy. We’re going in 2 weeks but damn every day trying to get there has been painful. Even with all of that h he’s still my best friend and we both love eachother so much. 

I’m here to ask how do you recommend trying to get through a difficult time like this? I’m scared of the outcome. I’m someone who struggles from anxiety, depression and PTSD, so dealing with this has taken a big toll on my mental health. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated.

I’m really quiet and pleasant always polite always turn up on time for appointments never complain always do what she asks etc yet her attitude with me is poor tbh.

I say hello to her at the beginning of every appointment she ignores me and juts narkily says ‘how’s your job search going’ rolling her eyes while looking at her computer screen etc

I ask her about a job application I’m stuck on she ignores me she puts me in computer job search and never goes near me to offer help but goes near the others.  I once picked up a pen she dropped once she didn’t take it off me and said ‘just put it down on the desk’ then later seen her put it in the bin after I walked off which was like 3-4 mins later.

But when certain other males who seem attractive and attracted to her it’s a different person from her. She’s giggly, bubbly all little miss sunshine personality goes out of her way for him offers him help she’s never offered me. phones him several times a week to offer him help but never phoned me and she also offered them to phone her and never has with me , you get the drift .

she randomly walks up to me and just scratches me or bites me. and it’s not that she doesn’t like me specifically or something because she does this with everyone. she does this with my other roommate and all of our guests. all the time i have scratches all over myself and i keep my distance from this cat (i never try to pet her or pick her up)

the issue is that my roommate doesn’t care. today i was sitting at my desk and the cat tried crawling up my back. i was wearing a knit top so her claws went right through the holes and scratched up my back. i screamed a little bit out of the pain and my roommate was right next to me and definitely heard me and did nothing about it. for the next 10 minutes the cat would continuously try to scratch my legs or jump up my back again and i kept yelling in pain and my roommate just let it happen. 

like i said, ive never had a cat before so i dont know how to go about training because i know cats can get aggressive, but it bothers me a lot that my roommate makes no attempt to train her cat. even so, if training is out of the picture, if she is watching her cat hurt others i dont know why she isnt doing anything about it. 

the other night her cat was sitting on my dresser and knocked my expensive camera onto the floor. my roommate was in the room with me and just groaned when it happened. i had to get up and make sure there was no damage. she didnt ask if anything had been damaged or even apologize. i own a dog and if my dog did something like that to anyone i would apologize and pick him up and take him away (like to my room or outside)

 I’m very confused and frustrated I feel as if me writing little notes/journals helps because i’m so lost and sooo hurt but happy. My on again off again boyfriend is literally the man i fell in love with but he’s also the same man who hurt me and broke me into a million pieces. I have no idea how I still want and care about him sooo damn much after he screwed me over. I’m not gonna lie and sit her saying I was the perfect girlfriend to him and did everything right in our relationship because i’m far from that but in all honesty i was just trying to have fun and party not caring about his feelings, only worrying about me. I did it bc I could, not necessarily because I wanted to because most of the things I didn’t want but it was forced upon me but regardless of that It’s also about the way he made me feel. I felt in public he was ashamed to be see with me or to be with me in general. He made me feel like he was hiding me. Then to find out he was cheating and he kept cheating after the many fuckin chances I gave him so of course I’m not going to trust him how i first did. Like after alll the chances I gave him LITERALLY BEGGING him to stop and be loyal to ME and only ME. It made me feel not good enough, not to mention put me health at risk bc he wanted to be a hoe. I’m getting soo mad just typing this because I DIDNT deserve to be put through that especially at my age. At the same time tho behind closed doors he was soo sweet and supportive. He helped me mentally and emotionally. He would try to calm me down when i was about to fight bitches. He held me and whipped my tears as I cried. He helped me with hw. He understands me. Not to mention the Sexual Tension between the two of us. The sex was sooo mind blowing, he was my first. The sex had Passion, Hints of Anger, Love, and Competitiveness. Us trying to one up each other. Then the After care was what actually made m fall in love with him. He’d give me some of his clothes, he’d cuddle me, he’d kiss me, we’d joke and play around, We’d Fall Asleep In Each Others Arms!

At the beginning of the relationship he expressed that he didn't want to talk about past relationships, because those things are in the past. I was fine with, and respected that, so a part from a few very short conversations in the beginning it hasn't been brought up.
This evening I was looking through his old Facebook posts to try and find some sentimental photos for a Christmas present, and I came across a post from 11 years ago where he was talking to someone about his upcoming wedding. And a second post from 9 years ago that showed that he and his ex were married.
It's really bothering me that he has never mentioned anything about it. I understand that I agreed not to talk about our exs, but I feel like this is a pretty big thing that he should have at least mentioned. 
He wasn't dishonest, but I'm hurt that he didn't tell me and I feel lied to.
I want to talk to him about it, but I don't know how to bring it up. 
Should I bring it up with him? Or should I try to forget it?
Any advice would be incredibly welcome.

I'm new here, and honestly I never thought I would end up here. It's just desperate times call for desperate actions, and I'm so lost in my own thoughts and overthinking that maybe receiving some input from people, be it strangers or friends, might help. 

Last May, I met someone and we instantly clicked. He is originally from the country I live in, but a period of time he was living in another country for work. He was only here for 3 weeks (and I managed to meet him during his last week here), throughout this week we truly felt a connection, and from my end, I was already willing to devote my time, space and interest to focus on him and move on forward with our blossoming relationship. I am indeed the kind of person who puts in a little bit too much into things I like or love, and this was perfectly that case. When he went back to the country where he used to work, I also booked tickets to visit him there after 4 weeks of us talking through social media. It's important to take into consideration that this was the second time I ever travelled by plane, and the first time I travelled by myself. So not only was I willing to spend money and time on this person, but also a lot of effort and fighting a lot of anxieties off. Everything was well and I was looking forward, however on my first night over his place in the country he worked in, I learned that a week prior to my arrival he had made out with someone while partying.

I understand that he has his own views and values on the matter and he claims that the intent behind the kiss wasn't malicious or because he felt attraction towards the other person. However I felt extremely disappointed knowing that I went out of my way to do so much for him to visit him, and his way of 'paying me back' hurt me a lot, and to this day, almost 6 months after, I am still wounded. I understand that maybe I was putting a little bit too much for such a fresh dynamic, and automatically I might have been expecting the same from him. I sometimes keep myself in check by telling myself that it was too early for any of us to restrain each other from anything, but to me, if someone was going to visit me after only getting to meet them for a week, I'd find it cruel and cold to kiss someone else knowing that there is someone willing to come to you despite all challenges. 

To this day we're still together and we've made progress, and this whole kissing thing isn't something he does when he's committed. But I can't deny my feelings, I've talked to him about everything and how I feel, I even started therapy because it creates so much insecurity. I just feel scared that I won't be able to trust him, and that I have been mistreated, and that it's a bit unfair on me because what I did for him was a lot, and what he gave me back was painful. Sometimes I regret everything I did and how vulnerable I allowed myself to be because now I have to suffer the consequences of loving him while still feeling angry and resentful that he did that to me.

We work at the same company and started dating 3 years ago. Honestly we’ve never had problems being coworkers and romantic partners - until recently. 

I developed a bit of a crush on this new hire (25F). Physically she is right up my alley. My GF even joked about it when she got hired. To make it worse, she wears very tight fitting clothes as her position calls for selling as much as possible, where as my gf is in a managerial role and dresses professionally. She scolded me for staring a couple of times but mostly in a playful way

The summer party rolled around but my GF couldn’t attend. That’s where I started talking to newgirl and catching feels. Later that night I looked up her socials out of curiosity. 

The next day, literally, my GF uses my iPad to search for something while I’m not home. 99% of the time she never touches my iPad but that day her spidey senses were tingling. Of course the thing she googles has a similar spelling to my crushe’s name, so she saw I looked her up. That’s when all hell broke loose. She wanted to break up and suggested I quit.  

I reassured her I loved her, nothing happened and I would never cheat. It was just sortve natural. We read many Reddit threads about this topic, a lot of them said what matters is how you act in response to the attraction. What you feed grows. 

Obviously I put her in a terribly awkward position since she has to see this girl at the office everyday. At least we all work in different departments, so there’s very little overlap in our jobs. Anyways I made a promise to my GF that I wouldn’t feed into the crush, just hi/bye, and I wouldn’t put myself in any situation where I’d be alone with newgirl. 

The next few months were rocky and trust had to be rebuilt, but we made it work. My crush faded, we bought a house together, moving in a few weeks. Everything seemed great

Until today, I saw newgirl for the first time in a while and I got this butterfly knot feeling in my stomach. When she’s out of sight/out of mind, I forget about her completely but then days like today I get this burning inside me. I feel guilty for having these feelings. 

What can I do to move passed this? Obviously changing jobs is the easy answer but our salaries and benefits are so good at this company, not to mention we just got a crazy mortgage on the house.

We were struggling, but I thought we could fix many things. I had a long depression episode because of work, I was totally burned out, and my mental health was very bad. She obviously felt I wasn't for her. After some time she decided to leave me. 

But it was a sudden decision. I felt I had just finally came back after a long fight with depression and she was gone. My heart hurts so much, I've tried everything to make her come back. She says she doesn't love me and that she doesn't want a relationship. I tried to understand, because it was very sudden. I'm very scared. I'm going to therapy. 

However, she blocked me on Twitter, and someone told me she started posting something about being in love with somebody, and then a guy's profile commented her tweets. This is very sad, and I feel stupid because she found another persons really fast. I haven't slept well in months and this makes it worst. 

I didn't know that guy, and even her little sister follows him in Instagram. I feel like replaced.

I asked him not to speak to her for a while until I was comfortable for that friendship to continue. He didn’t do that and talked to her behind my back. He had his chance of redemption. He was then asked not to talk to her at all however he couldn’t do that either. So now he was told by me and our couples therapist that he can’t have both and that if he wants this relationship to continue he needs to cut ties with her. He then messaged me after we’d made weekend plans that we were excited about and told me his ex had messaged him and that he wanted to speak to her. I have told him clearly on lots of occasions I’m not comfortable and I feel like second best to her. My worry is is that during this break he’ll either go see her or he’ll talk to her or even cheat on me.

On a weekend during May we had the munchies. I was too tired to go anywhere so I stayed home and fell asleep while he went to get food. He ended up coming back almost 3-4 hours later with chicken wings from the place that starts with a W. We live in Chicago. There’s like 5 of them within 20 minutes of us. 

He woke me up, handed me food, sat down, greeted me and cuddled then told me he cheated on me. I remember the look on his face and I remember that it was his serious look. I remember his eyes seeming apologetic and genuine. Like the look you would use to deliver bad news to someone. He ended up apologizing for joking like that and we ended up never talking about it again. 

Around early August he borrows my phone and logins in on a social media app. He ends up giving me my phone later with it still logged in. I snooped through his messages and found a women named H. Him and H have sent explicit photos and messages. I noticed one from around May where he said he was 5 minutes away. From what I’m assuming is he went over to her place. 

Within the last few weeks I put 2 and 2 together that the messages they exchanged in May matches the time and date of that night he came home late in May. 

Since August we have been working on  our relationship and he says they never did anything but since I made that connection it’s all that has been on my mind. 
 
How and should I even bring this up to him? Is this something we should discuss about or should I just ignore? It’s not really a confirmed thing either. I don’t have physical proof it happened. All I have is the memory of seeing the date when I went through the messages. 

If I do bring it up I’m afraid it’s going to ruin the progress we have made since then and I don’t want to have a setback or a big fight.

A little timeline so you guys have a background first:
- I went out with this guy as a favor to another friend to show him my city when he was in a business trip. It felt more like a date throughout the day, but he didn’t make a move;
- we were still on talking terms, but nothing other than happy birthdays &amp; merry Christmas;
- fast forward 4 years and I meet the friend that initially asked me for the favor and he tells me his friend had really liked me and was super single;
- I start talking to this guy again, show him my interest and he asks me to fly all the way from Brazil to Switzerland to spend the week with him - all expenses paid;
- I told him I didn’t want this to be a rebound or a fancy bootycall, to which he replied it wasn’t and that we should keep an open mind;
- I departed last Friday and arrived on Saturday.
So here the story starts, he goes to the airport to pick me up with flowers, we get home, eat, he pours some wine, we start kissing, go shower together, everything very romantic, then we had sex. Which is fine, I wanted it and so does he. The next day he takes me out to see around, we had a great time, come back home, dinner, sex and movie. On Monday I had to work, so we go to the sauna in the morning, he’s very affectionate, we have some fun in the sauna and then I come back home and work. In the evening again, fondue for dinner, sex and movie. Yesterday was when everything went to shit. He took me out to Lucerne, since he’d never been there himself I thought it’d be a good way to create memories. Then I started seeing him on the phone very often, I’m usually not the type of person that cares if you text every now and then (even though I find it disrespectful), but he was really overdoing it. It was a girl, I could tell, but I didn’t see the content of the messages, I start closing off, he asked me 3x what was going on but I didn’t wanna say anything, so I said nothing. Our day continues, he’s still texting her, then one time he says she was a Korean friend who landed in Austria and wanted to know if going to his home country was safe. I smelled BS right away because this shouldn’t take long to help and also because I saw him sending her a screenshot of a flight to Vienna, basically the same he did to me. I also saw that she reacted with a ❤️ to one of his messages. We get back home and I’m in a slightly better humor, dinner, sex. Right after sex he just leaves me and goes do whatever, then I see him on his fucking phone again and this time I couldn’t hold myself. He asked me if anything was wrong and I told him he was on the phone all day, that I came all the way from Brazil to spend time with him and on the few days I have free (because I still have to work) he’s texting some other chick? I told him I didn’t care about their relationship or the content of the texts, but he could have the decency not to txt her that much or do it when I’m working or not here. He barely lets me talk, says he doesn’t do drama, that we’re two different people, that we’re not compatible, that I want kids and he doesn’t (he knew that before I departed), that he saw I had expectations, but basically didn’t feel the same. Said he wanted me to have a good time, I asked him why he wasn’t honest, that I’d have treated him like a casual thing then…This is the same guy that gave me flowers, cuddled me, took a pic at Lindt museum like a couple (his idea too), we just sat there, he hugged me and everything. He’s also been fking me condomless, knowing very well I’m not on the pill - he’s not coming inside, but still. By this time I’m already crying because I feel like such an idiot for opening up to him and trusting him this way. His reaction? stone cold and turned on a movie as I tried to change my flight back, but it was too expensive and not worth it. Tried to go to my nearest friend in Europe but it’s proving to be trickier than expected, so I call a friend to vent and go to bed. Today he wakes me up for breakfast, I get up, go to the kitchen, he’s touching me in a loving way and being nice, says sorry then proceeds to give me a hug, the type of hug only couples give each other and then tried to kiss me, but I turned my face. I was so confused by this, wth? What’s he doing? I was still sleepy and couldn’t make sense of anything.

I'd like every room to have a theme and a specific colour. I know one room will be the bedroom with low lights with a spicy theme (without needing to be explicitly sexual, so she can be comfortable if she is not in the mood).

One room will be the kitchen so food related. The activity could be guessing 3 favorite foods of the other person. While games and dares will obviously be about food and having fun with it.

Gaming is something my boyfriend and I have always enjoyed. We've both been gamers our whole lives, and we even used to frequently play/talk about them together. So as you can imagine, I've never really had any issue with anything gaming related. I'm a chill, cool, girlfriend. Lol. 

My boyfriend recently got a new computer with some upgraded parts and that has really sparked a whole new level of passion for him. I was obviously very supportive and even helped him with the process, but he has a VERY addictive personality, so I did express a few little concerns about our quality time as a couple. He's also starting a new job, and has college courses. But he brushed all of it off and told me ""it'll be fine"" and ""nothing will change"".

Now that he's had his computer for a little while, I've noticed a lot of changes in him. All he talks about is his game. All he wants to do is be with ""the boys"" and play his game. This will go on for hours and hours and hours with no breaks even on work days. He often times stays up as late as he can possibly get away with so that he can play for as long as he can. Lately, it's gotten to the point where he leaves me waiting on him or neglects plans in order to play just a little bit longer. He told me he'd spend his night off with me, I excitedly waited for him, and then he tells me ""nah, I'm gonna play with the boys"" at the last minute. Tonight he played for an additional 5 hours after bailing on our plans (he played 6 hours while I was at work today) and just a little bit ago he refused to go to bed with me so he could stay on the computer even longer. 

I can't tell if he's becoming addicted or not, and I'm always worried that I'm overreacting. I'm a bit of a busy person and also have lots of hobbies so I'm trying to be understanding. But I'm beginning to miss him, and although I want him to have friends and hobbies, it's almost like they're being put before our relationship more often than not. I love gaming as well, but it never comes before important tasks or relationships/commitments.

We had a rough patch last December thru April where she broke up with me twice because she said she wasn't feeling happy with herself and she was frustrated with the relationship. I took it hard but I left her alone and she started dating another guy. I ended up seeing her at a coffee shop 2 months after the breakup I did no contact and worked on me. Seeing her brought back alot of feelings for both of us and we ended up dating again and took it slow until we got back together.

Something happened between her and her daughter and her ex husband this week that she won't tell me but I can tell it was upsetting her. I ended up going over last night because she said she was having a depressed moment as she struggles with depression.

My boyfriend (25m) and I (22f) have been dating for six months. We are a really healthy couple and we communicate well. However, whenever my boyfriend goes out, he tells me every time someone flirts with him. Does he want me to know he is desirable? Loyal? Does he just want to make me jealous?

At first, I felt happy to know. In my previous relationship, I felt insecure because my ex avoided telling me anything that had to do with other women, even female friends. When my current boyfriend started telling me about his experiences, I felt reassured and glad he was keeping me up to date. 

But the more it happens, the more uneasy I get. He has not done anything to worry me, nor cheated on me. A girl flirted with him when I was right there even before we started officially dating but we were in the flirting phase. He rejected her so he could keep pursuing me.

However, I can’t help but feel a hint of uneasiness. He told me he felt uncomfortable because of the last girl that flirted with him; he walked away, and wanted to call me right away (he was drunk). I think it’s sweet and it makes me feel valued, but why does he feel the need to tell me instead of just letting it go? Why feel uncomfortable? Does he just want to get a reaction out of me?

We'd spend hours together, stay up until literally the crack of dawn playing games just the two of us. And at the age of 20 it was the first time I'd ever had a crush on another girl and realized it was a crush *while* I was crushing.

I liked her a lot. Like, a *lot*.

The worst part was (this is relevant I promise) I knew she was gay, and she would flirt with me, but Danny was kind of just... like that. At one point, she even said something (can't remember for the life of me what it was) that sort of implied she might be aromantic? However, I'm known to read in to things too much, and she's also asexual so she might have been referring to that? Anyways, basically, I had (have) no reason whatsoever to take the flirting seriously, accepted the crush as unrequited, and suffered in silence with a stupid smile on my face.

Shit happens though. Danny distanced herself from our mutual friends, and although the two of us were still on very good terms, it made it much harder to keep in touch. We gradually drifted apart; at present, we'll shoot each other a message a couple times a year (one time she even tried to set me up with someone), spot each other briefly in a mutual video game, and that's it for contact.

Here's the part I need help with: tonight, when we bumped in to each other in said video game, Danny decided to tag along with me. This was (pleasantly) odd/surprising until it quickly became apparent that she was pretty drunk, which explained her forwardness. I'd been *just* about to log off before she showed up. I told myself, alright, five more minutes, for her. Then I wanted five more minutes after that. Then five more. Then I finally stopped pretending I would leave so long as she wanted to hang out with me.

It wasn't exactly like old times, but it was enough to make me remember them. She even made a passing joke saying she would date me, which gave me the familiar ""aw shit"" unrequited butterflies that I hadn't felt in a long time. At one point, she asked if she could tell me a secret. I said, yeah, sure. She said: ""I'm drunk."" I laughed. She said she had another secret to tell me, so I asked what it was, still laughing a bit. She said, ""I missed you.""

God damn, I know she was drunk, probably didn't mean it the way it got to me, but fuck. Me too.

Really, crush or no crush, I've missed my friend. I want to reconnect, but if there's a tiny piece of me that's still hoping something more might happen, I'm a little hesitant, especially since I don't have any reason to believe she *would* like me back. Don't get me wrong, I want to reconnect regardless, but I'm very quick to getting carried away with false hope, and I'd like to prevent that. Plus, I don't want to seem weird/clingy by suddenly trying to get closer again just because of a drunken gaming session that she might not remember much of. I don't know whether to say something tomorrow or maybe wait a bit before really trying to reconnect. Or what to say at all, really. How do I go about rekindling our friendship after tonight? And if I do, how do I do it without getting stuck in the unrequited crush situation again?

TL;DR - Drifted apart from a girl I liked years ago, but tonight she got drunk and told me she missed me. I miss her too, and now I want to rekindle the friendship, but I might still be hung up on her, and I don't know if she even meant what she said. If I do reconnect, how do I even approach that without seeming overeager or giving myself false hope?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7562607,public,self,My (26F) old crush (29F) who I haven't spoken to in years just got drunk and told me she missed me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywpfee/my_26f_old_crush_29f_who_i_havent_spoken_to_in/,all_ads,6,,,

I (29m) was fired from my job yesterday unexpectedly. I've been there for 1.5 years. I was told I wasn't in the right place and making small mistakes in the past few months. In my defense, I was the only one in my group handling all the day to day tasks and I had to train a new person who couldn't do anything at all (she quit right before her 3 months probation). So I was significantly stressed out. We hire a new girl that works alongside myself and she is a quick learner, so I am very much relieved (or so I thought). It was a cushy Finance job where I was responsible for collecting from our customers. We had a goal of reaching 55million in collections from October 1-Dec 31, in which we would receive a bonus. My boss said I was ""being too negative"" because I made a joke about hitting 54.9M and we ""didn't need that here"". (Keep this in mind)

Now about a month ago, there was a company golf event, everybody got drunk and afterwards I went to another coworkers house for drinks, there was about 7 others here, some coworkers and some roommates. A coworker (26F) I had feelings for was there and long story short, we talked a bunch and made out. The next few weeks at work are awkward, another coworker told me I had tried taking advantage of her because she was drunk, but I know this is not the case as I was drunk too and remember most of it. I try to apologize but she doesn't care. So the girl I kissed is now avoiding me and barely talks to me for work related stuff. Before all this happened, we were pretty close. She would talk to me lots. she had financial problems and her life is just a mess. I had pushed hard for my boss to promote her into our group (her, me and the new girl). She eventually sits nearby me due to the promotion. It's awkward everyday (we don't talk at all) and I try to make jokes but she brushes me off and so I eventually give up trying to make things better. 

Around this time the same girl and a few other girls in the department form a clique and gossip nonstop in another office behind closed doors. Her and the new girl in my group ignore me and don't involve me in work related tasks at all, they also just talk to each other and don't include me. The new girl also has been taking all my work. One day in private they tell me this other girl in the clique has been saying racist and discriminatory things about people at work, also making rude comments taking someone's job. The girl in question has been getting raises every so often and seems to be always working from home whenever she feels like it. She is basically trying to play favorites with the boss. Any other place she would have gotten fired many times. So the comments she made are reported to our boss but nothing happens.

Fast forward to the last few days, I am let go and I am totally shocked and confused. I send a text to the girl I was close with before, and she says ""honestly you didn't know what you did wrong, which is a problem in itself. You're almost 30, grow up. You were told to do your job and get your shit together for the past 6 months which you barely did. Stop blaming the company and take responsibility."" 

I can't understand this dynamic? How could they treat a racist person making derogatory comments like that (raises, promotion soon, work from home whenever) but fire me for petty things? Am I crazy or is this not right? I can't believe this?!

I am also very tempted to fire back at that girl, her saying I need to grow up really hit me. She's the one that has been behind so much gossip at work, she also skips lunch because she can't afford food (she told me this before) and she has lost 10lb because of this. She also ""looks forward to getting drunk"" at company events, so i think she has a bit of an alcohol problem. Who needs to grow up here?  

Tl;Dr dismissed by my employer after making petty mistakes and jokes, but nothing happens to this coworker making racist and derogatory comments of others. Workplace is toxic AF just from that AND with all the girls. Have a feeling the girls in the group ganged up on me, fed the boss a narrative and forced me out. Should I fire back at her or just be the bigger person and leave this? Now I am not someone to hold grudges but the way this played out, I hope bad things happen to them.

I find this odd and it's making me feel like there's something wrong with me. I HATE this person when im alone, but when we are face to face I don't feel much. We just talk like normal people.  She's not charming or friendly either. We are just on our phones or I'm playing with the dogs. 

As soon as I drive home I start to feel guilt and regret. Like ""why am I still talking to this stupid b that ruined my life. She doesn't care about me or anyone but herself.""

Nothing wrong with video games as a hobby, i understand this is heaps of peoples way to relax and have fun.

It matters more to me now because what if we one day have kids? I would hate to have kids like that but it would be hipocritical of me if their dad is too. I think that now that we’re more serious I care more about these things, as I live a really active lifestyle where I’m always either outdoors or at the gym in my free time. As something who is really into health, it’s hard for me to see the way he treats his body (his diet is quit poor too). 

I’ve tried bringing him to the gym but he finds it boring and have also  tried cooking healthier things but he’s a very fussy eater. 

Often I’ll go to his place when it’s a beautiful day and he’ll have his windows shut so he’s in comeplte darkness playing games, It makes me feel like I’m dating a slob. I’ve brought it up to him and said I didn’t like it since it’s unhealthy. While I do care about his health, I also just don’t find this behaviour attractive but I don’t know how to tell him that without being rude.

Me(18m) and my gf(18f) have been together for a little over 5 months, it feels one sided in most aspects and I'm working to make it not so without being mean or cruel about it.

I'm a fit person, I'm not big but I'm lean and muscular, I eat well and workout almost every day. I work and we go to the same school together. I struggle with drug abuse(weed, alcohol, and smoking) but have cut it down to smoking for the past 2 months, planning to drop smoking too. I've dropped all social media and just almost porn addiction. Self harm is still a prevalent problem to me though that I cant figure out the solution to it.

My gf lives a much less disciplined life, but she tries and that's why I have hope in her. She struggles with ADHD, anxiety and depression. She comes from a household where a lot of her anxiety and trauma comes from her family. She's overweight and has very little self control with food. Addicted to her phone and technology. She does workout, but I doubt its as intense as she says it is because she often lies to hide flaws, like how often she binges food and how long she stays on bed or technology. No job and searching for one now.

I do not understand what it is to be mentally afflicted as someone who isn't and never has been, so I'm adamant on being patient with her when mental illness the reason she decides to not take care of herself. I try to push her on the road to self improvement because I know we will both be happier with ourselves and each other. I know that shell be better off in all ways if she works on herself, I want her to be happy when she looks in the mirror and at her achievements; but she hasn't made the progress to get to that point yet. Recently I've implemented reward a reward system in the form of completing checklists compiling of working out, journaling, studying and whatever else shed need to do that day. The reward being me treating her to a really nice date. I understand its manipulative but its with good intent, because i want for one day her to be able to recognize the fruits of her labor and work to be the reward.

I think the juxtaposition of our lifestyles is why I feel like its so one sided, i have little sexual attraction to her, I've never had a good sexual experience of my own with her, but she's had plenty, every single time we do anything sexual its always one sided for her. I'm her first for everything, except hand holding. Everything sexual I'm her first, I've never cum, it doesn't feel right to complain about this, but I really don't like it, its probably my biggest problem. I'm always treating us to food, helping her with school, helping her if she's having a hard time, I'm always helping her with everything. It's not like she doesn't try to help me too, but i just straight up don't need help with anything else, i think if i just had a single good sexual experience with her i wouldn't be as frustrated as i am. It's hard to justify too, like its her first time for all of this stuff, but it doesn't feel right that I'm always given the short end of the stick for everything. I dont think i can even justify, im just frustrated by it. She has tried, but there's always some form of her stalling from giving me any form of stimulation.

I do care for her, her personality is amazing, its the saving grace. The way she cares so much and all of her actions seem to be based off of that, shes always checking in on friends. Whenever we go anywhere shes always has this bubbly joyful vibe to her, in person anyway, its more tame online. Before me shes only had talking stages relationships, so im the first to show her what real love is like, deep affection and care anytime she needs it. She struggles financially so i offer her food if shes ever hungry, i want to be the best man she can have, just feels like im not getting anything in return. Idk if im not putting in enought effort or if shes just here for the ride. idk, shes obsessed with me because shes never had this kind of affection in her life. i dont want to break her heart but i want her to be the best her so i can enjoy her as much as she does her.

Writing this out, im starting to feel like im not doing any part of this relationship right, i need some advice

We've been through a lot. I love her a lot but having trouble with the negativity. There is always a problem with everything she does. She very rarely says something good about what she does. 

She says she wants to make video games, I say awesome you should enrol in a course. She answers no it's too late. I say nah it's not you can do it online  she says she'd rather go in person. (We live rurally) so she gives up. 

Gets a hair cut, says its shit. I say I like it, she says I'm just trying to make her feel good. (This happens every time) 

Does a painting, isn't the way she wants it. I say I think it's good, she says I'm lying, I assure her I'm not, apparently I'm smiling funny so I'm lying. 

She makes something, says its not the way she wants it, I say well what's one good thing about making it? She says I'm condescending. 

I try to talk to her and say look, it is getting hard to speak to you because it seems you rarely have anything good to say and she says that I'm just focusing on the bad things she says. But literally 95 percent of what she says is negative. 

Leading to another point. If I try to speak to her about something she will say that I am doing exactly what I've said she's done. Then walks away and says she'll listen when I'm talking nicely. 

For example, I said I feel like you are being argumentative today, she goes no you are being argumentative. 

If I say, I feel like I'm doing all the deep cleaning around the house she says you don't appreciate what I do. Yet I leave for work at 8 and get back around 4:30. She does the dishes, cleans the stove top and mops up after the dog when she has an accident sometimes. 

If I say I feel like I'm mopping the floors most of the time she'll say ""you don't mop the floor every time"" 

I feel I have to be very careful in wording things as my mostly ends up as always, or my sometimes ends up as mostly.

I look at her and there is always a miserable look on her face. Doesn't want to go out to places, doesn't want to do anything but stay at home and play games. 

It's like that song story of a girl or something. ""I absolutely love her, when she smiles"" 

We used to have fun, go on walks, draw together. She does have some health problems that make life difficult but at this point I feel like it's part excuse.

He was super clingy, always texting(although I used to tell him not to text me all the time), coming into my office to hug me despite being unprofessional and showering with gifts and compliments in the first months. I told him I needed time, so we were not in a relationship, but just seeing each other. He then showed me some photos of me on his phone, he had taken without my knowledge, to send to his sisters as he adored me so much and I was the love of his life. I think I liked the attention and started to catch feelings so I told him I fell for him after the 3rd date. We kissed and he would facetime me every dinner, and we would take off our shirts, cause of chemistry. We never did anything sexual just cuddling in person, but he would ask for night calls although I would tell him no. I think he needed sex. In public though(we work together) he didnt invite me to sit with him and his friends. He thinks he is the best and very extroverted and I am an introvert. He saw me alone at the cafeterià and didnt bother to come and sit by me as his friends dont think Im cool or either like me a lot(they re gossipers).

I felt disrespected and he would blame it on me when I expressed it to him. I was the sensitive one, making it a big deal. He would tell me i was his priority and then cancel our date and when I got angry or stopped communicating, he would say he didnt want to lose me and bring some flowers, lovebomb again, so I would get him back(which I did). He didnt respect me at all and even gave me the silent treatment for a period of 1month, avoiding me at work. It all came because he questioned me about a guy friend I have, wanted to see his photos and social media and blamed it on me for dating other people, for not being honest and made me swear I only cared about him. I told him his actions were possesive and broke my heart so he told me I offended him and that I should say sorry. When I did , he replied I had to wait for his forgiveness to punish me. I then told him I missed him , he abandoned me and treated me like crap. Then, I blocked him completely. We now see each other at work but he has ghosted me, barely looks at me and he still knows I care. I started dating another person but still think of him at times and cry. The same man who would tell he loved me to death turned into the man that threw me away like a garbage.

We’ve been together for 8.5 years and have two children together. Short backstory, I cheated a year ago (not physical). Then he took off to clear his head and we had ended things but I had started sleeping with other people and at the same time leading him on. I did want to be with him but didn’t at the same time. Basically continuing to cheat. This went on from July until I ended up in jail for the first time ever in my life in September for hitting him (first time ever) after a long day of him calling me names and making me feel worthless. I spent 3 months not allowed in my house and on probation (couldn’t live in the house I own but would stay the night when we were getting along and would try to talk about things.) After probation, I moved back in and we’ve spent this entire year trying to work on things. The trust obviously still isn’t there. I’ve never done anything like the things I did last year and was diagnosed with BPD which explains a lot but doesn’t excuse any of my actions. The issue here… well there’s clearly a lot of them.. the issue is that we’ve been fighting to save us for the last year but we can’t ever communicate properly to save anything. So did we really even try? We haven’t had any conversations with depth, he actually tries to avoid me because I just annoy him all the time I guess, I share my location and don’t go anywhere without asking him to go or I go with a friend and our children, I take pictures of me on breaks at work to prove I’m alone, he has access to all my social media so he knows I’m not talking to anyone else, etc. Our relationship has never been perfect. I’ve been told by 5 therapists in our spans of 8 years that he is abusive mentally and emotionally. I’ve left him 2 times officially in our relationship (moved out and everything) but it never lasted more than 4 months. I know that with BPD my abandonment issues are really intense, but I feel like my world is ending. I’ve spent the last year suicidal, I admitted myself back in April, because I am filled with so much regret and shame and guilt from everything. My therapist said I have a lot of PTSD from last year (more to the story than I could tell on here) and I know I’m the one that caused it. I’m sorry if this is jumbled and confusing… my thoughts are very much just like this. Do I let this end? I don’t want to be without him. I made a huge mistake and I’ve been paying for it for a year.

other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

we break up and well i beg obviously and
then he starts interacting with me late
