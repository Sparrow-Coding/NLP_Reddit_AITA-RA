I'm 80% sure we both like each other, but we're not gonna date any time soon because I don't want to be in a relationship for various personal reasons. However, I still like Alex and I treat her like a mix between a friend and a partner.

We've known each other for 1.5 months and everything within the first month was great. We did become codependent at one point, but we talked and resolved it.

A week ago, my feelings got stronger and I got scared, so I just pulled away and acted really aloof (for 2 days max.). Alex confronted me saying that she felt anxious because of my behavior (rightfully so). I explained what happened and apologized. Alex then said the following:

* she has found me to be mean on a couple of occasions but didn't say anything. she compared me to a domestic abuser who excuses their behavior by saying that abusing is their way of showing love (because I told her ""I guess you can say bullying other people is another of my love language"" awhile ago as a joke bcuz we were discussing love languages).
   * this really.really.really shocked me. she was referring to the times when I teased her \[playfully\]. I know I might be saying this in vain, but I kid you not I am not a mean or bad person in any freaking way. like, if anyone were to describe me, and numerous people have done this, they'd say I'm nice. this was soooooo far-fetched from who I am as a person that it shocked me and frankly broke my heart. I tease my friends all the time because I like to keep things on the light note, and I never ever tease anyone on a sensitive topic!
* she blames me for not talking much about myself and she often feels the pressure to keep the convo going.
   * I honestly found this to be on the bs side because, mind you, we send numerous texts everyday, which I have told her before that it's not super necessary because even with my best friend we don't text everyday. but she just feels the pressure to and now she's blaming me.
   * I have personal issues that prevent me to talk about myself, but I have made an effort to do that more with her. 
   * Even if I don't talk about myself, I participate actively in things that she talks about and I do present my own view and challenge her view.
   * I know it can feel like I'm burdening her by not talking about myself that much, so I do put a lot of efforts in this relationship in other ways like researching activities and planning every meetup (we both hate doing this. she doesn't know that I do, but she's told me that she does once, so I don't mind doing it as it's one way I can contribute).
* she said it's not her job to decode or solve my problems that she suspects stem from past trauma.
   * I never expected her to. never asked her. barely rant / complain to her because one of my insecurities in general is burdening other people.
   * I was really sad that she said this because I thought the decent thing to do would be to communicate her frustration and ask what's wrong and stick with the friend and just be there for them you know? I'd do it and have done it with my friends. 
   * I confronted her about this, asking if she'd say this to any of her friends who is acting out of character and she said no. She said she acted this way with me because my hot-and-cold behavior was a big red flag based on her past experience. the thing here is... I've only been hot-and-cold once, and it lasted for 2 days...
* she asked to never see each other again.
   * this was the first time that I have ever acted cold to her. but it was enough for her to just leave, which really hurts me.

Eventually, we both agreed to give this another chance. It's been a couple of days. the first day felt forced, the second got better. but at this point I'm still quite hurt from what she said. I also feel like I'm always walking on eggshell watching over everything that I say because she might perceive it as harsh. I do really like her and before this mishap, I planned to ask her out in the future when I'm ready for a relationship because she is really special and she positively impacts me in a couple of ways. this mishap allowed me to understand how she sees me, which is a big shocker, and the fact that she could walk away sooo easily. I'm torn because on one hand I know I still have feelings for her; on the other I feel broken because of what she said. I don't know if it's too soon to decide or if I should continue with her or just end this given what I'm feeling now.

We only became official because I was able to move cross-country to the same coast as him with my new job as a travel agent and its been a rocky start for the both of us.

We recently got into fights regarding his insecurities about trusting me about my judgement with random “strangers” aka new friends and coworkers, especially guys. Of course moving to a new state, making friends was something I was very nervous about since I am an introvert but that’s the whole point of moving is to explore new things and meet new people, but its still a struggle. He is the same way and for a time, he had a hard time adjusting to me spending a lot of time with new people when he has been struggling mentally and being distant with me for a bit. We had a breakthrough though and spoke about how he was sad about not having me physically (primary love language for us is physical touch) and losing me emotionally since I stated I was struggling, but I was having a good time making new friends and going on new adventures so I was looking for emotional support outside of us too. 

My bf flew to see me last week and one night he told me he had doubts about how I am with my male coworker and my guy friend here. The only way I could give reassurance was show him texts of that day. I definitely compromised myself to show him my phone because it shouldn’t ever get to that point in a relationship, but because I had nothing to hide and want to give reassurance I gave it to him. He read the texts and there was one time out I invited my coworker out with me since we were planning to get food later in the day and said he had nothing planned all day so being nice, I invited him out. My bf was so upset, said I fabricated the truth when I didn’t recall all details of that convo except that I told him my coworker wanted to go out that day to explore the city based on the eagerness I felt from my coworker when he replied “take me with you!”. I apologized sincerely, not meaning to hide things from him and it wasn’t a detail that I ever mentioned because it didn’t matter. I panicked and went to the bathroom and reread through my messages to see if there is anything that upset him further, but I remembered I sat there thinking “there is nothing to incriminate me here with” and I honestly blacked out and don’t remember if I did delete messages or not. 

He was distant all day and later on in the night, he stated that he didn’t fully trust me and wanted to know what this coworker and my guy friend (L) who I go out with in a group meant to me. I said they are just people to me, L being a friend who I just go out with and my bf didn’t believe me. He asked if he could read our texts to have reassurance, which I was nervous about because it was breaking my boundary again. I gave him my phone with nothing to hide, and he found my texts to be “too friendly” and I was “too responsive” with smiley faces and giving genuine answers. Naturally, guys flirt once or twice with any girl and so there was one or two messages with a ;) but I brushed it off. Neither have done anything or said anything appropriate to me in person. My bf was angry, saying he needs a gf who would never let any guy disrespect me or my relationship and to be a “bitch when I need to”. I’m not as confrontational of a person, especially if I have to see these people again. My bf also said that I respond to these guys like how I respond to my bf in text so he doesn’t feel special to me in comparison to these guys. 

He also found a thread of messages from a random guy I met at the bar from a few weeks back and was flirting with me and I responded, but that night we had our first fight and my bf stonewalled me. It was a coping mechanism from my last toxic relationship where my ex bf loved attention from girls and we fought often because of it so I went out to flirt with guys because I felt so alone in my relationship, but I never did anything. I felt the same way that night, but in the AM I caught myself repeating my past and felt so ashamed so I never mentioned it and never did it again. My bf was livid, stating that I just love attention and enjoy flirting with guys as if I’m single and now he has to worry about what happens when we’re in a fight and the fact that I never told him about it. I apologized about this, I knew it was wrong but I completely forgot about that convo. That night of the texts I expressed to him about how hurt I felt and he was barely responsive to me especially when I texted him that I got home late. 

I reassured him again that he means the world to me, I wouldn’t enter a LDR if he really is the one for me. He then asked me if I deleted any text messages between my coworker and L because he saw that I did. I panicked in that moment because 1) how would he know that? 2) did I delete messages? I couldn’t for the life of me remember if I did, but I would remember if I did right? So I said no, because my thoughts are that there isn’t anything for me to hide that I felt would incriminate me. He kept asking me again and again, I said no repeatedly and he said I was lying to his face. He stated the exact texts that I did delete and he knew because he read through my messages the night before. 

I was in complete shock, knowing this is me being manipulated but I also got caught for deleting messages that really don’t mean anything to me. He started packing his things, telling me I’m a flirt, a liar and an unfaithful gf which is completely false because I pride in being truthful/transparent and being a loyal gf because I love and give sm. I felt so emotionally threatened that whole day, feeling the need to do things that I never done before like delete messages or lie because I genuinely didn’t know if I did or not. He was packing up his stuff to leave at 3am calling me these terrible things that I know I’m not and I’m in full on panic mode and blocked the door from him leaving. 

I finally convinced him to stay and we talked in the AM, he said he would forgive me because in the end he still loves me more than he hated me in the moment. We cried together and stated we wouldn’t be like that ever again. However, I told my therapist about what happened and she stated that he was showing emotionally abusive behaviors which I agree deep down.  She also said he will not change. 

He literally is my favorite person on this planet and I’m the same for him, or we wouldn’t have a LDR in the first place.
Is it possible to change these behaviors and make sure it never happens again? 

I know how I handled this situation incorrectly to be reactive when emotionally threatened, but it was the fact he made me feel so threatened. My therapist said he set me up to treat me like a criminal so in response, I acted like a criminal even though I had nothing to hide.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7587604,public,self,Is it possible to change emotionally abusive behaviors?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yz7a24/is_it_possible_to_change_emotionally_abusive/,all_ads,6,,,,

We moved in together about 7 months ago and things just didn't work out. Without going into too much detail, we basically just came to the conclusion that we sucked at being boyfriend and girlfriend after 7 years of always ""working on the relationship"". We just realised that we were extremely co-dependent and created very toxic habits in the relationship, something we could not avoid while living together. So we just decided it was best to go our separate ways, remain friends and grow as individuals.

The thing is, since we both agreed on the breakup and we're not mad at eachother, and without the weight and responsability of being in a relationship we both get along fine, we are thinking of sharing the house anyway, just as roommates instead. Rents are stupid high so we can't live alone, and neither of us wants to just move in with random strangers.

So, I know there's a million reasons why this is a bad idea and why it's likely to fail. I already know them. What I'm looking for is people who are in the same situation and are happy. Tell me why, despite the odds, it can work and how you managed to make it work.

Things couldn't go better with the woman (25f) I (29m) have been seeing for the past 3 months. Our personalities match well, it's passionate and physical and moving at a really great pace.

But the thing is, she is incredibly caught up in her career.

Her boss is a huge POS and she is really unhappy and unsuccessfully trying to find something else. So, naturally, that situation has her really preoccupied.

And there is a part of me that wishes she was as preoccupied with me as she is with work.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like she isn't paying enough attention to me or that the work situation is interfering with us in a meaningful way. We see each other plenty, she never gives me the feeling I'm not important to her or anything like that. And I obviously care about her career and want her to be happy and satisfied and do my best to listen and support her as best I can. I love that she is so committed and driven. I am definitely not doing a Ross (as in Ross and Rachel) pulling stunts for her attention or gaslighting her for caring about her work.

It's just that I know that nothing has as much of a grip on her emotionally, mentally etc. as work does. It's the number 1 thing on her mind and determines her happiness or lack thereof on any given day more than anything else. And while, rationally, I know, it's a good thing that we are so solid and drama-free that she doesn't have to agonize over anything in our relationship, there is a part of me that wants to be the number one thing on her brain. She certainly is that for me.

From Monday-Wednesday we exchanged some messages. Me offering words of support, her saying my words helped a lot, us saying we love each other, and her and her family being grateful that I offered to pay for flowers for the funeral.

Since the day after the funeral I've barely heard from her.

On Thursday I sent a message of support with a picture of my cat, she was online without opening my message a couple of times and then replied after 8 hours, deep into the night. She said ""I'll listen to your voice message when I'm alone, can't wait! 😘😘♥️"" and called my picture cute.

Yesterday we didn't talk. She again was online a couple of times without opening my message and then simply emoji reacted my last message from the night before. I sent her message late last night of a song I heard yesterday that she might like, and a thinking of her message. It's now the start of the next day and I've yet to hear a thing.

I'm not sure what to do next. I don't even know if she's even home or still in her home country, and sadly I'm getting anxious in the meantime and starting to worry that our long distance relationship may be causing her stress suddenly too.

Ok so this story probably is not what you think it is. Throwaway account because I don’t want to get anyone in trouble. I’ve got a long distance boyfriend, and he and I have been dating about 3 and 1/2 years. Let’s call him nick. I’m currently 20, and he’s 27. If you do the math, you’ll see we started dating when I was 17 and he was 23. This wasn’t an issue for me because what we had seemed to be healthy and I figured I’m just mature for my age or whatever. Nick wasn’t too far ahead of me in life as far as school or career goes because he had a cocaine addiction and flunked out of school when he first started college. He had overcome that and grown a lot though and had a lot in common with me. 
Anyways, we met in a class at my local college and we ended up meeting, dating, and eventually even moving in together. For the first 2 years we had a great relationship. Then about a year ago he got into school in another state (across the county) and I wanted to finish my prerequisites at my current college. We have plans to move back in together once he gets out of school.
 
Im the type of person who tries to remind my partner every day how much I love them. I’ve sent him a love letter almost every week since he moved. He sent me one back, in the beginning, and then never again. And I’ve been willing to accept that sometimes people have different ways of showing their affection, and I’ve kept sending them because I just wanted to make him happy. 
Anyways, I have always trusted him to not cheat on me. And I’ve felt like all I’ve done to show him I love him was deserved. But recently I have been seeing a lot of red flags.
 
Nick has a lot of new friends he’s made since he’s moved, and I’ve been happy for him for the most part. The exception is this one friend of his, let’s call her Beth. What happened a little while ago was he FaceTimes me and didn’t tell me anyone was with him, and then after we hung up me texts me that beth said we were cute. Weird, but ok. Then tonight, he tells me he’s going to a rave with her. on his Snapchat story , he posts the Kandi (which are handmade bracelets with words on them) he gave her, which says I love you on it. Kinda sus if you ask me. 

Here’s the thing, I know a bracelet isn’t proof. But he’s already dropped hundreds of dollars on a plane ticket to visit me for the holidays. With no trip protection, so he is clearly committed to seeing me. When he visits, I’m going to check his phone and see if he has any messages from her. Right now I only have a hunch so I’m going to continue with the gifts and letters, business as usual. 

 If there’s actual proof, then I’m going to act like everything’s fine at first. I’m gonna get him to let me give him a bj, best one of his life. Then, right when he’s about to cum, I’m gonna point his dick up and hopefully give him a face full of his own cum. And while I do that, I’m gonna break up with him. Probably tell him his dick is small and that he looks like rumplstilskin, and kick him out of my house. He’ll have no where to go for like a week unless he pays for new tickets home. And hopefully every time he cums or gets a bj, he’ll cringe a little bit. Bonus points if I get the cum in his eyes. That shit stings.

Ex Boyfriend - Max
Girlfriend - Hazel
Child - Sarah

Ive been in a relationship with this girl for a year and its been really great. but i've noticed her roommate (that is married but is also her ex boyfriend) has been acting more than odd recently. He lives with my girlfriend and his wife. but he often hangs out a lot more with Hazel than his wife and his wife complains about it a lot. I know for a fact they aren't doing anything ""dirty"" and she has 0 feelings for him since she now sexually identifies as lesbian. the only reason they live together is because they have had a kid in the past. which he knocked her up and cheated on her after. leaving her with a kid. props to him for coming back into Sarahs life. It is hard for me to deal with them living with each other but it also forms my patience and trust with her a lot. and for some odd reason i see him and his wife as parent figures since mine unfortunately passed away in my younger years.
but tonight. things got weird.
I text Max because we are friends and i start off with a nice greeting and we start talking and yaddayadda. Since i know Hazel is in the same room as him and watching tv i ask where she is, and he ultimately responds with ""i'm deep dicking her"" which actually infuriates the living fuck out of me! and i told him off and said how about i talk about your girl like that! how would that make you feel?? then he proceeds to send a picture of her back somehow and i just.. snap.. and i never do that. then he says ""were not actually fucking. i just took a picture of her back."" ill also go ahead put in what my response was to him. it was in the moment and i feel i shouldn't have snapped that much.
""FUCK OFF, LITERALLY HOW WOULD YOU FEEL WITH MY HANDS ALL OVER YOUR FUCKING WIFE MAX?? ITS SO DISRESPECTFUL! THEN SENDING PICTURES LIKE THAT TO ME?? ITS SO FUCKING TRAUMATIZING TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT."" (he knows i have severe ptsd and some of it is from past relationships cheating on me)

Then he proceeds to call it a ""prank""
and i tell him ""no?? you don't fucking do that!""
and he says 
""Well sorry bro, it's a joke not a dick, don't take it so hard!""
Then I say
""im sorry i snapped but i just did NOT like that and i have boundaries that ive already pushed past and beyond my limits just to make everyones life easier and avoid controversy"" 

It stopped there. I proceed to text Hazel about this and shes confused and says that he took her phone and is intoxicated.
She says
""I mean yea i think it was shitty. Im not entirely sober and he’s not either. Im sorry""
I ask if shes coming over tomorrow and she says ""sure if you don't hate me""
i say ""i don't hate you i just feel like he should be a decent human fucking being and not say shit like that.""

Thats where it ended. but i just want everyones thoughts on this whole ordeal. sorry its long but it is an important situation for me to talk about. 

please be nice in the comments.

I feel like I give myself fully in relationships,  I openly communicate, although I may be too much sometimes. I do enjoy going out 1s or 2s a week and I share this before dating. They are welcome to come but most men I Dated are homebodies.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 9 months and durning this one year everything has been greats, he has been very supportive towards me and my goals.and has cared for me in every aspect of our relationship including sex with aftercare.

The other day my boyfriend told me he wanted to talk to me and said that he wants us to explore sex I asked him to elaborate because I always loved being intimate with him and didn’t really insert and he said like me giving him head (which he knows I don’t like doing), trying some fun positions ( we currently do doggy style, missionary and riding), him getting rough and then he mentioned anal and I called him disgusting and few other things, I didn’t really mean it with intent to hurt him. I just blurted it out cause i knew I couldn’t give him those things he need, so I just blurted shit out as a defense mechanism. After I said those things he left, he didn’t really say anything he just went to his friends house. When he got home I apologized for saying those words to him and he said it was fine that he forgive me. (I know a lot of people may think the sex I have is vanilla but it what I feel most comfortable doing)

But ever since that day (1 weeks later) he hasn’t been intimate with me, he is always dodging me and saying he not in the mood. Today I dressed up all sexy and he still wanted to avoid me so I asked him why he was acting like this, he feigned innocent but later said that how is he supposed to want have sex with him when I called him disgusting, I told him I was sorry and tried to explain that it was a defense mechanism and I felt like he was pressuring me into trying things that I have expressed am not into but he said I should shut up that nobody would have forced me to those things if I didn’t want to. That I he only asked for something sexual 2 times in the past 9months, all I had to say was that I was not willing and that would be it. I agree I could have taken that approach but l wasn’t thinking straight. He went to sleep in the guest room.

My (33f) husband (35m) picks his nose and eats it. I'm not sure if he really knows how much I notice he does this. It makes me sick to my stomach. It also feels like he does it more when he isn't happy with me. Or maybe I notice it more. I didn't fully realize how bad it was until after we were married. It's not just his nose either. Without going into more detail, l've noticed he is picking... everywhere.

I tried looking up the science behind it to make me feel better. It made me even more grossed out. Like somehow he was harming me but consuming this bacteria. Or like he is putting it in my mouth because I do like to be kissed every now and then.

I've tried to bring it up in the past but I didn't do it in the right way and he did not respond well. I said something like ""I don't know if it's a subconscious thing, but l've been noticing you putting your hands in your mouth a lot and it's grossing me out."" He responded that he didn't know what I was talking about. Said maybe it was this or that, like his nose had been chapped and bothering him. He got really defensive and things weren't the same for a while. He did stop for a while. More info: we’ve been together around 5 years.

I wished I never said anything. Is it as gross as I think it is? Should I say something else? How do you bring this up? Should I say I know this is happening and I see it? I love him. Obviously, I get that people are people and we all have gross habits, but this makes me feel hurt and upset like he doesn't care about what I see him doing. No, this isn't a joke. Please be kind. I think I am a real reasonable and understanding human.

I (23M) met “John/J” (21M) approximately 6 months ago.

We hang out almost every weekend exclusively (because we were both in the military). Texted quite frequently too. About 3 months in, just as I was about to confess, he ghosted. Came back two weeks later saying that he wasn’t interested and how there wasn’t any chemistry. Also mentioned how he knew I liked him but had intentionally ghosted me on the advice of his best friend (toxic friend, tbh).

I took it quite well nevertheless and settled for being friends. You are free to disagree, but quite frankly, my POV was that there was still hope, somehow. Two months pass by, and we get along quite well, although there was nothing romantic. He said that he really enjoys our companionship. Prior to meeting me, he’d just came out of a relationship. J began to text at much slower intervals. I matched that energy, playing into his games.

We’d spent our birthdays together. Mine was over the weekend; he got me meaningful gifts. His birthday we spent it overseas. While we didn’t had sex, he did mention he was turned on by how innocent and pure I am these days, with a very obvious bulge – before going on to say that there was chemistry between us. He held me very close and at times, cuddled.

I also found out that he was talking to a few other guys back home during our trip. Disappointed? Yeah, but we were not “exclusive” in that kind of way. We had a mini argument on our last day – I couldn’t afford a cab ride home, so I wanted to take the bus, but he didn’t. So I walked away. Haven't texted since... until 2 days ago, he reached out with a harmless question about how he was going through certain struggles too. I offered my support/words/shoulder.

I get it. In hindsight, you could say that I ignored many red flags and obvious signs. I’m confused, but this was the first person I genuinely had feelings for. I know I deserve better, but at the same time I really want this to work.

Do I just move on? Talk to J about what I really want, and how I can’t go on as friends any longer? Stay on and wait? Happy to answer any other questions if anyone is curious. I don’t know what to do next, and why I’m typing this, but I guess it’s my coping mechanism. Been journaling and reflecting too, as a way to process what has happened.

Never been one to look for pity, or hugs, but I guess I could use some right now.

TL;DR, I liked a guy, confessed, said no. We still hang out, he’s turned on by me, but we never do anything. He’s seeing other guys too? Do I talk to him? Wait?

I generally work everyday, from morning till late night. We split off on picking up and dropping off our oldest to daycare, wether one is driving the other is watching our newborn. So majority of the time my Gf is taking care of the kids, luckily she is on maternity leave for 4months, (think she only has a couple left) so she’s able to stay home and take care of our newborn, aswell as our oldest when she gets out of school on the weekdays. I get that they are a handful, always need attention, hard to put to sleep, tantrums, etc lol. But I do usually watch one or the other for a hr or two to lighten the stress on her and be a father in general. We go out sometimes but not too often. We’ve been to the aquarium, small theme parks, playgrounds, restaurants etc. Whenever my gf asks if I can watch them I have no problem doing so. I’m usually tired from work when I get back home and so is she from watching the kids, so nighttime gets tough. Morning isn’t much better lol but we manage to get through it. My Gf mostly does the dishes and cleaning but I do take out the trash n generally any work that requires heavy lifting around the property.
My Gf feels we don’t split childcare duty evenly. Which is true but I told her when she gets off of maternity leave I will put much more effort into splitting it as for now I am around everyday although it’s only a couple hrs to a few I do spend time with my kids, then I work and on top of having a lot of siblings and being the oldest I have to lookout for them since my and their parents arent mentally stable, so it costs a lot of money and time ontop of raising my new family it’s stressful and it’s like my Gf feels like I’m free and she’s trapped but I have plenty of responsibilities too, mainly my children and family but they are doing great bc of their wonderful mother which I’m super thankful to her for. Maybe I came off crazy and should of just agreed to figuring out a system or what days I watch them I just don’t see how it’ll work because I’m working and dealing with life as I’m trying to be there for my kids. But she insists she feels like a single parent.. do I just quit my job it’s like she’s clearly not happy and I’m sort of unhappy with this uneasy feeling like all the effort I put in goes unrecognized. Bc she states “she’s contributing 80% of the energy it takes to hold our fam together” which I don’t understand, the moment our daughter was born I made sure to work everyday striving towards a bright a future and yes I still spent everyday with her wether it being 30min to several hours. But that’s not enough, I supported my Gf of her coding adventure, actually introduced the idea, she looked into programs and I started paying for it bc I believed in her, eventually she got a good job and around the time we had a second child she went on maternity leave. When it came to appointments, anything important I was always there. Before she got the job I was the only one bringing income, and handled all the bills which I had no problem with bc I see how hard she was working towards it. She recently complained about how when she went out all day with her friend she had to warn me about it weeks prior and had to remind me the day off.. I was just so confused bc I watched them from evening till midnight and it felt she was downplaying the effort I do put in. Also I never told her she has to keep reminding me she just chooses too I didn’t get why she felt that day was such a problem. She even thanked me that night, when I brought that up she says “I didn’t kno you have to thank your partner for watching his kids” I’m just like I never ask for that she chooses to say it just like she chose to remind me so many times. But paints this narrative over it like I didn’t respect her time, it just sounds like she’s stressing because she’s holding expectations without proper communication. Bc this past couple wks she hasn’t brought this up. And it’s giving passive aggressive vibes, me personally I like to talk things out till there’s an understanding.

i then went and found her instagram he was right, they were waaaay bigger then mine and mine are bigger then average.

it’s been two years since then but ive always had insecurity issues and this made them worse, the fact they’re bigger then mine makes me feel sick.

he told me that the things he said were “jokes” because that’s all his friends would say about her back then.

anyway, i went back recently on her page and saw she was posting a lot about SPECIFICALLY her tits and it’s made me hate myself more.

that was a couple of weeks ago and today i got horny and decided to masturbate, it was taking a while until the things he said about her came into my mind and so did her photos…. and i finished.

i feel disgusting and horrible and i have no idea how to get over my insecurity issues, i’ve blocked her completely but i can’t stop crying. i wish i would just grow up and get passed on not feeling good enough for anyone even my own bf.

So my girlfriend and I had been seeing each other for almost 2 years now. She was and kind of still is my first love and properly intimate partner and vice versa. She knows me better than anyone in my life and I like to think the same is the other way. I trust her wholeheartedly and fully believe she would never cheat or anything like that, even now. So anyways, about 4 months ago, it started to feel like the spark was starting to dim. Up to this point the relationship was pretty good, with rarely any fights, but when there were, they were reoccurring problems. For example, I’m not awesome at displaying affection, especially in a public setting, and she needed more. On the other end, I work 2 jobs and study full time, so I rarely have much free time. However, I tried to maximise time I had with her, and would visit as often as I could (within reason), but it was usually never enough, and if I returned from a shift and just needed time to reset at home, she’d get grumpy and cold shoulder me.

As time went on, it didn’t feel like the fights got worse but the spark dimmed more and more. Our life goals never aligned either. For reference, I have always been encouraged to travel the world, and feel that is one of my goals I want to accomplish while I’m still young: I’m considering doing it next year. However, she is set on owning a house, and wants to save up through her younger years to buy one (for reference; I live in suburbs where house prices a skyrocketing and the most basic houses cost upward of 1.5m aud). This always played on my mind during the later end of our relationship.

Anyways, fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, when we got back from a weekend away. Both of us had felt the connection wavering, and she was trying hard to hold on, calling me all the time ect. So she FaceTimed me around 10pm and we small talked for half an hour or so. Then she asked if I loved her to which I responded yes, to which she asked if I’m in love with her, to which I said I’m not sure. She started crying and I asked if I could come over. I drove over absolutely bawling with no real idea as to what my plan was, I didn’t know what I was gonna do or say, if it was comfort her or end it. I got there and long story short decided this was it, and I didn’t want to lead her on anymore. She was shocked and cried as I left. We met up 2 days later to talk after I’d done much talking with friends and family, and I reiterated that my choice was the right one. I laid the cards on the table and drove home feeling relieved (I wish I could remember the feeling). Her one request to me was that we keep sharing location on Snapchat. I ,feeling guilty already, agreed if it would help her heal. 

Anyways,for the next week I felt good and sure of my decision. She messaged me a few times, at first angry, but then asking if there was someone else, and saying how she wouldn’t be able to move on and do anything with anyone else for months. I told her there was no one else, and I wouldn’t be able to move on for a while either. About a week later, she was drunk at a party and messaged me asking if I wanted to hook up. I declined with great effort, and she said she understood. Then she asked if I could help her with a “boy problem”. I said that probably wasn’t appropriate but it still stuck with me. Hence started my downward spiral. Over the next week I checked her location more and more, and noticed she was very often out with friends, or going on late night drives, way more than when we were together. I began to feel more icky, I assume jealousy but to be honest, I don’t have much experience with the emotion. She messaged me less, but continued to ask to hook up. On a particularly rough night, when I knew she was out with two male best friends I agreed and we said we’d do it a few days later. 

Leading up to it, she continued to go out lots, and the night before the date we scheduled, she left her house after 11 and stayed out almost all night (I know, stalkerish but we were messaging at the time so I couldn’t help but see it, location comes up under their name). At around about 2am, I can’t sleep and send her a delirious message saying how I had no right to care but it hurt. She was, to her credit, understanding, but stated it’s my fault anyways, which is obviously true. Anyways, so the day comes and she comes to my house. Just seeing her made me immediately think about how I made an enourmous mistake. Anyways, so we get to drinking and talking and she tells me the boy problem she has is both her guy friends have crushes her. One she finds gross, but she said she’d consider hooking up with the other if he didn’t have a crush on her, cause she’d be leading him on. This damn near broke me, considering we literally just did the dirty and this is pillow talk, but I kept a strong face. The rest of the night alternates from comparing me to him, and being very intimate and loving. In the morning, I asked her if, hypothetically, I asked her to get back together, what she would say. She said she’d have to think about it for a long time, which is fair. I hurt her and I’m battling with guilt and loneliness and self doubt, and I really only have myself to blame. She asked if I really wanted to, and not to ask half heartedly. I said I needed a week, no contact and location, to think. She said that’s fine, but she couldn’t allow herself to think about it unless she knew I was serious, which I get.

So now you’re caught up. I feel like shit, I don’t know if it’s jealousy or regret or what. While she was here she’d kept saying how it’s helping her to flirt and use tinder and get out there (she has a tinder army btw, the “99+ people swiped right on you”), and I realised I have no idea how to do that anymore. I just don’t know what I want anymore, everyone says she’s playing but it really seems like she’s better without me, and it hurts. I know I’m not the good guy in this story, but I always tried to be as respectful as I can. I’m not religious but I have prayed for clarity at least 10 times this week. I don’t know what to do. I still love her, but I’m so torn. I have plans to travel, but that’s not for months yet, and I keep thinking what if she’s the best there is and I don’t know it, and regret it for the rest of my life?

So my boundary is about his drinking problem. Now to add in his entire side of both of his moms and dads side of the family has drinking problems. His mom wakes up drinking vodka and goes to bed drinking vodka and is a enabler to him and his drinking. So are his friends, he uses them as an excuse constantly to buy more alcohol. He also uses stress as an excuse. 

I have repeatedly asked him that I would like him to slow down on his drinking. As not only is he killing himself but I do not want to live a life with someone who drinks to ""solve his problems"". Bc that is exactly what he does. I also do not want to have kids with someone who drinks like such so that they can learn the same habits when they're older. Yes, I have expressed this to him numerous times yet he does not stop. 

It's making me feel disrespected and like he doesn't care about our relationship anymore. Which yes I have also expressed this to him as well and still... the same thing. He always just says ""ok."" That's it. 

He has slowed down from getting plastered drunk, but I literally can't even have ""hard"" eggnog in the house without him chugging it in one night. 

He has boundaries too which he had expressed to me a couple times, It didn't exactly take the first couple times to me. This last time it did, so I'm actively working on those things. So when I know that I'm trying and his actions are showing the opposite... I'm not sure how to approach this anymore. 

To add in, my boundary with drinking became a problem when he was plastered drunk and was being an AH to me. To give an idea the first time he was, was about 3 months into our relationship and he said ""I hope you kill yourself you stupid c***."" All i was doing was putting him to bed bc obviously he needed it. I told him off what he said the next day and he said he was sorry. But continued getting plastered and coming to my house being an AH. he didn't say anything like that to me but treated me very bad. 

We live in the same house, have 2 dogs and 1 cat. If i move out I will have to go to my moms and give away my dog who picked me as their person at 8 weeks old.

So some months ago I started dating a girl that I met online, and she connects with me really well in tastes, we both like to watch a lot of movies, play videogames and overall we heavily share a geeky side I'd say, she's very supportive and she makes me feel happy overall (we've had sex sometimes and It's been great, we are very communicative on what we like and have been enjoying it more every time, so that's a big plus  


Except for 2 things, but one actually is not that relevant, its something we can work on, She's very independent and sometimes it's a struggle to help her on anything, It's like she's never been used to being in a 50/50 relationship (sort of, cause relationships are never exactly equal, but optimally its something close to that, at least for me), so she's happy to invite me for dinner or something as an example, but ITS SO HARD to get her to let me driver to her house or invite something, or pick her up (she doesn't have a car), and it really makes me happy to be able to do these things for her, but she sees it as if that would make me uncomfortable, all of this is the workable part, because we talked about it, I told her it made me feel like she was not happy with  the details I wanted to do for her, because everytime she would see it as it was a hassle for me, and it has sometimes demotivated me on doing those kind of stuff, and I'm a very romantic and attentive partner, she told me she's aware of it and that she wants to slowly be less like reactive I'd say ( I can't remember the exact word she used) and just let things flow if I wanted to do something for her and enjoy.  


The second part on the other hand is something that I just don't feel comfortable at all, I will give some context tho for this, after some time dating we kinda mentioned we were only dating each other, and so we did this kind of arrangement of being exclusive to each other dating and see how things would evolve, I didn't see any problem in it, since I'm very interested and invested in her. But then something that bugged me out started happening, she would start mentioning this guy that she met on the bus(for the purposes of giving more context, I dont live in a super big city, so the bus lines are very reduced), she met this guy that always took the same route as her which is a route that crosses basically the whole city, but they split in like half of the route. She mentioned he was cool and one or two other things, THEN this really annoying thing happened, she stayed at my home and we were basically awake all night (doing well, things ofc), we barely slept, like 1 or 2 hours at most, she told me she had a lunch appointment, and I was like, can you not move it or something? You haven't slept for hours, you are super tired ( she was mentioning a lot she felt like she just wanted to rest, it had been a very heavy week for her in terms of work, she studies and works at the same time)

So based on how tired she look, on what she was saying and that this was like a lunch with a friend or w/e I was like the person will surely understand and you can re arrange it, she says no and goes, and I'm like okay that's fine if she feels okay to go its all good, next day she told me what she did, she told me ""Oh I was meeting up with the bus guy (she calls her like that, hasn't even told me his name, not like she's obliged to do it or anything, but feels weird not ever mentioning his name), and it turns out he took me to his house where his mom prepared lunch and she's like a realllyyy good chef, she did some pasta that I enjoyed a lot, then we watched movies together and I left to my house at night\*... then she comments \*Something weird happened, his mom introduced me with some family members as his girlfriend, I talked about it with him and said she just made a mistake and I made myself clear that I wasn't interested in anything of that sort\* So when she said this I felt really bad, because after all that happens and he's bringing her home, how are u gonna go watch movies alone, feels shady to me (that's what I thought at the time), so then I told her on chat that I wanted to talk about something and I became very cold for a few days because she didn't have the time for us to meet and talk about this, we decided to talk it over a phone call, and I told her I feel very uncomfortable with this situation, I don't feel like watching movies alone with someone you know likes you (because for me aside from what happened that day, was very clear based on the way he treats her) and she just went defensive and said that he didn't like her, that he told her that was not the case, and so I explained, the fact that someone tells you something, doesn't mean that's what they truly feel, and this guy from a mile a way I can see he likes you, It doesn't make me comfortable and It kinda makes me feel sad (more context on this later) that you hangout with him alone, I don't mind you having friends and doing plans and whatnot ( because she goes out with her friends rather frequent) But ME personally, I wouldn't put myself in a 1to1 date with someone I'm aware likes me, because it's an unncesary uncomfortable for me, and for my partner (in this case someone I'm dating, but we are exclusive to each other)  
To what she replies that she doesn't know what type of friends do I have that I see that her watching movies with him and wall that was abnormal, and I told her, normal or not what I'm telling you, is it makes me sad and uncomfortable, I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just communicating to you what it makes me feel. I'm a VERY honest guy, I HATE LIES, I DO NOT LIE to my partners at least not in important stuff, context for this, if for example and ex would write me about wanting to hook up or something I wouldn't hide it, I would instantly mention it to my partner, no need to lie, deceive or hide stuff. So in that moment I had 2 choices, say yeah that's fine (which would be a lie) and pretend like nothing's happening, or tell her what I feel, I'm not giving her a order, just communicating how I feel, which she vaguely says that it's normal and that I do not need to be afraid, but still its uncomfortable to me.  


Fast forward some days, things keep happening, he's arriving at the bus with food, presents, and I felt really bad at this point, because one day she was very hungry and tired to cook, so I wanted to order something she'd like, I told her hey I need you to answer your door in a while I got you a present and she was like you don't have to, I'll not receive it cause I can just eat something and I don't want you wasting money on me, and at that time I told her, its not a waste it's just a present for you, I like to see you happy, and so as you can imagine I felt really bad because with me it was such a problem for me to gift her that but in this case, she just received those and commented me like im so happy today I ate X thing cause the bus guy invited me for dinner, and I'm like ah okay cool( which is not but I don't want to say it written, technically I lied there but I intend to talk this next time we meet and tell her exactly how I feel, so It wasn't about lying it was more about waiting to discuss this face to face.  
Fast forward a bit someone try to assault her going to her university (My city is very insecure), so ofc she was very afraid, I was there for her and went to see her and give her hugs, kisses, support to make her feel accompanied, the next day she tells me, oh hey the bus guy is gonna go with me in the bus till my house until I finish this semester (like 1-2 weeks more) because I was traumatized for what happened, and so he's such a cool guy. And well I don't need to explain what I felt or thought, then sometimes she's telling me his mom is sending food for her, and yesterday she went out for dinner with him, on this, I really felt shitty because we haven't been able to see each other for 2 weeks, because she was very busy on work/study, but I asked her several times do you have at least 10 minutes, I could go to your house , or pick you up from work or something, I would love to at least see you for some minutes It would make me really happy, and she's like no baby its impossible I have too many things to do, but then in those same 2 weeks, she goes out with the guy and all of this happens, so I feel even shittier.  


I'll give context to some stuff to summarize and end up with this to finally ask for advice  
I used to be a patient with a heavy case of deppression and anxiety, no longer on antidepressants and my life has been going smoothly, biggest cause of my depression is that I didn't feel enough for anything, for study, for work, and the most of all I didn't feel like a beatiful person, I worked on that for some many years and I got a really big confidence on myself and I consider myself attractive, a good partner, I'm studying, working, doing my hardest at everything I can and everything is going cool BUT, my past relationship had a similar situation and I got cheated, so confident as I am, It scarred me a little bit so I don't feel as secure on that part, that's mostly what bugs me.  


And the other context is that the girl, she's very mature on her mindset so I struggle a lot finding out wether she's aware that he likes her or if she is naive enough to not see it ( or maybe I'm just wrong and dumb) But she's not naive, not from what I've seen, so that lets me with 2 other options, she's either ignoring the fact that he likes her cause she's not gonna pay attention to him romantically anyways, or she's lying to me and she's actually doing something with the guy  


I'll list the things I think I could do, I would love if someone could give me advice based on the decisions I'm considering or If you feel I should do something completely different, be my guest, but do explain why please :3 I would really appreciate it  


1. Tell her what I feel but I don't wanna sound controller, I don't want to control her relationships, I just feel like if this is something that she feels is okay, maybe this is not the right place for both of us.
2. Ask her to be my girlfriend already and see how the situation plays out, if the guy just stops doing all that because she's in an official relationship now, but I do not like just experimenting with serious stuff as a relationship is, so  Heavily dislike this choice, but I do want her to be my girlfriend tho
3. Act like nothing is happening and just see how much more of the situation keeps going to make a decision, but this is painful and sad for me, it feels like a very sad situation I've had all over again.
4. Maybe I'm wrong in this whole situation so just accept that and start working on the insecurity that my previous relation scarred me into (this is something I'll do aside of whatever I choose to do) but it's just that my heart and brain tell me there's is something wrong in all of this situation and then ask her to be my girlfriend.

But you see for option 4 there's a huge huge problem, that relationships for me, base on trust, and its been really really hard to trust her on this particular situation, I've had been trusting on her blindly on every other thing becuase, everything she has been very communicative to me, so I felt like, okay if there's something wrong or going on, she's telling me and we can talk about it, so I felt happy, until all of this happened that just triggered this that I can't trust her.

- Nat: my sister (22)
- Me, myself and I: (M25)
- Maria: my ex of 3 years (F26)

**The necessary backstory**:
Me and my ex broke up in July 2021. It was not amicable. I'm seeing a psychologist because of her. 
- She used to give very backhanded compliments to tear me down (for those unfortunate souls who read a book by a pick-up-artist think: *negging*). She broke what little confidence I had before we started dating down until it was in the negatives. I suffer from depression and an inferiority complex. 
- She fattened me up. For those thinking *everyone gains weight when they're in a happy relationship*, that's not it. She manipulated me into eating more, quitting karate and would be ""upset"" if I didn't eat all the food she made. What really proved it to me was when we visited my mom and I was helping my stepdad in the kitchen. I hear this conversation:
Mom: *hey, I noticed Thunder has gained a lot of weight since you moved in together.*
Maria: *good. If he's fat I'm sure he won't cheat.*

These things combined changed me and turned me into someone I've never been and never wanted to be. I cheated on my ex and she found out. I despise myself for cheating. I had never done that before and will never do that again. I'm not trying to make excuses for cheating. It was a dick-move on my part and fully own up to that. 

After Maria and I moved in together, Nat and I didn't see eachother as much as before but we still talked a lot and saw eachother at least once every 2 months. This deteriorated over time to seeing eachother 3-4 times per year (aside from the holidays). 

**the main issue**:
After Maria found out about me cheating on her she kicked me out and I went to live with my best friend. A few weeks after the break up, I found out Nat was still talking to Maria. I didn't really care, they bonded over the 3 years Maria and I were together and Nat is old enough to choose her own friends. 

When Nat invited me to her birthday I was completely on-board and told her I was definitely in for a party. It had been too long since we last did something fun together. A week or 2 before her party Nat calls me and informs me that Maria will also be coming. I just replied: *thanks for letting me know in advance. I need to think about this.* In the end, I decided it was best for me and the overall atmosphere of the party if I didn't go and informed Nat about this. She told me she would've liked it if I came but understands. 

This has happened every time Nat organises something. I'm not ready to face Maria. I'm still scared of getting in a relationship¹! I still have issues with my body! My psychologist tells me it's okay to feel this way and it's okay that I don't want to face her. 

Every time Nat invites me and I tell her I won't be there because of Maria, hurts both me and my sister. Both our work schedules are really full so meeting eachother is really hard aside from events that are planned way beforehand. We're down to once a year (again, aside from holidays) and I also notice myself not telling certain things to my sister in fear she'll tell Maria. 

What can I do to prevent total estrangement with my little sister, being as busy as we are and not wanting to face someone who hurt me as much as she did? Should I just face Maria and go to one of my sisters events? I'm really scared of losing her.

I know this was a long post and quite all over the place. So thanks for suffering through.

We both love video games especially Pokémon, which some of you know is a big game.The game released yesterday(November 18).

My partner and I had planned to play this together on release, though it wasn’t until November 16 he brought it up with me, asking if I wanted to stay over November 17/18 so we could both play the game as it unlocked on midnight. I said no because I had already preordered the physical copy (I’ve had financial issues so buying physical I can save money). I also told him that because of work I’d be tired. I’m a baker and am awake 3/4am most days for work. We were also talking about his ex at this time and he made a comment along the lines of “maybe my ex will play Pokémon with me”. I thought this was a joke so laughed it off, 30 minutes later he said sorry for being rude. And said he also understands me being tired with work. I said I would be picking up the game at 8am, and would be over at his around 9 so we can play together, he said that was good.

The next day, the day before release, he texts me in the evening “do you want to FaceTime at midnight when it unlocks so we can experience it together?” And I said no because I’m tired and he just said “umm rude. I wasn’t asking” I said “do you actually want to? How long for?” he said “yes. Dw. I’ll play alone”

I told him I felt bad, and said being a ne generation, I want to experience it for myself with my own play, not by watching someone else, as it feels more special. But I also said I understand his side to it and don’t want to dismiss him and that it would be amazing to experience it together.

I was willing to compromise, but he get in these moods when he gets upset that he just ignores me. He sent me a video at midnight of the game unlocking, and he seemed happy.

I woke up the next morning and got the game, messaged him but no reply. I did consider going over but I always feel rude going over unannounced/without permission so I just went home, I was fairly confident he was mad at me so I messaged him, and he finally responded at 1pm

“Of course I’m mad at you wtf You knew how excited I was, and you didn’t even want to have a phone call when it drops Mary arrived from Perth yesterday exhausted from her flight but stayed up just to be there for the experience The game is so good like I wish I could play multiplayer with you but like I don’t even want to speak to you right now”

I just said “Ok well I was going to say I can come over today and we can play together but if you want to be alone that’s ok I’m sorry I stuffed up and was selfishly thinking about myself and not your feelings”

And he just like reacted the message. I sent him a good night and good morning text which he ignored and told him to enjoy today since it’s his best friends birthday. No response.

**""13-14 year old girls already f*ck and lose virginity! Many really start it early. Many 13-14 year olds are not virgin anymore!**

**""My friend slept with a girl and she turned out to be 13. He was really shocked he didn't know cus she looked just like you do. And the worst thing she was not even a virgin! At 13!!""**

Yeah after saying repeatedly I look 14 lol🙁 also, I suspect it was not even his friend I didn't even know a name of but himself.... He denied it though. 

And, after I confronted him on his 'you see a hot girl and she is 13 comment' year after (yes I was too scared of him to confront him back then), he replied with:

**""But did you see how 13 year old girls look? They use lots of make up and they look 25 that's why I was confused cus they looked 25""**

Yeah, sure I believe you found them hot because they looked 25 🤣 you would find them more hot if they looked 12-14 than if they looked 25 amirite.

**""I like your jacket more than your parka. In your parka you look 18-19, while in your jacket you look 14""**

**""I legit thought you were 14 when I first saw you. I was even scared you'd be one of those girls who sleep with men on purpose to jail them that's why I asked you if you turned 18 already""**

**""Baby don't do manicure and long nails. I like your bare hands. With manicure, just don't be offended please, your hands look 25-30, while your bare hands look so childish, they look 14. Just don't be offended that I said your hands look 25-30, I simply mean I like it more without manicure""**

**""Did you have same breast size at 14?... Was your friend also 14? Yes? Then I'm sure she lost her virginity at 15""** - after I said how weirded out I was when I was 14 and had some girls overnight one of them started touching my boobs and kissing me. I regretted I told him about it right after. 

**""Wait, periods in girls start at 13? Then why having sex is only legal at 18, why it's not 14,15,16?""** - I regretted I told him periods start at 13 right after.

If you are curious, he denied all the claims and said to not lump him in with p3dos and that he never even thought about 12-14 girls like that. After I told him I'm sure he would date a girl that age had it been legal, he said 'but have you ever saw me looking at one of them', and tbh I think I have.. might be my paranoia.. I'm also scared to tell him I have two nieces who are 13 soon to be 14. Because I didn't want to again see that creepy glow in his eyes. Again that glow might be just paranoia after all these things. All his words also made me nauseous whenever he said 'girls', I told him to say 'women' unless a given female person is under like 20. There is just something disgusting about a 30 year old grown ass male who looks even older to say 'girls' especially after all these words. 

Now, if you read that far, whаt's yоur opiniоn of this guy and his words? Is it nоrmal or slightly p3dophilic? I didn't alter even slightly his words by the way, just translated from russian.

We met a month ago on a 10-day exchange program and got really close as friends. We're from the same country but opposite ends, so we decided to meet up in the capital.

We met up Thursday morning, after we both had several hour trips. I asked her beforehand if it was okay to leave on Saturday and she was cool with it.

We've had a lot of fun since, and she asked me to leave on Sunday, but I told her I had purchased the tickets.

She wanted proof, so I texted my cousin (whom I asked to buy the tickets several days ago) and he said ""I forgot to buy them I'll buy them now"" and 5 minutes later he said ""I bought them"" and sent them over. At that point we were out so I didn't see the first message to stop him.

She got really upset with me, because now she will have to spend ~24 hours without company here, and she's here to see her friends but I'm leaving. I get where she's coming from, but genuinely feel that her reaction is unfair towards me, as I had no control over this at that point. 

She also blocked me on Instagram.

If she was cooperative instead of blaming everything on me, we could've found out immediately that I can change my ticket, but rather we got busy with her attacking me and me defending myself.

We went to sleep and I found out I can change my ticket and texted her but she said ""Leave me alone don't talk"".

To be fair, she was a little bit drunk last night, so I don't know how much that is to blame, but the point is that now I don't know what to do. Do I wait for her to wake up and tell her that even though I get where she's coming from her reaction was too much, but that being said I can change my ticket now if we want to be cool and forget about it or what?

I will keep my story brief not to waste time. I was 16, she was 15. It was both of ours first relationship. We dated for a few months, but I threw it away because of my pride of dating a “dream girl”, when she didn’t live up to this expectation. Fast forward, 6 months later, she never really moved on. My friend said she really likes me, maybe it’s worth a shot. 
We dated for 2 years. In the first year, I was still an asshole at times, by not being all in for her with my actions, she was obsessed with me. We spent a lot of time at my home during quarantine. But then, in the second year, it changed. As we dated for a year, I started to feel safe and happy around her, even if she wasn’t this previous idea of a “perfect” standard girl, based on my teenage idea. 
However, she slowly started to shift. I had incidents where she’d dance very closely and text one guy the next day at my birthday party, or someone was clearly grabbing her ass while dancing with her but she kept dancing since he “stopped”. I forgave he. She wouldn’t try to change for me as much as she did before, but I didn’t care, I liked her the way she is. In winter, she told me she doesn’t know what will happen during university, and that she feels like she will miss out on being single in college, not even being able to talk to any other guy. She’d sometimes tell me how after knowing she got me (her perfect crush),it doesn’t feel as exciting, or that she wishes we met later in life so we wouldn’t have this thing of “never have experienced anything else”. 
Now, we broke up. She first broke up when I could tell she wasn’t planning long distance and I was getting too needy while she became more focused on herself. She said the spark wasn’t there anymore, and she wasn’t sure already but she came back a day later. Told me she thought we would end it by the end of summer, which was shocking to me, I had no knowledge of this all along. She left we broke up again. Weeks later when I visited, she told me she kissed two other guys at a club and had tinder ( I found out by accident). She also followed some thirst trap celebrity on Instagram. I still was desperate and spent time with her, had sex, cuddled. She visited my country once again and this time I was cautious but still opened up and we kissed. 
Fast forward a month of no contact at all, she texted me she’s very sorry for how she treated me. We opened up, I can see she still misses me and we both admit we feel safe and so good talking to each other. But her head is confusing and she doesn’t know what she wants in life. I don’t know if I could forgive her for all of this anyway, and I don’t know what amount of work she would have to do to get my trust back ever again. I tried to seek revenge by working on myself, I tried to say how this person doesn’t deserve me so why am I bothered. Sometimes it helped with my severe depression, but still,3 months post breakup I can’t sleep or be happy most of the day. Only now talking to her makes me feel so safe again. I’m also very jealous of her life abroad. 
My only questions are, what the hell do I do about any of this? And do I still keep in touch with her at all? I’m losing my mind and even though she wasn’t perfect in many things for me, she was perfect to me, I can’t imagine her being that version for someone else or it hurts me seeing her so good but without me there.

After so many times of me being upset over things I’ve chose to ask what I should do here. 

Struggling through difficult times, depression on both sides I feel like nothing is gonna change. 
For the most part it’s basic and I am fed up. 
Feeling very worried for the future because if it’s not good now how can someone just magically change? 

I get that this is one side of the story however positive advice and real support would be appreciated. 

I’me currently pregnant more than half way now, struggling to move around and be active, we have had no notice for a new house as yet. Don’t think Could we really afford it!!!

Now i don’t wanna just bitch and moan but I’ll get to the point. 

My issues are in my opinion basic requirements that are simple to share making my struggle a little less. 

No real consistency in contribution to- General housework, dishes, cooking, scraping of plates. 
Bills, shared pets, pets food, bedding/bill. feeding, clothes washing, drying. 
&amp; more. 

It will be easier to say the contributions are one off,  wash up pots never to an empty sink. 
Once in a while feeds the dog and rabbits. Does half a job. 
Sometimes gets some food in but never a big shop, sometimes walks my children school if asked. 

Can be fantastic with my children they have a good relationship however it’s not enough, our relationship is minimal, we don’t sleep in the same bed because of snoring , he sleeps in the day most of it taking up the whole front room all day or bedroom sometimes, plays PS4 all night and eats sleeps and that’s it it feels like. 

Safe to say he has woken me up a great number of times. I am aware he is struggling however I am also I feel he doesn’t care even towards me just the fact he doesn’t help me , doesn’t pick up where I fall or towards things because I think he sees it as not his responsibility. 
Anything I get help with I have to ask. It’s never just done. 

As a mother I can’t be poorly long, even poorly I try my best to do what my kids need because my work doesn’t stop for them they need me.

I was alone and admittedly scared of such a massive change, and she was the only person I'd met who was kind to me. We hit it off real well and became the best of friends after only a few hangouts.

Fast forward about four years, and my foolish self wound up catching feelings. Even more foolishly I professed them to her, in which she responded with similar feelings. We started dating and things went swimmingly, I was on cloud nine. Six months later, out of the blue she tells me things don't feel right and that we should be by ourselves for a bit, and maybe try later. 

Three days after that she was in a new relationship with someone shed only met a week before, I only know because we had all been hanging out together.

I was terribly hurt, and admittedly reacted much more than I should have. I refrained from insulting either of them, instead doing my best to cut contact to give me time to heal.

Jump to present day; her and I have been in contact for about a year and a half, exchanging a couple messages every 2 or 3 months. Nothing which would leave me to believe theres still a chance for us. But I cant seem to let her go. I'm worried I may feel entitled to something because of how long we were so close for, with that sentiment also keeping me from cutting her out of my life as we've both been there to help the other out of darkness several times. It feels as if the bar for any potential partner has been set so high that i cant even reach it to lower it down.

We have had ups and downs, but overall I genuinely believe we have a “healthier” relationship. 

I met my boyfriend, we will call him Drew, when I was 18 and he was 24. Right off the bat he made it clear to me that he is diagnosed with  borderline personality disorder, and I saw no issue with it. To me, he was worth it, and no mental illness could prove otherwise. 

We took our time before we dated. In fact, we got to know each other for 9 months before making it official, and things were perfect. Until I felt the need to bring up a concern. 

We do not fight. We’ve agreed to talk things out and find a solution, so when one of us has a concern, we bring it up in a calm manner and we talk about it. but here’s the thing. I do not get the solution, he does. 

I don’t have a lot of GIANT things to talk to him about, but i do have things that are important to me, big and small. even if they’re small to another person, i am most definitely in touch with my emotions, and it hurts me when people know what bothers me and repeat their actions anyways. I guess I just have expectations for the ones around me. 

When Drew brings up a concern to me, I am held to the expectation to listen and understand. makes sense right? all ears and all love. And i’m more than happy to do the absolute most for Drew to feel amazing, happy and comfortable. I do the most with these things. If he’s depressed I will always dedicate my day to him and making him feel better. cleaning the entire house, making the bed, tucking him in and ensuring he’s comfortable, turning on his favorite show and spraying his favorite smell, etc. everything, and i’m so happy to do it. 

But how come when I have a concern, he just cries and makes me feel so bad for his guilt (unintentionally, i think?)? I mean seriously. “Drew, you did this and it hurt me, and I would like to talk about it.” followed by him being excruciatingly sorry. he is so sorry, he cries every time. leaving me feeling extremely guilty for even considering bringing it up. 

When he says things along the lines  “are you going to break up with me?” and “i hate that i make you feel this way, it hurts me” it makes me feel so horrible. it makes me feel like i ruined his day, and sometimes it even makes me feel like i am not allowed to be concerned as it hurts him so badly. I always end up having to sway the conversation to “i’m sorry.” and comforting him for me being hurt by him. 

Another day I decided to bring up to drew another issue, which resulted in me getting frustrated by his guilt. I said something along the lines of “I feel like I can never have a concern. you always tell me it hurts you and i’m forced to comfort you and make you feel better when i’m the one who was hurt in the first place. you are hurt because i told you you hurt me and i’m taking care of you. does this make sense? i’m forgetting about all of the things that have hurt me in the past to comfort you” and he followed with tears explaining that he will try to do better. 

There was and still is nothing but repetition and I literally am tired of rebringing this up. This is not a squashed relationship. it’s full of love. 

BUT WHAT DO I DO? I hate to be a dick, but he’s 27. i’m a 21 year old woman. I want to be heard when my concerns arise, not ignored and forced to hug and comfort the one who hurt me. 

please help me. any advice please.

We have similar humor, and interests and are willing to explore them. Everyone is an introvert, although I do nearly all the initiating of random topics and facts, which I don't mind. Over the past 2 years, we have gotten to know each other well and there are rarely issues. 

However, when it comes to emotional responses, it is very stoic. Today, I tested positive for COVID-19 and likely got it from my roommate who had it earlier this month. We live in a shared room. She told me ""while both of us are in the room, we should wear masks."" I 100% agree. Except she told me this the moment \*I\* had told her about my positive test result. She's never worn a mask when she had covid and I went away for the majority of the time. It is hard to believe she just found out about this 2 weeks later, conveniently tells me now when I said I have covid, she does not. This little thing just piled up with the others: nearly never taking out the garbage except when I tell her, restocking the supplies, telling her to quiet down her late evening calls each time (even when I mentioned to her to be mindful during exam week). All this made me feel sad, finally understanding that she did not care how her actions affected me. This I will communicate to her very soon, even if it will be awkward. 

When I texted my college friends this, one of them said ""It's not that big of a deal"" and the other, nothing. I continued to elaborate on the details in two sentences, which was met with nothing. ""I'm assuming you don't care, so I won't bring it up again."" They send, 'You can vent, it sucks.' And that was the end of it. 

It baffles me that IRL, they're better at communicating their actual feelings and thoughts unfiltered. But when it comes to texting, it falls flat. I  wish there was more of an empathetic response than silence or ""it sucks."" I don't expect them to be my therapist, but I make it clear that I care about them. I wish they showed they do too (not just say), online especially. Otherwise, I don't see this friendship lasting past college when we live on opposite sides of the country. I'm aware friendships don't need to have the heart to heart moments, when it occasionally happens to me, I want to rely on them to feel a little better. I don't want to sever a good thing and I don't know how to make them understand about expressing emotions; a thoughtful reply doesn't have to ""add anything"".

The problem is, I don’t know what to do? Give up or keep trying.  I want to give  backstory on how we ended up here.

A while ago I met a Alice (20f), we went on one date and hardly spoke to each other. Soon after meeting Alice, I met Alex who I crushed on for about 6 months and started dating him for 7. Our relationship was balanced, I was the comforter and Alex was the one who needed emotional help. I didn’t mind this as Alex was someone I genuinely cared about and wanted to take care of. I found out later on that Alice was Alex’s adoptive sister and we started to all hang out. Alice was very good willed towards me, and had a boyfriend at the time. Soon, She broke up with said boyfriend and started dating her current girlfriend.

And during that time, Alice started to grow suspicious of me. She said I was stalking her which I never done. She even tried to convince Alex that I was. Form things that are very coincidental. And I provided edvience for. She still didn’t believe and continued to rant to Alex about it. 

Me and Alex had a fight about the situation where he went to his sister’s to cool down. I invited my friend and we started discussing what I should say when apologizing. I admit this was my fault. I gotten a text from Alice asking “Did you and Alex break up?” And Alex messaging me my name, which he only used when he was upset or being serious with me. I immediately panicked, as this was my first relationship and wasn’t sure what to do. I asked my friend what I should do if Alex was about to break up with me. He encouraged me to the first one to end it. I agreed since he had more relationship experience than me.

My message state “I think it’s best you move out to not make this break up awkward.” We we’re living together as we were friends/roommates before dating. I want to emphasize that he wasn’t going to be homeless if I kicked him out. His sister owns a 3 bedroom condo that he already had a room in. And he never has the much things or any valuables. I followed the text with “I’ll pack your things in a box at the front door, please leave the keys on the table.” He came home with his sister, took his things and left the keys.

The entire time I was crying upstairs as I watched them leave from the window. My friend assured me that it was for the better,while I was regretting my choice. 

After the breakup, I became closer with Alice. We regained a more friendly relationship as she apologized for ruining mine. Which I accepted. I wanted to move so I went to the college library I asked out this boy who seemed familiar. Note, I dyed my hair and gave him my real name that people hardly use. I wasn’t sure where I recognized him from. It turned out he was Alex’s friend.

I wanted to get back with Alex and formally apologize for what I did. I asked him to meet up somewhere semi public where I tried to apologize but I admit I was emotional. And he slashed out me , slapping me and asking what I really wanted. Mentioning I was already moving on by asking out his friend. Earlier that day Alice broke up with her girlfriend over text due to her never texting or being in our country. We ended up cuddling each other in her bed with romantic intention?(later on she admitted it was romantic.). After that, she got back with her girlfriend.

Recently, I bumped into Alex and formally apologized to Alex. I already had something in mind if I ever saw him again. (We live in an somewhat small city and he ended up crying in my arms. I held him until he had ran out of tears. Eventually I wanted to go to his place and make something to eat. He said his sister wouldn’t like that and she didn’t like me. Which I was confused about as I was on good terms with Alice despite the awkward cuddle ‘session’. We still hung out as friends and moved past it.

I was upset and wanted to prove she wasn’t a good sister. (I was petty and spiteful) I had keys to her place, hid Alex in another room with thin walls. I talked about what happened and left. Alex and me didn’t talk for a while and I went to check up on him. so I texted him every day to see how he was feeling. Eventually he slashed out at me again saying he was mad at me, not his sister and how she only did that because she needed a friend. And he said he was tired of people saying sorry to him. His friends tell me he never stopped having feelings for me even when he’s incredibly mad at me. I don’t know what to do.

I (F23) met my boyfriend (M21) when I was living and working abroad, in a country that is currently invading another country. We dated for four months, things were generally going well and then war began. My boyfriend previously earned a living making stuff which he sold to an American audience, but sanctions meant this business wasn’t viable anymore. Because of his ruined business and his age and military status we decided to move to another country and live there for a while. I found out two weeks into this trip that he had been flirting with and receiving inappropriate pictures from ‘just a friend’ for the duration of our relationship. Now I didn’t know when we moved to this new country that he had pretty much no money left, so was 100% reliant on me. I didn’t want to abandon him in a foreign country so we patched things up and got back on track. He also did own up to what he did and stopped speaking to this person of his own initiative.

Anyway we returned to his country after a month, because our financial situation just wasn’t stable enough and he couldn’t find a job. We started living together, things were generally good, we rarely argued and if we did we would make up quickly. I should note that he is not a very emotional person, and I, by comparison really enjoy talking about and understanding my emotions. He is very good at forgiving and forgetting which I find much harder if I haven’t talked it through first. Although it used to bother me a little, I have accepted that he is that way and I try to consciously value the emotions and love that he does show. I have no doubts that he does love me in the best way he can and he is an affectionate partner, just not verbally.

However, I started to have some health problems in this time, the stress of the previous few months, both in terms of geopolitical events, being the sole financial provider plus emotional betrayal meant that I lost a lot of weight and I began to struggle mentally. However, I tried to work on that through going to a doctor, getting out of the house and my partner was generally supportive when I was struggling with my emotions. I was still the main financial provider for the two of us although my boyfriend was going to work, but earning very little. 
Apart from my health issues and financial worries, everything else was good. 

Then mobilisation begins and my boyfriend decides to leave again, with the eventual goal of us doing the necessary paperwork and going to my home country together. We decide that I should also join him since my job is remote and then we could stay together. 
Whilst I was tying up lose ends before joining him, I discovered that he had watched an old sex-tape of him with a past girlfriend. Whilst I know some people would be fine about this, for me this reopened a lot of old wounds about his previous infidelity and feelings that I wasn’t good enough for him/attractive enough for him. I confronted him about it by phone and after pushing him to come clean, I proposed breaking up (not my best move, but I already forgave him for that sort of thing with basically no resistance once before and I wanted him to understand that this was a serious problem for me). The first call he shouted at me, called me an idiot and gave me 24 hours to ‘think about this decision’. He then rang me back about 20 minutes later, after speaking to his best friend (who is happily married), almost crying and apologised for calling me an idiot, told me how much he loved me and explained in full the context and details surrounding both this incident and the first infidelity incident, which I’d never managed to get him to explain to me. (I really value honesty so I did appreciate this a lot) He promised to be more open with me in the future and I gave him a list of things I consider to be unacceptable in a relationship (relating to other women) that he needed to think about and decide if he was willing to compromise on or not. He agreed, things were resolved.

However since we have arrived in this new country, I have had a lot of doubts about relationship. I feel increasingly insecure about my image and his attraction to me, reading into things that in reality don’t mean anything. He has become snappy towards me, and if I react emotionally to these comments, he gets angry and says I’m getting upset over nothing. I have tried to explain to him that I feel like I’m not allowed to have emotions because of how he dismisses them, telling me I’m talking nonsense and making a problem out of nothing because I enjoy it. I know he feels responsible when I get upset, although I try to emphasise that it isn’t him that has made me upset, it’s broader feelings of insecurity that are making me extra sensitive, but as a not very emotional person this weighs very heavily on him, and he understandably finds it overwhelming. These frequent arguments about my emotions are definitely affecting our connection but I’m not sure what to do. 

Some extra important details are that in this new country, he again has very little money whilst I am earning a decent wage. We live in a one room apartment so spend a lot of time together. However, he has very close friends who live here who he hangs out with but I have none. I should also say that so far I haven’t made a huge effort to make friends and meet people, so I do depend on him for social interaction probably more than I should. I am someone who has always had a close circle of friends and I wonder if perhaps being without this support network is destabilising me mentally and therefore causing the problems in the relationship. Finally, he doesn’t speak English and all our conversations take place in his language. 

I love my boyfriend and I believe that he feels the same about me, and we lived together very harmoniously in his country. I really want to make things better in our relationship, but I would like an outsider opinion on if the problem is actually resolvable.

He is 23m &amp; I am 22f. I love him. We have three animals together. I never want children, so these genuinely are my kids to me. These are commitments. We’re under agreement that if we spilt, the two cats are his and the dog is mine (the cats are rescues who are bonded and one of them would be broken without her dad. The dog was a gift from my parents and she is attached to me). We’ve been together for just over two years. I moved in with him about 7 or 8 months in because I was in a VERY toxic environment with my family.

Now to the issues. When I moved in with him I realized his relationship with a friend, M, was disrespectful to me. I tried to be her friend. I met her in person and tried to talk to her but she just refused to get to know me. Then after I added her on socials to try and be friends. She only added me back if my bf said anything about it (when I added her on snap he actually lied to me at first by saying he didn’t ask her to add me back when he did). She would message him in the middle of the night (albeit innocent things like snap streaks) but randomly it would be pics that seemed flirty to me, like kissing faces. Long story short, after everything was said and done, a mutual friend told us that M reached out and told the friend that she didn’t respect our relationship and that she didn’t like me (no reason was given). My bf blocked her on everything, but insisted that he didn’t realized what was happening delisted me telling him. Now, I don’t feel comfortable with him having female friends besides the ones I already trusted. If they try and pull anything, he clearly will not know. 

Second, his porn addiction. He told me he watched porn when we started dating. I was fine with it. But then I started letting him save my pics and vids. I told him I wanted him to stop watching pornography. He said he did. I found Reddit posts and accounts he followed. He said it was from before me, and I believed him. Then I found more posts so I told him I wasn’t comfortable with ANY porn. I was giving him so many pics and videos. Plus our sex life was nowhere near what I wanted it to be (he became fine with 2 times a week. I still want every other day, minimum). It felt like he preferred porn over me. So he promised again. Then I found photos that were screenshot from insta of bikini pics. I confronted him and he deleted instagram. Then I found more porn. This time he admitted a porn addiction. He said he realized how much it hurt me and he wasn’t willing to hurt me again, so he’d quit.

We tried couples counseling, but were denied from his school. We cannot afford anything else. He has not found individual counseling. I have checked his phone and computer but have found nothing suggesting he’s broken his promise. However, if he’s in the bathroom for too long or in the house without me, I feel like he’s watching porn. Plus I can’t even trust to be friends with other woman. 

I genuinely love him. He is smart, funny, and a perfect father to our pets. Maybe my requests are unreasonable. Or maybe I’m stupid and need to leave. But if I do I have to move back across the country. It’s so much work. I guess, should I leave? Some days I really want to, other days I love him.

I (20f) met my boyfriend (21m) about a month ago. I don’t have a lot of relationship experience. I had one boyfriend in high school, who was 2 years older and told me he loved me on the 1st date — it didn’t work out that well. That’s about it. I’ve done a few dating app dates but gotten ghosted almost every time. I honestly tried not to put too much effort into dating because I felt like it was too easy for me to fall into the trap of wanting a relationship just for the sake of having one, especially since I’ve struggled with my self esteem. So I mostly thought, when the right person comes, they come.

And I met my bf, who is, or at least should be, the right person. We have really similar interests, we are both autistic so i feel like he understands a lot of the stuff I sometimes struggle with socially, he’s kind, and I’m attracted to him. 

But I’m struggling somehow. We’ve only done anything sexual twice (both of which were good experiences, in fact one was the first time I’ve ever orgasmed with a partner) and I just don’t want to about 95% of the time. A lot of the time maybe (50-75%) I don’t want to be touched or kissed and both seem so gross to me, and I almost feel MAD/irritated when he touches me. I feel like such a shitty partner for being like.. repulsed by romance and sex so much of the time. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I feel broken and like I’m being so horrible because he deserves someone who can give him these things. 

It’s normal for me to not be touchy, I pretty rarely hug my family for instance, and I’ve been like that since I was a kid, but I feel like I shouldn’t be like that with my partner. In fact when he kissed me goodbye a few hours ago I felt so repulsed I keep thinking about it now and cringing. He likes to kiss my hand and my immediate response is to want to fucking wipe it off because it feels so wrong and gross. I hate that so much of the time even completely normal nonsexual touch is something I’m just putting up with and trying not to lose it. And making excuses not to have him over because I’m afraid he’ll want to have sex and I just don’t want to. And yet I like him, I might even love him!! What the fuck is wrong with me. I feel so fucking miserable right now. He’s young and I’m sure he’d want to have sex and here I am feeling like there’s nothing I’d want less, unless maybe the exact right moment hits. He hasn’t said anything like this but I feel like I must not be meeting his needs as a partner. Am I not ready for this? Is this something that I could overcome or am I just stuck this way forever? idk what to do.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7587236,public,self,I’m usually repulsed by any intimacy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yz61w0/im_usually_repulsed_by_any_intimacy/,all_ads,6,,,,
