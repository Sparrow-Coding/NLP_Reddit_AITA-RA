This happened yesterday so it is still very new and I am stressing out so bad. 

Yesterday my boyfriend(20m) and I (20f) got into a argument that ended with 3 holes in my wall, glass broken on the floor, he put bruises on my chest and arms and scratches on my body. We’ve been together for 8 months. He was tearing up pictures of us and throwing them in my face and choked me 2 times. By the time he left I was so upset I ended up calling my sister and she told me I needed to call the police and make a report for domestic violence. Now I am really regretting it because of the severity. They took pictures of the damage and the marks on my body. My initial thought was to just clean all the mess up and not tell anyone because it was embarrassing. Cops told me that they put a restraining order on him that ends Friday. I’m not pressing charges but the cops most likely will. I am not all beat up but there are definitely marks on my body. He has never done this to me before. He was messaging me nasty things in the Xbox app and we eventually ended up settling things and said we still want to be together but the cops are already called. 

I am stressing out so bad I don’t want them to arrest him, I didn’t know the severity of this and didn’t know that even if I don’t want to press charges that they still will. I feel sick to my stomach and am in contact with him and he knows this is serious. I told him the cops know he was hitting me and saw what he did. 

Now I feel like it’s my fault and am afraid they will arrest him. Not sure what to do or how to make things less server for him

I often find myself lonely and depressed, especially on the weekends. Everyone goes out on the weekend but I stay inside seeing everyone have fun on social media. It hits especially hard during the holidays and my birthday. 

I don’t have an issue making small talk whatsoever. I don’t usually approach people, but I can hold a good conversation. My issue is extending the interactions. For example, I had a coworker I would talk to at work and we got along really well. I asked for her Snapchat and she even suggested going out sometime. We talked about personal things and were on a joking basis. 

Then I never messaged her because I was afraid of being pushy or weird. I get anxious that people don’t actually like me and are just being nice. 

Basically my entire contact list is people I’ve gotten along with but was too afraid to reach out to. 

How do I gain the confidence to stop assuming I’m annoying or pushy? 

I go to college and I’m afraid to talk to people in my classes. I also work alone so I can’t make friends at work. Where else can I make friends?

Me and my closest friend realised that d rag q ueens are popular and mainstream because they are men and g ay and d rag k ings are not popular and mainstream because they are women and l esbians.

We also realised that men doing typically female hobbies and jobs are praised, celebrated and supported by women far more than women doing typically male hobbies and jobs are praised, celebrated and supported by men. 

For example d rag q ueens, g ay male makeup artist YouTubers and so on are welcomed with open arms, made famous and successful and praised for the bare minimum and standards are lower than they would be for women, women love the novelty of men doing their hobbies.

Meanwhile women or lesbians who do male hobbies or jobs and female footballers are paid less, have less crowds, less support, praise, less celebration, are trolled more online and held to higher standards, have to really prove themselves to be let in and have people who doubt them more. This also goes for female politicians who openly complain about r ape and d eath threats and attribute that to the fact that they are female.

So is it a far conclusion to say women welcome, love and praise men into their circles while women do not get that from men?

My parents were never very close. They felt more like two people who agreed to get married and take care of a child without having an actual relationship with each other. Not to mention, my dad (who no longer lives with us) would never join us on holidays since it was with my moms side which is a whole separate thing I’d rather not get into.

My gf has never put pressure on me when it came to her meeting my family and parents since she’s as clueless as I am. However, her parent have invited me to their birthday parties and family gatherings occasionally and it makes me feel guilty that my mom has never done the same with her. I have no idea what I’m doing but I know that I want her to feel like she’s a part of my family. I know we’re still young but we even talk about moving in together and getting married once we get settled in our careers.

Also I go to college 3ish hours away, she works full time so we see each other every weekend.

Anyways, part of me wants to put this on my main so she sees it because she is way to difficult to talk to at times. She either gets mad at me, sad, or will turn things around and target me. 

I'm tired of the attitude, I'm tired of me saying something she doesn't like and then gives me all kinds of attitude. Like I'll make a stupid joke about something stupid, like a joke about the name of a football team and she gets mad at me and thinks I'm stupid or inconsiderate (I call the Commanders the commies because its a meme for some reason). Fuck earlier today, I called her and she instantly gave me attitude for whatever reason! I called her, she was all WTF do you want then randomly hangs up on me. I didn't even say anything to her yet that day!

I'm tired of her berating me and calling me stupid and the R word. I'm tired of her assuming I'm ignoring her or being an asshole simply because I'm busy and can't reply asap and yet she leaves me on read all the time, I don't mind I know she's busy but then why get mad at me when I leave you in delivered for more then 5 minutes.

I hate that whenever I have an issue and I bring it up to her she bitches at me about how I'm an asshole who doesnt see what she brings to the table. ""Hey I like when you help me clean up and you do a good job, do you think you can help more"" (I asked her this because when she visits and when I visit her I usually cook us dinner but she never says thanks or helps cooks or cleans just sits on her phone), she replies ""WTF I DO HELP CLEAN ALL THE FUCKING TIME, I wiped the counters down wrf did you do!""... idk cleaned the pots and pans, cooked the entire fucking dinner, and served it...

I hate how whenever I am struggling with something it's a competition or if she doesn't deem it worthy enough to be a struggle she just says ""that's a you problem"" or ""oof"" and leaves me on read or ignores me. I once needed to talk to her about a shared traumatic experience... well yeah ot was harder on her then me but don't poke my chest and scream at me how I'll never know how hard it was on you and how my feelings basically don't matter because it was worse on her.

I have so so so much more I want to say but it's hard to convey over text... I'm starting to have second thoughts and honestly feel I may not have been very happy these past few months. I want to talk to her about it but I know she's either gonna get mad and put all blame on me, or cry abkut how she's such a horrible GF and she's trying to do better because she's not use to this healthy relationship. I'm starting to just want out but I love her and don't just wanna leave I've had some good times and memories with her, but I just don't know any more.

I would catch him talking to girls all the time over text or snap or honestly a lot of things. I’ve never caught him or seen any evidence of physically cheating. But I don’t truly know. 

At first I blamed myself because after I had my last child I hit a very deep dark depression and it severely effected my sex drive. And I think the catching him over and over again made me not love him. Anyway cut to now. 

I finally hit my breaking point after I caught him one last time. I took a whole week before I confronted him. And I thought things out throughly. I decided I wanted to try everything we could to fix it before we gave up our family.

I have hard a previous sexual/dating relationship with this man. 

He is married with children and my co-worker. We had worked together previously and have recently starting working together again. We were working on a project together and decided to work out of the office. While out of the office he asked if I would like to have dinner. I said yes and asked what he would like, assuming he would want to grab something at a drive-thru and then return to work(truthfully I thought anything else may be inappropriate). That is not what he meant, he meant a sit down dinner. We have very good conversation, and it was nice to sit down to dinner but afterward I felt like it was the wrong decision given the history. Approximately two weeks later he arrived at the office to see me(although not working) and explained that he had really enjoyed going to dinner(also I could see he was visibly nervous at the beginning of our discussion). He also mentioned discussing going to dinner with me, with his mother. I was very surprised he gone out of his way and seek me out privately to tell me this. He had on previous occasions expressed his unhappiness in his relationship and on this particular night explained that he may try therapy. 
At this point I’m trying to convince myself that he is not interested in me but is speaking to me as a friend. The part that I find confusing is that he tells me that I look good, notices if I’ve spent more time on my hair or makeup. He tells me I smell good or that he likes what I’m wearing. At another time he asked me to do something with him privately, out if office but again for work. He has sometimes spent time staying late to talk with me about any number of things. Maybe this is avoiding going home?
I find him attractive. I suppose in asking this question I am trying to discover if the connection I feel is real.

She can be a sweet person but also can be an absolute terror.

As with most roommate situations, we share a kitchen and a refrigerator. We both love cooking as a hobby so the kitchen tends to be the most occupied by either of us. Usually it’s not a problem because we have different work schedules, and since we know each other’s schedule, it’s rare for us to use the kitchen at the same time. Anyway, my issues with her is that, while she is a great chef, she often leaves a huge mess and won’t clean up after herself. Food scraps are left on the counter even though we have a scrap bin. No matter how many times I tell her about it, she forgets. Any pots, pans, utensils, and dishes she uses, she will leave them in the sink and just forget about it, too. Or expect me to clean it because I’m “usually the one who uses them next so why wash them if they’re going to get dirty again?”

When it comes to the refrigerator, we have a rule to name our stuff and only touch/eat/use each other’s stuff with prior permission. Numerous times I have caught her eating my food. Using my condiments or ingredients, especially the types that are on the luxurious side. I still am bitter when she ate most of my homemade arancini (leaving only two out of five) that I worked all day to make. I didn’t talk to her for a week. She said she’s sorry and thought they were there for sharing, despite being in a Tupperware with my name on it. She claims that I had already given her permission to eat/use my stuff, even though it was for only that *one* time she wanted to use my ketchup that she had ran out. I explained this to her about three times. I told her, when she gave permission for me to use *her* mayonnaise, I understood it as that one time only and haven’t touched her stuff since then without her permission. So I told her it’s, and should be, the same situation. All three times, she has apologized for interpreting it incorrectly but will forget about it and steal my food again.

She’s normally a good roommate. Again, she’s a great chef and makes some darn good food. Just her kitchen habits are downright horrible that I’ve started to avoid using the kitchen as much as I can. I don’t know what to do. We don’t have the space to install a dishwasher and our landlord refuses to add things so that’s out of the question. I have bought a mini fridge to put in my room and have moved some of my stuff there but obviously not all of it. And that still doesn’t resolve the issue of her not cleaning up. We moved in five months ago but our apartment is a two-year contract so I can’t afford to break lease and move out so I’ll be stuck with her for awhile.

So my (21F) boyfriend (21M) and I have been dating for a year and recently went long distance three months ago due to grad school. 
I usually am very accommodating of his schedule since he’s doing a tech degree and experiencing some early challenges. I love him a lot and try to understand that he won’t be able to always talk for a long time everyday. 

However, recently he started an on campus job. I used to only have weekends with him and he has 8 hour shifts on each of the days of weekend. Due to his busy weekdays, he has stopped texting me first, calling me first, and usually taking a long time to return texts, cancelling virtual dates that I try to organise and put a lot of energy into. 

Before we started grad school, he used to shower me with so much attention and love, and constant communication. He couldn’t get enough of me and always used to do sweet things for me. 

I have had enough of this. He does not reciprocate my energy. Since the past three days we only exchanged like 5-10 texts at max, and yesterday, I thought I might just leave it upto him to text/call first just to gauge if he actually cares about me and loves me and wants to talk to me. Zilch. That FUCKING hurt so bad. At 11 PM yesterday of literally zero communication, I texted him:
“Do you not think of me at all, not at all?” 
I was so sad that I had to be the one to text him again just so to hear from him. 

He said that he’ll do better, and I believed that. The next day, the cycle repeated. I lost it, but not completely. 
I called him, cried on the phone literally begging him to text me first, take some initiative and do something. Be the man I can rely on and hope to feel loved from. 

He said that I just have to accept that he doesn’t have the time to talk and the sooner I accept it, the better it would be. He also told me that I should fill up my time with other things so that I don’t miss him a lot. 

This has been happening since the past four weeks, and initially I used positive reinforcement to get my point across. I used to make it explicitly known how I absolutely loved when he texted me and said those sweet things when he did. And in return for his small gesture, told him how I wanted to spoil and pamper him for being the amazing boyfriend he was. I thought positive reinforcement will encourage him to talk to me more. 

Things stayed that way for four weeks. I was so angry, that I said this. I told him that I didn’t want to be that girlfriend who has to nag her boyfriend for having the basic decency to care about his girlfriend. I told him that it’s on him to make this right and empty promises won’t do. I need to see real results and real improvement. If he keeps neglecting me like this, it might put a lot of strain in our relationship and it’s better to nip this in the bud. 

Since I conveyed that to him, granted he has been more attentive, been calling, texting in between etc. but I just feel like he’s doing it out of obligation rather that having the urge from within to show that he loves me and how much he wants me and misses me. It just feels forced.

People, how do I deal with feeling this? Have you had similar experiences with your partner that makes you question that your partner is doing something only to appease you and not out of their natural desires/thinking about you ?

I don’t think it’s my responsibility but I’m starting to feel like I should. We didn’t get along very well when I was a teen, but our relationship was starting to get a lot better now that I have moved out and started my own life. 

It started in August. My sister’s(9,A) birthday. I couldn’t make her actual birthday, but my fiancé(21, J) and I decided we would take her to the fair a couple days later to celebrate. I called my mom to ‘ok’ it and then went and picked up A. 

When getting back to my house, we had about 3 hours before we were going to go and J was going to let A play his PS4 while she waited. Which would be cool, buuuuut A has had head lice since she was probably about 5 years old. 

(Backstory because I feel it’s necessary to add: 
 My family has been struggling with head lice since I was a child (6-7yrs). We did the treatments and whatever but nothing ever seemed to work. I have 3 sisters so that’s a lot of infested hair.)

Anyway, my mom and I had just talked about it a week or so before. She told me they had taken care of all of it. Everyone had clean scalps. It made me happy to hear that. 

I checked A’s head and it was clear it hadn’t been even treated for at least 2 months. I felt so horrible that my 9 year old sister had to sit with this. I called my mom to let her know and this is pretty much how that went,
Me- Hey, I just called to let you know that A’s still got lice. I thought you said it was taken care of.
Mom- It’s not that easy. 
Me- Well, there are lice clinics that can 100% get rid of it.
Mom- You don’t understand. We can’t afford that. I’m tired of everyone telling me how to raise my kids. You can bring your sister home now. 
And she hung up on me. 

Luckily, I had some lice shampoo and combs on me and I got to work. I spent 2 and a half hours combing and picking at A’s hair. Our plan was to still take her to the fair. It was our gift to her and she was excited, I wasn’t letting my mom ruin the fun. 

My dad called me as we were getting ready and basically blew up on me. He told me to bring A home now. He said if I ever wanted to “come at your mother like that again, you will have to go through me.” and hung up. 

I REFUSED to let them take away this experience for her. A and I used to be so close. I changed her diapers and made her bottles at 12 years old. She slept in my bed until she was 5. We grew apart when I moved out of my parents house. 

We went to the fair and we had a blast. We rode plenty of rides and ate so much greasy fair food. We got on their ferris wheel and looked down over the whole fair. It was awesome experiencing it with her for the first time. When we left, I took A and met my dad and a gas station to get her. I haven’t seen her since. 

With the holidays basically here, I’m missing my family. My siblings have asked questions and from what I’ve gathered, my mom and dad don’t talk about me. Whenever one of my siblings brings me up, they shrug it off and change the subject. Was there something wrong that I did? 

I’ve been feeling on the fence about just texting my mom. Something to at least open up conversation? I wouldn’t know what to say though. I’m not sure what to do. J’s family is basically all I have right now. They’re amazing but I miss my own. 

Should I reach out? How would I even start this conversation? Or should I wait for one of them to reach out?

Minutes before I was supposed to be getting married, he said to me "" I guess we're not going to be able to do anything reckless anymore, are we?"" perfectly normal thing to say to someone, getting married is an immense commitment but still, he isn't the type to say that sort of thing, i decided to stay quiet and it stings my head as seconds later he said, ""I'm going to become lonely without you."" 

I didn't know what to say therefore I didn't reply, he has a history of mental illness which I've helped him with, I know what he's like, I assumed he was going through another episode or something but I can't describe the feeling I felt when he said that, I felt my stomach drop and felt a horrible sense of dread, and sadness, if you please.

They also betrayed the person who passed away in the process as they had passed with the reassuring knowledge that they would be there for me. 

I was completely broken by it &amp; sent myself almost mad with the mystery of it all on top of unbearable grieving to the point where it sent me spiralling &amp; I wasn’t sure I was going to make it. It took me a year alone to just accept that they really were doing this for good &amp; that I wasn’t going to get the dignity of an explanation or even an acknowledgment.

Thankfully I am in a much stronger place now after 2.5 years &amp; i’m actually glad that they left me if they didn’t have real love for me, but I still live with a lifetime of memories &amp; a lifetime of memories of my late loved one intwined with them. I can’t do anything about that &amp; I would be erasing many of the happiest &amp; momentous moments of my life &amp; my loved one’s life if I tried to erase them so I will somehow have to live with that. 

However I have actual physical things in my life that are directly to do with them - gifts they gave me, mementos I kept from memorable times together, photos, things that I bought but are strongly intwined with memories of them. I don’t know how to feel about these &amp; what to do with them. 

Many times in moments I felt very angry at them, especially when they were ignoring my messages for an explanation, I’ve thought about smashing the items, throwing them away, even leaving them outside their door as a cathartic process. Then I used to get fleeting moments of thinking maybe things will change in the future, what if we reconcile one day, the relationship was too big &amp; deep &amp; valuable to me to believe it could really be gone just like that. 

I no longer believe we could ever reconcile anymore. 

Too much stuff has happened since they started it, they weren’t there for massive things that happened to me &amp; actively contributed to nearly killing me. I hate them.

However I am still conflicted about the items in my life. They’re not as complicated as the memories I can’t &amp; don’t want to erase, but they are similar in that respect. They’re mementos of real &amp; happy moments in my life. And the gifts they gave me back then, they were sincere &amp; came from a genuine place at that time. Didn’t they? Do I separate that from what they’ve done to me since &amp; keep the items as I’ve always felt about them. A part of my history. 

More confusing are the items from after my loved one passed away &amp; which blur the lines of when they started to abandon me. The most heartbreaking is the flowers they gave me after the funeral along with gifts each. They meant a lot to me, I was touched by them showing me love as even though we were very close they were never affection showing &amp; gifting people. I dried the petals of the flowers carefully &amp; kept them, they will have no idea I did that, but I kept them like they were precious jewels in my room. Whilst they were ignoring my pleas asking why they’ve abandoned me whilst I sobbed I looked at the dried petals everyday in front of me. 

A beautiful teapot one of them also gave me with the flowers is in the cupboard. I’ve thought about leaving it on her doorstep along with the petals many times when I’ve been going through a terrible moment but held back. I loved that tea pot when she gave it &amp; would have many moments of peace with it drinking tea with biscuits whilst in deep grief. 

Maybe I leave it for some time yet? Maybe I’ll regret it in future if I let it all go even if I never reconcile with them?

I've been a quiet person most of the time since a kid, and did not have many friends growing up, and had always found it hard to get along with people around me. I have the desire to be in a relationship for sure, and in my view, I have tried to approach men to initiate, and some men have done the same, but nothing ever developed. Out of some of these initiations, it started with friendships that I believe I have often made things awkward for the other person, and they backed off - often making me feel rejected and abandoned. In one experience, a guy used me in every way you could think of and ghosted me. 

One of the things I realized only later on in life was that I'm not good at communicating or expressing myself, and I've also always been a really quiet person, so people may find that I am a bit hard to understand - eh, they may just find me boring? I also figured that I've low self-esteem and maybe have been codependent in the could-have-been-relationships, putting people on a pedestal, scaring people away. Part of this, I'm trying to deal with therapy and myself. I have found myself lying to people when they asked me about my relationship history simply because I'm ashamed I've never had anything real. Having people respond to me in ways that'd make me question myself is scary  - ""seriously? you never had an adult relationship before? you've been single since school?""  so I automatically lied a few times which I hated - the core belief that I'm unlovable is real!

I (F22) think I have a pretty good idea of how consent works but my husband (M22) seems think I’m wrong. We’ve been together for almost 5 years, married for 2. 

In short - he had sex with me when I was high as a kite, but I never gave consent to have sex explicitly high. I don’t remember what happened, and he is saying if I said I wanted sex when I was sober and again while high it counts as consent. Really confused and upset. Would like clarification on consent and maybe some good credible websites to show him. 

In length - He won’t believe me or even bother to look up how consent works and he argues even if the world says it works one way it’s my fault if I haven’t communicated how “specifically” I want consent to work in our relationship. 

Last night we talked about having sex at 10pm and both agreed on it. We did not discuss nor did I give my consent to “under the influence” sex. At about 9:30 I took an edible to help me sleep. I had surgery 3 weeks ago and so this is really helpful since I have to sleep in an awkward position. I usually only take half of one, but my husband saw me biting it in half and told me to just take the whole thing snappily. Usually it doesn’t kick in for almost two hours MAYBE an hour and half, so I wasn’t too worried about it effecting me during sex. However that night it literally kicked in in 15 minutes and I was ZOOTED OUT OF MY MIND. I hardly remember anything. I was not expecting that.

I woke up the next morning in lingerie that was hurting my incisions and apparently had done the deed. I asked my husband and he was nonchalant about it and went to work. I was feeling very very icky and used because I didn’t even remember anything. 

I confronted him later when he got home and asked nicely like “hey Ik that sometimes I like the idea of being incapacitated during sex but we have to have specific consent for that and if you don’t have that please don’t proceed.” He got really defensive and angry, and now he refuses to have sex with me because he says I called him a rapist. I didn’t. But also- 👀… He later apologized and said he can do that but he is adamant he didn’t do anything wrong and it’s actually my fault for never telling him that I wanted to have specific consent for incapacitated sex before. His argument is since I said when I was sober I wanted to have sex and again when I was high (I don’t remember) then it was perfectly fine. I tried explaining that yeah I gave consent for sober sex and that’s not the same thing blah blah but he doesn’t agree.

First time posting so sorry if this rambles or doesn't make sense. I recently became official with my girlfriend (F24) she and I really click, I seriously love this girl. The problem is she thinks it weird I hang out with my girl best friend (F24). My best friend and I have been friends since I was 13 we have never slept together or dated. To be fair, we have liked each other before but nothing has ever been felt at the same time. I recently told my gf about this and she was a bit upset to say the least. I know it's a little weird or relationship but it's strictly platonic. But anytime I go out with my best friend or go out hang out with any girl my gf calls it a date. We recently had a discussion and my gf doesn't think it's okay that I would feel perfectly fine if she had a guy best friend and went out to get dinner or go to the movies. I understand the situation I am in is weird and usually is what starts infidelity so I understand her reservations. But what can I do she is uncomfortable with us being around each other alone, she doesn't like going to the movies and that is something we like to do all the time. She sees it as me doing relationship stuff with other people. I just seeing at hanging with friends.

She’s devastated and so am I but I couldn’t resolve these issues:

1. Drinking. We both drink socially but she gets hammered sometimes and then drives. I’ve warned her but it still occasionally happens

2. Curiosity. She doesn’t read, listen to podcasts or do much to improve her mind. She’s not dumb but also not the sharpest crayon. Her lack of intellectual curiosity makes it hard to have conversations.

3. Parenting. She has an 18 yo and doesn’t guide the kid much. No plans for college. This drives me crazy but it’s not my kid (both my kids went to uni)

4. Wings it - she doesn’t plan and goes with the flow. She has her own successful biz but it could crash anytime and she’s oblivious.

5. Hangs with trash friends. She’s gregarious and likes to meet new people but when I meet them, I run. Absolute garbage.

Im financially secure, thoughtful, honest and caring. I don’t cheat.

While I love her, I can’t see us together 3-5 yrs from now bc our values are so different.

I don’t have any close friends that I would be willing to share this story with because my bf and I’s friend group are pretty intertwined and I don’t want anybody in his personal life to find out if he doesn’t want them to. We’ve been dating for about a year and are talking about marriage, ect. Before that, we had known each other for a while and had been best friends (inseparable) for close to a year before dating. I had never met someone with whom I shared so many of the same interests, and he has just shown me so much understanding, and kindness. I can tell he genuinely loves me. Family members (while friends) thought he was gay and while he isn’t afraid of feminine activities I thought it was due to him being sheltered and being close to his mom/sisters, while not having a good relationship with his dad. I have been hurt in my childhood and have made some terrible choices with men in the past that have cheated, continuously lied, ect. While I’ve been working on myself a lot (he has helped so much as well) to overcome trusting people again, it’s really hard to turn off the alarm bells sometimes, especially when everything is going so right. 

I’m his first gf, school and work hadn’t given him many opportunities to meet a lot of girls his age. But he has told me about his childhood crushes. His family is very religious and he believes in God but isn’t nearly as religious. So I was his first kiss, first everything. While we haven’t had full-on sex (due to religious beliefs), we do oral stuff. 

Anyways, I was over at his house and I found his journal. While I know how awful it is to read someone’s journal I still peaked and once I saw one or two things I decided to skim through a few pages and couldn’t look through it anymore. I feel punished because my bubble of him has completely been crushed and now I know things will never work out without us both being hurt in the long run. In his journal, he said he was “forcing attraction”, and that if a guy did the same thing he would know if he liked it while he’s not so sure when I do. That he wants to see a guy naked or seeing me naked didn’t make him feel things nearly as much as a guy “should”. However, he also was saying he was struggling to not have sex with me? But in the few pages I read, he mentioned me a lot and I can tell he genuinely loves me and that he’s really struggling. A lot of his thoughts were not completed because I think with how close he is to his religious family he’s afraid to fully admit to himself how he feels.

After I could gather my thoughts, I was angry at first that he would date me if he was struggling with his sexual identity and angry at myself for prying. Now that it’s been two days I’m just really sad and my depression has gotten pretty bad. I love him so much and I want the best for him and to be happy and accepting of himself. I don’t think he’s bi? so eventually a romantic relationship will fall apart and I also can’t go on dating him knowing that about him without at least talking to him about it. I just don’t know what to do, and if I did admit to prying how do I approach him about it without hurting him? If he does admit to it and we break up how do I support him while getting over the hurt of losing him as a romantic partner?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7542868,public,self,I NEED HELP/my bf (23m) is a closeted gay and how do I let him know I know,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yuo1rr/i_need_helpmy_bf_23m_is_a_closeted_gay_and_how_do/,all_ads,6,,,,

Due to this we hangout all the time together. However, this hasn’t been happening as much since my friends husband has become extremely difficult the more we have gotten to know him. 

For the last 5 times that we have spent time with them her husband has started uncomfortable fights with his wife about issues that seem unrelated to anything we are doing. He has become overall very difficult, he refuses to do anything unless it’s what he wants to do, such as what restaurant/bar we’re going to, what movie we’re watching, or what board game we’re playing. Even with the small things like if I say I enjoyed the movie we watched and he didn’t, he’ll go on a rant about how it was utter trash and I don’t know what I’m talking about. 

It has gotten progressively worse lately, last Friday we were going to watch a movie at their place at 8pm, which turned into us trying to find a movie that my friends husband wanted to watch that we did as well. The three of us wanted to watch a certain movie and he said if we watch that he’s taking his computer to the other room to play video games. Obviously, we wanted him to not feel left out so we tried to find one we all wanted to watch. Fast forward to an hour later where we still couldn’t find one he wanted to watch because he refused to watch any of the ones we suggested. My husband and I ended up going home at that point. 

On Saturday we had brunch with them at their place, which ended with a disagreement happening between my friend and her husband. Her husband wrapped himself up in a blanket and laid on the floor refusing to talk to anyone. My husband and I awkwardly left so they couldn’t work through the fight that had taken place. 

My friend gets very annoyed at her husband’s behaviour, and I’m not sure what to do about it all. There’s just been so many times her husband has ruined the plans we had for the day because he didn’t get his way. If we’re in public and this happens, he will say he isn’t feeling good and we need to go home right now, he does this every single time so I know it’s not legitimate.

I don’t think I could bring this up to my friend without it being very uncomfortable. But I just don’t know what to do at this point because I still value my friendship with her.

She's a really sweet girl that doesn't deserve all of the horrible hands she's been dealt in life, and I still care about her deeply. We've been together for almost a year, and it's become clear to me that we are not compatible. I've tried to break up with her gently twice before, but she broke down and begged me to stay, (which I did), so I already know it's going to be rough. Recent developments have given me more resolve, and I know I'm going to hold my ground this time, but I'd like some advice. 

She has been verbally and emotionally abused for most of her life, by her parents, exes, and peers. She only has a handful of friends outside of my friend group, and she does not actively spend time with them. She suffers from anxiety and depression and her self-esteem is almost nonexistant. When I started dating her, I admittedly had a bit of a savior complex and thought I could ""fix"" her. I recognize now that this was wrong, and I am in over my head. Currently I am her only source of validation and emotional support, which is why I'm very concerned that leaving her is going to push her over the edge. I want to be honest about my reasons while minimizing the hurt feelings. 

The overarching point that I'd like to make to her is that she has done nothing wrong, and I am only leaving because I recognize our incompatibility. I want to stay single for a while and don't have any plans for moving on, so I would like to stay friends and continue to be there for her.  My specific reasons for breaking up with her (in order of importance) are as follows:

1. I am emotionally drained. At least 75% of our conversations are her expressing her low self-esteem due to abuse from her parents, exes, and others, and me desperately trying to offer validation with no success. She does not express happiness or excitement when we spend time together, which I fully understand and don't blame her for, but it leaves me feeling unhappy and unappreciated myself. She is very sensitive, and I rarely express my own needs, problems, and emotions, for fear of making things worse for her. 
2. She is very against alcohol. This is understandable, as her parents are severe alcoholics (which contributes greatly to their verbal abuse towards her), and her uncle recently drank himself to death. She especially hates jokes about drinking. I, however, like to drink and party. I only do so with friends and family, always in a controlled environment, and never break the law. But I like to get drunk, occasionally smashed, and act stupid. My friends and I like to drink at parties or go bar-hopping, and my family drinks at every gathering. She claims to be fine with me drinking lightly, without her around, but she is clearly upset anytime I get even a little buzzed. She has angrily pulled me away from parties, and lashed out at my friends for joking about drinking. I don't feel like I can bring her around my friends or my family anymore without risk of her making a scene. Her feelings are valid and I don't blame her for this, but it's not a change I'm willing to make. Even if I gave up drinking, I can't change my friends or family, and I want someone that I can comfortably bring with me to social gatherings. 
3. We are sexually incompatible. Without getting into detail, she expresses little to no interest in sex. I want much more frequent and varied sex than she is willing to give. Early in the relationship she assured me that it just takes time for her to get used to someone, and gradually she would open up, but it's been almost a year and nothing has changed. I am very sexually unsatisfied and I don't feel attractive or desired. I know it would be wrong to pressure her, but I've given up hope for things improving on their own. Her feelings are valid and I'm not going to force her to do anything she doesn't want to, but this is not what I want my sex life to look like for the rest of my time on this Earth. 
4. We really don't have that much in common in general. I can't think of any shared interests other than travel. We frequently go entire dinner dates with almost no conversation and just look at our phones. 
5. She likes to dabble in 420. I work in law enforcement and weed is illegal in my state. It's a minor offense, and I really don't care on a personal level, but nonetheless it is a serious ethical/integrity violation for my significant other to be a user. I've offered a compromise of agreeing to disagree, and adopting a don't-ask-don't-tell policy when she goes back to visit her home state, where it is legal. However, she rejected this compromise, and continues to pick occasional fights about it. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated. I want to be honest but gentle, and I want her to know that I can and will still be there for her. But I know, and I want her to know, that continuing this relationship won't be good for either of us.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7542862,public,self,(23M) breaking up with someone (25F) that I love and care about without hurting her feelings too much,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yuo03k/23m_breaking_up_with_someone_25f_that_i_love_and/,all_ads,6,,,,True

I am concerned that I don’t care for my girlfriend the way she cares for me and am maybe not attracted to her that much. I am confused.

I want to start off by saying my girlfriend and my relationship are amazing. We share a similar sense of humor and are really great together in many ways. I love talking to her. She spoils me almost too much, giving more to me than I’d ever expect or have ever been given in a relationship. I am never turned down for sex. She really is an unbelievable woman.

At the same time, I feel immense guilt. I can’t tell if I just don’t love her (and WHY), or if perhaps this is just a more lowkey kind of love that I am not used to. Just a few months ago even she seemed to notice this and was upset but I reassured her, which felt wrong in a way. I have been in a relationship before and I think I had stronger feelings then. I was certainly much more attracted to my ex, both physically and in a way that’s kind of hard to describe. I was just more attracted to her as a person despite her being worse for me in the end. I never got the butterfly feelings for my current gf that I had in the past, not even at the start.

At times I feel I have stumbled into a relationship with a great friend. Maybe i just don’t feel for her romantically but do platonically? At others I doubt this and think that maybe this is just a more mature relationship. I would miss her immensely if she was gone and would surely doubt my decision for a long time.

- I didn't want to have commitment with her before. We ended up breaking up for 1 month. After we got back together (I finally figured out my feelings), her feelings for me is not the same anymore. She feel unsafe and insecure.

- Yesterday, I accidentally left her behind when we when out for a walk with one of our friend (who is also a female). I walked with my friend without noticing that she was left behind (she always walks slowly). I sat next to my friend in a pub. She is opposite me. She said that's not where I should sit (which I agree with).

- I didn't let her sleep in the same bed never (I find it hard to share a bed with someone).

- I never said I love her after 1 year of dating. I am just not ready to say it yet.

- I made her delete the photo of us that she posted on social media.

- I kept forgetting to buy her what I promised. Things are just candy or flowers. They can easily be bought when we went shopping. She ended up buying them herself without telling me.

She claimed that I don't like her enough to care about her.

Those are just so small reasons. I know I am not a perfect boyfriend but I am trying to be better. I just had 1 ex and it was during covid so I didn't have experience in dating.

Hello I've been with my girlfriend for 4 months now, she is insecure about herself and ou relationship, we work together before daiting and when my suicide attempt failed and ended up in the hospital she was the only one that reached out to me and called me, nevertheless she was daiting a guy at that time and when I got out the hospital I began talking to her flirting with her here and there but when we became girlfriend and boyfriend she was still daiting the guy for one week.

       After that we've been together but she has gotten to attach with me and she gets jealous every time I talk to a boy or a girl even tho they are in a relationship even friends ( good time to remind you guys I'm bi) and I work in a restaurant mainly as bartende.  

    But all of a sudden a month ago this Venezuelan girl came to work and because I'm the only Spanish speaking person I was chosen to train her and help her out and my girlfriend didn't like that, which it's not surprising, but anyway she got upset and we had a discussion and before I left I told her I can't do this anymore I can't I need a break.

      Wake up the next morning police department, fire department and paramedics on my door apparently my phone was dead and didn't get calls from my ""girlfriend"" and she called saying I was suicidal, so I have 5 polices in my apartment checking everything and patting me down to check any self-harm injuries  and asking all this question.

    I explained myself but even that they didn't understand  so now I'm taking medication and going to therapy because of her, even tho I did said anything.

    BUT WAIT THERES MORE

So now me and my girlfriend are in a break and that Venezuelan girl I talk about is staying with me because the apartment she was one the guy doesn't wants her there because her wife doesn't trust her and she just got here a month ago and doesn't know anyone here my girlfriend says it's okay but I know she's not and she is a handful full.
