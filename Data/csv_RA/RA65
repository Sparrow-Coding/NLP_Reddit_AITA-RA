we met in highschool, i was around 14 and he was 15. we became friends really quickly and i honestly don’t know how to describe it. 


the easiest way to put it is i don’t think i’ve ever felt so seen by another person before? he understood me so easily and vice versa and talking to him just came so naturally. i think it had to do with the fact that we’re both chinese and trans. but even without that he was just such an easy person to talk to. he was one of my best friends. 


around grade 11 (grade 12 for him) our school system got a little weird because of covid. i could tell he was super stressed from academics. so was i. i was burnt out and depressed and it was probably the same for him. still we talked, called, even if we didn’t have anything to say. we’d chat and then just do our own thing while still face timing. when we did have actual conversations they’d last forever. 


throughout our friendship we’d joke about how he was incapable of loving people because of how emotionally unavailable he is. maybe we were more serious than we realized. despite his slightly non affectionate personality i felt like we were really close. i loved talking to him and i miss those times he’d spam me with texts asking me where i was so we could go grab bubble tea together and hang. i remember one time he wanted to draw me for an assignment but that never happened. i really wish it had. 


so during the last few years of highschool, despite going to the same school it was hard to get ahold of him. he didn’t answer texts and i didn’t know which classes he had. at the end of the year i found out he was going to move away and he didn’t even bother to tell me. we promised to hangout one last time before he left but that never happened. 


he’s been away all this time now. occasionally i’m able to get ahold of him and we talk a bit. last time he told me he was back home for a bit and we could hangout again. we made plans but he cancelled both times with vague excuses


today i messaged him again. turns out he was here last month. i asked him why he didn’t tell me he said he didn’t bother. i said we should hangout he said he’s not sure. he says he hasn’t changed but. he wasn’t understanding my texts and he kept sending little confused messages like uh and um. it’s just so different from before when we just got each other. 


i’m aware it’s insane to expect a person to actually be the same after so long. i’m also a little drunk and just messaged him saying that if he doesn’t want to hangout he should just say it and that we haven’t really been friends in a while. probably dumb move but whatever. 


i just miss my best friend and it really hurts right now. it hurts that it feels like he doesn’t care as much as i do. i wonder if he ever really cared at all. i think he was the closest i’ve ever been to being in love. 


i mainly just wanted to vent but any advice on how to move on would be greatly appreciated.

I (m27) date a woman (27) for almost 2 years, and we live together for almost 1.5 years (I know, too quick).

The problem is that we have literally nothing to do.

She doesn’t want to go to restaurants, cinema or any public places, which is ok.

At the same time she never wants to just stay home and chill in the weekends, and since “im a male” I have to come up with things to do, and I’ve completely exhausted my list of ideas.

We traveled a lot, seen the whole country (a small country in Europe), visited a couple other countries… but we can’t travel outside of the country every weekend, lol.

For the past couple of months we just get out of the house, walk in a park, then we get in the car and I just keep driving hoping to find something new and exciting… all while we both are visibly bored, and the pressure just adds up and even this activity is not enjoyable at all. But even if it was, it would still get annoying after a while.


It’s annoying that we can’t just stay at home and do stuff, whatever it is, even watch Netflix.

At the same time I’m trying to set up a business and would rather spend a couple of hours every weekend on it than pointlessly drive to try and keep her entertained.


I feel like I want this relationship to be more normal/typical - Netflix and chill, each has their own hobby, each gets to spend some time on their own, and then go on date nights for “us time”… or just lay in bed and talk as “us time” rather than pointless going out just to not stay at home.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7553849,public,self,"My relationship is becoming very boring, we have nothing to do",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvrd4t/my_relationship_is_becoming_very_boring_we_have/,all_ads,6,,,

While I was on a trip across the world for a month in a different country I wasn’t able to communicate with him too much because of the time zone however the times that we did get a talk are usually just talk to my adventures and air out my grievances occasionally to him.  

Towards the end of my trip my boyfriend and we got into a little bit of a disagreement his first language is not English. And he ended up correcting my English and honestly my English is not good either especially while texting. I make a lot of grammatical mistakes. I just made a comment on how he actually did an English test And that it makes him better at English tell me. The way I might’ve phrased it might’ve come off across a little bit condescending however it was all through text. He took it the wrong way and decided to tell me that there’s 100 other girls like being out there and that he doesn’t need me and that we should break up. To me this is a big shock and kind of out of nowhere. 

He removed me from all social medias and every time I try to contact him he wouldn’t respond he basically blocked me off of everything. However in a couple of days he still decided to text me and we were still kind of talking. Mostly just about what happened and why he freaked out the way that he did. I was the one  initiating the talks to fix it he was seem like he’s mentally checked out. When I arrive back home my cousin sends me a screenshot telling me that he is on a dating app.

That’s when I really lost it because in two days my birthday was coming up and he was also acting as if everything was okay and that we were good so the fact that he was still on a dating app was really baffling. When I decided to confront him about it he called me a moron and said a lot of things that I’ve honestly just erase from my memory because I decided to forgive him because we really do love each other. We have Sexual chemistry physical chemistry we understand each other even though he wasn’t raised in the country I was born in and hasn’t gotten from post secondary education. He’s been really good to me besides the one time I caught him talking to another girl and he told me that it was this other girl and it turned out to be his cousin‘s girlfriend. But I thought we had love hence I decided to let it go believe that it was his cousins girlfriend. 

Side note: we’ve been very serious he’s told his parents about me his friends and he does want to settle down in 2 to 3 years. I was OK with this timeline however every time he would bring up the marriage I told him that we needed to have a bit of money saved up before we decide to get married because you have to plan for a wedding and living together. he also doesn’t have citizenship or PR in the country I’m in so I wanted him to get those first.  Hence why recently I’ve been hesitating on the marriage question because we don’t have our shit together and I would always tell him 2-3 years when the stuff is completed and I have a stable fulltime job. He drives a truck currently. I’m just out of undergrad looking for my fulltime job. 

What do you guys think was going on here do you think I should give this guy a second chance or do you think I’m just asking to get hurt again?

I do not want to break up with him, I want to help him live his best life. He has supported me and I want to return the favour, but I don't know how. I am autistic, so I hope the text reads well and I apologise in advance.

My boyfriend (24m) and I (20f) have been together officially for almost 5 months now, plus the dating time it would be almost 7.

When we first started dating, I was really open to him about my issues  I was actively working on. It was really great to learn to enjoy life again and I've been feeling a lot better lately.

For context, I work 20 hr/week, while also going to school fulltime (3rd year of my bachelor's) and having internship two days a week from 07:00-17:00, along with 2 1 hour sessions of therapy a week. I teach English, and while loving my job, it is exhausting.

Despite this, I still make sure to have ample time available for him throughout the week. My boyfriend, however, doesn't seem to have much time at all. He sleeps in until 12 almost everyday, barely goes to school which has caused him to repeat his first year of his bachelors (claiming he has already passed most of the subjects, but if he had, he wouldn't have to repeat his first year). He doesn't have a job and his parents pay for everything. He always starts projects which he never finishes, for example the bed that has been in boxes for the larger part of our relationship. I quickly got a feeling that he might be depressed, so I suggested to him to talk to somebody, but he claims that he doesn't have the time and he's so busy, which admittedly makes me upset since my life is a LOT more productive and I still have time for improving my health.

My issue here is that he acts like he performs equal amounts of labour compared to me, which is NOT true at all. I hate this voice in my head that tells me that I'm further ahead of him, 'better' than him perhaps, as I'm 4 years younger, already have a stable job + stable income and nearly finished my degree. I feel like that should be irrelevant, since he makes me feel like I am the only girl in the world. He is incredibly kind, caring and amazing at communication most of the time. He clearly cares for me, loves me, listens to me, cooks for me, picks me up from work every now and then because otherwise I'll have to commute 3hr/day for 4 days a week. There is absolutely no denying this man loves me, but I can't shake it that I want him to be more independent, I want him to work, I want him to take care of himself. The final straw for me was yesterday, when I went to his apartment and he was clearly not taking care of himself. 

I fell in love with the ambitious, independent, spontaneous guy with the gorgeous smile and the well-taken care of appearance. He's letting himself go. It's like I don't recognise him anymore and I have a hard time feeling attracted to him, no matter how badly I want to. I have tried everything to make life easier for him, like cleaning his house, doing his laundry, helping him with schoolwork. Which other steps can I take to help him get back on track? I'm losing my own motivation for life here.

&amp;#x200B;

We spend almost every day together, and usually have a great time. 

A little background: When I was eight years old I started to develop depression, i got really depressed until about two years ago, when I recovered. (Thanks to professional help I was getting for years and dealing with trauma) 

The last couple of weeks I have been feeling really stressed, I’ve been trying my best at school but I failed all my exams despite studying for very long, I don’t have energy anymore and things just feel really heavy for me lately. Of course I talk about the stress with my boyfriend, he knows I’m not feeling well but this morning I woke up crying and I felt like I was in the exact same position I was in two years ago and I never even got better in the first place. 

Having depression for the biggest part of your life is really hard and I was telling him that I was afraid of getting depressed again, because my lack of concentration, my inability to sleep and random negative thoughts that are bothering me ect.  
His immediate response was; “if you really feel like you’re going down that road again and you’re not getting help you don’t have to come knocking at my door. I don’t think I can handle you being depressed, because that’s what I fear most and I can’t deal with it.” Then he left for school. 
Of course I know that I need to get help if I can’t handle it, but therapy is really expensive and I haven’t been feeling this bad for that long so I would rather try to deal with it myself first. I was just hoping to get a hug or an “it’s going to be okay, I’m here for you” but that response was all I got. Did i put him on the spot? Is this a normal way to respond?

TLDR at the end.

My partner (25 NB) and I (26 F) have been having issues. Together for approx. 5 years, engaged for 2.5, but the last year or two has been especially difficult.

The first few years of our relationship were great. We barely had issues, but when we did, we would talk things through and come to a decision together. We were happy and in love.

They were someone who took pride in themselves. They dressed well, took care of themselves, they held themselves with confidence.

They aren’t like that any more.

They failed out of university, which I think was a big blow to their self-esteem. Then they did a college program, did very well, but got into the field and it was not what they were expecting. They are no longer working in that field. 

Their mother thinks appearances are everything, so she is constantly commenting on their weight and how they look…

They have huuuuge self-esteem issues. (Which is where I think a lot of our issues stem from.)

They also experienced some childhood trauma that has caused them to have an anxious attachment style. They HATE being alone. During their 10 minute drive home from work, they have to call me, their mother, or their grandmother…

I can’t go out with friends without them texting saying they miss me. I come home from work, and they want me to cuddle and hold them and kiss them for an hour straight because they “waited all day for me.” They will not go to sleep until I cuddle them.

Then came the mental illness. (Which I think has emphasized the pre-existing problems.)

They have bipolar disorder, and they’re trying to figure out the right medication combination. Things have been up and down, but their current meds seem to be helping them to an extent.

They see a counsellor, usually every 2-3 weeks. (They need more often, but it is not financially viable atm.)

Their mania is well controlled, but the depression is an issue still. They barely shower, they almost never brush their teeth, and they get stoned more nights than not and binge eat.

As someone who has dealt with severe mental illness, I understand what they are going through, but I’m now in recovery, so it’s agonizing to watch them destroy themselves, no matter how I try to help.

I have TRIED on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS to speak with them, tell them how I’m feeling, encourage them to do things that will help them feel better (showering, brushing teeth, balanced diet), tell them my wants and needs, gone to therapy with them, brought them to the mental hospital when they needed it. I was happy to do these things because I love them. I have done some of these things multiple times, because I have been there and I KNOW it’s hard.

Lately it feels like everything I do to try and help them is futile. They told me one day that they have”absolutely nothing to live for” and when I asked them, “what about me? You don’t want to live for me and our future together?” They said no.

I have told them I am unhappy. We planned to go together to their next counselling appt to discuss, and when the day came, they said they needed a session by themselves. We are going together to their next one, but it’s not for another week, and the resentment I am feeling just keeps building.

I have been noticing all the little things they do that piss me off, and it’s making me wonder how many of our “compromises” have actually just been me giving in to what they want and them getting used to relying on me for everything.

They will do nothing for themselves unless I am not there, or I REPEATEDLY and FORCEFULLY refuse. Washing their work clothes, getting something downstairs, making them a snack, tucking the blankets on the bed a certain way, household chores, you name it, they ask me to do it and they pout and whine and beg until I either give in, or I refuse so much that they get pissed.

They will wear underwear multiple times if I don’t wash any, they will not  prepare themselves a meal if I do not go with them, they will not run an errand if I want to stay home…it’s infuriating.

I think their self-esteem is so low and they are so reliant on others that they won’t do anything for themselves. Lately I have been refusing to do certain things for them no matter how much they ask because they are perfectly capable of doing it themselves, they just won’t.

I won’t even get into the mess that our sex life is, because it has gotten tangly.

So, I made a plan. 

I told my closest friends this plan so I’m accountable to someone.

I said I would (for the time being) not say anything and be helpful to my partner by going to therapy, continuing to encourage them to develop healthy habits, trying to be supportive…until after Christmas. But I would also be firm in certain boundaries, like refusinf to do basic tasks for them.

Once January comes, I will reassess. If nothing has improved, I will give them an ultimatum. Take action and improve things by the time I graduate from school in April, or I’m gone.

I think this is fair, given how long we’ve been together, how good things once were, and given the state of their mental health and the fact that I am aware things are harder when your mental health is bad.

I’m having a hard time sticking to this plan. Everything that they do that bothers me seems like it’s overshadowing the good person that I KNOW is in there. Everything in me is telling me to end it now, but this will involve losing SO MUCH. I’m also scared if it does come down to us splitting, they might hurt themselves.

I really do care about them. I love them. I’m just not sure if I am IN love with them any more.

They make me laugh. They care about my happiness and I care about theirs. They are soft. They are generous. We have similar goals in life. We have a special bond.

I’m not asking for advice regarding their mental health, it is just a big part of what we are going through. I am, however, asking for advice on if I should stick around to see if they’re going to put the effort in.

Do I stick with my plan? What do I do? I’m at a loss. Help.

TLDR: I made a plan for how I’m going to address my long-standing issues with my partner, which I have tried to address multiple times in the past, but I am having difficulty wanting to stick with the plan because I am becoming increasingly bothered by the situation. They aren’t putting in enough effort for me to want to stay, but their mental health is a big factor in why.

Me and GF have been dating for around 3 months.

I have a project at another state, so we're long-distance for a month.

She was a being hot and cold when we've just started dating, and that made me consider ending it because I don't like these games, but she started sobbing and assured me she really wants this, she misses me, etc, so I stayed. It became a bit better, but I still feel that she's much colder than any of my exes.

She asked me if I can send her ""good morning"" when I wake up and I obliged; I do this every day, but she wouldn't do the same if she wakes up first.

In addition, unless I text/call her first, she's not going to initiate, even if it's been almost a day since we've last talked. A couple of times I tried to give her space and not call/text for a whole day, and the only contact she made was send me ""Good night"" before going to bed.

Yesterday was one of those days. I've messaged her throughout the morning, told her I'm thinking of her, I miss her, can't wait to see her, and she would reply me too, and that's where I left it. 

15 hours later she messaged me ""I think I'm sick. Good night."". I called right away and asked what happened. She said she's been feeling very sick for the past 6 hours. I asked her why didn't she call me earlier, and she said ""you are always busy, I am the one always calling and texting you first"" lol what?

I told her that's not true, she can check the call logs and the texts, I call/text first almost all the time, and I told her before that I don't like mind games...I ended up not pursuing this argument because I thought it's not the best time for it (she's sick, this is not a phone convo etc).

Based on the facts, it's true, I am almost always reaching out first, and it makes me feel clingy. I honestly don't know why she would say what she did. Her behavior on one hand makes me feel like maybe she's not really that into me, but from what she complained, maybe it's just her trying to not show interest on purpose...

I know its a bit long post, but i am really depressed and anxious and i am in the toughest period of my life, and would appreciate your kind suggestion :(

I loved a girl deeply whom I met 4 months ago, we met for the first time in my country, where she spent her exchange semester, she came to visit and i asked if we can meet, we met she seemed quite interested in me on the first date and she was just looking at me while i was a bit shy but we hugged and kissed each other and i booked a hotel where we spent some nights together and had sex. it was more like a dream come true for me as she was so beautiful.

She came to Germany due to her business trip and i went to her country we met continuously and we have had sex every time plus we enjoyed each and every second specially me. i bought her presents, and once flowers and always bought something for her which she likes.

Once she mentioned her therapist told her she needs a good sex, and she thanked me multiple times, things went quite far and i become very attached to her as she was sharing each and everything with me, calling me, and wanted to talk almost everyday even i was busy but i gave her all my availability and time. i thought she loved me as she was always interested to meet me as we stayed quite far but she always wanted me to take the first step, i took paid and unpaid leaves from my work just to meet her and spent time with her.

while i assumed she loves me, but it was more like FWB thing for her which i got to know after some months. she sometimes said you are good friend etc. but everytime we went on a date, i paid for the restraunt, grocery and even whenever she bought for herself i paid for it, i don;t know probably my stupidity.

I got signs of being used sometimes but i ignored them as i loved her, eg: she asked me to book a theme park which she likes and wanted me to pay for her, until i asked should i sponsor ur ticket too, she said no no i can pay for u too as u are a good friend, and i told her no thanks we can split it.

things became worst when we met on a date 2 months ago, when we went on a restraunt and i paid there after we ate, and went a bit fast to the door, while i saw she is still sitting and i went back, which made her feel angry and mad at me, i felt sad as she misunderstood and i told her i came back for u as i didn't notice, she was a bit rude u went fast and bla bla, my fight language is just to stay silent so i don't say something wrong which might hurt her. she bought something afterwards from a store for me and i had my flight and she had a train to her city, i decided not to go with her and made a excuse on which she said f\*\*k you which made feel sad and because of what happened in restraunt and her words, and i decided to leave the appartment and she started to cry and appoligized and said she says it as a joke to her friends and they dont mind while i cried for the issue of restraunt and also her words(probably it was my childish part) but it hurted me.

She used to text me almost everyday but after that she stopped to contact and was contact every 2 3 day. It made me feel anxious if something is wrong after a lot of struggles I asked what she feels for me yesterday and she responded you are a nice person and no one treated me like this u treated me like ur gf maybe in future I might get same feelings like but then she said she don’t want to give me any hope. and i deserve someone nice.

It made me feel heartbroken. I don’t know why I love her. Even after this my mind is not ready to cut off. What I should do here? I don’t know why I care so much for someone for whom I am more like a option. she sees my messages sometimes and replies after 2-3 hours which was not the case before.

I don’t know why I am holding on to her but I would be grateful if someone can advice me something It’s my first relationship and which never even existed :( and i can't even focus on my job nor my studies, i am checking her insta and fb almost everyday and thinking about her and these thoughts are making me feel dipressed, i can't even have a therapy as its very hard to find it in germany if we don't speak german :( I would be grateful for your kind advice and suggesion. as i live alone her while parents live far away from me nor i can share it with my friends.

I took some of this advice and I recognize how it sounded and my intentions. Truthfully, I didn’t expect details, just in general, “are you two alright?” And I was agonizing over it. 
I respect that the details are none of my business. It was coming from a place of concern for her, me, and the kids and seeking out that boundary. 

She didn’t mind me asking, I think, because I explained I just wanted generalities. Not specifics. I said “Hey, look, I just know things were tough for awhile and I want to make sure things have been better because I want everyone to be safe… including him.” I appreciate that many of you would be mad if someone was trying to pry into the intricacies of your relationship and I had no intention of doing that.

I’m at a total loss right now, confused and hurt. 

His main reason for leaving is because he says he wants to work on himself and I need to work on myself. He says we’re toxic for each other and he needs to better himself. I just don’t understand how giving up on couples therapy, separating and no longer living with us is bettering himself? I feel like I am being left alone and he’s helping as much as a baby sitter would, showing up here and there, then he leaves and goes to do whatever the hell he’s got going on (house shows, video games at his brothers, concerts) I just wish he would settle the fuck down and grow up and take on the father role like a typical parent would.

I am a lost I suppose.
I met a guy online who I became great friends with. We would play daily and chat together and either the occasional playful teasing which we bigger knew it was a joke. Though until he had admitted his feelings for me and I didn’t reciprocate them but I feel bad. So things started escalating firstly when he started unwanted pictures and telling me it’s a joke. I told him how it made me uncomfortable I was but he kept going but he suddenly apologized on day which made me confused but I accepted it. I decided to give them a second chance and that’s when they confessed to me. When I first reacted I was shocked but all he did do weird sexual things sometimes. What I learned was he was recently broken up with someone and was looking for someone new. So I said immediately no because he didn’t love me, he was just desperate and just wanted something else out of me and not genuine love. He keeps saying he’ll wait for me no matter what but I keep telling him no. I don’t think I can keep this up he said it was fine being friends but it’s gonna end up hurting him more.He keeps trying to cross the boundaries and I’m getting tired of it. Even with our normal conversations it always ends up with him saying he loves me or accidentally calling me babe.

Their was another boy in our Village who always tried to flirt with her and later i got to know from her bestfriend that they were in a relationship before she got in a relationship with me and when I used to ask her she told me that she isn't and all.

But now let's just say i was in an unofficial relationship with her and it was kinda toxic. She was always buzy and i used to ask her to talk to me more cause we rarely talked then she went on a date with some friend of hers without telling me and they held hands and all she explained why and all but i was the one who found all this but i still love her and now she said she won't ditch her parents cause we are kinda connected to each other by family so our parents won't approve my father even said I would rather kill myself then seeing this marriage or something. I don't know guys now she dumped me cause i wasn't showing her the ss of her friends and my chats and said we can be friends.

Her bestfriend told me she isn't the good girl everyone thinks she is so there's that but i still want to change her and now that she has dumped me i just want to focus on myself so that I can ask her again ki please be with me and all.

Some background: he keeps plush animals that resemble passed pets, his birthday is coming up, he always says his birthday was ignored as a kid because it's so close to Christmas, and he doesn't yet have a plush animal of his most recently departed cat he's talked to me about at length before. I asked for a photo of this deceased pet ""for a surprise"" (we'd just been talking about his birthday,) aka to hand-dye accurate markings onto a plush I was planning on gifting him.

Extremely stupid but equally important detail: he texted me ""butt"" just before this. Just ""butt."" I said ""you're a butt :P"" before asking for photos of the cat a few hours later.

He replied to ""you're a butt"" instead of my question. That was fine, I just went along with the joke while trying to prompt him to answer; ""Not sending me pics of Chip [the cat] for my present for you is proof enough 😤""

Apparently this was interpreted as me making a joke about his dead cat. I told him that I understand it's a sensitive topic, that I can see how he could've taken it that way, then explained (or, re-explained?) my intent of only wanting to move past the ""butt"" thing and get the photos to make his present. He essentially stated he doesn't give a shit and only cares how he feels, then told me to ""shut up before I change my mind about you.""

I love him (he also won't let me say/tell him that) but I don't really want to stand for being illogically berated and told to ""shut up"" by someone I'm in a relationship with.

Unfortunately haha when he was opening his contacts, I saw another contact name with super flirty emojis. I blurted “oh c’mon.”

He stared at the contact for a second and said oh, yes, I did date her last year. I asked if we can delete the emojis at least and he deleted her whole contact. I said if our friends see these contacts pop up but they know he has a girlfriend, they’ll think poorly of him. 

Then he looked upset and told me that I don’t trust him but he never did anything wrong, and he asked me if I had something he can’t see on my phone and that’s why I’m suspicious about things like this. I said no, I think it’s reasonable to be shocked that your boyfriend has flirty emoji contact names. He kind of agreed but was clearly still upset. He asked if I am that kind of toxic jealous girlfriend and I said, you know me better than that. 

I’d love advice for how to help him feel like I do trust him. I do, I was just jealous.

I (30F) have been with my now ex (27M) for a little over a year. We have been in the same friend group for over 4 years but were never close before we started dating.

I had been wanting to date this man since I've known him : I have always been attracted to him physically and to his personality. When finally ended up being single at the same time last year and started sleeping together / dating. It was a time in both our lives where we had time for each other as it was our last semester at university.

Everything was amazing. We had time for each other, our sex life was the best I've ever had by far, we had fun. Everything was moving quickly : he told me he loved me and wanted to be exclusive a little before a month together. We moved in together after around 6 months and were happy living together until recently. 

During that time , he was starting his thesis working from home and I had a new job mostly remote as well. We would spend our lunch period together and most of our free time. We saw family a lot and friends too. I got overwhelmed by work because some people were leaving without getting replaced and I was more stressed. He got a part-time job. We weren't spending as much time together but I mean we were still together a lot. I was happy and he looked happy too.

This went on pretty much the same until this September, when he went back to study on campus. I was taking a graduate course as well but working almost full time, so we really wouldn't see each other as much. He started to get involved in student activities from the get go, think parties and such. 

At the first event we met a new student (F21) ""Sarah"". From the looks of it she seemed very interested in him, but I just thought it was cute that a younger student would be interested, I didn't feel very threatened. I even joked about it to my boyfriend saying she wanted him. He didn't react much. 

So anyway he ended up cheating on me with her. I found out looking through his phone (we had an open phone agreement that none of us were using). He had some weird non explicit exchanges but when I saw she told him she loved him I understood that it couldn't be innocent (if that matters he didn't say it back, I'm not sure if it's better or worse). He admitted to sleeping with her on two occasions. According to the messages they would also spend a lot of time at university together and he admitted to making out with her in his office (I find all of this super pervy). 

I was shocked because I trusted him not to cheat, I thought maybe a small crush and then we'd talk about it. I still have trouble believing that he ruined our relationship for sex, though I think he might be more emotionally involved than he let on. 

He was very apologetic, said he felt bad (but not enough to let me know instead of having to find out through messages). I wanted to stay because I love him so much but honestly I can't do it and don't want to stay anymore. 

During the time I was trying to make it work I kept on asking why he would do it but he couldn't say anything other than I'm sorry I hurt you, I wish I could take it back. He was sad I broke up, he says he really wanted to stay with me. I'm not sure what to understand from this. 

I can't expect closure from him, I'm not convinced that he has the maturity to admit it to himself, yet alone telling me why he did it. I don't know how to move on. I feel like I need an answer but I will never get it. I'm looking for advice on how to move on, on why someone would cheat in a relationship that seems to go well.

But she does do some questionable things that I am unsure if she is completely aware about. For starters, in college I had two really close girlfriends (her being one of them, let’s call her banana and my other friend Apple) and my friend Apple recently got out of a long term relationship that left her heartbroken and banana only met apples boyfriend through Apple but after Apple and her boyfriend broke up banana decided to maintain that friendship even though I told her I thought she shouldn’t and it was a little weird (she didn’t view it that way, she said that Apple now ex boyfriend was a really cool person and they became friends now) so fast forward Apple is completely healed and happy and in a new relationship and banana is still friends with Apple ex boyfriend. Another example, is that banana bestfriend (literal childhood bestfriend let’s call her mango) mango also got out of a long term serious relationship where she thought he was going to be the one and mango was very sad about it but banana still chooses to be friends with mango ex boyfriend even though she knows mango feels weird about it (but to my knowledge they never had a convo about it). Now fast forward I am in a serious relationship where I am finding myself feeling very weird about how banana is being towards my boyfriend. Like she texted him after we hosted a joint celebration but she never mentioned to any one of us or me that she did that when we tell each other everything in the debrief. She tells people that he is her cousin when they haven’t even hung out 10 times (just using my fingers as reference). I hope we never break up but I feel like if we did she would want to maintain friendships with him which would 100% hurt me because I feel like as a girls girl why does banana care so much to maintain a friendship with these people.

why i think im being love bombed is that:
1. he said i l*ve you to me too fast and i had no choice so i just said it back 
2. couple days later he asked me to be his girlfriend and this happened way too soon
3.he’s really attached like he’d call me every day and night and leave college early to call me 
4. he told his friends about me and kisses me over the phone in front of his friends 
5.drunk calls me which is fine but still idk if thats love bombing or not
5. planned his future with me but it might’ve been my fault cus i accidentally said something in the moment but he kept saying id be a good mom and imagine how cute our kids would be 
5.he compliments me a lot and checks up on me all the time and has been there for me during my hardest times even though he barely knew
6. he said it feels destined
7. we have nicknames for each other
8. he showed me his n*des and is always showing me photos of himself or the stuff he does which can be cute at times but sometimes its like i don’t know anything about him nor he doesn’t know anything about me but at the same time i do know everything about him if that makes sense
9.he posted me on his story, not my face but something i was showing
10. sometimes the conversation is always about him and it always redirects back to him in a way 
11. he initiated phone sex 
12. he calls me all the time to check up on me and make sure taken my meds/ate/drank water/ etc 


and all this happened in the span of a month and hes is honestly so sweet like he is always reassuring me and even when he asked me to be his gf he asked me multiple times if thats okay or if he pressured me into saying yes. furthermore i think im over thinking cus it is LDR so maybe he finds the need to constantly reassure me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7553548,public,self,are these signs of love bombing?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvqb74/are_these_signs_of_love_bombing/,all_ads,6,,,

She can be verbally abusive and doesn’t show any interest in anything I do. She shuns most physical affection and spends most of the time with our kids, leaving me alone to do whatever around the house. 

I didn’t really notice this until I met a girl online in a game I played. She has depression, suicidal tendencies, adhd and was dating another girl in this same game. After getting to know her I realized I suffered from depression and didn’t know it, so I started going to counseling. Working through that I realized I struggled with some abandonment issues from my childhood and my wife not spending anytime with me didn’t help with it. 

I tried to talk with my wife and she said I was being stupid and told me I’d better not try to get her into marriage counseling. We separated for now and fast forward a couple months and my friend broke up with her girlfriend. The girlfriend was actually a cis male, that wanted to transition but never did. So the boyfriend here was pretty abusive to her, calling her names and yelling at her all the time. She said that was pretty typical of most relationships she’s been in.

So my friend has always cared about what’s going on with me, she split her time between her boyfriend and I, and was super engaged in wanting to hang out and do things. It made me feel wanted, something I haven’t had for years. When her boyfriend broke up with her, her and I started slowly becoming more than friends. We never we really officially said “hey should we date?”, it just kind of happened. 

At this point I’ve known her for about 6 months and we’ve dated about 4 weeks. This last weekend she messaged me that she had done something really bad and needed to talk to me about it. So we did talked and she shared she’s not a cis female like I thought, she’s transitioning into a female. I love this girl a lot, she got me through a rough period in my life, she filed a hole I’ve had for years. I went from contemplating if my life has any worth and why I should stay alive, to not being able to wait for the next day to start when I can see her and hanging it again. 

This revaluation of hers though hurts deep. For all this time she never said anything to me. I know she was abused in the past and she said a lot of the abuse was because she was transitioning. So I understand why she was scared to tell me. Now though I’m stuck in a position of really loving this girl but not being attracted to a non-cis female. I tried to watch a lot of porn of women who still have their dicks and it was a turn off for me. I support her 100% in this transition but now when I talk to her I just think of the fact she’s not CIS and it makes me uncomfortable because I’m not attracted non-cis women.  

I told her tonight I felt really bothered that she led me on for so long. She asked if I wanted to go back to being friends and I said yes. She asked why and I don’t know how to answer that without making her feel like shit. I don’t want to say I’m not attracted to you anymore because you still have a specific body part. It will make her feel shitty, based on how the conversation went tonight. 

How do I let her down without coming off as “ewww” to her? I love her a lot but can’t see myself getting over having been lied to for so longer and her yet to have all of the procedure’s she needs. 

I know this will reopen the hole she helped fill, which saddens me.

Well, I have been playing the piano since I was a little girl. We have a piano at our house, I play it a lot for him. He’ll request certain songs and I’ll play for him whenever I can. His favorite is peanuts (he calls it the Charlie Brown song)

Earlier today, he said there’s something he wanted to show me. He said “I’m gonna play a song for you now” He went to the piano and started just banging the keys. Like, he wasn’t even close to playing anything near a song. It was obvious to me he was just kidding. I laughed and he turned around and smiled and asked if I think it’s good. I laughed and said no. He started crying and ran upstairs into our room. I’ve never seen him cry before.

I then poked around our iPad we have on the piano for sheet music and saw a ton of piano tutorials. I figured out that for the last few weeks, he had been trying to learn piano to try to surprise me one day. Today he gained the confidence and courage to play in front of me and I laughed at his hard work.

I seriously don’t know if I can live with myself. I’ve been considering suicide for the last few hours. He hasnt left our room. He’s just been playing his video games.

Before we started dating, he told me he cheated on his last girlfriend of 3 years. Obviously a huge red flag and something that made me hesitate big time, but he didn't make excuses for himself and told me he felt genuine remorse that he did it and it wouldn't happen again. I also asked him if he would be willing to go to counseling for it and he said yes, so we started dating. Something we both have in common is rOCD. Typically for me, rOCD manifested in wondering if the relationship or person was right for me to the point of panic attacks, but for him it was, ironically, fear of his partner cheating. Anyway, weird things happened lately. He was on his phone and flipped through reddit briefly and I saw for a split second an image of a naked girl. I asked him what it was and he showed me. pretty much his entire life timeline consisted of porn. that made me freak out a little, only because also at the beginning of the relationship he asked me if I would be okay with porn and I said no, at least not yet. he explained it was an old account that he was willing to sign out of or delete and I said okay. Another night he had a weird porn-looking tab open on his computer so I asked him what it was and he showed me and it was an anime first-person porn site i guess, he claimed his friend shared it on discord because he thought it was funny. One night I asked for the password for his computer so I could go on it for a second and he was weird about it. He's been spending time with his friends a lot more lately which made me a little anxious. I went though who he follows on Instagram and found a girl who looked a lot like me but that posted a lot of revealing pictures. I confronted him about that and he said he didn't know who I was talking about and he followed a lot of people but that he could try to find them and unfollow them. Anyway, after all of this lately I've understandably had a gut feeling something was wrong but I have pretty bad anxiety so I can't always trust my gut. But it was eating at me, and near the beginning of the relationship he asked to look through my phone, so I thought it was fair I ask at least once. He has multiple VPN's and privacy apps so I don't even know to what extent this has been going on, but all of his Instagram suggested reels were porn videos. I found he has a private tiktok account following a lot of e-girls. I found he messaged ""What's up"" at 5 am to a random girl when we were dating. I found he has was talking to a random girl on Snapchat less than seven weeks ago with messages turned off after 24 hours. And the Cherry On Top™️ is his recently deleted photos were locked. I asked if he could sign into his phone again and saw a video of him stroking himself and several pictures of nudes from other girls. It seems blatantly obvious he was cheating???? right??? but he claims he was not cheating, he was just looking, and he took the video of himself to boost his ego. Even if that is true and he didn't cheat on me, he lied about not watching porn. Fucking big time. He finally told me he's had a porn addiction since he was 12 years old. I don't understand why he wouldn't tell me that before we started dating or anytime after I said I wasn't okay with it. He says he'll do anything to fix it, including using a shared computer, having locks off his phone, and going to counseling (which I asked him to do 11 months ago). But how in hell could I ever trust him again? I already struggle with rOCD and self-image issues, so me trying to help him would be at the cost of my own mental health and well-being. Writing all of this, I realize I sound so stupid. But I'm so fucking scared because I love him so much. I wanted to marry him.

Though, we couldn't afford a wedding so his family doesn't really treat me... like family.

ANYWAY, at the last family event, a very traumatic situation went down. The best way to summarize it: his family has been taught to deal with problems immediately. There is no stepping back and calming down. You can and will be verbally assaulted until someone makes it physical... and then it gets physical.

My husband grew up this way. I think he felt a sense of safety and learned how to communicate while being with me. When that situation went down, and he calmed his voice and asked politely to take a step back from the situation, all hell broke loose. MIL's sis put her hands on him, and he has touch-reactive PTSD. To this day, I feel awful. He was so safe, and we communicate so well. It feels like everything we learned was thrown in his face. 

He has only cried in front of me twice. That night, he broke down crying in front of me and his brother. He doesn't talk about that night. I NEED to talk about it because I'm scared to go to their place for thanksgiving. I haven't been able to fall asleep for days now because I panic when alone with my thoughts.

I never, ever want to be in that situation again. And I'm fucking terrified it will happen again. 

A couple notes:
1. Yes, we can just not show up if they're there. But husband wants to show up, so we're gonna try to be there when they aren't.
2. If something happens again, as the situation didn't even start with my husband involved, we have to go get his brother. They've been through thick and thin, and I'm close with his brother as well. Brother is a minor and MIL has been reckless with drugs again (weed &amp; shes on probation), so she'll let us take him or we'll call the police

I'm not scared of hurting his family, provided they attack first, to protect my husband or BIL

What I'm scared of, since I'm not really family anyway, is that I will completely fuck over my husband's family relations and I just won't be allowed to be around. Which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't so harmful to him

And, yes, it would be awesome if he could cut contact with them. That's not my choice, though. And I know his mom will target me over anyone else because that's what happened last time. She blamed me for the entire situation when all I did is tell her to leave my husband alone because he was literally breaking down crying.

And recently my sis was moving out of country for the very first time so i asked my gf to book tickets for me and my sis is the first person who is going in plane for the first time so i have zero experience in this that's y i called my gf many times to ask about the rules what to carry ajd what to not carry, and each time I called for this she got annoyed on the day my sis was leaving there had to be done online boarding which i had not done before so i didnt know so i asked my gf to do it from me but she refused to do it , she said she is having bad times . I was like okii at least tell me what is bad happening but she never told. 

Then just after this in 2 days i was packing my things to get it to my home town, i had few things which i didn't want to get to hometown like a dolls which were gifts from her to me and mine to her, (both were kept at my home only and they are very big and total of 5 dolls out of which one was gifted to me by her and the other 4 i gifted to her). I asked to come to my home and take them and go and keep it with her till i come because i didn't want to carry them to home town . She said yes when she had meet me 2 days before but later on the day i was leaving at the last min she denied and gave reason that her fish were not feeling good tahts y she was feeling bad and she cant come that too last min she was like u come and give me my mom was with me and we had no time to go to her room and give tahts y i had asked her to come and take them . 

Then there is a game which we used to play together couple (it is not couple game it is team game of 5 ) she ranked up and i didn't , yesterday I found out that she removed me from her friends list and still kept my friend in her friend list. 

Then since I am waiting to join i am getting very anxious so i am applying to many companies but i am unable to get anywhere that's y i got disappointed and not worked on my resume from many days, she offered me that she will ask her manager about job in her company but she needed my resume i told her I had to correct it but i didn't do it but if she wants old one she can take it from drive , each time she asked me to send it i said i didn't work on it and she just left it at that . 

The yesterday when we had a fight she made fun of me not having vehicle during our engeneering while her friends bf had vehicle this topic she has said to me like 100s of times now , i didn't have vehicle because it was college and i lived 5min away from it so did she . There was no difficult in walking to college that's y i didnt have vehicle and if we had to go some where we could rent it , which i did when ever it was necessary i did rent . She made fun of this . And then to top it all she said that it is not her mistake that i didn't get any company because i spent the time playing games whole that's not the truth . I have been working but still she said that it is my mistake that i don't have a job .

So she died from an overdose on the 29th and my bf A, told me her father reached out to him to let him know that she was in the hospital on a ventilator..

They dated for three ish / four years, and broke up in 2016ish. She broke up with him to see other people and to sell her body, unfortunately for drugs. And while he dated other girls since their breakup. They both were very active on each others social media. Like she liked every picture or status he posted, except for ones with me in it. And he liked all of her things on her fb page. ALSO-We’ve been dating since Jan/Feb of 2021, and he never wanted to be Facebook official..If you go to my profile and read my previous posts, I explained why I thought it was weird and got mad at him. But please don’t think I’m an awful person, I was angry when I wrote that 😞 

I recently watched little black book, if you haven’t seen that movie. It’s when a GF of a guy gets to know his exes, and his current gf realizes one of his exes is the person he’s supposed to be with— not her.

And that’s how I feel about my bf and his ex. They had a whirlwind relationship full of festivals, concerts, and a lot a lot of drugs. Drugs were a big part in their relationship and he even shot her up after they broke up. Luckily he’s a nurse and had narcan etc to make sure she wouldn’t od, but it’s still kind of sick imo….But my bf had been sober from alcohol for 2 years and been clean of drugs for 4 years, he takes his recovery seriously and I admire him for it. I’m in recovery too, and I just got 100 days but I’m scared to tell him my sober time because then he will know I relapsed. It’s very hard for me to be vulnerable to him.

Basically, I know I’m crazy and I need therapy, but I’m so jealous of the time she spent with him and the times they did drugs together. That makes me want to see that side of him. I know it’s wrong and I hate how much I feel insecure, but I just need to talk to someone, because I’m scared to bring this and how I’m feeling up to him..",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7553475,public,self,Am I crazy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvq0dd/am_i_crazy/,all_ads,6,,,

We hit it off and fell in love super quickly. We went super fast, hurt each other on the way, but we were determined to make it work. We both have such a strong drive to find our soulmate that we’ve stayed together even through extremely rough periods. 

Unfortunately, I’ve grown detached from him and I’ve been so conflicted on breaking up with him. I broke up with him after he was mad at me and not speaking with me. Him being mad at me wasn’t the reason I broke up with him, but I was able to think clearly during that time we didn’t speak. 

I thought about how we have nothing in common interest wise. How we go into our offices after work and do things by ourselves. How it felt like just having a roommate instead of a partner to do things with. We couldn’t even watch tv shows or movies. It’s been so depressing going through apps looking at tv shows and adding them to a list of shows I’d want to save to watch with him. Just for him to never have interest in watching things with me. This was a big one for me because I feel like tv is pivotal to any relationship (not literally but it’s a big want for me). It’s just A bunch of things that we don’t have in common made me reconsider wanting to be with him forever. 

I kept thinking about all of the things that I really dislike about us. I thought about the times when we have s*x and he’s too tired from work to keep it up or he’s psyching himself out or he’s already relieved himself multiple times that day. He can’t stay hard or it takes him forever to finish. It hit me that he probably isn’t as sexually attracted to me as he once was when we first got together (I’ve gained some weight (thin to chunky) so I’d assume that’s the reason). I have brought it up before and it just made him feel insecure, so I don’t plan to do it again. But I still feel like I want to be wanted sexually.

Additionally, we have had a huge amount of mental struggles to the point where we’re exhausted. I mostly feel that he is exhausted mentally when it comes to my feelings. He tends to go numb when it comes to overwhelming feelings, whereas I tend to get overwhelmed and shut down mentally. At first, he would try to help me feel better and push that I see a doctor for depression medication. Over time, He pushed his own mental battles aside to try to help me and ended up exhausting himself. He wouldn’t tell me when he was feeling overwhelmed, but blamed me for mentally exhausting him because I didn’t care about his mental battles. I feel like he never expressed when he was upset and when he did I tried my best to help. Well, now if I am feeling overwhelmed, he leaves me alone. I’ve expressed to him how much it would help to have some physical affection, but he just says that he’s exhausted trying to help me and needs to help himself. I understand helping yourself, but I’ve asked to be included in his mental struggles and I’ve asked for help. I’ve pushed down the feeling and thoughts that he isn’t my soulmate and I should break up with him. 

It’s mostly those three things as to why I don’t want to date him anymore. Normally it would be an easy decision to break up, but there are many tricky factors. 
- I don’t hate him and I still find him attractive, but I feel like I want better for me (I’ve started to daydream of my soulmate) and him (due to it appearing he lacks attraction towards me)
- We just moved 1400 miles in August for a job after graduation (mine). We put so much into the move and I feel so shitty breaking up with him after he did so much by moving with me.
- We have a 12 month apartment lease with about 9 months left. I have trouble now when I’m around him and we’d have to go through that for at least 9 months. Awkward…
- He’s such a good person. He’s helped me financially, mentally, etc. He’s a great guy, but I don’t think he’s my soulmate.
- He took care of me while I finished school and I planned to do the same for him so he can finish school once I got my degree/career. I feel shitty for wanting to break up after he’s done so much for me. 

I have come to believe that we have the patience and drive to stay through the hard parts of relationships, but we aren’t each others soulmates. I think we want to settle down instead of no commitment, but I don’t see a future with him anymore as my husband. I’m so conflicted with staying broken up. He’s been asking if I’m positive I want to break up and he seems hopeful (almost confident) that I’ll get back with him. I want to end things definitively but don’t know if I’m justified or doing the right thing. I care about him and just want us both to be happy. I’m not happy with him. I feel that if I push these feelings down, they are going to come back later. I just don’t want to waste each others time and I think we’d be happier with someone else. So… 
- I don’t see these three main things as things we just need to work on for us both to be happy. I feel like you can’t change your attraction, I’ve tried to improve us mentally to no avail, and you can’t change your interests (they can change over time but you can’t force it). I feel like I’ve lost the motivation to continue trying with this relationship and I don’t know if I should stay broken up with him. Especially because of everything he’s done for me. It doesn’t feel fair to him.
- He keeps bringing up that we could get friends to fill the void of no common interests. I don’t know if I should tell him the other reasons for me wanting to see other people.
