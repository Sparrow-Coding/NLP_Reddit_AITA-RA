His parents occasionally send him small amounts of money for necessities. He chooses to spend ~90% of this money on weed rather than paying me back or lowering his own debts. When employed in the past, he did actively pay me back as much as his salary afforded, but this has not translated to the small ‚Äúsalary‚Äù his parents grant him (they may send $50/100, etc.)

I have not been able to come to terms with the fear I have of letting go. We spend most of everyday together as I WFH. The thought of him no longer a part of my life immensely saddens me, but his behavior patterns give me no hope for having a stable family in the future.

After she left, I apologized to her over text later that night and told her how I was so sorry I treated her and how I handled our relationship, and that I hoped she could us another chance after time had passed and that I could prove that I'm worthy of her trust.

 Will this friendship turn to love?

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èSome facts that emerged through research may be mentioned.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èA boy and a girl cannot remain just friends for long.  Especially in adolescence and early adulthood.  Mere love does not last more than four months.  If you like it for longer than that, it will turn into love.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you look at your face regularly for at least 10 minutes a day and say only good things, then the person likes you.

 If you have to touch your hands or body for more than 20 seconds, the trust between you will increase a lot.  There may be less physical pain.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you imitate that person or like their voice, you already like them.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èOnce you fall in love with someone, it becomes difficult to see him as a friend. Then you can't get rid of the memories of love. When you fall in love, you get a special energy..

 ‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you are more than 20 years of age and experience heartbreak

For simplicity's sake I will refer to my SO as Z.

Z and I were together for 7 years, we broke up and went 2 years without contacting each other and after talking for about a year we somehow ended up getting back together.

When we broke up, my mother ended up really disliking Z after seeing how upset the breakup got me. Told me how she doesn't want to see Z again in her home because of how bad she hurt her only son. When I started talking to Z again I mentioned it to my mother and she immediately started talking in a negative tone.

What I'd like some advice for is this: Z wants me to let my mother know that I'm back with her and that we're engaged. I honestly don't want to because unfortunately I still live with my mother and I am pretty confident that if I tell her she'll never stop talking about it, she'll be constantly be bringing up the things that happened in the past and constantly be asking me what if she hurts me again, or bringing up the fact that Z and I don't even have a place of our own so why are we engaged.

I honestly do not understand why the hell this is even important, but Z really wants this for whatever goddamn reason. The only outcome I see in telling my mother is only my life getting more stressed out. Z's life won't be changed at all, only mine since I live with my mother. I'll have to deal with constant quips and attempted lectures.

I'm just going to start by telling a quick story, recently I lost my car in a car crash, insurance paid out, no problem, I'm ok with all my parts. Sadly that means well I don't have a car. Not a problem since I live in a big ass city with a lot of public transport, and I can take Uber whenever I please since my parents subsidise some stuff. So thankfully it's been ok.

Enter my dream car, after almost 5y of saving and working(250 a month+/-) I can finally buy a MX 5 ND, I just need a 5k loan for it, and I can pay it. My parents told me Im paying for everything since theyre not happy Im getting that car.

Now that loan means cutting costs, and I told my gf that. I will not be able to afford a ton of stuff, like going to restaurants, movie tickets, Uber eats and the like. Basically leisure stuff, I can still afford school stuff and the basics since my parents pay as long as I get good grades. Obv they dont pay for me and my gf.

Now heres the problem, I told my girfriend (of 2yrs) I was going to have to cut costs way way down and that until I pay it all, we may need to go low budget for a while. Maybe if we want to eat a dessert we can cook it together in my house. If we want to go to the movies. Perhaps we watch it in her house and I bring snacks over. Gifts? Maybe lets go with something handmade since I cant buy a ton of stuff. Sushi for dinner? Welll maybe lets go eat tacos with lime water. Basically lets try to budget these things. I hoped for her to be understanding and tell me its ok since its only temporary and well its my literal dream and I still tried the hardest to be a good boyfriend.

Her response?

""No, I want you to have money to treat me like a gentleman, I want you to have the money to spend on something like a dessert or a nice day out. Maybe fix your situation before dating a woman.""

Its to note that my family is very well off, and Ive always been thankful. My gf is from one of the poorest places in the country, her family isnt poor per se, but they arent definitely well off or anywhere near that. And she has told me in the past she cant afford to buy me a videogame (60$) because its to expensive and she has expenses.  


Is there a way to talk this out? What do I do?

I‚Äôve had a girlfriend (21nb) for 2 months now, it‚Äôs going very well and is looking like it‚Äôs going to be a long term commitment. 
My parents know I‚Äôm a lesbian but they don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm non-binary. I‚Äôve also left an abusive marriage with a cis man this year and are in the middle of a divorce. They have made it clear to my brother ‚ÄúBob‚Äù (23M) who is bi that were he to date someone they didn‚Äôt approve of he could not visit them with his partner. They also are not allowing our younger siblings who are minors (5 of them) have any extended interaction with Bob for fear that he will ‚Äúendanger their souls with sinful beliefs‚Äù. Bob recently told them he was no longer practicing any sort of faith or religion. 

I‚Äôm also no longer religious but my parents do not know this. So as of right now I can spend unlimited time with my younger siblings without suspicion. My parents think that, even though I‚Äôm gay, since in their mind I‚Äôm still Christian, I would not corrupt their kids or date any non cis man. 
I would like to not feel like I‚Äôm living a lie around them though, and be myself. But I‚Äôm worried about my younger siblings still at home. I really want to continue being a loving and accepting presence in their lives. 

I‚Äôm thinking about coming out to my parents about my gender identity, relationship, and freedom from oppressive religion. But when I do I would like to have some written down boundaries - for both me and them - to start with so that when the conversation inevitably turns to how we will move forward, I have something to work with. 

What sort of things should I request from them? I‚Äôm thinking something like, I‚Äôll respect their religious practices and beliefs when we are together if they respect my personhood and the names/pronouns of me and my loved ones when we are together. That might be impossible tbh. I‚Äôm also thinking about sharing that I know what will be said about me when I‚Äôm not there (because of other family members in similar spots) and ask that they answer questions about me from their perspective but also let me answer the same question from my perspective. That also might be impossible. 
I‚Äôm also thinking about talking to my siblings individually before I talk to my parents. They are 8, 10, 13, 15, and 17. The 17 year old already knows I‚Äôm gay and wants to be in my life no matter what. It‚Äôs the 4 younger kids that I don‚Äôt really know how or when to approach. 

I almost want to suggest family therapy but that‚Äôs a lot of people and I‚Äôm not sure how that would work? That‚Äôs probably not covered by insurance anyway. And my parents would only want to go to a non affirming counselor anyway.

I have bipolar2, manic depression, agoraphobia, social and general anxiety. Husband has ADHD/OCD, depression and anxiety. I give that info to maybe explain our mental states a bit. We're both on medications.

&amp;#x200B;

Been married for over 3 years.  It's definitely been a rollarcoaster. We've been stressed the past few months with jobs, rent increasing and just little emergencies all at once, but my meds were working until suddenly they weren't. I think it's a stress thing. I had so much going on that I didn't have time to be really stressed until it was over, so now it's all hitting me at once. 

When I get manic, I typically spend a lot, depending on how far the mania goes. It's a scale and usually it's been manageable with meds and trying to eat better/communicate. But it hit harder than normal and I wasn't prepared for it. One of our things is that before I buy something, I have to tell him first before I click checkout or whatever. And this week, I didn't.

 I bought groceries and things needed for a new job (like steel toed boots) and he's pissed. He doesn't like when someone breaks a promise, and I get that. A lot of our money troubles were my fault as he's way more frugal than I am. We have a budget though and I stick to it with the exception of a little more(like 20/30 dollars) if we need more for an occasion or something like that. 

And I'm frustrated. I've just shut down on him and don't know how to communicate properly and that gets him upset as well. I KNOW we need to talk but we mostly go in circles when it comes to this. He was sleeping so I went ahead and ordered our groceries since if we didn't order soon, we wouldn't get the food today and I officially start the new job tomorrow.

And that's the other part. He's had a spotty work record and stopped his last job in July/August. We'll both be starting this new job together and I took the 12hour shifts so we could be on the same schedule even though I know it'll physically be torture for a month. And I know it's supposed to be 'our' money but a petty part of me doesn't want him to tell me when I can buy something when it comes to situations like this. And since his job history has been spotty, I don't trust that he'll keep this job and it's making me more stressed. 

I know I'm in a manic episode since I'm fighting the urge to run away and move somewhere else and start over, but I can't tell if I'm thinking rationally over this. I'm mad that he's mad at me and feel stupid for that.

&amp;#x200B;

And because I don't like just mentioning the bad, he's a good person. He makes me laugh and when I get sick, he stays up the whole night with me. When I had to get all my top teeth removed and get dentures, he was there and taking care of me and still tells me I'm beautiful. There's more but that's a little bit of it.

It's my first relationship and I always thought looks don't matter  because I will eventually find him good looking when I love him. 
The problem is I still do not find him physically attractive. I never look at him and think he is good looking and I keep noticing things I want to change about his style. I really do want to love him for the person he is right now but I cannot control it. It really makes me feel like a terrible person. 
To find a potential solution, I asked if I could style his hair for the day and I found him way more attractive with a different hairstyle. I know it's selfish and rude to want to change someone's appearance so that I find them attractive so I feel very conflicted.
I'm not sure what I'm feeling is normal-to love someone without finding them physically attractive. 
I also don't know if I would be crossing the line if I ask him to change his style a certain way. I don't think he is ugly it's just that he is accentuating his ""flaws"" and not showcasing his best features.

Me (25f) and my bf (27m) have been together for about a year. We‚Äôve had little tiffs here and there, but nothing major.

A few days ago we went out drinking with friends, and I drank a lot. It wasn‚Äôt planned, but usually I‚Äôm okay when I drink and can be a lot of fun. I don‚Äôt drink very often. 

When we got home (we live together), we got into a massive fight. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt even remember it. My bf was slightly drunk, but not blackout like me so he told me what happened. He told me the fight was just about stupid stuff (mostly drunken stubbornness), that I was up in his personal space because I wanted to talk while he wanted to go to bed, I apparently shoved him (he was not hurt) and I was swearing and things. Basically acting a fool. 

This isn‚Äôt like me at all. I never ever thought I would be aggressively physical with him or ever call him names. I‚Äôm always good with choosing my words because I don‚Äôt want to regret anything. 

The next day we talked about it and he said he was disappointed by how I was acting but he knows that‚Äôs not who I am. He tried to give me some reassurance. I promised this wouldn‚Äôt happen again, and he says he believes me and trusts that it won‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve just been feeling like shit about it. He‚Äôs been a little off since then, and I brought it up again and he just had gotten annoyed that I keep trying to talk about it. He says he just wants to move on, past is in the past. 

I worry that there‚Äôs more to the story that is bothering him, but he won‚Äôt tell me in an attempt to protect me from myself, because I am quite hard on myself. 

Do I just take his word for it and let it go? I have learned my lesson. But I want to know the reality of the situation incase he‚Äôs more hurt than he‚Äôs actually letting on.

I‚Äôve been really excited about a woman that I‚Äôve been talking to for over 8 months. 
We have known each other for over 3 years‚Ä¶ both really like eachother‚Ä¶ but things have gone from 100 to zero all of a sudden‚Ä¶ leading hot to our first actual date.

We had our very first date last Saturday. One week ago‚Ä¶ It was great but something weird shifted in her leading up to the date‚Ä¶. And I can‚Äôt figure it out.

Our connection has grown steadily stronger over time. We seem perfect for eachother. But each time we set a date‚Ä¶. Inevitably‚Ä¶ just before we meet‚Ä¶ she gets scared and pulls back. 

This has happened like 6 times‚Ä¶ a couple times in the very beginning‚Ä¶ winter 2021 and spring of 2022. It was never a good time for a date because she was too busy with work or other absolutely reasonable and real reasons.

I think we set up one coffee date and canceled last minute due to her plans shifting or something.

Then we decided we would wait until summer when my kids arrive. She loves them and wanted to visit them.

Then when the time came and went I asked her what was up and she said she thought she could visit but when the time came she just couldn‚Äôt face it because her ex lived in the very small town where I live. He‚Äôs around all the time. I bump into him often so her fear of bumping into him is legit. 

Then we set up a date a week or two later but her escrow closed on her new house‚Ä¶ and then she became all consumed with that for a while‚Ä¶ weeks‚Ä¶

Then we set up another date‚Ä¶ 
In a shotgun kind of way. I was being a bit pushy. And she agreed to see me. Then I didn‚Äôt bring it up the week of the date‚Ä¶ for fear that she would back out.. and on the night before the date I asked where she might like to go. She acted taken by surprise and said she couldn‚Äôt make it on short notice. Then offered to meet up the following day. But then her mom scheduled lunch and dinner for the family.

All of her reasons were legitimate and I was completely understanding but it added up to a pattern of her not following through.

Fast forward‚Ä¶

About a month ago ‚Ä¶ in a playful way‚Ä¶ I confronted her about not meeting me and how it felt and how I needed us to actually have a first date or move on. We played around with some ideas then agreed to book tickets to a show in December.

Then 2 weeks ago before I left town to visit my daughter for her birthday we agreed to a date sooner. Last week.

Our connection has been growing and growing. Stronger and stronger. Texting all day every day. Talking on the phone every other day.

Then she became a bit upset that I stayed in the same house as my ex fir my daughter‚Äôs birthday. We talked about it and maintained our connection.

And then when I returned she began pulling back. As the 1st in person date approached.

And then as I feared‚Ä¶ at 2pm when we were scheduled to meet at 7pm she asked to postpone to the following weekend‚Ä¶. When she knew I‚Äôd be in CA. She said that she was overly tired (I believe her) and also said that she wasn‚Äôt ready and things were moving too fast‚Ä¶

We have been talking for about a year now‚Ä¶ texting almost daily for 8 months‚Ä¶.
Have expressed very deep connection and feelings for one another‚Ä¶ and all of a sudden she pulls back‚Ä¶ like we have seriously discussed marriage and having children and our future lives together.

So I tell her how devastated i felt and how I felt it coming. I felt her pulling back.

And I empathized and told her to put herself and her needs first and take a breath and give me a call sometime if and when she was ready to date.

She said she felt pressured but now that I was being understanding she would take a nap and if she felt up to it would see me at 7.

We did end up meeting and the date was truly wonderful. She told me that it hurt her feelings that I thought she didn‚Äôt want to date and said that she does. 

But‚Ä¶

The connection isn‚Äôt there the way it was a week before our date.

To be honest I really really like her. But she seems so afraid that I am what she wants and she is afraid of being hurt. Or she just isn‚Äôt that into me but loves that we have all of the bond and connection of a long term relationship without any potential heartbreak because she won‚Äôt move forward.

I decided that once she started pulling back I would date other women again. To protect my heart from her yo yo ing.

But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs right either. 

TL:DR - I‚Äôm in love and i think she is too but she is acting hot and cold and i don‚Äôt know what to do.
I don‚Äôt want to be overly sensitive and emotional and needy and chase her away but I don‚Äôt want to play games and match her hot and cold.

I knew a few of the things she was doing for her party but didn‚Äôt really ask too much. Part of it was the ‚Äúcliche‚Äù bride to be and bridal party drawing the guy naked. I don‚Äôt have an issue with that, there was a stripper at the stag do so it‚Äôs pretty commonplace. I found a drawing from that night of my fianc√© who was drawn, completely naked.

I don‚Äôt know what to think. I am really shocked that she did it. It isn‚Äôt in character.

To give a little context growing up we were both immensely dorky and argued quite often but were still friends. Shortly after we met when we were 12 I found out through a friend he had a crush on me (cute little kid stuff lol nothing I thought about too much) 

As the years passed I observed him from afar and we kind of just stopped talking.
We both moved away for school and that was that. I heard about his life vaguely through other friends but I never really thought I‚Äôd see him again so we kind of just lost contact. 


Fast forward we have both moved back to our parents post-COVID and live in very close proximity to one another. 

I‚Äôve been trying to get him out of my mind because I thought I wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance with him now, since he is quite honestly super handsome and charming now (any sign of dorkage has disappeared). 

I recently reached out to him asking for his help on a shared academic interest since I‚Äôm starting my masters soon and he just finished his. 
It was something I could‚Äôve easily googled but I just needed anything to start a conversation. 
The conversation has been going well. He‚Äôs very responsive and asks me questions and gives me his opinion. We‚Äôre both very organic with each other since we‚Äôve known each other forever! 


This is where things get a little tricky for me though. I have never been in a relationship, not even close. He has had many (how should I put this) beautiful women who lust after him. I‚Äôve only heard from my friends telling me the stories the past couple of years. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he would even see me in this way, if he‚Äôs just being nice or only wants friendship. I‚Äôm being obvious *enough* throughout our texts that I‚Äôm pretty sure anybody would perceive as flirting.


My friend coined it as ‚Äúacademic sexting‚Äù lmao that‚Äôs a new one for me.

I‚Äôve never really felt this comfortable and drawn to someone but I don‚Äôt want to set myself up for failure. I‚Äôm taking things slow, giving him space, seeing where things go. But this is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt like this and it‚Äôs entirely overwhelming! 


Please give me your opinions because I‚Äôm super horrible at understanding what‚Äôs going down!

We were just friends initially fooled around a little bit I developed feelings but she was in a relationship at a time so I just dealt with it and just moved on. A year after she asked me out and I was the one who said no, since we were co-parenting a puppy at the time and I felt that would just complicate things if we were to break up. Months went on and one night we were drinking and well we ended up fooling around again and decided we should give dating a shot. It was awful truly, I don't want to get into it too much but she completely changed and started treated me pretty badly and ended up cheating on me (on Valentines day btw). Anyways I broke off all contact and moved on with my life got into a 2 and a half year long relationship and was pretty happy. I would see her regularly since we did co-own a dog but I would try to keep things polite and distant. About two years into this she reached out to me and we talked and I felt like I did back in the old days before all this romantic drama bs. We decided to give friendship another shot.  It all went good went until one night while drinking and watching a movie and we fooled around again. Before someone tells me this was inevitable she was in a relationship at the time and I was in one too (mine was an open relationship though) so I didn't think it would happen. Anyways it was very confusing she was telling me she loved me and I was pretty uncomfortable at that statement although I cant deny it was an ego boost to hear her say that after all this time and how she treated me in the past. Anyways I told her we cant let that happen again even though I was in an open relationship we shouldn't do that since she had feeling involved and we both agreed. 

Skip forward like 6 months and all was good she was seeing some guy he seemed pretty cool and I was seeing my gf until I wasn't. We broke up amicably, and she's even coming to visit me in a couple days for a month. Anyways after I broke up she broke up as well with her bf at the time. After a while we hooked up again and said we actually wanted to date each other, this lasted like a few days before she said she didn't want to see anybody right now but maybe in the future. Which I understand I do feel like we were both rushing into new things too fast. Anyways she went back to her, ex broke up with him again (turns out he wasn't such a cool guy but I'm not going to get into that as I feel like I'm rambling enough already) and we are at the present day. Now before I ask you guys for some advice I just want to clear somethings so I don't have to hear them again. 

1. I realize now I don't think she's really interested in dating me. Or if she is she changes her mind to often for me to take these feelings seriously.

2. I don't think we would make a good match anyways. After thinking about how her other relationships and my relationship with her went I can confidently say that she has a lot of growing to do in that aspect and has some toxic traits. I cant shake that feeling that I do not want to get hurt again. 

3. She is a good friend. I enjoy her company, she supports me and I support her. And I care about her. And she cares about me. So I would like to maintain that.

Now I am believer that men and women can be friends I do think they can, but its seems to get increasingly complicated between me and her and I feel like we both are getting hurt in the process. I find myself getting jealous of other men in her life which is stupid since we are not anything other than friends, when we go out with her friends I constantly get asked if I'm her boyfriend because we are very flirty and physical with each other.  How can I turn these off? LOL. I know this is not how feeling work but how can I process these feelings in a healthy way and maintain our friendship. 

TLDR: I have feeling for my bestfriend even though I know she is toxic romantically and would like to continue our friend ship.

My sister told me that my boyfriend asked my dad for his permission to propose to me at Christmas. She thinks our relationship is really weird because of stuff like this. I'm sure a lot of people on here will too, but I'm only asking you keep an open mind so the advice isn't too biased either way.

I confronted my boyfriend about this, which I kind of felt was wrong to do, but I couldn't help myself. It was the only thing I could think about. Basically, he wants to get married as soon as possible. My birthday is later than his in March, and his plan has been to work out all the wedding planning super early so we can get married a week or so after. He says that he loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me and is tired of waiting. He says he feels ""stuck"" like this, which is kind of scary to me because I don't feel stuck. I just enjoy being with him as his girlfriend.

My parents say this is really sweet and are supportive. They say most men his age have to be chased by girls for something serious, while he's ready to commit the rest of his life to me right now. I love him and I do want to marry him, but I don't want to be married in high school. There's almost no logical reason for this, it just seems super weird to have a husband in high school. He pointed out that I don't have a reason and is saying maybe I don't love him as much as I think I do which is so untrue. I get I hurt his feelings with this but I love him so much. He pointed out we started dating really early so this isn't any different, but how we were with each other at the beginning of our relationship is so different to how our relationship functions now, it's incomparable imo.

He didn't say it, but I worry this is less about him being so mature (although I know he is) than it is about him wanting me to have sex with him. He says it isn't but idk. Based on everything he's said, I feel like if I turn this down, he might never get over it, which is horrible because we're in such a good place. I don't want to lose him to the point where I think it might be better to accept the proposal. My mom says if I let him slip because we're too young, she's worried I'll end up settling for a guy that's much worse than him when I'm 30. I do want to get married and it would stress me out to be older and single I think. Sorry, this is turning into a tangent, so I'll stop myself now.

* She forgot it was my birthday yesterday.
* She agreed for me to come over, then once I arrive she say she‚Äôs left for the airport to pick her sister up. 
* Accidentally called me by her exes name.

* Friends spontaneously come over, all backs get turned to me, excluded from conversation but I‚Äôm expected to stay with them until they leave.
* Always seems to change plans and is consistently late.

I know most of these seem insignificant, but my brain has begun to overthink, obsess and pullback when they happen.

My girlfriend normally has a few pimples on her cheek or forehead that comes by once a month (before period). However, recently she's started developing multiple pimples (red, painful) around her jawline and having spoken to her GP, he's told her that it's likely hormonal due to her having taken a medication twice within a short period or time (altering and skewing her hormone levels). 

She's not sure what choice she wants to wait. A part of her wants to do a) Wait it out (approximately 3 months), but she gets impatient at the thought of looking and feeling the way she does. b) Using over the counter creams (Benzac), hut she doesn't want to use any products on her face after having bad experiences in the past (not an option for her ag all). c) Use a contraceptive pill to control her acne. She's keen on this idea, but doesn't wanna have to continuously take it for life. She knows people that have temporarily taken it (3-6 months) before stopping and letting it be.

The GP told her if she waits it might get worse. She's been thinking if option C. I support her decision, but I'm also conflicted on whether or not she should wait it out for a bit to see if it goes away on its own before taking anything. 

However, all of the decisions aside it's really taken a toll on her self esteem. She's turning lights off when she showers, not wanting to go outside, sitting and crying all day, not doing basic chores or looking after herself. 

She's always talking about her acne and has it in mind, so she's always talking to me about it. She thinks I won't love her anymore for her acne. She doesn't love herself because she's always had silky, smooth and glowing skin. I love her so much and it hurts seeing her like this, I wanna do what I can to help her through this. I wanna know what I can do to get her mind off things or even getting her to look after herself. Even when I tell her I love her she tells me she doesn't even love herself.

We've been dating for years now, I'm 32f and he's 29m. I love him, and he's often very sweet and easy to talk to. We mesh well, have similar affection styles, which often make me feel very loved, and spend weekends together. We have some similar tastes but also have lots of different interests. Invites me to family things, friends things, etc. But, yeah, I wouldn't be here if there weren't some big problems... I guess I just need to talk them through. 

He said some very racist things in the past, and I didn't break up with him right away,  instead telling him that he must go to therapy to deal with these thoughts because they were unacceptable, and that he also needed to read some books on racism. I tried to talk to him a little about why it was wrong but I am not a good teacher (I was and am very angry and frustrated with him and found it difficult to have a productive conversation instead of just... being angry with him). He agreed that what he said was wrong, (there were multiple instances), and said he would do better. 

A couple of months later he said the n word again (while he was quoting a comedy skit, I still think it was unacceptable) and still hadn't even purchased any books or gone to therapy. Thankfully after that he hasn't voiced any racism to me. While I'm a little fuzzy on exact times, it took almost a year after that for him to go therapy, (I did bring it up after a few months that he still hadn't gone) and when he did it was for work related anxiety issues not racism, and still to this day has not finished a book on racism (that I ended up buying him even though I told him I needed to see him show initiative on this issue). Months later after we had yet another talk where I told him I was experiencing resentment for his lack of initiative and that it was affecting our relationship he finally went to therapy and began talking about his drinking problem and racism.

Unfortunately, that lasted only a few months before he stopped going to therapy. However, he did not tell me he stopped, I had to confront him about a month ago that he hadn't mentioned therapy in a long time and I knew he wasn't going. He said it was because of money and that he had always intended to go back. I told him this was a lie by omission and that I had always been clear that him dealing with his racism through therapy was a requirement for our relationship and also that his drinking every night was enabling multiple problems. If he had told me he needed to stop for a while until he had more money (he was unemployed for a month or two and I don't believe he had insurance) I would have been completely supportive and patient. 

During this last month he also agreed to not drink (I did not suggest it actually, he offered). He was temporarily between living situations, and spent a week with me and didn't drink, but I found out (discovered his alcohol) when I was helping him unpack his new place. 

He has since started going to therapy again (or at least scheduled it to go, I don't know if he has been yet).

Writing it out- yeah, this is all fucking shitty and long, sorry. I guess I feel guilty for considering ending things when he is going to therapy again (and has consistent work that he seems to enjoy so I don't anticipate him not being employed again soon). He has agreed this is all not ok and that he wants to do better. 

There are other issues that I feel might be because of the resentment and pain I feel because of all this, so I haven't tried to discuss all of them with him, except for things like his messiness, which I told him I need him to improve on before we think about moving in together. 

He has improved on issues- other things have come up and he has tried to treat me better and mostly succeeds. With very specific direction and examples he is more likely to improve. Cleaning has only slightly gotten better. I'm not a clean freak but it's too much. If I focused on the issues and brought them up more aggressively maybe things would be different? I definitely struggle with confrontation and self advocating but realistically how many times do you tell people things before they change? How long does it take for big issues like racism to change, a long time if ever, right? He's said that he wants to change and always intends to but doesn't really have an answer when I say his actions don't show that except that he agrees they don't. I don't want to mother him and feel like asking him multiple times to, for example, clean things, is frustrating for both of us.

I guess the question is: realistically, how long do you stick around for people to improve? I've already stuck around for so long because he tells me he wants to change. He has, he no longer says racist things, but as I've told him, I need more to show me he has changed now that he's said racist things- I need to hear why, to talk about specific things he now understands, etc. I want to be a patient, forgiving and loving person but this has been so hard on me. I feel like my resentment is eating me alive.  I have depression and anxiety so it's not like I also don't have things to work on, I know I need to improve on communication and I do my best to express things in a healthy way by using 'I feel' statements, but I feel like things fall apart when I'm really frustrated (I don't ever call him names or say hes bad or stupid or something but I can devolve into what is probably a monologue about how I'm very hurt and sometimes it's being hurt by minor things that I've probably blown out of proportion). I cry super easy and sometimes for no reason or minor reasons. I know I can bottle things up until they are a big deal instead of immediately talking about them too. I'm definitely not perfect. Having a partner with depression can be exhausting but I try to not burden him with stuff often and talk to my therapist instead. He has told me before that he feels sometimes that he's walking on eggshells around me. (That's not who I want to be- I don't shout but yes there are things he probably considers minor things that I end up being very frustrated or sad about). 

I can tell other people they're allowed to leave their partner for any reason but it's hard to believe it for myself. I don't have many friends and realistically I'm also afraid of the crushing loneliness that I know will increase. He's going to therapy now- what if he is finally going to take this issue seriously? 

I won't be able to talk to my therapist until after Thanksgiving and I don't think I can go any longer, even a day with him, without having some sort of conversation about how my resentment is eating me alive (if I don't just end it.)

Just...I need some guidance. I feel ashamed sometimes that I didn't just leave immediately but how else do you change racism other than lovingly guiding them in that direction?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7586224,public,self,I might need to break up with my boyfriend but I'm struggling to commit to the decision,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yz36ks/i_might_need_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_but_im/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

We got together when we were just 14 and stayed together through college. We were faithful to each other the whole time and it became a major value in our relationship.

After college, we lived apart for a year. In that time, she told me she felt it would be best if we saw other people for a while to experience it and that if it was meant to be, we'd get back together.

During this time, we both saw a few people and eventually reconnected. I had slept with 5 girls, she with 3 guys - all of it was passionless and empty.

We had an incredible relationship afterwards and got married 6 years later. All in all, we've been together 17 years.

I thought we had the perfect relationship until yesterday.

Our dog, which I got when we started dating, died last week at 17 (almost 18 years!). For whatever reason, the topic of our break came up, which I've always told people was this really healthy thing we did. She said one of the people she was with was multiple times.

I asked if it was someone I knew - lo and behold, it was one of my friends from highschool. She had started cheating with him before our break and orchestrated our ""healthy break"" as a cover up for her cheating. She had sex with him for months (without a condom, always been a big deal for me) and then never told me about it.

After this, a lot happened. I lost my mom, we got engaged, I lived with her parents, we eloped, we had a huge wedding, we traveled the world, we started business together - it has been so great 

I'm completely devastated that she never told me all this time. I had to pry the truth out of her. I thought just a few days ago that what we had was perfect. Now I feel completely alone, I have no idea what to do. We go on runs daily, we have trips planned, we were trying for kids.

I told his sister that. The next week a caught him staring at me in the hallways. Then, his sister and I talked a few days later, and she said that she told that I have a crush. I looked shocked, but she told me not to worry because he said I seem ""cool"". I think that's a good thing? Also I said that I wanted to get to know his personality and she said that I should talk to him if I did. However I felt as if she was saying it in a way that encourages me to do that. I'm quite a shy person, so without an excuse, there's no way I could. So, I came up with a plan. Once, his sister and I went out to get icecream  and she payed for mine. I tried to return her the money, but she refused to take it. So, I thought to initiate conversation, I'd return the money to him. I did that today, but I was so stupid to do so. I only saw him once, and that was at the end of the day. He was rushing to his bus, but I had the stupidity to stop him and give him the money. I told him to give it to his sister, he just nodded to me and continued running. I'm bothered that now he thinks I'm annoying. I just want your honest opinions, do you think there's a chance that maybe he likes me? Because I feel as if I have mixed signals. Firstly, he knew I had a hallway crush on him, and he still didn't approach me. However, he's extremely handsome, and his sister says he's never had a girlfriend, so maybe he's shy to do so. Also I felt as if his sister wanted me to approach him, I don't think I would do so in her place if I felt my brother didn't like that person.

My boyfriend told me he‚Äôs not going to drink anymore or put himself in a situation like that again. He blocked that guy everything and cut contact. He keeps apologizing. I don‚Äôt know what to do. They were drinking together with one of my boyfriends others friends and this guy happened to be there. To make matters worse today I ran into the guy he cheated with and he was so ruthless and rude towards me.

I‚Äôve never had anyone be that rude to me who doesn‚Äôt even really know me. He knows of me but we‚Äôve never talked before. I don‚Äôt know what to do.
