I am questioning everything about my past relationship with my boyfriend, now ex boyfriend.

I started dating my boyfriend 4 months ago. We became a couple fairly quickly, after just three weeks of knowing each other. I was originally not that into him and wasn't sure about going out with him. What made me change my mind were his feelings for me. He told me how much he liked me, he wanted me to meet his parents, wanted me to move in together with him, he was so sweet and in love. All my friends told me how jealous they were of us and how they could see how much in love he was with me. 

He introduced me to all his friends and I spent the holidays with him. He would have given me the world. From the beginning he told me he wanted to move abroad for a year. He even asked me if he should cancel his plans for me. I said no, of course, because we only knew each other for a month by then and I didn't feel as strongly as him at the time.
I still felt deep care and attraction though and it developed into maybe even love. 

He then got accepted to a program about two weeks ago. I told him I was sad he was moving abroad and he told me he was too but that we should enjoy the time we had left together. But he kind of avoided the topic of him moving abroad in March next year. I also noticed a slight change in his behavior towards me. But he still invited me to dates four times a week, invited me on a couples camping trip for next month. Told me he already had plans for my birthday.
Then yesterday he was kind of in a bad mood and he seemed annoyed at me when we planned to stay the whole weekend at his place. I asked him if he wanted time alone and he said yes. That was unusual behavior of him though so I told him we needed to talk. I told him I didn't know what he was thinking at the moment, especially about his move. I asked him if he wanted to break up before he left and all that.
 
He then basically told me that he was not interested in a LDR. That hurt my feelings because I would have stayed with him but I could see the reasoning behind it. But then he told me that he just saw me as a friend. That really broke my heart. He said he noticed two weeks ago and I could see in his eyes that there was really no love left for me. He said he was sorry. The fucked up thing is he wouldn't have told me that until March next year, I am a 100 percent sure about that. He would have just strung me along, would have still taken me on dates 4 times a week. I feel betrayed and also like there is something wrong with me that made him switch up so fast. How can somebody lose love in such a short amount of time and even worse not tell me and just pretemd to still care about me. 
Deep down I also knew we weren't end game but I still enjoyed my time with him and like him immensely.
He messaged me if I still want to talk. Do you all think I should talk to him or just block him forever. It's hard to image to lose contact to the person you did everything together. It's even harder for me to find out that he lost all his feelings and didn't even have the courage to tell me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7593032,public,self,My boyfriend (24m) told me he just sees me as a friend (24f),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzqlai/my_boyfriend_24m_told_me_he_just_sees_me_as_a/,all_ads,6,,,,

I was basically getting all the girlfriend privileges without the title. I had been thinking that I needed some space from him because I was developing feelings for him and felt like he was too which lead to us having arguments at times. One of them was me asking about his friend and if said friend was single. A few days ago he was acting very distant from me which was unlike him as I am used to him calling me and texting me everyday. He asked for “space” because he was dealing with a lot mentally and needed to figure out a lot of things at this time. I told him that if he wanted to stop seeing each other that I’d be hurt but that I would understand as he needs to to figure himself out.

I am American and he is German, and we both live in our respective countries. We met during the last half of his year abroad in America and we have been long distance for about 5 months. 

From the time we went on our first date, I knew that he was special. He is the kindest and most thoughtful person I know, and I can’t imagine my life without him. 

I’m graduating from college this May with two bachelors degrees. Based on my chosen career path, I will eventually have to obtain a PhD, which will probably take me 7 years to complete. I’ve currently applied for a program to live/work in Germany next year, but I’m also applying to continue a master’s program in the USA that I’ve begun this year. (My university has a program where you can begin taking graduate classes while you’re working on your bachelors.) The program is not in a career field I’m interested in pursuing, but my family is really pressuring me to complete this so that I “have a masters”.  

My boyfriend has just started the first year of his bachelors at his university in Germany, and has 2-3 years left before he graduates.  My boyfriend has told me that he has no interest in moving to the USA permanently. He has spent a year living here as part of the program he was in when we met, so I can respect the fact that he tried out life in the USA and has decided it is not for him. That means that I will eventually have to move to Germany if I want to be with him. Moving to Germany would mean leaving my friends and family behind, including my grandparents who are approaching their 80s. Leaving my grandparents is something I struggle with a lot, as they played as much of a role in my life growing up as my parents.   

I have a couple options moving forward after graduation: 
1. I accept the 1 year in Germany program and apply for PhD programs in Germany for afterward. This means leaving my life in the USA behind very quickly, but it would mean being closer to my boyfriend. 
2. I accept the 1 year in Germany program and apply for PhD programs in the USA for afterward. This means that my boyfriend and I would be long distance for the next ~8 years (the Germany program is not located close to my boyfriend).
3. I continue with the Masters program I have already started and apply for PhD programs in Germany for afterward. This would mean having an extra year with my grandparents, but it would mean completing a degree in a program I’m not interested in. I would also be moving to Germany without ever having experienced what life is actually like there. 
4. I continue with the Masters program I have already started and apply for PhD programs in the USA for afterwards. Again, this would mean ~8 years of long distance, but I would have more time with my grandparents.

We are very happy just enjoying time together and are looking forward to the future. I am even moving soon to be closer to him.
We have obviously talked about our pasts and exes. I had been single for a year before we met, whereas him and his ex had only been broken up for a few months. He told me they had a falling out and she ended things, and he said they argued constantly so he wasn't too broken up about it.

A few months into our relationship, I noticed that his ex (26f) had liked a couple photos on instagram and viewed my stories. The likes were quickly removed so I thought nothing of it. But it kept happening every few weeks or so. I'd see a notification or her name in my story views, and so I told my boyfriend. He said that it was really strange, because she blocked him on all social media and they haven't spoken since they ended. He ended up emailing her and asked her (very politely) to stop looking me up since it made us both uncomfortable, and she came back with a very aggressive response and denied everything.

After that I thought it had stopped. I thought wrong. A few weeks ago I get a text from a random number that just says ""Ugly."" I assume it's a wrong number and delete the message. A couple days later I get a text from the same number that says ""Dumb bitch."" I'm curious, so I reverse search the number on a few different sites and the results come back with her name and info attached, so it must be an old number registered in her name. I screenshot the message and search results, just in case, and tell my boyfriend what happened. He is just as confused as I am how she found my number in the first place, and also upset because this is now harassment. I block the number.

Then last week, the same thing happened but from a different number. The message this time said ""Have fun with my leftovers."" I take a screenshot and sent it to my boyfriend who confirms it's her current number. I block the number. At this point I start to get pretty upset, I feel like my privacy has been violated - all my social media accounts are private and I've blocked her on everything and I have no idea how she even got my number. A few days later, I get another message from that same number, even though it's been blocked - this time it says ""He definitely downgraded.""

Since I'm fed up at this point, I respond basically saying that we know it's her and to please stop, and if this continues I will be reporting her for harassment and stalking since I have screenshots of every interaction, and hope she can find a way to move though whatever she's dealing with.

My anxiety is through the roof. I feel very insecure and wary of everything, though my boyfriend is very reassuring. I feel like I'm paranoid and keep overthinking the smallest things. I never used to compare myself to exes but I feel myself doing it all the time now. I don't want her to live in my head rent free but she's done a very good job worming her way there. It all feels so juvenile and high-school-gossipy! What bothers me the most is that I've never met her and probably will never see her in my life, so why is she doing this? Is it even possible to text numbers that have blocked you? How could I have improved my response to this situation and her texts?

I've been dating my GF for 10 months. I do love her at this point, and she loves me. I find her intelligent, witty, so funny, beautiful, and really easy to get along with. Our dynamic is great.

There's one major issue, and that is that she is a terribly anxious person. She really dislikes having attention on her, and she really dislikes people even noticing her in public.

This is fine for the most part - it just means that I can't sing loudly in public when I'm with her.

However, there have been a few times when I'm out with her that this anxiety causes a real issue. 

I live in the city, and when I'm out, about 1 time out of 5, I come across someone who MIGHT need help. Every single time, she has attempted quite forcefully to get me to ignore them or just walk away.

We were walking home one saturday night, and there was a man sitting on a wall, bent over so I couldn't see his face. He was swaying back and forth and moaning. The assumption is that he's drunk (which he was), but I didn't know that. I went up to him to check he was fine, we had a little chat and he assured me he was okay. I offered to call him a taxi or ambulance and he refused, but thanked me. My GF was quite upset and told me that I should have just left him alone.

One time we were in the park and I saw a duck with a HUGE growth on its face. I immediately stopped and called the animal helpline (we have that in our country) to report a sick animal. My GF was so annoyed and just told me to leave it alone. The duck had been reported many times in the past, and is eating fine, apparently.

Another time, there was an old lady at 11pm who was walking back and forth over and over again, reading a sign. I feared dementia, as this is a classic symptom of it. My GF, again, wanted me to ignore her. I told my GF outrightly that I will wait from a distance and observe the old woman. She eventually entered a nearby premises and I was happy she was indoors on a cold evening.

Just last week, a man elbowed me as he walked by me, and I yelled ""HEY GUY!"" and my GF pulled me away and told me to stop.

I've had discussions with her about instances like these. She tells me that she just really doesn't like attention being drawn on her, and her being with me when I do these things draws attention on her.

I told her that I am the type of person who will help people or animals or stand up for myself, and that won't change. She says that she'll have to adapt, but she hasn't. She is still anxious to the state that her first instinct is always to stop me from helping people.

Had a few long term relationships but nothing like this, truly incredible. So so so in love with this woman. 

So I've had the worst week of my life. A dear relative, the heart and soul of the family, was suddenly taken from us after a long battle with cancer. On my birthday. We didn't see it coming, and it shook us to the core. It's sent me into a bad way mentally.

A few days after she passed, GF(25) comes to stay to keep me company. She is in therapy due to childhood issues and problems with her parents. A couple of weeks ago she had a session that really sent her sideways and I don't know what happened, but she's been off ever since. We ordered breakfast, it arrived cold, order was all over the place, and it was enough to send me into a bit of a tiff. Nothing overly bad, I didn't get physical(never have, never will) I took my breakfast and tossed it in the bin and threw a bit of an excessive tantrum in the process, for which I instantly apologised. 

However, she decided to get up, pack her bags and tell me she couldn't be around me when I was like this. I told her I was okay and that given what had happened during the week, it was fair to say I was unbalanced and waiting to pop off. She decided she was going to leave anyway, to which I told her that I really needed her to be with me now more than ever as I was and am still grieving the loss of someone so important to me and my family. She left. 

Fast forward to me calling her, she answers and tells me she's nearly home, to which I said, regretfully, ""I need you now more than ever, please turn around and come back to me"". She said no and that she couldn't stand to be around me while I was mad, but I explained to her that I wasn't mad, more so just the weight of the week had taken its toll and that I'd lost the head a bit. It made no difference and she said she refused to be around me, and it lead to me telling her that if she didn't want to comfort me when I needed her the most, then I didn't want to be with her at all. 

She finds it hard to comfort people, but she has improved massively since starting therapy. 

I then proceeded to take a bag of gifts she had gotten me for my birthday and return them to her, she refused to come to the door and sent her roommate. 

I left. No contact, no phone call, nothing. Silence. I decided to contact her later that night to tell her that I had settled and realised I had obviously overreacted massively, but given the circumstances I think it could be excused. Truly a once off circumstance of emotions I havent experienced taking full control of me. 

She doesn't agree and thinks I was way out of line, I do agree, but again I have been completely overwhelmed by what's happened this week that I don't know what's going to upset me and what won't. 

Right now she doesn't consider us to still be in a relationship, she had a talk with me today for about 15 minutes and said this will take time to mend. 

I guess I'm wondering if someone can tell me, am I after ruining this whole thing and am I completely full of shit? Or am I somewhat being gaslighted here and she's making this about her when I need her now more than ever?

I’m Jewish but he isn’t.

It’s a very risky thing to say on a first date but he’s a bold guy. 

One time I forgot my wallet and he said “ah yes the old forgot my wallet jew trick “ but he makes them in private and it makes me laugh.

Anyways today he was over for dinner and I wanted to announce that I negotiated a raise at my job and he accidentally blurted out “you greedy Jews and your money “ I wanted to laugh but it just got awfully quite.

My father asked him to leave the house, which he did . On the way out he said he’s joking.

They told me that they are very very offended with his behaviour and it’s borderline anti-Semitic.

I tried to explain that he was just joking and he likes to joke like that but they’re not listening. They’re implying I break it off, but I really like him. If it’s any consolation he’s Indian so he’s a minority himself and I joke about that too.

I have got a situation here, my boyfriend's mom. She's a real trouble. I m totally in love with my boyfriend and he is very supportive, loves me, accepts me for who I am and have introduced me with his family as the girl he loves.

Initally his mom used to like me but then all of sudden she started acting weird. And started telling my bf to leave me but he stood up for me and fought that he is not going to leave me.

She called my sister to told her ""you sister is sleeping with my son, no one cares about the boy you know, but the girl has to look for their respect and everything, if can talk to her about it, then I will talk to your parents about it"" My sister got real angry and asked to back off and to break up because this is toxic.

my bf's husband died and there was nobody living with her as both of her kids (daughter and my boyfriend) were studying in canada. So my bf's best friend started living with her for 4 years and she says that she loves him like her own child.

Later she fixed her daughter's wedding to my bf's friend but the daughter dined for the wedding but she did not call it off.

Later the friend came here and he started living my bf and her daughter. The daughter still hates him and never talk to him because it's awkward for her to stay under same roof.

The daughter called my bf's friend's dad that she did not wanted to get married to his son and everything going on is not right. The father understood and asked his son to move out of the house.

Mom started crying and banged her head on the wall, pretended to be sick and a HELL A LOT OF DRAMA!!!!
After few months the mom moved here and now all of them started living here. The day she have arrived, she's been troubing problems in me and my bf. Then she got to know about her daughter's bf who loves her a lot and wants to marry her, she somehow reached to daughter's bf's parents on social media and started texting them that they have to ask their son to stay away else something happens to my daughter he will be responsible.

She told her daughter that she's a sleeps with people. Same thing she told her to daughter's bf as well.

Now, In between, I, can not go into such house where there is a person like this.

The daughter is away and has been staying someone where else and the mom blocked her and never tried to reach her, on other hand, she's been calling everybody (Including my bf) that she's worried and she's tensed, but she never tried to reach her. Can you imagine ? and she banged her head when she knew the friend is moving out. LOL!

My bf tried to reach her sister but never asked her to come home more than once.

I love my bf a lot because its been more than an year we are together.

I told my bf the truth, that i can be living your mom and your friend. So its better we call it off. He's sad and very emotion. It's hard to see him like that.

I don't know what to do?

PS: I think his mom secretly loves my bf's friend that why she wants him to move out and she sleeps in his room (door always open) but still?

I think she has a plan that all three can live together for the rest of the life, that's why she's forcing her daughter to get married.

How we got together was “complicated” but normal HS stuff in my mind. 

My sister was dating my husbands best friend, I was dating the best friends brother. So essentially me and my sister were dating brothers. The guy I was seeing (the brother) from 9th-11th grade was in the same grade as me. He was a douche that I was head over heels in love with and my first real crush from 5th grade until we started dating. I had sex for the first time in 11th grade at 16 with him. We continued to date through the summer I was going into 12th.

He would always leave me alone at the parties we would go to and I would end up hanging with my sister her boyfriend and his best friend (my now husband). I live in NY and the summer of 2003 there was the “Black Out”. Guy I was dating was out of town. I ended up with my sister, her boyfriend, and boyfriends best friend (my husband). He was honestly such a charming and respectful guy. He never made a move or tried anything, and I was very attracted to him. We made out…. A lot that night….. and talked for hours. I felt guilty and didn’t see him for a while after that. I don’t even know why I felt guilty. The guy I was “dating” was in no way exclusive with me but expected me to be exclusive with him. He was a douche. 

Fast forward some time and I call the friend one night I was feeling bold. I told him to come get me so we could hang out. I had every intention of sleeping with him that night, and did. Since that night we have been together. We had our daughter in 2005 and got married in 2009. We moved away from our home town and settled down south. We lived there for ten years. 

The pandemic turned our lives upside down and my mental health suffered and my husband lost his career and the market he was in hasn’t fully recovered. We moved back to our hometown to live with my mother in law. My two oldest kids are now going to the HS we went to, with my daughter graduating this year. 

Ok so that’s the back story, whew, that was a lot. Now let’s talk about last night. My husband and his friends were jocks. Exactly in the stereotypical way you can think of. Football was life for them. This includes the guy I “dated” way back when, he happened to be the quarterback our senior year. Our HS was in the county championship last night and we all headed out as a family and met up with my husbands group of friends. 

I did have a bottle of wine before heading to the game so I was feeling at little loosened up. I’m already friendly and I haven’t seen some of these guys in 8+ years so I probably was a lot. I can be a lot. 

The old hookup was exactly as he has always been around me since I started dating my husband and he gave me the cold shoulder (like get over it were both married with kids and it was nearly TWENTY YEARS AGO) but I was still polite gave him a hug said hello and spent most of the game catching up with his mom (absolutely adore that lady). 

I noticed my husband acting odd so I made sure to include him but was still sociable with everyone, because that’s who I am and who I will always be. It’s who he married. 

We all met up at the local bar and grill after the win but I only had eyes for my husband and was really feeling him and gave him 100% of my attention cause he’s just really hot and I adore him.  

During this my husband says to me, “you’re being weird” when I pressed him he said I’m acting “secretive” I asked with what and he said my thoughts. Because I know my husband I know he was talking about my old flame. I honestly didn’t really pay the old guy any mind. He’s corny and his behavior towards me is ridiculous. I let that comment pass, took my husband home and did everything he likes me to do in the bedroom. This is where another odd thing happened. 

I don’t handle hormonal birth control well so I’ve been using spermicide. I was drunk and forgot to put it in, but told my husband so he could pull out. Our youngest is 12, we have come to the decision we are done having children, be did pull out but put himself back into me to finish, I asked him in the moment why he did that and he didn’t respond. 

What I think happened is he is feeling a sense of ownership because he was in the presence of someone he feels threatened by, the only other guy I have been with. I want to bring it up because I don’t know what’s going on with him or why he would do this. He’s never done anything like that but it’s also the first time we have been together around this guy in about 8 years or so. I wouldn’t say I feel violated because it’s really not a big deal to me, but I know my husband doesn’t want any more kids he has made that abundantly clear. I also don’t know how to broach the topic either. Would it be best to ignore it and move on or address it and how?

That night we had the best sex and had so much fun till morning. We realized that we have a good chemistry etc. He said that he is not a ons guy, and want to see me again. 

After that night he went to a week long holiday but even on holiday he texted me everyday, he sent me photos of the places. and we started texting every single day till now. He was always saying how beautiful i am, how he is enjoying having sex with me, how fun i am and of course other things. Even i am not a texting person, i was really enjoying texting with him. 

When he came back we kept seeing each other regularly and when we were together everything was so amazing, romantic, crazy and fun. I was feeling so close to him and everything was better with him.

Well, at the first times we talked about how we feel about each other and the expectations. I moved to this country 2.5 months ago and i dont know much people here. I said that i dont want to be in a relationship with someone i met first in this country but i like him really really so much. And he said that i am very right about this, also he likes to being free and not commiting anybody also he has no time for a relationship but likes me so much. We decided that we both are on the same page, hanging casually without commitment and responsibilites. 

During this time everything went really great. I was very happy about the situation and i wasnt really care if he was having sex with other people because i was really sure how much he likes me, that’s the important thing for me. And i was also kept seeing other people but didnt have sex (i knew i could if i wanted to, but i just wanted him) but during this time he was so jelaous about this and acting too protective on me. 

Last 3 weeks he was pulling away and started telling me that he was so depressed, feeling unmotivated, unproductive and feeling like dead and antisocial. I always supported him, always told him if he evet needs me i am always with him and he can talk to me as much as he wants. But he said he is not feeling very social rn and replying really late.. we decided exactly 1 week ago to see each other again. That day i texted him like “are we still doing this today?” He replied hours later and sent me long text that says in sum, he feels really bad to make me feel this way and is aware of answering me really late but this is not because he is uninterested, he was only depressed and not feel like talking. But during this time he met someone else he liked, there is nothing happened between them and he doesnt even know if it is serious or not but it is not feels right to him seeing me right now. 

I am devastated. I dont know what to feel about this, how to handle this. It is just hurts. I know we were both free to do whatever we want, but after he said that he likes me so much but doesnt want any commitment then he choosed someone else over me. I feel so broken and i cant stay cool about this. 

Maybe i feel good about his honesty, but on the other side it feels like a lie to me. How can someone has strong feelings for a person but suddenly feels depressed and simultaneosly like someone else? It doesnt make sense to me. Because i was very sure about the thing between us, even only last week before a few days of this text he said how much he likes me.. or maybe i just cant admit he choosed someone else over me and have never like me enough. I just i am so sad and broken. Can you please give me any advice?

My partner (40/M) and I (34/F)have been engaged for almost 7 years now. We have a 6-year-old child and with the pandemic and everything happening - it’s been very busy.

He puts our child to sleep and often falls asleep with our kid, so we’ve been sleeping separately for years now.

Lately I’ve been asking him to make more efforts in the relationship. I found us a couples therapist (she’s now on mat leave so we don’t have one at present), I planned dates, I planned two family trips this year, I cook, clean and I basically manage our household and I work full-time. He works full-time, he showers and puts our kid to sleep (I’m working at this time), he does the dishes, takes out the trash and sometimes he does laundry. Any other task on top of this and he gets overwhelmed, I’ll remind him to do it for months and then end up doing it myself (for example planning a vacation, ordering filters for the air purifier, planning a wedding that seems like it’s never going to happen).


I feel really resentful at this point because I try really hard to spend time with him. I’ll ask him to come see me after he puts our kid to sleep so we can watch a movie together in bed (90% of the time he doesn’t show up), I beg him to plan dates (we had 4 dates this year, 3 were planned by me), and I try to talk to him to keep some sort of a relationship going.


The lack of connection in our relationship make me feel really lonely. I was abandoned by my family so him and my child are my world. I have some close friends and I also prioritize spending time with them. 

My partner is really close to his family (I’m not close to them, they don’t think I’m good enough for him). He has close friends too and he speaks to them by phone but never sees them unless I make plans with them. 

I’m trying my best to be unbiased in writing this. I long for a deeper connection with him but I feel like I keep getting rejected. I’ve told him this over and over again and he often become defensive and blames me and says I’m always in a bad mood. I tell him that I don’t think that’s true and when I am it’s because I’m reacting to him. He has terrible mood swings from smoking and quitting - he’s always smoking then quitting. 

I don’t know what to do. One of my single friends suggested that I leave him. But there are good moments and he’s a good father and I would hate to traumatized our child. In addition I want to grow our family…..but I don’t know how that’ll happen. 

Staying also just seems like more of the same.

In this time, my bf has had girl friends that I’ve met and don’t have issue with. Recently, he has started studying with this girl in one of his classes, and for some reason it’s really been rubbing me the wrong way. I think because initially, he would say he was studying with a guy from his class, and never mentioned anyone else. One day, he said he was going to go study again and I asked, just to make conversation, if it was the same guy and how he was doing in the class. He got quiet for a moment and told me that he was actually studying with a girl he’d been studying with for a while and that the other guy didn’t really show up anymore. It probably wouldn’t have bothered me, but the fact that he’d been studying with this girl for who knows how long and had never mentioned her until I asked a pointed question struck me as really odd. Then immediately he followed it up with saying that he’s pretty sure she’s a lesbian, which again seems like a red flag to me. Now, they study together probably three times a week (to my knowledge), and I’ve noticed he’ll tell me he’ll be done around a certain time and then won’t get home until like 2/3 hours after that time. 

There are other small discrepancies I’ve noticed, but one thing that again made me feel apprehensive was that apparently this girl asked him if him and I like to play board games, and he told her I don’t like to play board games because I get too competitive. Again, very odd because we don’t even play board games together and if anything he’s the competitive one. So then he goes on to say yeah so I’m probably going to do a game night with her one night but don’t worry you don’t have to come. 

I definitely don’t think he’s cheating but I do feel like he has a crush on this girl, and that’s what bothers me. Also he has a history of developing romantic feelings for his girl friends, so it just doesn’t sit right with me.

We did have sex, which it had been a very long time for us, and I was skeptical of him ghosting me, but he said he’s had an actual relationship before where this happened on a first date and it later turned into a relationship.

I also asked him during the date what are his intentions on the dating app, what is he looking for. I said I appreciate people being transparent with what they’re looking for. He agreed and said he’s looking for a long-term relationship, and I said me too. 

I said I enjoyed the date and would love to go on another and he agreed. He said to let him know what my schedule is like. 

We’ve been texting for 2 weeks now and I had asked him out for this weekend but he has plans. It just seems like he has no interest in me because he has yet to initiate another date, doesn’t ask me questions either. Yet, he’s very responsive and his texts are never brief and he always asks “what about you?” “How about yourself?” We always have something new to talk about every day.

So I took the initiative and said: “So, I think you're an awesome guy and I’m interested in getting to know each other more. I just want to make sure we're on the same page, however. I’m looking for a long-term relationship as well. Either way, I’m very understanding” I was trying to be brief and not sound “needy” or “pushy.” I wanted to see if he had any interest in going on more dates/getting to know each other more (because that’s how you do it, right? Getting to know people). 

He responded: “I appreciate you letting me know. I am looking for the same as well but I’m going very very slow with it and idk what else to say really I think you’re very cool and I enjoyed grabbing drinks. I would be open to trying new things out again but I’m not sure where we stand yet.” Which I’m trying to go slow as well (with anyone). I just don’t want to waste my time or his time if he’s not really interested in further knowing me.

I’m unsure how to do explain the above because I feel like I gave him the wrong impression with my text.

***How should I respond??*** I want to say something and not leave it how it is. I’m bummed because he’s a cool guy and we have a lot of similarities/interests.

My girlfriend [25 F] want to break up with me [26 M] 

We've been together for 8 years she is the love of my life 
And my first true love.

The issue is whenever we face a couple problems, which is very rare, instead of talking about it , she want to break up .

And I always convince her not to do so with love  , that it's not worth it , that we have a very good relationship. And we shouldn't break-up only if we have solid reasons

She could break up with me over simple things like not asking her what's wrong and how did I not notice that she wasn't okay even if we were communicating with messenger...

I respond that it's hard to tell if you're okay or not If we communicate with chat ...

 One silly exemple ,She accused me that I can't hold a debate or talk without screaming .

I responded to her that if it's an issue we should talk about it, and if couple break up whenever they face a problem,  there would be no couple in the world. 

 I'm a calm person and all my freinds and family say the same . 

But when we have debate, and  she can't win, she have the tendency to disrespect me a little and i put her in her place because I think nobody has the right to disrespect a human being. 

Plus  recently my mother got very sick + my brother got in jail so I'm very stressed ...

One time she tried to break-up with me , because I decided to start my own business without talking to her , which is totally false,  I talked to her about it she didn't seem against it .

when I signed the contract she accused Me that I didn't talk to her about it , and I should've have her agreement first,  because she always talk to me when she want to do major things,  which is true .

But you didn't say you were against it in the first place why I should talk about something that you don't have problem with .

Guess what?  she want to break up because of this too

She use all strategies and tactics to make me feel that I did awful things like cheating or something...

She dramatise silly issue  that all couple have to make me feel guilty and unworthy of her.

The last year  she  wanted to continue her career outside of the country. 

I told her that's not how we planned our life, we both agreed that we would live in our country .
Plus  I can't leave my business and follow you ...

She was convinced. 

But whenever we have arguments she brings it on ...

She keep trying to break up once per year , and this time she told me the only way to stay with me , is i follow her outside the country 

I want to let her go because she is tearing me apart each time, and I'm really suffering,  but the idea that she will be with another man , the idea that I will no longer see her or hear her voice is too painful to handle 

I know it's cowardly from my part and I should be a man and don't let someone do this to me .

I (20F) am currently living with ""Paul"" (22M). We've been dating for 3.5 years and have been living together for 1.5 years. I have a crush on someone I've known since high school.

So I met ""Chester"" in high school. I crushed on him hardcore for a few months, he told me he wasn't interested, so I started dating other guys. Chester was still nice to me and overall empathetic, so we chatted occasionally, and still do to this day (but since graduation, it's been strictly over social media-- just texts, no calls).

So I met Paul the following summer (a few weeks after getting over the initial Chester crush), but he and I didn't start dating up until my senior year of high school. And then we dated for a few years before we decided to move in together.

After the first few months of living together is when Paul and I went downhill. Long-story short, he was failing classes, jobless, wouldn't contribute to many chores in the apartment and ignored me by playing video games. He basically did the bare minimum, and I felt like I was a single mother with an overgrown child. Whenever I'd confront him or try to push him to do better, I would get hurt (not physically, but emotionally-- he'd gaslight me in any way possible to make me feel like I was the problem, and wouldn't admit it until God knows how many times I cried).

Right around this dark period is when I picked up feelings for Chester again, and I still like him. It took Paul maybe 4 months for him to get it completely together, and while he's doing great now, I can't figure out how to move on from Chester.

I've tried to be somewhat vague in details for the sake of anonymity but am happy to give more context/details if needed.

About two years ago I [30M] got a new job and moved to a new state. The transition was pretty tough, I've never been the most social of people so moving to a place where I knew absolutely no one was hard adjustment. One of the first people I got to know was a younger coworker [22F]. We hit it off immediately and quickly became good friends. We got very close and while things always stayed platonic between us, there had been some occasional light flirting back and forth. It's been a long, long time since I've met someone and felt such a strong, almost effortless connection. She someone I feel safe with her and who brings out the fun, quirky side of me more than anyone else. I usually have a challenging time connect with new people (combination of social anxiety and being very introverted) but with her it was effortless from the start. 

I absolutely knew that I couldn't bring this up while she technically worked for me, for obvious reasons. But that's changed now and she's no longer employed at the same place I am. As such, I've felt like this could be a good time to open up to her about these feelings. My biggest concern is that I truly value our friendship and don't want to potentially risk it by bringing up these feelings. To be completely honest, I'd be ok if she didn't reciprocate these feelings, I'm more than happy to have her in my life as a friend and nothing more. I dont know how she'd react though, and I would totally understand her feeling awkward and it causing a rift in our friendship, which is probably my biggest fear.

She's an amazing person and I'm lucky to have her in my life. It's just this not knowing for sure if there's the potential for something more here that's nagging at me. I think she might be into me but I've honestly always been terrible at picking up on that, even when it's been painfully obvious in hindsight. Obviously I'm concerned about the not insignificant age-gap as well. The last thing I want is to fall into the trope of the creepy older guy hitting on younger women. 

Part of me feels like I should just keep all this to myself because it's not worth risking the friendship. But the other part of me worries that I'll regret not talking to her about it. So yeah, I'm at a loss for what I should do. Being a chronic over-thinker with anxiety certainly doesn't help either.

Whilst I would love nothing more to have kids with her further down the line I can’t possibly make her wait until I’m ready, I didn’t listen much in biology at school but I’m sure in 10 years time she’d be running the risk of being unable to have them?

I've been with my boyfriend Greg for a year and a half. His coworker Alex and his girlfriend Jess have been together for 6 months. Alex started working with my boyfriend a year ago.

Alex and I used to work for companies that were next to each other. We would have friendly conversations as we took lunch at the same time and would walk to and from a corner store together. We went on one date, there was no spark, we didn't even kiss. We continued our walking routine until I left my job a couple months later. We never hung out outside of that or our one date. We never even exchanged phone numbers. 

I don't normally hang out with Greg and his coworkers, save for the few that are actually close friends of his. I've heard Alex's name in conversion but it's a common name so I didn't think anything of it. Last month, I went to a work event of his for the first time, where everyone brought their partners. I was introduced to him and Jess and we both were open about having met before when we worked our last jobs. After the event, I told my boyfriend privately that Alex and I had gone on a date. He gave me a little shit for it, saying I had a type (this is a well known fact - I've seriously dated 3 people in their industry which is adjacent to my field, including Greg, plus my one date with Alex, and it's a running joke in my friend group) but was otherwise fine with it.

Alex told Jess and she didn't take it as well. She forbade him from being friends with Greg, gets mad if Greg is at a work hangout and Alex attends, and has told everyone who will listen about our ""little affair"". Now when I meet Greg at work or hang out with the group everyone teases him, Alex, and myself about the ""love triangle"". It's a blue collar job so this kind of thing is pretty tame for the shit usually talked, but it's still irritating.

It all came to a head last week at another co-worker's farewell party. Alex and Jess were both at the bar, then also came to the after party at the other co-worker's house. I ended up leaving early because Jess would not leave me alone: she'd go from being super attentive and overly sweet to me in the group, too being snide and shitty when no one was paying attention to us. She had told me at one point to ""fucking watch yourself"" to which I responded loudly (not yelling) to leave me the fuck alone. Everyone looked over and I told Alex to come get his girl, and left.

Now I'm looking like the asshole, and the coworkers are doubling down on their shit talking. It's gone from playful banter to really obnoxious accusations about Alex and I. It's grating on my boyfriend as well. There is no HR for him to go to, and even if there was, the culture of the job would make things worse if he did. Luckily the girlfriends and wives of Greg's coworkers are also my friends and they've got my back but there's nothing they can really do either.

I have no idea what to do here. I feel bad for Alex having to deal with Jess, but I also don't care about him or his personal life so it's not like I'd get in the middle of that. I feel sad and frustrated for my boyfriend who is just trying to exist at work and with his friends as this is his main friend group. I feel annoyed that I have to dodge his coworkers if I meet him for lunch or pick him up after work. I definitely don't ever want to go to work events or hang outs now which is upsetting to Greg. 

What moves can I even make, besides avoiding them entirely?

We've been together for about 2.5 years.


I met my boyfriend about 3 years ago, right before the pandemic. I was active and ate healthy, but slightly underweight then, and he preferred the way I looked then.

During the lockdown I fell off of my exercise routine, stopped eating healthy and gained over 25lbs. Told myself that I couldn't continue to gain weight at that rate for another year, two, three. I had lost weight years ago after I gave birth, so I kind of figured I could do it again, but man it seems so much harder this time. I have equipment at home because I hate the gym. Stationary bike, treadmill, weights, bands, I figure that's a good start. I wake up at 5am every morning to exercise before work. I'm tracking my calorie intake vs output. I'm down 12lbs, have touched on losing 16 but it keeps teetering in this zone.

Today I am 5'10"" and 138.4lbs. I'm not overweight but I still have fat that he finds disgusting. I'm not as toned as I or he would like, but I feel like I am doing what I can at the pace that I can...

My boyfriend is unhappy with the way I look to the point where during arguments he's yelled at me to lose weight. He bought a medicine ball last night, at the store he said it was for him but when we got home he said it's not his style and he got it for me. He wobbles my fat and laughs at me. 

He has also said that he wished I was better to look at during sex, which makes me depressed to the point where I end up lying in bed for the rest of the day rather than doing something about it. I get to an extent that guys are more visual so I'm trying to take that into consideration. I think about it when I'm working out, my thoughts go to, ""maybe he'll get off my case if I lose weight and tone up."" I catch myself getting depressed in the mirror and then glancing over at him sleeping and feeling resentful that part of why I am doing this is for his satisfaction. 

When I exercise and he's awake/around he starts getting bossy about it. He hasn't said it outright but he has a problem with me taking rests. He adds weight and pushes me to do more reps, which would be fine if he listened when I say that's my limit, but his tone of voice is pushy not motivating, and he gets disappointed if I can't handle more. Now when he starts pushing me I lose the drive to exercise. And then he gets mad at me for giving up.

He gives me a general sense that he's not excited for my health, he just wants to speed up the process so he'll have something better to look at, sooner. Maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective, though.

When I try to explain this to him he gets really upset and doesn't let me finish what I'm saying, and we end up arguing. He says he's sick of my insecurities and he's just trying to help and I'm getting all defensive.



--How do I talk to him in a way that a guy would understand, that his reasons for wanting me to get in shape and the way he guilts me are counter-productive? And that I'm more likely to get there by shooting to make little bits of progress over time that I can commit to, rather than going hard and burning out/not wanting to continue?

I didn't initially see him in that way. We talked a few times at work and then exchanged Snapchats. I didn't expect much from it but I was wrong. 

Some how we ended up hanging out and having sex. Best sex of my life. Very intimate and passionate. I felt seen and understood by him. He actually came inside of me which was something I had never experienced. After that I was head over heals. I tried to remember he was only 23. But he was extremely mature in ways I was not including sexually.

We continued to talk and had sex 4 more times after that. Of course my feelings grew but his did not. I could tell he just loss interest. And it fucking hurt like hell. I thought maybe I wasn't sexual enough so I started to be more sexually verbal. Instead that made him uncomfortable, unknowingly to me. He shut me down after that. He expressed he was going through something and didnt want sex with me anymore. As much as I tried to understand and just be there for him. He continued to pull away.

After a week of blah conversations and small talk I finally asked what happened and if he was still interested in me. He responded by saying he had a hard time being around me because I downed myself too much. He also said I did something that made him uncomfortable sexually which is why he no longer wanted a sexual relationship with me. But he wanted to be friends. I have been crying so much since hearing that. I know I have to move on but it fucking sucks because my intentions were so pure. 

I just walked away from my ex of 10 years so I'm quite insecure. The last time I dated I was 16 years old. Of course I don't see myself the same. I'm learning.  And to know a 23 years old turned me down because I'm too insecure. I didn't mean to make him uncomfortable, I just wanted to keep up and hold his interest. 

I just need advice on how to move on and gain confidence in the process. How can I be confident in myself after someone I genuinely liked said those things.

Like when I tell you I tried to be the perfect man, not sucking my own dick. But I really did try even at one point working two jobs and extra shifts to make sure she would have the best fucking birthday I could give her. It wasn’t just special events I tried every day I brought her flowers gifts and gave her reassurance and respect every single day but after about a year went just a month after our 1st Anniversary I noticed we weren’t doing the hanky panky very much, tho this didn’t bother me as sex isn’t everything, here’s a little more context she’s on birth control and medications for depression, anxiety and sleep meds. So I understand that of course that would cause a low sex drive but that didn’t bother me as long as I was with her I was happy like I didn’t care if we were in bed all day just watching movies or going for a drive or little dates I was happy as long as I was with her. But as I said I noticed she was getting distanced with me after our anniversary and didn’t want to leave the house anymore. Then sometime in September I see on her phone that she was snapping her ex on Snapchat. Of course I think what any man would think so I just went for a drive to clear my head and gauge the situation as I’ve been in work all day and was tired and stressed then I come back to talk to her about it and she just said “oh he had court today” and explain that. But this is where it gets juicy so fast forward to Halloween the night I wish I died. Aight so I didn’t even want to go clubbing on a Monday night Bcs wtf, but anyway gf wanted to go out and I wasn’t gonna let her go out alone so I got my best mate to come out with us and she was off with me all night. Ok so I skip to the cheating part, he “boy mate” whom she’s known for a long time and he’s been there for her and all that in the past got kicked out of a near club so she texts him to come into the club that were in. He gets in and he’s being all  touchy but me being the trusting idiot of a man I am believed that my gf loves me and wouldn’t even fucking go near this ugly bastard. So my best tells me somethings off Bcs those two my gf and her mate went to get drinks at the bar so my mate says follow them and when I get to the bar we see them kissing. I lose my shit of course I wanted to smack the shit out that bastard. But then my gf says I went to kiss him on the cheek over and over again then she gets mad at me bcs “I didn’t let her explain” should of just left straight away. But no me being who I am made sure to get her home safe then talk in the morning so I did that. Then I’m the morning she admits to snapping her ex that night aswell and she said oh one of his mates told her he tried killing himself which I feel was all bullshit anyway. But you know what I forgive her. Bcs I believe if we both try we can make this work and the week was good we were cooking together reading books together. Then Friday not even a week later she decided to end it. Then not even a week later she’s back on tinder how did I find out? My friend had to message me asking if I was still with her Bcs he’s seen her on there. Now I’m single trying to get back with her Bcs look I know I’m a fool but I tell you I Love this girl so much even after everything that’s happened. Why do I forgive her bcs we never argued everything was perfect til she fucked it up. All I want is her back. We broke up on the 4th her reason for I was because sEes me as more of a friend, at which I argued that’s normal when we spend every day together and don’t have sex.

 (F,23 M,22)

So I started speaking to this guy in the summer. From the jump I knew I didn't want anything serious as I'd just come out of a 2 year relationship but thought I'd find someone new to speak to. He's very handsome so I went on a first date with him which went well.

When we  started speaking he told me he used to be a drug dealer but not anymore I should've cut him off then but I kept him around for the wrong reasons. (I was bored and he buys food for me often). He was nice when we first met but progressively became weirder and more red flags started showing. E.g he asked me for nudes when I'd only seen him twice. He admitted he was still a drug dealer and laundering money up to 30 grandwhich he only told me recently .He put me in danger by drink driving and nearly crashed the car although he said he hadn't drank anything. He made 0 effort to communicate even when I spoke to him about it and makes excuses that he's busy with school and is just genuinely a bad person who seems to attract a lot of bad energy in his life that would be too long to fit into this post. For anyone who knows about andrew ***e he gives that energy.

I have attempted to cut him off twice now and both those times he says he understood just to end up reappearing a week or 2 later to 'check on me' he's  BEGGED for chances  even though we've only met up twice he orders food for me everyday. His logic was to meet again before I made the decision to 'end things' just to see if it worked in person to which i replied 'sounds good' and 24 hours later i'm blocked . Admittedly this is coming from a place of a bruised ego because I really was dying to get rid of this man, but I was the one with the problems with him so what's the logic behind begging for chances, and then blocking someone.

It was pretty awful, and it took a long time to get over her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple times since then, she's used a couple of things to come back in my life and cause havoc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time, it was 7 months after our split and I accidently used her credit card to buy lunch and she ripped me a new one publicly. Absolutely horrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a mistake. She had me purchase things with her card, it was saved to my phone, and I accidently used it when I ordered lunch and paid with Google Pay. I apologized and sent her a money order. But not before she got on Facebook and called me everything but a human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, 20 months after our split, she's doing another drive by, and I don't know what to make of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My aunts and cousins have a group text that her and I were a part of while we were together. I created a new SMS chat group after our split that didn't include her, but my aunts, being in their 60s and 70s, continue to use the original SMS thread that we were all a part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, over the months, all my aunts and cousins have used this group without a peep. A couple of times a month there might be 4-5 texts that go back and forth. Usually when something big is going on, a trip to the hospital or a death. Recently, my grandmother and my father both passed away within a few days of each other. And in this group condolences have been sent to my sister and I for the passing of my father and recently, plans for my grandmother's celebration of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, in response to one of my aunts trying to find the celebration and my cousins sending love from across the country, my ex decided to send us all a ""LOL."" Now, today the day we are having my grandmother's celebration of life -- it really makes me wonder WTF!?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

I get it, she gets these messages - she's in our business because of us sending her these messages. I did try to get my non-tech savvy senior citizen aunts to use the new thread without Julia, but they always returned to the thread with her in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was blocking all of us at one point and she still ignores my messages. (I did attempt to talk with her about the credit card and I did try to find out what the LOL was about)

he’s never been very mentally stable, but i could tell that in those two months that his mental health deteriorated drastically. i blame myself for part of this. but what saddens me the most is that he blames himself for a lot of the things that i caused and he won’t see any other way. 

when i returned home two weeks ago, all our issues abroad disappeared some how and we immediately got back together. i felt good, he felt good, everything has been good for the most part. we don’t argue about the things we used to argue about. but there’s times when i want to talk about something with him and he ultimately breaks down into a spiraling depression and isolates himself from both me and his feelings. 

for example, the other week i thought i was being too much bc i texted him a lot that day, and i casually asked him if he was upset or annoyed with me about it. he didn’t take it very well and broke down into sadness. he often tells me things like “i’m not good enough,” “you don’t deserve me,” “i treat you like shit,” “nothing makes me happy,” “i want to be alone forever,” etc. when in reality he is the perfect person for me and i care about him deeply. i don’t feel that he treats me like shit at all. i reassure him of all this so many times but he refuses to listen when he’s sad like this. 

he has a crazy school schedule and has had issues with his friends which doesn’t help at all im sure. he has a really full plate and it’s normal for someone of his age to feel so overwhelmed and sad. i know this bc i was there at one point too. 

my point is, i’ve been telling him for months that he should seek therapy and help himself. i learned a long time ago that i cannot force someone to get help and that although i can be there for someone that needs it, it’s ultimately not my responsibility to help them—it’s on them purely. i still encourage him to seek help whenever this topic shows up (which is often) but he is extremely stubborn and every single time refuses. he insists he can do it alone, insists that he isn’t depressed, and insists that he doesn’t want help. due to his self hatred, hyper independence, loss of interest for things he enjoys, etc, among others, it is clear to me that he is depressed. and severely. i have contacted one of his friends who i barely know telling her to watch over him when i get really concerned and i’m not there. i dont know what to do. it’s selfish to say but it frustrates me and makes me so sad knowing that he doesn’t gaf about himself. 

i remind him that he’s strong and that i’m there for him always, i’ve sent him contact numbers for free therapy, but i don’t know what else to do :/ any advice would help",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7592717,public,self,how do i date someone who doesn’t help themselves,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzpjzi/how_do_i_date_someone_who_doesnt_help_themselves/,all_ads,6,,,,

He’s nerdy and loves country music, history, video games, reading, every big franchise sci-fi movie or TV Show, from a small country town, never really paid attention to politics or social issues.
I dislike country music, love Pop&amp; RNB,have no interest in history, only video games I play is The Sims or super smash bros, haven’t seen LOR, GOT, or any of the recent Star Wars stuff. Lived in the city/suburbia my whole life, am constantly up to date with the politics and social issues.

We met at work and have been together for over two years, when we met I was so over guys and happy being single but I was told he liked me so I thought why not give him a chance because he wasn’t anything like the usual guys I was going for. Our first date was amazing in was in a small dimly lit bar/restaurant and we just talked for 3+hrs. I didn’t touch my phone once which considering how addicted I am it was notable. Since then we have been mostly great of course there’s been a few arguments and disagreements but it’s by far the best relationship I have ever had. He caring, loving, a gentleman, always looking after me, very attentive in the bedroom too. He’s truly someone I can be myself with. 

We don’t live together yet as I bought myself a place last year and he wants to buy a place soon. The plan is for me to move in with him when he does but I worry about how this will go with us liking different styles. I like modern &amp; minimal ie a few photos &amp; decorations by definitely no clutter. He likes rustic, having all the Nik knacks and all memories out on display . I’m also quite the fanatic when it comes to cleaning, where he is tidy&amp; clean but not to my standards. He offers to help me clean my place all the time but I never accept anymore as the few times he did help I redid what he cleaned (thanks dad for instilling in me while growing up that I have to do it myself if I want it done right)

We both would rather just hang out and watch tv or lounge around in our free time,going on a few dates here &amp; there or to the shops or farmers market. This is the first serious long term relationship I have had that doesn’t have constant drama &amp; issues, most of the time we are just content. His anxiety &amp; depression does sometimes affect us but I try to be as supportive and understanding as I can, he is getting help and I know it is a daily struggle for him but I wish I could just take it away from him.

We go to most events together but I normally give him the option if he wants to attend one of my friends events if there isn’t going to be anyone around his age there which he normally ops out of and will just drop me off(he gets along great with my family and the few friends that are 28+)

Anyways we recently had a one of my friends engagement party’s, previously he would normally opt out of this friend group’s events but most of the friends invited couldn’t go due to other commitments so I asked him to come with me. 

While we were there we had a few drinks, one of my friends told us about her &amp; her partners travel plans. Which got us talking and I realised we have a very different idea of a holiday, I want to rest, relax, eat, drink and enjoy the beauty of wherever I go where he wants to go to all the historical things ie castles, ruins &amp; battlefields. I said I would do a few of those together but I would probably just go shopping or to a spa while he goes. After I  was dancing and singing songs at him  just having fun while he was standing there. He made a comment saying I’m so cringe, which he apologised for after he saw it upset me but after that I noticed that the couples around me were all having fun together, I saw my friends singing/yelling the lyrics at each other and just genuinely goofing around together, posing for photos etc and I couldn’t help but feel a little jealous and sad. We aren’t like that and we probably never will, every event we have gone to he refuses to dance, he definitely doesn’t know or like majority of the music being played. I’m definitely the more social one of the two of us.

After we left I couldn’t help but think I probably would of had better time if he wasn’t there, I would of been able to chat to friends and dance without feeling guilty for him standing alone. That’s horrible right? Since then I haven’t been able to stop the doubts creeping in and over thinking everything I have noticed about how different we are over the last two years. I look at my sister’s and her partner they are like two peas in a pod, they do everything together, like the same things and have the same hobbies but my relationship is like chalk and cheese who only really hang out together at home or do things alone.

Back in September my husband (29) and I (38) went to a wedding.  I wasn't feeling well and didn't dance much as I normally would. At one point I was trapped dancing with a guy I didn't want to and he wouldn't let me get away. My husband who was of course drunk, walked right by and didn't help me so I was pretty pissy later in the night.  Later on he was dancing with another woman (who is married) and she was grinding all up on him and caressing him and he did nothing to stop it.  I ran off and he never even came to find me and that was my big mistake because now I really don't know what happened.  The whole thing has been pretty heartbreaking and he still doesn't think it was a big deal and that I'm just 'naive and it was just dancing'. Anyway, I eventually went back in, asked him if we could leave and he said 30more minutes.  I just went back to the truck and cried.  While waiting (over an hour till I had to go get him) I see the woman's husband go into the bushes with another woman.  

I have a wedding coming up in a few months and the cheater and the woman who decided it was appropriate to basically give my husband a lap dance will be there.  I'm obviously still hurt and traumatized by all of this because my husband never validated my feelings or admitted any of it was his fault even though he didn't push her away.  He just says some really awful things to me whenever I bring it up. I know I shouldn't bring it up but this other wedding has been a dark cloud looking over me.
