A lot has changed in those 5 years —moved in together in a new city, both got jobs in our fields, good balance of independence, strong communication — but just not sure if she’s the one I want to marry/spend the rest of my life with. 

My parents are divorced so maybe there’s subconscious fear that would eventually happen to us, but more importantly I often consider my life without her and what it would be like. I have ADHD so it is naturally exciting to consider changing things drastically, but have never acted out or betrayed trust. Alternatively, some days the thought of leaving her scares me, too (fear of the unknown, maybe?).

I’ll note that we do have fundamental differences in our personalities; I am fairly outgoing and extroverted while she is more introverted and likes to keep thing simple, including a small friend group and lack of desire to push comfort zone (meet new people, for example). This isn’t a problem on the surface because she has no problem with me scratching that itch on my own and trusts me to be loyal when I’m out with other friends. Deep down, I do wonder if this difference will turn into a bigger issue down the road…

Safe to say in 5 years we have gone through a lot as a couple, we’ve been there for each other and know each other very well. Essentially best friends &amp; roommates with a decent sex life. I think both our needs are being met (and when needs aren’t being met we’ll talk it through). 

So my dilemma is that lately things feel a little stale and frankly too routine for my liking (going through the motions), so I am thinking more and more of shaking things up. Usually when things get stale we’ll spice things up with dates or in the bedroom but it’s getting harder and harder to do as time moves on — can only spice things up so much.

She’s a great girlfriend and I don’t want to hurt her or destroy what we’ve built, but at the same time I don’t want to waste her or my time when I still question if she’s ‘the one’. The thought of leaving is scary but not as scary as looking back 5 more years from now and having regrets.

Is this a normal feeling in long term relationships? How can I tell if she’s ‘the one’? What can I do to make a decision to continue (or move on) with confidence, one way or the other?

For context, I'm starting out in a STEM PhD program in a field where women are underrepresented. I am a native of the country I'm going to school in and the friend in question is not. 

One of the first friends, who is an international student, I made here started to cause problems with my other friends, who were women. They said he was being sexist and disagreed with his opinions, the main issue being that he would tell people that they should stop complaining and just work harder. 

At the time I disagreed but continued to be his friend and disagree whenever these issues came up. I felt that as a man it was my place to keep him in line since given his attitude, I didn't think he would take the complaints from the other women seriously. 

Anyway, after this incident, he would constantly talk sarcastically about how he was 'cancelled' and the 'racist misogynist' of the department, as well as recalling the confrontation as her 'screaming at him' and calling her a bitch, even though he knew I was friends with her. 

Over time, this kept happening and my calm disagreements weren't having any affect. Moreover, he started to offend other people in the department with his behavior so last week I privately and forcefully confronted him, saying that he was being fragile and acting in a sexist way. In particular I emphasized that this is not about politics, but about keeping in mind his privilege and the effect of his behavior on other people who are less privileged. At the time he didn't say much other than that he acted this way because of the culture where he came from, which is understandable, although I probably wouldn't be so deprecating to his culture. 


Now this week, he made a point to steer to topic away from politics every time it came up in conversation with other friends, 'joking' that they can talk about it as long as I leave. Moreover, he has been making passive aggressive comments around other friends that people in his country are mature enough to talk about issues, and going out of his way to praise some people in the department since he actually respected them, unlike a bunch of other people. 

After all this, I'm frankly pissed and I feel blatantly disrespected. I felt like I handled this in a mature and private way but it seems like my efforts have failed. I want to confront him next time I see him and completely burn the bridge over this, but he is quite popular and we are both probably stuck here for the next four or five years. 

As such I'm not really sure what to do. How should I go forward with this conflict in a mature and professional way?

So I got this thing that has been going on with this girl for 4 months. We live 30 minutes distance away from each other.

Like any other relationship we had ups and downs. Whenever we get into an argument and we stop talking for a day or two I am the one who always make things up and fix the tune (happened two times; one time we stopped talking for two days and the other time for a week).

**Behaviour Change**

In the last 45 days she wouldn't make an effort to see me or make a plan (before she used to reciprocate my initiatives and we used to go out) and whenever I make a plan should say: ""I will let you know when we can"" or ""we will plan an outing soon"".  

I was sure there was no other dudes involved and her job is just taking much of her time.

**The last interaction**

So last time we had an argument while texting. She brought up something that I clearly explained to her in the past and that she should trust me about it yet should would do the same shit and distrust me so I told her I was angry and disappointed in her attitude and for that day I stopped texting/calling her all together as a reaction to her wrongdoings. **The thing is she didn't care and stopped texting/calling as well and that went on for almost 25 days.** I stopped texting/calling her at the time on purpose to see if she cares to make up or fix the argument but I was confirmed that she really doesn't care or her abandonment issues are affecting her behavior to make her try to be more distant from me.

He left me alone sitting and waiting for him, went to sit by his friends, didnt bother inviting me over and when I left slamming the door he said I made it a big deal and none of his friends like me. It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he d say sorry and start with the love words. Then, he cancelled a date after promising for a match with guys, last minute and said sorry when I got mad. He then proceeded staying with another girl at work, she was new, and more of his type as Im quite introverted. I felt not enough, he would treat her similar as me, doing same actions, even being there for her at the middle of the night helping her with car issues, while he d tell me he would be there for me , but words and actions didnt match.

He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late.

I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye.

He leaves every office Im at, but checks all my stories, stares at me.

I took him back several times as he would bring gifts, say he couldnt help losing me, now barely looks at me and is avoidant. We only text regarding work and he replies , but doesnt initiate. I dont get it, he wanted me to love him and I do, and then blames me.

What do I do now?

With time a lot of weird things happened and now we cant go a week without fighting or arguing about the smallest things. About the things that have happened: The first one was about a friend of her and mine (now my ex-friend). That girl talked bad about our relationship always and said rude things about me , my gf stopped talking to her back then saying ""no one of my friends has the right to talk bad about you"",but ive had a gut feeling after a while that she was friends with her again, so i logged in on her IG and saw that she hid it from me and kept on being friends with her. She also treats my gf really bad and one time when my gf didnt feel well and didn’t answer her texts, that girl just blocked her. Next thing that was weird was, when i saw her texts between her and a boy she used to have a thing with in 2020, which i find in my opinion disrespectful to be talking to people you had a thing with in a relationship. My gf is bisexual and she has some boys on snapchat and Instagram added and im always overthinking a lot.She claimed she blocked him anywhere but im not sure what to believe. In summer we were supposed to meet for the first time but a week before, a friend of mine tested my gf on Instagram (i didnt know about it and id NEVER ask someone to do that), making a boy account and asking her to get to know her and to get her snap. My gf was on break at work at that time and when my friend got an answer it said ""yes sure "" but it got deleted right after. When i confronted her with it, she claimed her friend ( the one who talked sh*t about me) was on the account and texted that - even though that girl has a boyfriend? Seemed pretty weird to me. The best thing happened a few days after: A random instagram account texted me if i wanna be friends🤔Ofc the bio said ""lesbian"" either.She said she was from California but I tried the Log-In method to see the digits off the number and hmm.. the number was from the same county as my gfs.. What a coincidence right? To this day she claims she has nothing to do with that but i refuse to believe it.

I wonder, is it too much?

We give each other 2-3 gifts at both Christmas and birthdays. In total, we probably spend between $100 and more than $300 each occasion on each other.  Sometimes it's more. Last year, he bought me an instant pot and an espresso machine for Christmas. It's getting out of hand!

I'm not sure if the spending costs for gifts or the amount of gifts bothers me more. We are newly married and not financially combined, though he pays a bigger share of the bills. I feel like we should save our money for our future and travel, etc.

My husband (and I say this with love) has always taken the lead on buying me several thoughtful but expensive gifts for both my birthday and Christmas. And he makes a funny, sweet homemade card each time. 

My family never really exchanged gifts. I'm not great at thoughtful gifts. I don't give anyone else actual gifts except for weddings or baby showers, which usually have registries. Generally if I feel compelled to get a gift beyond that, it's simply cash or quality time, like treating someone to a meal or to an event they enjoy.

My husband's family is very generous. His parents send us both cash for Christmas each year and send him gifts for his birthday. If we all get together for Christmas also with his brother and sister-in-law, everybody buys nice thoughtful gifts for everybody else. Oh, Midwest nice. 

I appreciate him for the gifts he gives me and truly enjoy them. But my income is less than half of his and I'm not a great gift giver, so I stress about it. Things are also more expensive now too, and if there's an economic downturn, my job is vulnerable (his is not, he's military) and could be on the chopping block like it was early in the pandemic.

So, are the following things stuff that women commonly accept without question?

Whenever I ask on here they tell me ""who cares"" and ""get over it"" and that I should be happy to just find the needle in the haystack and be done with it.

So...

Is o ral s ex is much more performed on women than it is on men and is this commonly believed and accepted? And this has nothing to do with men being selfish since g ay men are male and commonly give oral to other men? And that this means p enises are more appreciated than v aginas?

Is it widely accepted and believed that men commonly f etishize and s exualise women who have p enises and that type of p orn and s ex work and that they commonly use l adyboy s exual tourism, but that women and gay men have no interest in the men with v aginas equivalents? And that this shows p enises are more liked than v aginas?

Is it widely believed that men prefer younger women, rich men prefer younger women, that men in affairs mostly leave their wives for younger women, that beauty is mostly about how much younger you look and women are concerned with their ageing. Whereas women are thought to like a wider age range of men?

Is it widely believed that misogny is far more common than misandry across the world and throughout history? And therefore that women like men as a gender far more than men like women as a gender and that women like and are attracted to men in a more well rounded way?

Is it widely believed that in gender segregated and s exually repressed countries (like Muslim countries) and places men commonly have s ex with men but women do not anywhere near as commonly have s ex with women? And that this shows s traight male s exuality depends almost solely on the s exual availability of women whereas s traight female s exuality does not depend almost solely on the s exual availability of men and they replace them far less.

Is it widely true that men are attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. And that natural body hair on a woman, fatness, non feminine traits are more g ross to them than a feminine woman with a p enis. But that women and g ay men love a ndrogynous men and many popular hearthrobs for them are feminine or wear makeup and women's clothes or have long hair...like Harry Styles, Adam Ant, rockers, etc. And they'd rather them than a masculine woman or man with a v agina?

Is it widely true that in general women support, praise and celebrate g ay men and men doing typically female hobbies more than men support l esbians and women doing typically male hobbies. For example d rag queens and g ay male makeup artists are loved by women, popular &amp; mainstream and praised for the bare minimum vs d rag kings and female footballers or women doing male things are not loved by men and instead need to prove themselves a lot more. And that g ay men are more mainstream, have more poistive stereotypes and romcoms involving them are more mainstream and successful than ones involving l esbians?

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as automatically s ubmissive while p enises are seen as automatically d ominant? And so f emdom and d ominant women have to wear s trap ons and use p egging to be seen as d ominant/face s itting is not enough. P egging is named ""extreme f emdom"" vs anything to do with just the v agina is deemed ""gentle f emdom."" The s trap ons are also seen as similar to real p enises so l esbians who use them are asked why, men who are into that also like t ransgender women and see them as d ominant and t ransgender men as s ubmissive. And also that there is no v agina type as i dealised or searched for in p ornography as large p enises and B B C are. Also c uck f etish is all about the other man having a bigger p enis, not about the other man's o ral skills or anything to do with w orshipping v agina.

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as more g ross, t aboo and have more s tigma than p enises do and that g ay men are more openly d isgusted by v aginas than l esbians are by p enises. And that l esbians are more open to t ransgender women than g ay men are to t ransgender men, because p enis is more important to women and g ay men than v agina is important to l esbians and men.

Men are obsessed with a nal because they bore of v aginas and look for alternatives. V aginas are seen as replaceable h oles. Meanwhile women do not b ore of p enises nor look for alternatives. L esbian sex has it's validity questioned with ""you just haven't found the right p enis."" Or people asking how they even have s ex without a p enis. G ay sex is not invalidated, because p enis and p enetration is seen to be what s ex is all about. Men who are into a nal are open to women who have p enises.

Can you tell me how right or wrong I am? Most on here tell me I am right and ask why it bothers me when most women accept it and stay attracted to men.

Would men be as accepting on mass if the opposite equivalents applied to them, not complain or complain and stay attracted to women and not lose attraction nor be bitter or hateful?

So, are the following things stuff that women commonly accept without question?

Whenever I ask on here they tell me ""who cares"" and ""get over it"" and that I should be happy to just find the needle in the haystack and be done with it.

So...

Is o ral s ex is much more performed on women than it is on men and is this commonly believed and accepted? And this has nothing to do with men being selfish since g ay men are male and commonly give oral to other men? And that this means p enises are more appreciated than v aginas?

Is it widely accepted and believed that men commonly f etishize and s exualise women who have p enises and that type of p orn and s ex work and that they commonly use l adyboy s exual tourism, but that women and gay men have no interest in the men with v aginas equivalents? And that this shows p enises are more liked than v aginas?

Is it widely believed that men prefer younger women, rich men prefer younger women, that men in affairs mostly leave their wives for younger women, that beauty is mostly about how much younger you look and women are concerned with their ageing. Whereas women are thought to like a wider age range of men?

Is it widely believed that misogny is far more common than misandry across the world and throughout history? And therefore that women like men as a gender far more than men like women as a gender and that women like and are attracted to men in a more well rounded way?

Is it widely believed that in gender segregated and s exually repressed countries (like Muslim countries) and places men commonly have s ex with men but women do not anywhere near as commonly have s ex with women? And that this shows s traight male s exuality depends almost solely on the s exual availability of women whereas s traight female s exuality does not depend almost solely on the s exual availability of men and they replace them far less.

Is it widely true that men are attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. And that natural body hair on a woman, fatness, non feminine traits are more g ross to them than a feminine woman with a p enis. But that women and g ay men love a ndrogynous men and many popular hearthrobs for them are feminine or wear makeup and women's clothes or have long hair...like Harry Styles, Adam Ant, rockers, etc. And they'd rather them than a masculine woman or man with a v agina?

Is it widely true that in general women support, praise and celebrate g ay men and men doing typically female hobbies more than men support l esbians and women doing typically male hobbies. For example d rag queens and g ay male makeup artists are loved by women, popular &amp; mainstream and praised for the bare minimum vs d rag kings and female footballers or women doing male things are not loved by men and instead need to prove themselves a lot more. And that g ay men are more mainstream, have more poistive stereotypes and romcoms involving them are more mainstream and successful than ones involving l esbians?

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as automatically s ubmissive while p enises are seen as automatically d ominant? And so f emdom and d ominant women have to wear s trap ons and use p egging to be seen as d ominant/face s itting is not enough. P egging is named ""extreme f emdom"" vs anything to do with just the v agina is deemed ""gentle f emdom."" The s trap ons are also seen as similar to real p enises so l esbians who use them are asked why, men who are into that also like t ransgender women and see them as d ominant and t ransgender men as s ubmissive. And also that there is no v agina type as i dealised or searched for in p ornography as large p enises and B B C are. Also c uck f etish is all about the other man having a bigger p enis, not about the other man's o ral skills or anything to do with w orshipping v agina.

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as more g ross, t aboo and have more s tigma than p enises do and that g ay men are more openly d isgusted by v aginas than l esbians are by p enises. And that l esbians are more open to t ransgender women than g ay men are to t ransgender men, because p enis is more important to women and g ay men than v agina is important to l esbians and men.

Men are obsessed with a nal because they bore of v aginas and look for alternatives. V aginas are seen as replaceable h oles. Meanwhile women do not b ore of p enises nor look for alternatives. L esbian sex has it's validity questioned with ""you just haven't found the right p enis."" Or people asking how they even have s ex without a p enis. G ay sex is not invalidated, because p enis and p enetration is seen to be what s ex is all about. Men who are into a nal are open to women who have p enises.

Can you tell me how right or wrong I am? Most on here tell me I am right and ask why it bothers me when most women accept it and stay attracted to men.

Would men be as accepting on mass if the opposite equivalents applied to them, not complain or complain and stay attracted to women and not lose attraction nor be bitter or hateful? I ask because I know about male e go, male p ride and how i ncels are e ntitled and b acklash.

I met my now girlfriend almost exactly 1 year ago.

We met in a therapy group and I was so smitten by her I called her the first day I was let go.

I didnt think much, at one point I just said:  ""I cant get her out of my head, im going to call her and I want to get to know her"".

Now a little bit about her: She is 20 years older than me (me being 30), has a 21 year old daughter and is single due to her last partner mistreating her and influencing her relationship with her daughter. 

Everything was lovey dovey at first but since like 2 months she started to develop doubts.

Since we know each other very well already, I started to suspect that something was wrong. So I asked her. And she told me : ""What is happening between us isnt normal. Everyone will judge and talk. Although my daughter knows it drives distance between us just like in my last relationship, and if it comes for me to decide I will always decide for my daughter"".

She told me in her last relationship her daughter was very envious and at some point they had lots of arguing and she moved away. After her relationship ended - like 2 years ago - she developed a insanely strong bond with her daughter texting and sending voice chats like every 2 hours or so.

Now even after 1 year I think daily about her and every single day of mine starts with a  ""good morning"" and ends with ""have a good night"" sent to her.

We come from different worlds and we dont have much in common, but we think alike and just understand each other on a deep level. I have never experienced something like this with any other person I was with. 

But it hurts me when she looks down and says things like ""it wont work"" and ""its not normal"". My reaction usually is to say: ""If its not working then thats alright, now at least we enjoy each others company"" and ""I will never stand between you and your daughter"".

And thats where I am asking you guys: How can I make her more comfortable with this age-gap romance that we are in?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7529372,public,self,How do I reaffirm my 20 years older girlfriend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytfhd2/how_do_i_reaffirm_my_20_years_older_girlfriend/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So make a long story not long. This girl I’m dating for about a year talks to her ex periodically. She says they only share insta posts and that’s it. I told her I don’t understand why she still reaches out, and I wish she would stop, because to me, he serves no purpose to her. She agreed to stop, once her friends and sisters even told her that it’s weird. She even says he’s a “bum” and made empty promises. Fast forward I found out they still share insta posts and she decided to txt him in front of me to let him know he ain’t shit jokingly, but it’s like why even reach out? She has shown through action she cares by gifting me things and what not, but I thought we came to an agreement at first. She has asked me to stop mentioning my in the beginning of our relationship. I should note, they have dated for 5 years.

We have been seeing each other for about 5 months now and we officially had the relationship talk. She brought it up. I agreed that we should make things official, but not without some slight hesitation on my end. 

Don’t get me wrong, she is awesome in so many ways. I am attracted to her, the sex is incredible, we have very similar political and life views, we want similar things in life (kids, etc), we have a similar sense of humor, and we overall just have fun together.

There are some things that annoy me however. She definitely worries a little bit too much about if we’re safe in certain neighborhoods, she’s a little bit of a hypochondriac, and there is a noticeable height difference (I’m 6’1 and she’s 5’3). She’s a little fragile and I worry about her long term physical health. That’s me really being picky, but they are things on my mind.

Given that I don’t really have much serious relationship experience (this is my 2nd “official relationship” , I’m not really sure if there’s anybody else out there that could be potentially better for me. I definitely wonder about that a lot. 

Also, My hesitation comes from the fact that I have no idea what the future holds, and if I start showing more and more affection, I’m worried that if things don’t work out in the future I would really be hurting her. 

I definitely like her, but I’m not in love with her. That grows over time though, right? That doesn’t happen right away?

Like some High school bs but I'm confused and could
Use some help trying to figure this all out.

Theirs a girl in my friend circle I really we get along great and seems to like me my friends even told they think she does, but when I finally got the courage to say something it turned out she had a boyfriend.  I've been trying to play it cool keep a little distance waiting to see how things play out, she told me not too long ago that she broke up with her boyfriend, I didn't wanna just pounce on her because I really like this girl and I didn't wanna just be a rebound.

She sent me a text the other night asking if I was going to the bar after work because she needs to talk to me.
I had a long night already so I ended up going straight home, I go to the bar the next night after work and when I see her she ask me if I know anything about a rumor that me and her are sleeping together, I was 
A little shocked I had no idea I just told her no it wasn't me.  Once I convinced her that it wasn't me that started that rumor she told me that this other girl we know has been say that we are to people, this other girl when she gets sloppy drunk always ends up trying to kiss me but she's already fucked so it doesn't seem right so I don't do anything so I just said jokingly she's just mad that I turn her down all the time.  The girl I liked seemed to be convinced I didn't spread this rumor but seemed a little upset that someone would lie about us like that, she said even if we were sleeping together it's no one's business.

So my question is this, is it a bad sign that told me about this and seemed upset about people saying this about us???
She didn't seem like humiliated or anything about it but seemed more upset that people were talking about me and her.  I'm already confused by this situation this just added to it.  I'm kinda thinking I should just try and talk to other girls and cut my losses but at the same time there's something about her and if I have a chance I don't wanna miss it because I'm with someone else.

He knew about me moving for months beforehand, and always said he wanted to move with me. But I was nervous about that, because I was moving with my parents and sister. This caused a few fights because I couldn’t tell how I would feel about him moving up here, since we had recently started dating. (7 months as of now.) So he told me I had three months when I get here to decide, and I told him I thought it was a good idea to wait for him to be more financially stable because of the amount of debt he has to pay back.

Then about a week ago, he lied to me about what he was doing, he originally told me he went to see his brother. We have each others location, this is something he insisted I have. When I checked it that night at 4am, he was at a random house. The next day I asked how visiting his brother went, and he said he didn’t stay long. Later in the conversation he told me he instead went to a bar with some friends and crashed at one of their place.

I told him I honestly thought he was cheating, since he didn’t tell me when I first asked and tried to stay in the lie. He said he didn’t cheat and that he was sorry and he’ll try to regain my trust.

Then a few days ago, he told me he isn’t ready to move up here, and wouldn’t give me a timeline. I kept trying to talk to him, I was honestly really hurt because of the stress he put onto me about moving here. Then he shut down and said I was stressing him out. I apologized and we haven’t talked about it since.

Now, he used to called me multiple times everyday, but now he hasn’t called me the past two days. And before that it was once a day. I texted and asked if everything is okay, and he said it was. But then the day after that he didn’t call at all. So I asked if I had done something wrong, and he said no everything is good. So I asked why he hasn’t called and he didn’t respond for hours, then said he’s just been busy and forgets to call me.

I want to tell him that I’m really hurt and feel really alone. At the same time, I’m scared to be honest with him, because before when we’ve had disagreements, he says I just bring up the same things. I would wait everyday for 5pm to roll around so I could hear about his day and hear his voice. 

Now I’m at a loss for what to do, I’ve already tried asking him. I don’t want to be overbearing and push him away more trying to get to the bottom of this.

We lost our virginity to one another and have been madly in love for three years. He is my rock and the person I want to marry.

However, since we both now go to different colleges (4 hours away) things have become strained. The first week of school we FaceTimed and he visited. Everyone loved him and my roommate said he was cute. But since early October he is calling and texting less and less. Our RA, Steve, flirted me from day 1, even when Bryan was here. He tells me I am the hottest of the freshman girls in the dorm. Well, now Steve and I are sleeping together. But I am still with Bryan and I still love him. Steve and I have been together 6 times and sex with him is much different than with Bryan. Bryan has trouble lasting while Steve wears me out and even plays with my butt. I must admit that I do feel awful about cheating on him but I honestly also enjoy hanging out with Steve and some of his friends. Even the older girls don't seem to hate me. I want to stay with Bryan through at least Christmas break and see where things are. I can't picture my life without him in it. Steve is a player and people have told me he is using me but we have an intense emotional connection as well as a physical one. I stayed over last night and we did not even have sex.  

I am also a bit jealous and anxious after Bryan mentioned hanging out with a mutual friend of ours who is also a freshman at his school. We knew her in HS and she sleeps around. I would be devastated if he is cheating on me even though I have no right to.

From the time we were just getting to know her I was up front and honest that I have chosen not to have kids, and due to a long string of bad relationships I also wasn't interested in getting married again (was married from age 23-28) but very interested in a committed relationship for life. She was cool with that and agreed that she wanted the same thing, so we continued our relationship. 

We moved in together due to timing for both of us about 8 months later in Oct 2019 and she started changing. She started getting extremely angry any time marriage or kids were brought up and my opinion on them. I never wavered, but also didn't think I was rubbing it in anyone's face. 

Covid hit and the fighting started getting really bad. It came out that she changed her mind and did in fact want more kids and marriage, she would periodically break up with me for a day or two and then apologize for getting kind of crazy and we'd move on. Some of the fights were so intense that I did not want to stay with her, but knew I couldn't throw her and her kids out on the street. So every time this would happen and she snapped out of it, I eventually just took her back and re-committed fully to the relationship. I really love her and it hurts that we had all these fights. I was nothing but good to hear and her kids. 

After about two years the kids started warming up to the idea of calling me (step) dad. Their bio dad is in their life but he's a narcissist and is only allowed to see them every other weekend. He's done nothing to try and raise them right. Just wants to be the fun dad with no discipline or teaching or anything. I taught their son how to ride a bike, we would build things in the garage together, I helped with homework. In all senses of the word, I was their dad. 

Fast forward to now. My ex gf has moved out but couldn't take all of her things with her at once, so I let her keep whatever she needed and periodically she'll get more stuff. Today she came over, we still get along very well and both love each other very much. She keeps trying to get back with me, but I know that if I do it will end the same. (some of these fights were so loud and ended up outside, I can't believe the neighbors never called the cops. I was terrified of going to jail). She's been working on herself, but I can tell that she still can't really control her emotions and goes off the rails once in a while. Possibly due to Borderline Personality Disorder, but technically has not been diagnosed (she displays almost every symptom of someone with BPD so I think she has a bad therapist or she hasn't told her the truth). 

I feel absolutely horrible and miserable now. She's not doing good, and the kids are doing even worse (getting in fights at school, not learning well, not listening to mom, etc.). I want so badly to be there for her and the kids, but I know that it could make things worse, being in and out of the kids' life. She's truly a beautiful person when she's not losing it. But the difference is night and day. 

I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for. I'm hoping that writing this out will help me deal with some of the emotions, but any word of encouragement or advice would be appreciated.

I'm currently at a pretty intense talking phase with this girl who doesn't live in the same place a me, so long distance. We both have feelings for each other and want to see where this goes.

I'm starting to get concerned with her drinking habits and the fact that she smokes and has in general a very unhealthy lifestyle of sleeping like 4 to 5 hours a night. She is a rock star in her professional life, super high-powered and smart, but seems to be very unhealthy otherwise in her personal life. She says that she can't drink less or whenever I mention that it would be good for her to sleep more she gets quite defensive.

This would not be a major problem other than because we have some really bad fights that always inevitably happen when she drinks a lot. She turns into a different person. I can drink quite a bit, but still, be in control. But with her, she becomes a different person, has no filter on what she says, can become quite mean and it becomes impossible to reason with her. And the next day she only remembers half of what she said. And she drinks pretty often, if not daily then once every two days. And when she does it is usually a lot of drinks.

I have tried to ask her to drink less, I have even told her that I really like her but that she does become a different person when she drinks and that I don't like who she becomes. I don't know what to do.

My layman assessment of her is that she went through pretty bad trauma in her life and as now developed some pretty bad defence mechanisms. She is in therapy, and that is amazing for her, I am really happy for that. But I am afraid that if I get into this I will be dragged along into a very unhealthy relationship.

I am scared of getting deeper into this. I really like her, she is perfect in every way except this. Is it my place to tell her that she shouldn't drink?

So far the excuses have been dealing with their autism and their overall outlook on dating and how right now they are just too tired to put mental effort into it.

A few weeks ago we saw a movie and discussed seeing another one this week. It was going to be a whole thing where we dressed up. Well, ultimately they decided that they wanted to wait a week for the crowds to die down a bit as they didn’t want to deal with opening night/weekend crowds. I agreed.

Yet, he didn't clearly say I should stay home so I kinda didn't get the memo, which I know is really silly but I have this stupid habit where I don't realise obvious things.
He got even more upset at me for not thinking of it myself and told me to leave him alone several times and told me to not text him until he says so.

At first I didn't want to, but if he gets really angry he usually needs some time to calm down and I wanted to give it to him and respect his boundaries.
We have been arguing a lot over the past months and things are really rough right now, so we're both a bit fed up in some situations.
Yet, I thought doing as he says would be the right thing to do, so he could calm down and we could speak about it later.

It turned out it wasn't the right thing to do, because after his text ""don't text me until i tell you to"" I didn't say anything.
I read it and left to give him time and a few minutes later he texted me again, more upset than before, asking me if I even care.
He said I don't care about him or anyone else, only about myself, and that I'm ridiculous and terrible.
It really hurt me, but I do understand his anger and I realise I should've said something instead of leaving like he told me to.

In the past, I didn't want him to go out with his friends when I felt upset and he always stayed home to be there for me.
I really really appreciate this, but I haven't done the same for him in this situation, which made him really angry.
I understand that and I realise there's kind of a double standard going on here, and I do feel very sorry about it.

I felt torn because he told me several times to leave and I know how upset he gets when I don't respect him wanting to be alone.
I know I should've probably stayed to calm him down and I realise I've made a mistake here, but since we're having so many issues in general (maybe read previous posts I've made) things are just rough and it's much easier to get fed up and angry, which is why I chose to leave him alone like he said.

In the end I did stay home, but he still was angry that he had to tell me to do so and that I didn't do it out of my own way.


I just felt like getting this off my chest I guess, but I would still like people's views and some advice on this.
Maybe it sounds ridiculous to some of you, but our past issues have made things really sour already, especially from his side since I've done many mistakes in the past when it comes to respecting him.

Now here’s the thing, I’m not nervous at all (at least I don’t think I am), I’m not grossed out at all by any stuff we do (I love it), her breath isn’t bad at all, and I’ve even gone the whole day without eating before us hanging out to prevent it, but even when that happens, I throw up absolutely nothing.

For the past week, i’ve cried every single night. On some occasions it was because I felt ignored by my boyfriend (for context, we were on the phone and i told him about my day at work and then after a bit he goes “you never told me about your day at work, did you even go?”). On other occasions it was just out of frustration of being burnt out.

Last night, I was talking to him about something and then I bring up how i’ve been feeling down these past few days. He tells me that I might just be burnt out and then I become kind of hesitant to share the rest of it because I feel like every time I bring up my emotions regarding things he does, he shoots them down and implies that they are just incorrect. That’s when he began to feel as though i was hiding something from him (which he did state) and then he repeated the fact that he felt like i was hiding something which culminated in him sounding frustrated as well as a shift in his tone. When I brought up how I felt like in that moment he was upset at me for not telling him the details about why i feel sad, as well as bringing up how at times he makes me feel like i’m just bothering him, he said that “you need to realize that most of the time your interpretation of things isn’t correct” and that i need to admit that to myself - not in a general “oh everyone’s mind tricks them” - but more in a targeted way.  

I felt really hurt by it and then later on in the conversation i asked him if his feelings have changed towards me. His answer to that question was a non answer, he just said that no matter what he says I will still believe what I want. To which I said that all I wanted was a little verbal reassurance especially when he doesn’t really speak to me anymore and he was just fighting to make sure I didn’t get it.

Dear Reddit,

I know I will receive a mix of opinions on this one but I need advice, I’ll keep it as short as possible.

TLDR: Back in 2020 I started dating my (24f) boyfriend(24M).  We met in person but now it’s a LDR. After 6 months of dating I saw he saved many (anime) porn on his public account. It made me upset and we discussed the boundary that I didn’t want porn to be part of the relationship, especially anime porn as he admitted to being turned on by it (even when watching together on call). This summer, after two years, I visited him in person. Before visiting him I made clear that he shouldn’t watch porn before meeting as it could obstruct out sex life (as back in 2020 it didn’t work out). He agreed but in person he admitted he still did watch (after sex didn’t work out a few times). We argued a lot and almost broke up but made up before I left. Yesterday we started arguing about it again, he offered me that I see his account and I agree. He still saved porn (even if it’s considerably less) in the range of the past three months. Then he got upset at me today about that I don’t trust him while he was the one who told me I could see his account. Got angry and called me names for the first time (which we have never done before). Idk what to do.. 


So in the beginning, everything went great, I got to start watching some anime with him (some were fine but I was never really into anime and still didn’t feel like it’s something for me as I hate the amount of fan service shoved in my face). So things became long-distance after a while.

One day I wanted to add him as a friend on a social media platform. Upon going to his account I saw he saved an enormous amount of porn, both anime and random thirst traps. This was already 6 months into the relationship. But the animated porn disgusted me a bit more than the regular naked woman bending down.

I called with him, discussed it with him, made my boundaries on porn clear: I don’t want it to be a part of our relationship. I told him it’s fine to watch porn while we are long distance but the animated porn weirded me out (he saved more than 10 each day, on his public account). I especially got weirded out because he told me some of it turns him on. I made clear I’m not okay with hentai and anime porn, because he watched many anime.

Don’t get me wrong, he loves anime and I’m okay with him watching anime and some of them were really great. But he doesn’t even want to watch the shows I like or regular movies. And combined with the fact that he got horny from some anime (even when we were watching it online together) made me have this boundary. I made clear he doesn’t have to agree and that maybe he should have girlfriend who has more of the same interests but he agreed a to my boundary.

Skipping to this year, I was finally going to visit him after two years of not seeing each other in person. When calling a month before, I told him it’s best to stop any porn (because sex didn’t work back then, not a big deal because he was nervous, but I didn’t want porn to interfere either as it could disrupt sex life). Low and behold, in person the same issues and he admitted he didn’t stop the porn (despite agreeing to my boundary) we argued a lot and I asked him if it’s okay to show me his account tor see if he still saved porn. He got hesitant and angry and told me he didn’t stop although he reduced the amount of content. I told him I don’t want to see it but I was disappointed. We argued some more during the week I saw him and almost broke up. However we managed to talk it out and made up before I left to my home country again.

Yesterday, for some reason we ended up talking about porn and then it turned into arguing and that’s when he told me I could check his account. He even said it’s been a really long time ago he saved anything and that it was a 10 min scrolling down before I would find anything. I agreed and he showed me his account during our call. Yup, even if it was not as many as in 2020, he still saved some ranging 1-3 months ago. Thus, I got upset that he lied to me . And when I remarked on the NSFW posts, he literally told me there was nothing there and it’s not true (all while showing me?)

Then he was really cold to me and angry and we finished the call. Today he texted me that I’m in the wrong for how I handled it and that I mistrust him and that he doesn’t want to call for a while. He was literally the one saying I could check his Account… 

Then we argued more on text and he called me some names (which I have never done before so I got really upset) and after that I told him I don’t want to talk anymore for a bit.

like she will say she wants to give up or that she wants to kill herself, or that nothings gonna ever get better so why does it matter and whenever I try and whenever I try and listen to how she’s feeling and give her advice she just shuts it down saying it won’t work and that there’s no point untill she eventually gets mad at me for pushing her to try things.

Or I get anxious because she gets overwhelmed with what she needs to get done and just starts screaming fuck over and over again and slamming stuff around and like hitting herself in the face.

I know it’s not directed at me but my last relationship was extremely emotionally and verbally abusive to the point where she would follow me around screaming at me for hours over the littlest thing even getting in the shower to keep yelling at me.

the sudden screaming first thing in the morning triggers memories of that, plus makes me scared of a noise complaint from our neighbors since we are in an appartment, plus they have kids and I just feel bad for them, and it won’t stop untill she’s done or I can’t handle it anymore and snap at her to stop screaming.

we’ve been together for 2 years and I known her for 6, I want to be with her, and I want to help her get help and learn to tolerate distress better, be happier with wha she has in life, and love herself, I just don’t know how to try.

So, one week ago we broke up and she blocked me everywhere(literally, except calls).


Yesterday, at the moment of The picture for beReal, i saw i had a new suggested friend, because of a common friendship, and it was her.
The problem is that the common friendship is a friend of mine (not really close)she dated for one week or so and, as i always told her.

We had some discussions, not even fights, because of him, because i always said i wasnt jealous about her past, but he was part or my present.

I got taunted by this and checked on whatsapp, just to see she had unblocked me there aswell, so i sent her a text saying i wasnt really happy about those spites. 

She basically said she didnt unblocked me to taunt me or to make me suffer and then blocked me again, without waiting a reply.

Have i messed up? Did i have to write her something else or to not write her at all?

his mom has been texting me to make sure he’s okay because she’s genuinely concerned as well.  he told me and i’m all he ever cares about and he just doesn’t enjoy anything anymore unless i’m there.

At first, I didn't think anything of it, especially because she used to say the opposite about herself. I would tell her all the time how beautiful she was, and she would deny it. When she first started making these comments, it actually made me happy. She'd be like, looking in the mirror, and she'd comment about how pretty she is, and I would always chuckle and say something like, ""Yeah, I done been telling you that,"" or something like that. 

Recently, she makes comments like this multiple times a day. She'll ask me what it's like to be with someone who's so pretty, and it makes me feel some type of way. Not too long ago, I told her that I was concerned that she was going to leave me. I've always been insecure, and I've always known that she is out of my league. I've been going to therapy, as well as losing some weight, to try to build my self-confidence. She said something along the lines of, ""It doesn't matter how beautiful I am or if I could have anyone I wanted, I love you, and I'll always love you,"" and I feel like she meant it in a good way, but something about the delivery made me feel weird. 

She's also started wearing really tight, sometimes see through clothes that makes me feel some type of way. I'm trying to be supportive, but like, I don't know. It makes me feel weird. She recently went out wearing a piece of leather ""adult time"" type of thing on the outside of her shirt. It was holes in the center to outline her chest. I told her that I thought it was weird, but she got upset with me for trying to control her, so I dropped it.

Today, she was putting on makeup because we're about to leave the house. She made multiple comments about how pretty she is while looking at herself in the mirror. I was just kinda watching her because at this point, she says it so frequently that it just makes me feel self-conscious, and I don't know how to respond. She looked over at me and said, ""What's it like to be with someone so beautiful?"" After a short pause, she added, ""What's it like to be with someone with so much self-confidence when you have none?"" I was taken aback by the second question, and I didn't respond. After a brief moment of silence, she came over and started like, kissing my neck and stuff like that like we were about to start messing around. I didn't reciprocate, so she asked me what was wrong. I told her that she had just hurt my feelings, and she apologized, saying, ""I'm sorry. It was kind of a joke, but it was also a serious question."" After some awkward silence, she got up and continued getting ready. She apologized again but like, I don't know, man. It was weird.

Four months ago, my wife told me that one of her Cousin sister met with an electrical accident and was declared dead on the spot. She also showed me some of her last photos after accident. Those pics didn't had her face but those photos were so disturbing that i can't ever remove them from my mind. Her cousin's name was say ""A"". I didn't know ""A"" that much but I've met her for couple of times and she was very shy and soft talking human. I remember her for sending us a very beautiful set of blanket and fabric that was very famous in her city. My wife also told me that ""A"" was about to get married in few months.

15 days ago, i came back from an office trip which was 4 days long. During this trip one of my colleagues who is also my friend, asked me to send him some of his photos from my marriage album, he wanted to show his wife. While i was checking out my Marriage album i found that some of the photos are missing. Maybe nearly 3 or 4 of them were missing (i have seen my album so many times that i remember almost every photo in it).
Although i was wondering about those missing photos, eventually i forgot to ask to my wife. 

Yesterday my wife and my son went to her mom's, and i went to drop her to the station. While coming back from the station i got a call from my wife's brother. He told me that my wife will not be coming this week as they all are going attend a marriage of one of their cousins. I told him to keep me updated as my son was not feeling well. I was quite confused as my wife didn't tell me about any marriage she have to attend. So i asked my wife's brother about the marriage.

He told me that it is A's marriage.

I called my wife but as she's didn't pick up the call, i texted her asking that ""isn't ""A"" dead?"". She texted back with a laughing emoji and said ""what? Do you hate her LOL?"". I didn't replied.

I again checked that album and all those 3 missing photos are back there. And all those photos had ""A"" in it.
