I (24m) and my Girlfriend (23f) have been dating for 3 years already and we have known each other since we were 14.she is the Love of my life and i want to spend the rest of my life with her and everything is perfect.the thing is my Girlfriend also has a little sister (18f)who is quite fond of me and is always hugging me or giving me compliments.

initially i didn’t think much of it because i think of her like Family but overtime these touches and compliments got a bit more inappropriate telling me how she wouldn’t mind stealing me from her sister “as a joke” or asking me to tell her if her swimsuit (thongs)look Good on her or hugging me while rubbing her whole body in me for minutes.

the main part was about 2 weeks ago when she came home drunk crying in our apartment (my girlfriend was not home so i asked her what was wrong while sitting her on our sofa.she told me she broke up with her boyfriend and i tried to comfort her telling her the classic “there’s plenty of finish in the sea” line.

she threw herself on top of me while crying and tried to kiss me so i had to push her off me and she cried even more telling me that the one she wants to be together with is me and she is jealous that her sister got me and she wants and loves me than she ever will before passing out so i carried her in bed and called my girlfriend that her sister is here and is passed out because of drinking too much because of a break up but i didn’t tell my girlfriend about what happened that night yet because i don’t want to strain their relationship.

my Girlfriend and her sister are very close with each other and they have always been and i don’t want to ruin that for them but i really feel uncomfortable and like i cheated on her.sometimes i think its my fault that she feels this way

I’m pushing away the love of my life by being so needy in a manic state. We been on and off the past 4 years and known each other for over 10 years. The trust has been damaged over the past 2 weeks significantly, as I found out she posted pictures of her and another man all cute and Lovey and was talking and hooking  up with him briefly a month prior. She told me none of that was going to happen and she wasn’t going to be with anyone els. We haven’t been dating for the past year but we were saving each other for one another. that was the agreement… I thought. I’ve been manic a lot this year. We broke up partially from me being flirty with my coworkers and she found out, this is a year ago. Fast forward all this happens last 2 weeks ago and I’ve been acting crazy. She said she is thinking about me way more and wants to slowly make a connection, but I keep fucking it up with acting so manic. Texting and calling like crazy and she’ll just ignore me cuz I’m driving her crazy. 
Yesterday was her coworkers birthday she hooked up with and she wasn’t responding much to me and I started getting manic thinking she was with him. It reminded me too much of how it felt when she actually was with him. Even though she kept telling me she’s not with him(I do believe her but I keep freaking out going back to she’s lying)Fast forward today and I’ve called her close to 40 times over the course of 12 hours. Texted her a ton of stuff.And her response was that she doesn’t care how she feels about me she’s done. And my behavior will never be acceptable acting this way ever, and she will not put up with it. Idk I want to fix this, I want to let her be so she can think clear of me.I need someone to talk to.

Refuses to let me in on what is going on. Any positive affirmations, experience, etc. are welcomed &lt;3 

We have had a rocky relationship. We'd go a few months being good,  3 months ago, I reached a breaking point. He was lying, drinking every day along with drinking &amp; driving, refused to work through conflict, we never had intimacy, amongst other things. I went no contact

He found his way back in. He promised me the world and he did deliver on it. Cleaned up his act, was including me in plans, was respectful towards my feelings &amp; concerns, talked with me through everything, etc. I thought we were on the up and up. Only thing holding us back was we still had no sex life (important detail for later)

This past weekend, on Sunday, he called me drunk claiming his doctor sent him a note saying his test results weren't looking great. He had his tests run &amp; delivered over 2 weeks ago so I thought that was odd for the doctor to randomly send him a note on a Sunday, but I didn't want to start a fight.

Monday, he claims he is sick as a dog with a cold &amp; running a fever, so he canceled our date night plans. A few hours later, he called me drunk from a bar.

Tuesday, he canceled our date plans once more claiming he had a last minute appointment for more tests to be run. He was texting me saying he went to the doctors, they ran scans on him. However, my friend who lives in his complex directly across from him saw his car parked outside on the street so he clearly was not at the doctors. 

He called me last night fake crying saying that the test results were so bad and didn't look good. He asked if we could talk in the morning. This was where I broke and I asked him if he had driven himself to the doctors, he said yes why wouldnt he. I confronted him about his car and he changed his story saying ""I texted you earlier, my roommate drove me"" when I said that he didn't, he doubled down and said he drove himself. 

All I know for fact is something is up. I have diagnosed anxiety, and my brain is racing with what could be happening (is he sleeping with someone else, did he test positive for an STI and that's why we can't be intimate, did he get fired, is he just ditching me to hang out with his friends, etc.) I keep trying to remind myself that I can only know what others will tell me, anything aside from that is not my business

Like I said, the only thing I know for certain is that he isn't being completely truthful with me. I've asked him to please just let me know what is going on and he hasn't responded

The only thing in my control is how I respond &amp; protect my energy and I'm trying to just let it go and have my brain quit racing, but it won't stop circling back.

the problem is I'm dating this person who luckily is very understanding of this, and every time I've tried to get better and attempt to hold their hand I can't do it for more than a few seconds, we've been dating for nearly two years and we've only kissed once because I can't get over the feeling of their lips. 

we have both talked about this issue and they are very understanding but i fear that because of this I'm limited away from being able to speak their love language.

During this time I worked a full time job, and also went to school for a bachelor's of commerce, plus a two year college in marketing. I helped support him through school and for his career, he failed out of school 3 times, I was always there to pick up the pieces and help provide for him, I even helped him write essays for school because he struggled with English a ton. He was in a computer systems course in college, 2 years and then later did a three year degree in Computer science. During the three years we were long distance, he didn't want to move because he didn't want to move away from me, I supported him and despite him struggling with it and I said that he should do it because it will help open doors for him later on in life and yeah I guess I was right about that. This whole time we talked about our future plans, getting married and having a family when we were ready.   


After he finally graduated he moved back to my hometown and we lived together (where i was living and working) and he got a job in a start up company that lead to him traveling around the US for different conferences. He confessed that he failed to tell me that during the last semester of university while he was away, he lived with a woman there, a roommate and they became friends. I was alarmed that he didn't tell me about this, and it felt weird and created some trust issues for a little bit. He would change his stories and comments on it and it got confusing, I felt like he was half telling me the truth and I felt on edge. One night I planned a romantic evening, cooked him supper and took him to the lake to watch the sunset.  


As we watched the sunset I put my head on his shoulder and he broke down crying, he told me that he got a job offer in San Francisco, but he didn't tell me about it. He lied to me about travelling for work and he starts his new job there next week and he is living this Friday (It was a Tuesday). He is moving in with a friend of his that he went to school with.  


I was shocked and confused. Was he just planning on leaving and not telling me? Why did he lie about it? He apologized and said that he was so sorry he didn't know how to approach it and he didn't think that I'd want to move there with him. I said I would feel weird moving to another country if we're not married or engaged at this point, but of course I'd support him like I always have and I'd want him to be happy. He wanted me to come with him, he was excited, he finally proposed to me and said he'd go find a place for us and ask if his company would hire me too.  


A few weeks after this my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I told him that I was going to stay with her, she only had a few months to live. My parents were so happy with our engagement, and my mom hugged him and said that she'd always think of him as her son. My mom rapidly got sick, my ex moved to California in November and by January I was sleepign nights in the hospitals, the doctor said that they didn't think she'd make it throughout the night.

Once Saturday night I called my ex crying from the hospital waiting room, he got upset with me and told me that I was a selfish person for calling him with this when he has a lot of stress to deal with right now with moving and adjusting to the new place. I told him I'm sorry I just missed him and I wished he was here with me, he accused me of not supporting him and his dream, I said that's absolutely not the case.  


Soon afterwards he started slowly ignoring me, I couldn't get ahold of him, his mother couldn't either she called me worried. I didn't know if something happened, I called him and reached out over the next 3 months and got nothing from him. I suddenly saw a new account with his name on it pop up on instagram, I messaged him and got blocked instantly. I told my best friend about it, she messaged him but she changed her name up a bit... he immediately responded to her, they talked all night and she got a ton of information from him. He told her that we broke up in December, which is actually when we got engaged, he told her that he was dating someone new now. I was so confusing at hearing about this and seeing the screenshots, the whole time he was also acting flirty with her.  


I texted him and asked if we are still together if he considers us still engaged, he responded for once and says yes of course absolutely, WHYYY DON""T YOU??? I said I was confused, and since he hasn't responded and barely talks to me I don't know where I stood with him. He said I was too clingy and needy and I need to learn to be more independent. My mother was dying of cancer, I just wanted him to be there for me :(  


He confessed that he had been cheating on me for the past 5-6 years with a variety of women on the same day my mom passed away. My ex contacted me and tried to apologize but I was so emotionally numb, I said of course I forgive you because I know that is the right thing to do but I am still hurting from everything. He said that he wanted to be friends still, I asked him why and he says ""because you are a good person"" I was confused and lost, my therapist said to go no contact so I could heal.   


A week after my mom's funeral a man I used to work with messaged me on LinkedIn to ask me how life was going, I just emotionally dumped everything on him. I didn't care and thought that I'd probably never talk to him again. I've since picked up the pieces, went to therapy, moved on from this horrible pain, and married this incredible man who has been there for me since that first Linkedin conversation back into my life.   


It's been 3-4 years now. I ran into my ex's friend who told me all about my ex's life now and I saw pictures on social media from mutual friends. He's living in sunny California still, makes a great wage around $200k USD and this affords him a lavish lifestyle, he's now engaged to a very pretty blonde and goes on these elaborate trips.

I(33M) am sitting in a hotel room, pondering which actions I should take in my 10 year relationship.

My wife has assaulted me many times through our relationship.  5 years ago I even went to the police to file a restraining order.  We have a pretty good life together, I make 95% of the income, I cook 99% of the time, take family on vacations several times per year.  We have a huge house, and cleaner who comes in several times per week.  Maybe not the best word to use, but I would call her a 'brat' in her attitude towards me and our living arrangements.

Last night I think was the ""this is it"" moment for me.  We had an argument in the evening.  I asked to step out, my wife didn't let me, and I proposed to her to step out instead.  She agreed to step out.  She didn't.

I ended up taking our oldest child to his soccer practice, then upon coming home putting him(he's 8) and my other child(he's 2) to bed.  After which I made a decision to leave and go to a strip club.  I do not consider strip clubs cheating, though to my wife does, but I didn't really care and made that move.  I have never cheated on her.  My wife would get violent on a number of topics, small or big.

I arrived home late.  Noticed that our bedroom door was locked, so I made a decision to go into one of the other rooms to sleep.  As I was dosing off my wife threw a bucket of cold water on me.  I locked the doors, and decided to take some time.  She wasn't happy with a the doors being locked, and ended up using a garbage can to try to break through the doors.  With our son sleeping in the door next.  When she managed to get in, she was pushing me outside of the house, and I ended up falling down the stairs.  She was screaming her lungs out while I was just begging her to stop assaulting me.

Here is a fun fact.  Her mom has been staying with us for the last 3 months.  She was shocked, but went back to her room, even though I was being very clear that I need her daughter to stop assaulting me. 

I ended up in the garage, just with my shirt on and underwear.  I unlocked the side door preparing to run to the neighbours in case my wife comes out with a knife or something else that could hurt me.  With no shoes on, no pants, in Canadian winter.  It was -5 C outside, so about 5 F.  After waiting for about an hour, I decided to go back in to get my pants, shoes.  I slept in the car for a while and then decided to go back inside and sleep on the couch.  

In the morning I saw that my wife tried to destroy my laptop, thankfully a repair shop was able to fix it.  She also took my phone and says that she didn't, meanwhile it was next to me in the first room I was sleeping in.

After begging her to give me back my phone, I decided to go and talk to her mother to see if she can help me.  That didn't work.  She said that we are not respectful to her and if she could leave she would do so immediately.  It hurt me.  I didn't have a problem with her staying with us.  I cook for her at least once a day.  I even do her effing laundry.... her moms that is, never mind doing everyone's else's laundry in the household.

We despise each other right now.  I was going to file a restraining order, but decided to take some time to think my actions through.  I do not want our 2 young kids to hurt, but it's probably going to hurt them more if we do not break up.  She is a good mother, and I do not want my kids to lose her just so I can feel safe.  

This situation is so sensitive and I can't talk to my friends or family about what I have been experiencing.  In the past we always made up.... and if my friends or family find out the abuse I've been going through over 10 years, that will lose any positive feelings they may have towards my wife.  

&amp;#x200B;

Do I let them live in the house, pay for mortgage payments myself, and leave?

Do I try to take the kids away?  Again, she is a good mother to them, and my kids love her dearly.

I feel lost and confused and not sure what my next steps should be.  Of course, I was wrong for going out, but it wasn't a good enough of a reason to assault me or damage property that I pay for and work for daily.  This behaviour happened many times, for various reasons, and every time we have had any fight something has to get destroyed by her.

One of my friends (W) got engaged to a girl from South Africa, which is where he’s originally from. His two closest friends are his best men, which is (M) and me. 

W’s fiancé had some trouble and delays with her visa. This is also in the midst of covid, so traveling out of the country is a concern. The original plan was to have the wedding in Dec of 21, but they had to postpone the wedding due to visa issues. They pushed it to April of 22. All of us, including the 3 other groomsmen, were ready and prepared to make the trip in Dec. 

Feb 22 rolls around, and we haven’t heard anything from W. I’ve brought it up a few times, because we’re starting to get anxious on the plans. Finally, near the end of Feb, W texts us saying we’re ready to make plans and get our suits. Nothing else about trip accommodations is communicated. We start asking questions about travel and covid complications. The uneasiness of travel in a foreign country we are unfamiliar with makes us bail out. I feel awful that we’re abandoning our friend on the most important day of his life. 

W texts us saying we shouldn’t have texted each other behind his back, and saying we don’t support his relationship. He also tells us we have poor EQ. We try to be supportive and explain it’s a short notice for such a big commitment, and a lot of us have life events that are happening. I was going through a divorce, selling my house, splitting assets, started a new position at work, etc. 

M’s girlfriend had shoulder surgery, and couldn’t drive on her own. Anyway, me and one other groomsmen were able to make it work, but M wasn’t. He had to support his girlfriend through her rehab. It ended up being a great trip, but I still had a talk with W and his fiancé to express my frustrations on how we were treated. I still feel like they are still being stubborn and unreasonable.

Now W doesn’t invite M to any of his gatherings (bday, Friendsgiving, masters graduation, etc). This really bothers me, because if I didn’t make it would he have cut me off?

I was constantly having to update and be with him while it was one sided, he had many anger issues like punching walls and claiming he “wanted to end humanity humanely” and how “if He didn’t find a game to distract him he may give into urges” and just in general I was always the problem. He bullied me like a lot as well, but I won’t dig into that.

The main point I had my reasons and it was the first time I ended things but my hand in a legit relationship and now after seeing everyone in my family already married off and happy at my age, I’m questioning if I’ll ever be happy and find someone. I’ve come to enjoy my time alone, really, but I really just want someone else in my life. I’ve come to love having someone else in my life as a partner even if so many times my aspergers and other mental shit I can’t get rid of due to genetics causes me to not read a room and realize someone has no good intentions or on the other hand they can’t handle me and my mental illnesses even if I’ve made every effort with medication, therapy and so on I’m still going through and most likely always be in.

He essentially had me promise he would be my last and such and now that I know I want another relationship eventually, I feel guilty and have started questioning if anyone else will even want me because he was the first to deal with me and try and work things out, even if a lot of the time that was more just for his benefit. At the end of it all, I just want some advice for my ocd kicking my ass and tellling me no one will ever want me as a wife and hopefully mother of their children one day. I want to know if there’s any hope of getting past this or if I should just quit because even though I’m young I’m just mentally unsure where to go or even do. I have so much growing to do, but I don’t want to wait till my thirties in order to be happy. As I said, I am happy on my own for the most part but I’ve always wanted to have a deeper companionship with someone. 

If anyone with experiences like this and has ocd could throw me a bone to ease my brain much would be appreciated. I just want to know if it’s worth the pain to find the right person or if I’m just wasting time and should just not plan to keep an eye out for a potential relationship in the future, def not right now as I have healing and a lot of therapy to improve further before that point.

We meet up a week into talking and in person it was different but he talked a lot about himself but made it conversation wise.Since meeting up for the first time we have seen eachother for 6 times and Everytime we hangout it’s for hours on end.Last Sunday that i saw him it was something else I met his friend and it went great !.He told me let’s a take a picture for memories and told me he told his female best friend abut me and that his female friend thinks I’m great I’m just like okay ahha.


One thing about Sunday is that once we said bye to his friend he became quiet in the car and I have notice this twice already Everytime we are in the car and no longer kept conversation going…So I’m just like this is awkward..we hung out for about 8 hours that day it was a great time till we were faced with eachother alone we could talk for a couple of minutes but then just singing to songs and nothing else.


We are supposed to hangout today but honestly I feel like ending things because the way sometimes conversation feel so one sided and he never ask question about myself like Trying to get to know me wise.

Disclaimer, please forgive my english as its not my 1st language.  


&amp;#x200B;

My ex and I lately divorced over disagreements and a lack of shared future. Much of it goes back to some serious childhood sexual trauma. My ex was been sexually abused by a family member over a few years in her childhood. I didn't know this until much much later in the relationship. Even if, in retrospect, there are many red flags.   
This family member (70M) is still around and involved in family business. Worst thing, is he has been protected by my ex's mother (55F). My ex-MIL has refused to do anything to protect or heal her children from this man (not even terapy), even though at least two of her children confessed to the abuse. I suspect the abuser's wife is also aware of his behavior (being in relationship with the man for 40yrs+), but that's not something that was shared with me. 

This is very much in-line as there are other predators in my ex's family (no longer alive) who were also shielded and protected by various other women in the family.

Now, my ex and her other sibling no longer live anywhere near this man. One has moved across the country and cut contact, while the other is in another country). They've built up physical distance from their abuser, but they refuse to go public about what happened. They don't want to cause discomfort and pain to other family members who rely on this predator to fulfill their emotional and financial needs.

This whole thing has been a major cause of concern and pain for me and I'm coming to accept the idea that it isn't any of my business anymore. I am divorced from her and her family and all this mess.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as I was seeking comfort and closure with a confidant, this person pointed out that the 3rd sibling (27M, AFAIK: not a victim) still lives in the same town and has recently started a family (twins: F&amp;M). What is the most concerning is that this sibling has no idea of the abuse and could very well leave their children in the care of said man (which is how the two older siblings got sexually abused in the first place)

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a major dilemma here. On one hand, the relationship is done and I shouldn't interfere. But on the other, this cycle of abuse has to stop somewhere. This man has hurt and abused 2 generations of women and now, he could very well be on the  3rd generation of victims.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7566084,public,self,My (39M) ex-partner (34F) and MIL are actively protecting a predator,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yx4kfq/my_39m_expartner_34f_and_mil_are_actively/,all_ads,6,

I spent a lot of time and effort getting myself ready, mentally preparing, etc. and was really excited to be treated.

I ordered a couple items and ate normally, but suddenly, when the check came, the man I was with just looked at it and would not touch it.

I asked him if he was going to get it and he said no. I started panicking about getting in legal trouble because I didn't have any cash on me except for 20, and the meal was 100.

The guy then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay, and he said this was equality and seemed very vindictive, it was really uncomfortable. So I put in my card and he put in his, he told me we were splitting it.

Then the restaurant waitress came back and said they ""couldn't split it"" and that my card got charged for the WHOLE thing since his card happened to be locked. I also had to leave the tip since he refused to do so. I'm wondering if the waitress lied also and was lazy.

I would not have accepted the date if he told me we were splitting, but instead of splitting, he foisted the WHOLE thing on me and I felt trapped. Could I have just paid my own portion or asked her to void the bill and leave?

Or tell him that I have no money and I can invite another guy to pay for me? I like to be courted/wined dined and am still traumatized deeply by this experience. Could I have just left him there or demanded the bill be voided/and then just paid my share and suggested they call the police on him?

TL:DR: I was s3xu@lly ass@ulted by a close friend, but played the whole thing down for the sake of preserving the friendship dynamic and my wider group. Now the dynamic is gone anyway and I’ve lost my friends – how do I tell my best friend that I feel betrayed that she is still friends with him?

I (27F) have been friends with Marie (27F) and Chris (27M) since we started high school, but became quite close when we all went to the same uni. Marie and I consider ourselves best friends. For background, we were part of a bigger group of about 6 or 7 (guys and girls) and would hang out often. Marie Chris and I got even closer when we all went on a uni exchange together 4 years ago, and we would spend most weekends exploring our new city and going on trips. I genuinely loved them both and was so thankful that I had found two such amazing genuine friends.

About 3 years ago, Chris s3xua1ly ass@ulted me. In my country it’s not technically rap3 because he never managed to successfully penetrate me, but the intention was there and it was the most humiliating and degrading thing I’ve ever been through. It went for hours, and even though I wasn’t physically hurt, it shattered me. I was devastated that someone I knew and respected so much could treat me like I was worth less than nothing. 

Throughout the ass@ult I tried to find a balance of stopping it, whilst also not offending him or making it seem like I was accusing him of anything. This is what I’m most ashamed of; trying to do covert damage control whilst in the middle of my own f\*$king r\*pe. I did it because 1) I knew that outrightly accusing Chris of r\*pe would ruin my friendship with him but 2) more importantly the dynamic between Chris, Marie and me – which was so so important to me. 3) I didn’t want to put Marie in the position of choosing either as she hates drama and picking sides. 4) Also, Chris is very charismatic and likable, and deep down I knew that if our wider friend group had to choose, they would choose him. I didn’t want to lose my friends (I’m aware of how pathetic this is).

I told Marie about the ass@ult about 6 months after it happened, but stressed to her that I wanted things to remain the same between us all for the sake of our friendship and the wider group dynamic. I also ended up confronting Chris about it, and whilst he said he was sorry I know he’s not – he’s made absolutely no attempt to ever act sorry. Other people from our extended friend group know parts of it through word of mouth, but not everything. Chris and I have also unsurprisingly drifted apart, though this has been totally on his end, I have tried my best to remain friends so I can remain in the friend group.

Fast forward to a month ago and Chris has a birthday party. I’m not invited but everyone else, including Marie, is. After the assault I was still getting invited everywhere but it had slowly dwindled and now that Chris isn’t even pretending to like me anymore, I know the invites will stop altogether. I was devastated, like I’ve disrespected myself for years in order to keep my other friends, and it didn’t work. For me this is the last straw, I should have cut him off years ago and I know that. What hurt the most however is that Marie, knowing I wasn’t invited and knowing how much that would have hurt me, went to his birthday (and tried to hide it from me). 

Marie has always said she’s there for me, but throughout the years she’s said/done nothing to stand up for me. And by going to all the events I’m not invited to (especially the birthday) and saying nothing, she’s telling Chris &amp; everyone else that she’s fine with it. I’m so hurt that my best friend has never stood up for me, never told Chris that what he did to me was wrong. 

I feel betrayed by her, but at the same time I did tell her that I didn’t want anything to change between our friendship group so I can’t blame her? However, things have changed now and despite my best efforts I’m no longer part of the friend group, so I feel like the deal is off and now it’s her time to pick a side – not be neutral.

I don’t know if I’m expecting too much of her or if my hurt is justified, but how can I bring this up to her gently without offending her and sounding like a hypocrite.

We’ve had our ups and downs but somehow, we’ve managed to make it work.

So his ex is part of his friend group. They dont talk or meet regularly, just in group chats. I knew the dynamic beforehand as he was almost honest with me about the situation. I dont have a problem with them being within the same friend group, as long as the relationship is kept platonic. 

I’ve always made my feelings clear about this and that they should not go over the line - which as far as I know they don’t as they don’t talk privately. Obviously an ex is an ex and I’m not entirely 100% comfortable with the situation. 

However the thing is that she doesn’t like me and due to some things that have happened, I reciprocate the feeling. More so, I believe that both of them deep down still have some feelings for each other, as they passed through a lot together. Whenever I bring this up my boyfriend always assures me that he doesn’t feel anything towards her, and that she’s just his friend. 

He knows that this whole situation is a sensitive topic for me. Sometimes he passes comments or jokes around and they obviously bother me. Whenever I tell him to stop and to not mention her again or joke around, he gets defensive and starts telling me that I dont know how to take a joke. This pisses me off as I feel that he doesnt understand me. Even if its just a joke I find it disrespectful that he keeps on joking around about her.

My (23F) boyfriend (22M) of 2 years and good friend of 4 has hurt me many times, all in which were boundaries he crossed while we were together. He has used/saved photos of female friends for masturbating (lied to me for months saying he doesn't like men who do that, then confessed to it a year in), told me explicit details about his sex life with female friends I have to hang out with even when I've repeatedly asked him not to share those things with me, and more.

He is my best friend, I truly have never wanted to be with anyone else despite those things, because of how kind he would be to me in every other facet of our relationship and how much I enjoy being myself around him. 

We recently had a casual conversation about an ex he already knew about that resulted in him asking ""wait, did he c*m in you?"" referring to my ex. I answered yes, and asked why he worded it so vulgar, and why he seemed so offended. This is not information I kept from him and thought based on my past transparency that he knew this. 

He left for work and when he came home he wouldn't look at me, kiss me, or hug me. Proceeded to say things like ""I don't think you're gross, but...."" , and ""our sex no longer seems special""

Keep in mind he has had unprotected sex before with other girls, and his reasoning, as for why it is different for him is because he pulled out before ejaculation, and apparently he was not entirely comfortable with the situation (which, if he was pressured, that is so terrible, but nonetheless I have also been assaulted and don't think that changes anything about his unfairness.) In my past situations it was with trusted partners with the intention to pull out and sometimes things don't go as planned.

I asked him why it is okay for us to have unprotected sex, but it is not okay that I've had it with past people. I told him that this is extremely misogynistic, and he is not the first time I have been in love. He has since apologize profusely but I almost feel like the damage is done.

2. My fiancee is fantastic in every other way. On the pros and cons list, this issue is the only con.

My fiancee is bad at brushing her teeth. Toothbrushing is a habit that her parents never taught her. That's no excuse not to take care of your teeth, of course, but it does give context. She is meticulous about all other hygiene, just not her teeth.

She will usually brush once a day, but I have observed her not brush her teeth for up to two days. When she does brush, I don't think she's doing a good job either. She does go to the dentist regularly and has had 2 cavities filled. 

I don't know how to tell her that she needs to brush her teeth twice a day, she needs to floss, she needs to brush her tongue, and she needs to brush better. I have hinted without success. My biggest concern is that I will deeply offend and embarrass her and that by asking her to I will seem very controlling.

I don’t hate him at all, I don’t hate anyone honestly. My last relationship ended with a my ex ghosting me and came back after I was completely healed. I never got closure from him until he reached out and I stopped caring about him. Either way, on monday I bought him food but the restaurant was closed and since I was doing food deliveries I didn’t see the email till later. I told him that it was closed and that I would come on wednesday. Which is today. And he texted my friend saying he trashed the food and will demand for a restraining order to be in place ASAP. The only reason i even did this was because if I got him food we could talk. I let him know I was coming and I dropped it off hours ago and now he is messaging my friend saying I am stalking and being a burden. I thought by me giving him the food I originally bought would get him to let me get my stuff if I even left anything. I don’t believe he actually trashed anything but i don’t know.

I then found out he was seeing a girl (who looks similar to me)  When I found out about the new relationship I told him he had to leave the next day. He moved in with the girl and married her 10 days after he left the house.

The last time he came to my house to pick up the last of his stuff he was also telling me how much he loved and missed me and was rubbing my arms crying. 

He then asked me if he could have the title for the truck because he is moving to Idaho and needs 4 wheel drive. We both spent 50/50 on the truck. I told him I trust him to pay me and told him to pay me by the end of November. 

Now he is refusing to pay me and he thinks because I have the house he doesn’t need to pay me for the truck. But I bought the house with my money and he never married me.

We share a lot of similar interests and have hung outside of work once. We're still getting to know each other, but I hope we become good friends.

Enter our mutual colleage, lets call her Aileen, she'w fundamentally horrible. She talks shit about everyone, yells and slams things in the office, talks to clients with a nasty tone, gets upset every time the phone rings and she has to deal with a client (thats literally our job), etc. This woman is embroiled in drama constantly. She has major anger issues, i could go on. She has been written up and suspended previously. She's toxic. Others agree.

Her and my work friend started at the company together earlier this year. I've been here about a year and a half but mostly wfh due to pandemic. Our employer started requiring us to come in a couple days a week so I started getting to know Ana and we really clicked. Ana and Aileen had already established a pattern of taking their breaks together. I suppose Aileen kept her her temper mild in the beginning or else I cant imagine why Ana would have much to do with her. 

Anyways, the part that bothers me. Ana has confided to me that she strongly dislikes Aileens behavior, attitude, philosophy just everything fundamentally. The problem is that she is non confrontational and it's hard for her to straight up start ditching/avoiding Aileen. She would rather keep things civil and never let Aileen detect an ounce of her displeasure. I understand it can be hard to tell a person you don't care for them. I get it. So everyday Aileen will initiate break time. She'll say, ""hey Ana, you ready to go to break?"" And Ana always complies and goes with her. Another colleauge, lets say Olga, usually joins them. So 3 employees at the same time usually. Ana started inviting me to join her on the break. Sometimes I go but sometimes, I can't always join though bc we need to have a minimum number of reps available to take client calls. I've tried suggesting that Ana skip break with Aileen and just wait to go with me. Aileen would still have Olga to chat with (they are good friends-miraculous!). Ana however, couldn't possible deny Aileen by stating she would rather wait and go with me. Even though she secretly dislikes her very much and has told me in great detail about her annoyances. So alas, I go on break alone frequenelty. 

There are also occurrences where I was talking with Ana about something and Aileen butted in with whatever mental diarrhea was right at the front of her partially formed prefrontal cortex. Ana will immediately pay attention to what she is saying and respond before continuing with me. Ugh.

This has caused me to feel.. I dont know..jealous? I understand that she doesn't want to cause friction with Aileen but at the same time I want her to grow a pair and show that she's not afraid to choose me. I feel as though my feelings are childish but I guess I need validation. Didnt have many many friends growing up.

We essentially have lived together for the same amount of time and we get along great and love each other a lot. We plan on getting married one day and having a family together.

One thing that bothers me is that it feels like my girlfriend is just very inconsiderate about certain things. For example, last night she went out to dinner with a female coworker and was out late (got home at about 1:00am.) I have a difficult time going to sleep and it’s even more difficult for me to sleep when I know she’s out because I worry about her being safe. It’s not the first time she’s done this. Another time she was was flying back home from a bachelorette trip and expected me to pick her up late at night from the airport on a Sunday night when I had work the next day early. 2 months ago we celebrated her birthday and she flat out told me that I needed to stay up late with her and go drinking. When she saw I was visibly frustrated she got upset and said that I can never sacrifice my sleep for her.

She knows about the difficulty I have falling asleep but she always finds a way to make me stay up late (either intentionally or unintentionally.)",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7565916,public,self,Am I (25M) overreacting about my girlfriend (25F) being inconsiderate?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yx3w59/am_i_25m_overreacting_about_my_girlfriend_25f/,all_ads,6,

I'm not 100% sure how to identify contempt to be honest. I am 28F and he is 26M. Together 4.5 years and engaged for 1 year. 

My fiance has never called me names, said anything to put me down, ignored me, or said any mean jokes towards me. However, these are the things that he \*has\* said/done that may be red flags:

\- I brought up something over the weekend that I know kind of annoys him and we've talked about a million times before. He rolled his eyes when I started talking about it (I do have anxiety and tend to ask for reassurance constantly which I am working on). I think this is the first time he's ever rolled his eyes at me.

\- I said to him completely out of the blue ""Want to play chess tonight?"" and he replied ""umm sure...? Do you?"" and I said ""yeah!"" and he replied ""okay!"". But when he said ""ummm sure"" he sounded kind of like he was thinking ""wtf""

\- I asked him last night if he made a restaurant reservation for us and a group of his friends. And he replied ""No, I'm still waiting to hear back about times from them"" but sounded annoyed when he said it. 

\- I was driving us somewhere a few days ago and he ""you can go"" when the light turned green and sounded annoyed (we were running  slightly late and he HATES being late so maybe he was stressed)

\- On the weekend we were trying to find out how to play a video game on the computer. Technology was just being really annoying and dumb. I suggested a solution and said ""we could move the monitors downstairs"" and he replied ""that would be stupid""

Right after these comments or change in tone, he acts 100% normal and completely in love again. He always tells me how much he appreciates what I do and how much he loves me.

Most of the time it's the tone of his voice. He sounds annoyed sometimes when I ask him something. Are these red flag that I should confront him about?

We had a bad breakup but managed to get back together about 2 months ago.

My boyfriend is young and likes to go out and drink. For the last 4 weeks, he has gone out with friends and I'm not invited. I don't know any of his friends and I see that he has followed 5 women on Instagram.

He said he trusts me but that i am insecure. I go out, but it's usually with my same group of friends and i don't follow any single guys.

I don't want to accuse him but i don't really feel good about how things are happening.

He did cheat on me once, and i found out he followed her on Instagram (and still does) so I still feel paranoid/taking time to trust him.

What can I do?

I confessed I had feelings for him months after we met, he said let’s kind of date and my oblivious self thought we are committed. After the 2nd phone seggs he said let’s not date cause this relationship is difficult for him, of course I was heartbroken and posted it on a separate account when he found it, he apologized to me and I couldn’t sleep that night, months the cycle repeats again and I felt like my mental health is peaking down. So I tried to be his friend instead of a partner, but nope my dumbass self got into the cycle again.

He apologized for saying he’s always horny, and found out that I’m trans by my Twitter and he texted me he asked if I’m trans and i said yes I am I was scared to tell him, then he said I get it but that is important but he meant in a relationship it will be. I was confused what relationship, we never committed. But I didn’t tell him, we texted for 2 days but he didn’t text me.
