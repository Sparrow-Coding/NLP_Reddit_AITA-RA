Now granted my wife had a rough recovery and has only just gotten to a place where we can be intimate again. I never minded the wait it was for her health and our child. I knew this would happen and supported her the whole way. 

I told the group that it was fine and that we're happy with where we're at. Nothing more, no further details. 

After the meet was winding down the women (24) that made the ""joke""  offered her number and told me she's happy to help me out. I declined both the number and the offer and told her I'm happy with my marriage. 

I've since distanced myself from her and the group. I've told everyone that it was just sheduling problems and I would need to look for other options. 

Should I tell my wife or just let this die? I don't want her to freak-out thinking I'm looking to cheat or feel like she's not good enough but I'm also worried that this is gonna be a bigger problem and I can't just step back from it.

My (19f) boyfriend (18f) and I have been dating for over a year now. We love each other so much and I could not be happier. Our communication is great, and we both equally love and respect each other. I couldn’t ask for more. 

However, even since our first kiss, I haven’t felt anything when we kissed. I thought that would change as our relationship progressed, but it didn’t. I love cuddling him, and I like kisses a little bit when they are more lovey, not sexual. Though, even when I give them out of pure affection, I don’t really feel anything. 

When we make out, I absolutely hate it. Every second is “cringe” and I can’t stand it. He’s not the best kisser in the world, but he’s not bad either so i’m not sure it’s that. It pains me because I know he gets really excited during it and loves it, while I’m there secretly hating it. I know i’m not asexual or anything because when we get further-ly sexual, I can definitely feel things. It’s just kissing.

He talks about how much he loves kissing and how much it turns him on. It’s a necessary part of foreplay i feel like i’m missing out on not enjoying. When he gets so excited to do it I just think about how I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t think this is ever something I could bring up to him to be honest. I just know it would crush him and this is a me problem, not him.

What is wrong with me? It’s worth mentioning this is both our first relationship.

I noticed his Snapchat score was going up which means he is communicating with others on Snapchat…. Yes I checked this because this was not like him and I was genuinely worried about his safety…. That’s when I realized that I was being ghosted by my friend.

She’s a really great person, and we’ve been texting every day since, exchanging memes, getting to know each other pretty well, she’s been initiating most of the contact/hanging out outside of class etc (she works 2 jobs and does school part time). but our third time hanging out, was at this bar where you throw axes at the wall, she told me she was gay, which is kind of a bummer for but it’s fine, she’s really cool and I still would like to be friends with her. So I kinda backed off a bit, just keeping it platonic I feel like, but after that when texting her she’s send me selfies, started calling me “prince” and “cutie” and other names, and I’d reciprocate. I was a bit confused by this but was feeling happy about it, and we’d hang out after class every week. So 2 weeks ago we were at this dive bar, it was pretty late, we’re a few drinks in, I kinda noticed she was rubbing up on me a bit more, grabbing my arms a lot, asking if I was seeing anyone at the moment or if I was interested in anyone, and we’re playing pool, she’s “showing” me how to play like reaching over behind my back and guiding my shots for me. Then what really took me back was she got right in my face, looked me straight in the eyes and grabbed my arm and said “Mikey, you’re such a sweet heart and a cutie, if I wasn’t gay I’d totally hook up with you right now”. I was shocked a bit and it took me a second to reply but I said “I don’t know how to feel about that, but I think you’re really cute too” and we kinda just moved past it, she’s still acting like this all the way through the night, we ended up going for a walk that night and just talking, I didn’t make a move or anything, and then we both went our separate ways that night. We still talked for a couple days after that. But what she said was just in my mind all week, so I asked her what she was doing after school the next week, and she said she was hangin out with some friends and that I should come with, to which I replied I wanted to talk to her about something she said that night and was hoping it would be just us.(I didn’t say about what specifically which was a big mistake I realize now, but I wanted to talk to her about boundaries with saying stuff like that, I’ve been in therapy for awhile now and have been working on it) I guess this weirded her out and just left me on read, when I saw her at school she avoided me all day, and ignored me, so I gave her space for a couple days and texted her that I needed to talk to her, and how I felt about what she said that night, to which she replied she didn’t think it was a big deal, and she apologized for it (I wasn’t looking for one) I just said I hope we can move on from it and that we’re still cool. I don’t know, I feel like I was getting a lot of mixed signals from her, if I fumbled this girl, or if she’s just like this with everyone.

I don’t know Why I’m doing this right I post really. I just want your thoughts. So a couple years ago I was dating this guy. We broke up but still lived together since we lived in a house with four of our friends. I paid rent. he paid rent and it was always understood that one of us was going to move out, but it took a while. Fast forward to about five months later I start dating this new guy, but I’m still living there. My ex-boyfriend made up all the stuff about how I was still with him and I’m sure from my current boyfriend‘s perspective it look like it was real because I live there so why wouldn’t I. When in reality the rent was $125 a month and I was a broke college student that couldn’t afford to move anywhere else and he was a 30 year old man that had a job that paid about $20 an hour. Anyways things got messy I ended up moving out. I Ended up just being like it’s better to live at my sisters house for a while then to live here and just keep on having this happen. It has been three years since this whole issue and still to this day my current boyfriend brings up the fact that I lived with my ex-boyfriend and all of the stuff that he was telling him. So much so that we get into fights all the time. This point I am tired of dealing with this. He has put his hands on me, he has kicked me out of the house with no car in the middle of nowhere, he has called me every bad name in the book. If I had a dollar for every single time that he called me an overweight pig I would be a millionaire. And I am literally 125 pounds. We are going to Switzerland in about a week and a half. He is currently at his parents house taking care of their dogs. They’re going on a week trip for seven days and we are also going for seven days, so he’s going to their house to take care of their farm. Everything was going great. We were loving towards each other. We were excited for the trip. There hasn’t been really any fights or any issues for about a month now. And before that for a couple months, but some thing was brought up and again with the ex-boyfriend thing. Side note I have not talked or seen my ex-boyfriend in about 2 1/2 years since I’ve moved out. We have had no communication he has been blocked off my phone and all social media. And I think vice versa he probably blocked me too. It was a long term relationship since I was 17 and things got messy, so I understand and I’m sure he does too. So the topic of having a prostitute in Switzerland was brought up. I thought it was a joke. I was like “no I’m not paying for your prostitute lol.” He got all serious said that we weren’t sexually compatible and has had me on blocked for about 24 hours now. I should also sidenote this by he has cheated on me with a prostitute before, and I forgave him. And I am mostly think it’s because at the time I was so mentally fucked by him telling me I’m such a bad person for things that I didn’t even do. Going to Europe has been my dream for a long time so I’m not gonna give up $2000 plane tickets and the trip of a lifetime.

I was in gifted classes growing up, accelerated math classes growing up, etc. I understand jokes and concepts quickly. I can solve most riddles I’ve come across. More times than not, I’ve been considered the smartest person in the room. I’m just saying all of this to establish that I’m not an idiot. 

I got a new job last year where everyone is at or above my level of intelligence. I continued to operate at my old level where I wasn’t using my brain much because again, I always got things quickly. This caused me to miss a lot of stuff and have the people training me repeat things a lot which got me the reputation of slow. I allowed all the jokes to roll off my back at first because I thought it was in good fun. There is one particular girl who makes it her mission to point out every single mistake I make loudly. I like her outside of this as a person and we are friends but I don’t know what it is, she loves to point out all of my mistakes. She also makes mistakes, some I fix. Everyone there makes mistakes. But because of a combination of things that caused me to come off as slow (lack of sleep, thinking the job was easy so not applying myself, possible undiagnosed adhd, etc), I’m the only one who gets ridiculed. 

One of the guys there has recently started to make jokes to me about being dumb. For example, he told me I must have sniffed glue as a kid, that he wouldn’t put money on me regarding a debate I had with another girl, that I have a “sunk cost fallacy” approach to doing things because I don’t think outside the box etc. This guy is admittedly very smart. 
It’s starting to really irritate me and makes me think my coworkers really think I’m stupid. I don’t want this to become a bigger deal than it is and I don’t want the problem to just “go away” by going to my manager or hr about it. I want to prove my competence and have them change their minds about me. 
I’ve tried pointing out people’s mistakes but it just makes me feel like an asshole so I’ve stopped. 
I have since stopped making big mistakes or not understanding things quickly enough (in fact I complete tasks the fastest out of everyone there), but the jokes continue and the overall perception of me is that I’m dumb. I’ve never had this reputation and it feels strange af. 

I sometimes think of comebacks to these jokes hours later, but then it’s too late. I don’t know how to change their minds about me as it seems to be fun for everyone to joke around like this (I’ll admit I took part in it at first because it was funny). Now I want it to stop and for them to take me seriously and know that I’m smart.

I don’t know Why I’m doing this right I post really. I just am angry and just wanna know if I’m in the wrong. So a couple years ago I was dating this guy. We broke up but still lived together since we lived in a house with four of our friends. I paid rent. he paid rent and it was always understood that one of us was going to move out, but it took a while. Fast forward to about five months later I start dating this new guy, but I’m still living there. My ex-boyfriend made up all the stuff about how I was still with him and I’m sure from my current boyfriend‘s perspective it look like it was real because I live there so why wouldn’t I. When in reality the rent was $125 a month and I was a broke college student that couldn’t afford to move anywhere else and he was a 30 year old man that had a job that paid about $20 an hour. Anyways things got messy I ended up moving out. I Ended up just being like it’s better to live at my sisters house for a while then to live here and just keep on having this happen. It has been three years since this whole issue and still to this day my current boyfriend brings up the fact that I lived with my ex-boyfriend and all of the stuff that he was telling him. So much so that we get into fights all the time. This point I am tired of dealing with this. He has put his hands on me, he has kicked me out of the house with no car in the middle of nowhere, he has called me every bad name in the book. If I had a dollar for every single time that he called me an overweight pig I would be a millionaire. And I am literally 125 pounds. We are going to Switzerland in about a week and a half. He is currently at his parents house taking care of their dogs. They’re going on a week trip for seven days and we are also going for seven days, so he’s going to their house to take care of their farm. Everything was going great. We were loving towards each other. We were excited for the trip. There hasn’t been really any fights or any issues for about a month now. And before that for a couple months, but some thing was brought up and again with the ex-boyfriend thing. Side note I have not talked or seen my ex-boyfriend in about 2 1/2 years since I’ve moved out. We have had no communication he has been blocked off my phone and all social media. And I think vice versa he probably blocked me too. It was a long term relationship since I was 17 and things got messy, so I understand and I’m sure he does too. So the topic of having a prostitute in Switzerland was brought up. I thought it was a joke. I was like “no I’m not paying for your prostitute lol.” He got all serious said that we weren’t sexually compatible and has had me on blocked for about 24 hours now. I should also sidenote this by he has cheated on me with a prostitute before, and I forgave him. And I am mostly think it’s because at the time I was so mentally fucked by him telling me I’m such a bad person for things that I didn’t even do. Going to Europe has been my dream for a long time so I’m not gonna give up $2000 plane tickets and the trip of a lifetime.

We’ve been together for 6 years. He’s very supportive financially, and in terms of bettering myself. I had a really bad relationship with weed and he helped me take a long break that I’ve been on for a while now. When my job fired me because i had been there too long and started making stupid mistakes he supported both of us financially. he goes out there every night and picks up taxi rides then comes home at like 7am. I cook and clean for him while I’ve been unemployed. He can also be really cute and sweet offering to pay off my debt so we can be closer to our financial dreams. He’s extremely handsome and knows it 🙄 which gets kind of annoying because he comes off as kind of conceited and thinking he’s doing a favor for me by being with me.. But he has a lot of good traits and we’ve been through a lot together. Only problems are he’s never really made me feel safe with him emotionally. Lately things have changed and he tries atleast 35% more to be there for me emotionally but I already feel kind of jaded from the first 5 years of our relationship. He used to break up with me and then get back together when he’s mad or tell me i shouldn’t disrespect him but then when i tell him something hes done or said is disrespectful it’s a long as conversation that starts with him telling me i’m overreacting. Most times lately i don’t even say anything because it’s more draining to try to get through to him. It’s even hard for me to feel turned on by him because I don’t feel safe and I know it’s just a matter of time before we argue and he goes back to ignoring me walking 10feet ahead of me when we go anywhere etc.. In the past I used to sneak around and see other guys I even cheated a couple times. I know it was really wrong to do that but I didn’t even feel like he was there for me. he doesn’t let me forget it though. Lately we’ve been having conversations about longterm relationship desires like marriage and children and I told him I was concerned about his views on women. He told me he felt like he couldn’t get over my past cheating and even said I should give him grace if he cheats but i should even think about it because i cheated in the past and he takes it differently as a guy. Also he feels like his culture allows him to be with many wives so i should know that and just be grateful if he only had a slip up every once and a while. (his mother abandoned him at birth and it led to him kind of mistreating lots of women in his past seeing himself as the prize and watching a lot of kevin samuels type content and saying men gain nothing from marriage) He says things every once and a while like “men build everything valuable in the world” which turns me all the way off but it’s hard because I get lonely too sometimes and I try really hard not to talk to other guys but I find myself on dating sites talking to people just to feel something and then deleting them. Everyone in my family says he’s a good guy but they don’t know that he literally calls my people (African Americans ) uncultured baby mamas and again it turns me all the way off. most times i just go through the motions of being in a relationship but i don’t actually know if anything will come of us and it makes me unattached. the last time we had sex was a month ago and I keep having dreams about other guys because i’m sexually deprived. My mom told he not to worry because he’s such a responsible protective and caring guy and things might change as he heals his trauma. 

Honestly i’m annoyed with people just being like “girl leave him” not even knowing my financial situation or the reality of dating in the black community and all this gender war shit, but i’m not closed to that kind of advice if it comes with deeper consideration or realism. can anyone give realistic me advice? ESPECIALLY from anyone nigerian or otherwise black? Am i wasting my time or missing out on a great guy with only a few flaws? Keep in mind i’m not perfect either im very stubborn and will literally intellectually sauté anyone if i even think they’re saying some conservative or anti black shit. then again i’ve worked in retail for a long time and he’s supported me as i’ve been studying for a new career and pursuing my passions of multimedia design film photography and fashion. he also is my longest relationship.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7514062,public,self,"In a relationship, political disagreements, ignoring games, emotionally immature, his way or the highway",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yrx98t/in_a_relationship_political_disagreements/,all_ads,6,,

Things have been good - really good - we have great emotional and sexual chemistry, we share similar interests and outlooks on things

We spend quite a lot of time together and when we’re not together we’re usually texting back and forth which I enjoy because we set some time apart to talk to each-other about our days, say good night and good morning. 

I care about her a-lot but I can feel her pulling away and I can tell she’s just not into it… she’s not there to support in me the way I support her, our sex life has gone down the drain, her responses to my texts have been growing more scarce and meaningless (usually she won’t respond to what I say and will just give me a reaction like lol or oh)

She’s working a new job and I know that she’s been busy, I know it’s important to her and she’s working really hard but I can’t help but feel like I’m losing her and it’s making me upset

The other day she snapped at me about something silly and we haven’t talked much or seen each-other since then. I figure she was just stressed but it’s eating at me because we haven’t set any time apart to make up or communicate in any way.

It’s possible that she’s sick of me and needs a break after seeing me so much but she just feels cold and I don’t feel like she cares about me anymore like she did when we first started talking

My Uncle is rich, like he has a Lambo rich and a lake in his house. Some 8y ago he invited all the male members of the family to his 50year birthday aniversary to Vegas, all paid. I 40m, but oldest of cousins, went very gladly as it was a nice opportunity to mingle with my family, even if it was a very misoginistic thing to do. My mom (his sister) and my only Vegas-age cousin were left behind.
The weekend was nice, but it made me realize I have nothing in common with them. I was constantly assaulted for not moving my poor ass to the USA and come and work for them/be their cheap highly educated employee. When I left I felt like I was over them.. and went NC.  

Then 5y ago I got married and had a big fight with my mother which made me go temporarily NC with her. This only improved this year now that I have a baby.

So, I just received an invitation to this Uncle's wedding (all paid for, even plane) for me, my wife and baby. Honestly I immediately declined, but my mom found new love for us and is pushing very strongly for us to go. I dont know if it was my older uncles death last year, the baby or what.. but she says we must leave the past behind and let the family meet us.

I think we should not go, she said if its to difficult, I can go alone.. which is worse. But Im having second thougths on if I should go. They used to be nice people, but money has made them very egocentric.

My girlfriend and I are polyamorous. We’ve been dating for about a year and she has been dating her now of today ex for about ten years. He has had other partners but freaks out every time she has a boyfriend. 

He’s been freaking out. Lashing out at her. Becoming more controlling. And a few weeks ago, as she told me, he raped her. He doesn’t call it that. Nor does his other girlfriend. My girlfriend feels bad cause she “just froze” I tried to tell her bodies do that. She has nothing to be ashamed of. 

Due to this and other things, her friends and I have been trying to find her a way out. We were going to do it slow and wait for a moment for all of us to get her stuff and move her to a friends, till she could move with me. 

I’ve been supporting her. Telling her she has nothing to be ashamed of. She came to me and asked me to be the father. 

She was going to wait until we as a group had enough to get her out. But her other boyfriend suspected something when she went to stay at her moms house for some time. 

I don’t know what to do. I told her I would absolutely treat any child of hers as a blessing. I volunteered to take her to the doctor. Sell my truck. Take her into my home and support her and the baby. I got her prenatals and a journal. I’ve been processing how she feels each day. 

She says I’m a treasure but loving her is easy. I don’t want her to be going through this. One night I held her and told her everything will be okay. She told me she actually believes it with me.

So I (24m) have been with my gf (24f) for nearly 2 years. We have ups and downs but I love and respect her so much and want us to be the best we possibly can. We have gone through so much together already and we have both grown in so many ways.   


There is one issue that has been causing me to feel more distant than normal and slightly resentful towards her; that being that I (for the last 3-4 months) have found myself being overcome with the lust of being with other women (sexually). It makes me feel afraid of committing to my  partner and makes me feel trapped.  


I have read so many posts over the past few months, all ranging from ""It's just biology"" to ""You are a scumbag and your girlfriend deserves better"" so I am still feeling very anxious and unsure about what to do. I know it's 'normal' to find other people attractive whilst you're in a relationship, but please understand that this is an intense, deep kind of pattern of intrusive thoughts that ruin my day and cause me to feel less attached and make me value my partner less. I know that I may be struggling with insecurities about validation and commitment, but they are very real; intoxicating thoughts.  


I am a dumb 24 year old guy living in a big city. I'm not perfect and I just want to live my best life whilst also not hurting anyone, especially my girlfriend. I honestly love my girlfriend and haven't told her this, because it would be useless and just hurt her. I actively want to STOP having these thoughts and just focus on my partner. We are actually on a break right now because it got so bad (the feeling of being trapped/missing out on life/wasting me life) that we decided it would be the best option. I didn't know how to cope with these thoughts so I just became distant and reactive. I hate that, I don't want to do this to her. What the hell do I do?  


I'm talking to her again in about a week - we have been on a no-talking break (we are still technically together) but I still have these thoughts... BUT AT THE SAME TIME I do not want to let go of her! I do find her attractive, it's just other women have... you know... bigger this, better that, nicer this, blah blah. I know it's bloody stupid but these are the thoughts in my head. I feel so guilty that I might throw away a good relationship just so I can fuck around and indulge, or is this the universe telling me that I need to fuck around with other women? God this sucks. (I also have ADHD I don't know if this changes anything but I've read it can make dilemmas like this worse).

I (27F) have been with my bf (27m) for almost 12 years.

My bf has always had trouble falling asleep and always watches videos in bed with the sound on (very low). I have told him many times that imo he should see a doctor for his sleeping trouble but he never went and is always on his phone when falling asleep (I am quite convinced that it doesn’t help him sleep… quite the opposite).

99% of the time it doesn’t bother me as I fall asleep very easily within seconds. I am not bothered by any light, sound or anything really.
But some nights I really cannot sleep (like last night) and I find the sound of the videos very disturbing as I am constantly focused on it…
When I asked my bf to exceptionnaly turn the sound off tonight as I couldn’t sleep he told me to stop complaining and put the sound to the minimum.
I then asked him again to turn the sound off or put some headphone on and long story short he is now watching his video on the couch in the living-room.

It is the first time in 12years that one of us goes to « the couch » and it makes me very sad that it is for something that stupid.
Should I just have tried harder to sleep and not said anything or proposed something else?
I don’t feel like I was asking too much and being an asshole for asking him an effort this time. 

I would like advices on how to make him realize that his falling asleep troubles might greatly be because he watches his phone while falling asleep (maybe I am wrong). I have tried talking to him multiple times but was never sucessful inducing a change. 

I think we both could benefit from an imrovement of his sleep. Maybe some people have had the same issues and have overcome this.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 years now, we live together. we’ve had some pretty rough moments, some because of her being really high maintenance and needy, and some because of me being a selfish and lying person. Overall you could say we had a really toxic relationship at times, but right now it kinda stabilized.

Still she’s (to a lesser extent) high maintenance and needy. And all those years dealing with her kinda made me tired. I know guys who would not tolerate her attitude for a week. She demands a lot of attention and gives the silent treatment/ sulk if she’s not receiving it.

The issue is since the beginning of our relationship until now, i’ve never had the balls to confront her when she does it. I lack the energy to resist her little mind games and I always cave. She knows perfectly how to make me feel bad for not giving her the attention she needs, I can’t not apologize and cave when she sulks.

I’m tired. Over the year i’ve pretty much run out of love for her, romantically and physically. We don’t often have sex, I don’t really feel like it most of the time.

We act cute together during the day, we say we love each other all day long but I’m not sure I mean it anymore. I just say it because we always said it.

I daydream about being single every day now. Not because I want to fuck other girls, I don’t care about that. But because I wanna enjoy my 20s alone, without having someone by my side everyday, without having every decision I make revolves around her, without following her way of life, her living standards, etc.

We got together right when I finished highschool, like literally right after. I never got this period of self discovery, being by myself, discovering my independence, thinking about me and what I want in life as a singular person.

No I got into the relationship, totally hooked on love and I gave up my young adult freedom.

Now I feel trapped because I’m stuck following her plan for the future, and because i’m spineless and because i never got to explore myself, I never told her what I want, I just followed her. I don’t take decisions in life, she does, I’m just the passenger.

Now she wants to move in a big ass city because of her job. She always dreamed of living in the city. But not me, I hate the idea of living there, it looks so fucking stressful, sad and overwhelming. Too much people, too much noise. I grew up in a small city near the mountains, thats what I want.

But again I didn’t say anything. I shut up and nod. Because I never got to to know me.

I have no dream, no career, I’m an ex addict, I have anxiety disorder, I don’t do sport of any kind, I’m boring, scared of everything. The only thing I know how to do is follow someone else’s dream and plans.

Now I feel trapped because we’re moving soon, I’ll have to get a job I don’t like, in a city I don’t like, with someone I’m not in love with anymore. I’m severely depressed and I wish I could have the courage to say fuck it, leave her, and fucking explore life on my own and figure out who i am before starting something.

But I’m can’t do it because I’m spineless.

I have known him since we were very young but only got closer in the past few years. Around a few years ago we both had feelings for one another but things got messy and we never dated. We were not on talking term. I eventually moved on and had another relationship. We both started talking again during my relationship but it was nothing more than just friends. My past relationship was really messy as my ex was very controlling and manipulative so my bestf who is my bf currently would give me advice but i never took them and regret it. 

So fast forward to currently basically i have known my bf for very long even before we started dating. The first month it was great and purely innocent. My bf is a very dry texter, he doesn't like to text much either. We don't live together and have our own busy lives so it's hard to find time for one another. But during the second month or so he kept asking for pics if u get what i mean, and i didn't feel obligated to send them but i did either way, sometimes it felt like he only got excited to text me when he got pictures. My bf is a very straightforward person, if a rs isnt working out he would be very frank about it as he is the type of person to not drag things out if it isn't working out. So for the past few days he's been more dry than usual, usually he texts me at night when he's free from his job and he dosent text in the morning usually because he wakes up really late. And for the past few 2-3 days he's been full on ghosting me , i tried texting him on other social media platforms to just get left on seen. He is not replying my friends either.

I’m 19f and I live with my two brothers Asher (29m) and Stephen (35m). We live at Stephen’s house, with his two kids. (Stephen was married for a while but his wife cheated on him, and he left her.Kind of irrelevant background info.)

Asher started dating this girl Brittany, who’s 22f. I love her, I think she’s really nice and funny and sweet.  I don’t know if this makes sense though but it’s almost like Asher DOESNT like her? he’s really controlling and does and says little things to make her feel bad. She’s really pretty but whenever she goes out without wearing makeup he’ll make a comment on how she looks sick or frumpy. She’s really small and thin, but Asher constantly makes comments about what/how much she eats. He does it so subtly though and if she ever said anything he makesa big deal about HER making a big deal about things, being too sensitive, etc so she doesn’t say anything anymore. last night I heard someone crying on the patio (my room faces it and I had my window open last night) and Stephen was out there hugging someone for a while so I thought it was one of his kids but then I went downstairs and  Asher was really pissed saying that Stephen wasn’t letting him talk to her.  

Then Stephen came in said that if Asher didn’t start treating Brittany better he was going to kick him out. Asher said Stephen was making things up and was trying to sleep with Brittany and trying to convince everyone that Asher is a bad boyfriend. Brittany got really upset at the fighting and told everyone to let it go and just get along but now things are SUPER tense and it’s awkward.

I’m not sure how gay friendly this sub is. If you’re no ally just go away.

TL;DR: My bf (28M) and I (28M) have never met up due to covid and his bad cancer, we met online several months before the pandemic. He’s in the ICU (again) right now and he also has been of the mind recently that we’re too incompatible and we may break up soon. I don’t know how to help him or how to help our relationship.

This is a long one probably. I’ll try and keep it short, but there’s just so much going on.

I (28M) am not sure what I can do for my boyfriend (28M). He is in the ICU. Again. He’s severely immunocompromised from bad cancer and treatments. He was diagnosed a few months before the pandemic. We met online several months before then, and ironically only live about an hour apart. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do regarding his sexuality and spirituality at the time (I was in the same boat before, too, so I respected that and let him take his time dealing with that his way and in his time). He eventually came to terms with his sexuality and was confident in wanting to be with me and coming out. The pandemic had already hit, though, and so we couldn’t risk his health by being around each other. Even after vaccines were readily available, he had to keep up the same safeguards. He wasn’t healthy enough to get vaccinated, and even to this day he must maintain the same level of caution and wariness as during the height of the pandemic. So, we have yet to be able to ever spend any time in each other’s company. We’ve been in love for a long time and have planned on spending the rest of our lives together.

The past few months we’ve had some difficulties in our relationship, though. Things that I feel like don’t warrant a breakup and that we can work/live with, but that he feels makes us too incompatible. We both have plenty of our own shortcomings. He can be impatient and clingy and get angry; I can be lackadaisical and procrastinate, have MDD (medicated) and have untreated ADHD (can’t afford right now). He’s stopped saying things like “love you” the past two or so months because he says he doesn’t want to lead me on if things don’t work out. He often feels guilty for us having to wait all these years and not having been able to be around each other yet. Our plan this year was that after his second upcoming bone marrow transplant (first one didn’t take), after his recovery regardless of the result we’d start spending time together and move in together by the Spring 2023. This would obviously mean a big shift in my daily life to ensure he wasn’t at any risk (which I’m so ready for).

Last year in October he got COVID despite every effort. He was in the ICU for over two weeks, and he almost died. He barely started recovering before he would’ve been intubated, and it would’ve killed him. Last month he went on a big business trip with his boss and the CEO of his company to Europe for two weeks that they invited him to and insisted he go (his boss knows his condition, CEO doesn’t know details but surely they noticed something while on the trip). Ironically, he works in healthcare. We talked about it a lot and he determined his career would stagnate if he didn’t go. I’m so livid with his boss and CEO. I can’t put it into words. On the last day traveling back he started feeling a little sick. Over the next two days he had some flu symptoms and once he broke a fever he had to go into the ER. By the next day it escalated to pneumonia and he’s in the ICU on a high amount of oxygen and has been there the past week. I don’t know what I can do for him or what to think about the future of our relationship.

This relationship has been so hard for both of us, too. His family has disowned him and stopped contacting him (not even over his sexuality, he never even came out to them, they’re just petty, but they’re still his family so it super sucks), and he doesn’t have contact with any old friends after all this time besides his roommates (who are really great, but one is kind of homophobic and doesn’t know he’s gay yet). He’s insisted on keeping things entirely private, so I don’t share any details at all. My closest friends only know that his health has prevented us from seeing each other yet, and anyone else either gets no info or is kept oblivious. I also don’t get to know if address or phone number (we talk through other apps), though he does know my address and has sent me things for birthdays/holidays. For birthdays and holidays I’ve done a lot of digital art related things for him. I studied a lot of digital media and am pretty good with Photoshop/Illustrator and other tools and they’ve brought him so much joy. Something else that he’s loved over the past year is that we’ve had a more open relationship. He brought it up to me, and I wasn’t objectively against it, but didn’t want to do that just because he felt guilty for the idea that I haven’t had physical anything over the past few years – which didn’t bother me too much despite being difficult. He convinced me that wasn’t why he wanted to try it (although I’m sure it certainly helps). Obviously, this has meant that I’m the only one getting with other guys, but that’s what he genuinely enjoys most about it anyway, and it’s worked well for us. (Yes, I’m safe, on PrEP, get checked, etc.) Lately he’s mentioned things like how with some of these guys I could legitimately be dating and would be able to pursue things with them without the limitations we have. I don’t care and he’s the one I want to be with, and I tell him as much. I’m with him every step of the way.

There’s so much more always going on, especially after all these years, but those are the biggest points and the gist of the situation. I don’t want to lose my partner – whether from breaking up or from him dying. I’m so terrified for his health, and so irate with his boss/CEO. I think he wants to end things, but he maybe also doesn’t know if he actually should, it may be too painful for him or doesn’t know how/when to do it – and I think neither of us want to go through that while he was on his trip or while he’s currently in the ICU (especially because he can’t take his oxygen mask off to talk. I just do not know what I can do to help him get through things with his health right now. And I don’t know what to do to try and save our relationship either…so close to when it would make the biggest turn and we’d be together. I’m not sure if he needs to break up with me but I need to rip the band-aid off for him. I just don’t know. I’m so stressed and so scared for his life and for our relationship. I’m setting up Christmas decorations at my place (he loves Christmas and decorations so much) today and will take pics and send them to him and I know he’ll enjoy it so much. I’m not looking for a magical answer from some random Reddit stranger – and I’m certainly not making my major life decisions based on the advice of internet strangers, but maybe I can get some help opening my mind to what I CAN do, I can get some relief getting this off my chest. Please, no excessive pity, no criticisms on him or our relationship being real (I’m not wasting text space here to try and argue that to you, I don’t have time for that bullshit).",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7513974,public,self,How do I help my s/o and our relationship?

I’ve met his family, all of his friends, visa versus. We spend every Th-M together. We usually talk on the phone every night and text throughout each day we aren’t together. He tells me he cares, I am a priority, he will regret losing me, and that we have a deeper connection/bond than he has ever had with another woman. He is great at listening when I present emotional concerns regarding his lack of commitment to me, however, he is still sleeping with other women. He told me he doesn’t care about them, but he struggles with being exclusive and doesn’t want to hurt me by lying about it. I love him deeply and do not date, nor do I want to date anyone else. I know the risks associated with the relationship, but he and I are very attached. Mutual friends tell me he always talks about me, brags about me, and they see how we are with each other and want our relationship to work out. I just get sick knowing there are some nights (usually one night per week) that he completely checks out and I am left behind knowing he is with someone else. No matter how hard I have tried, I haven’t been able to break things off with him. Losing him breaks my heart and makes me physically sick. I am supposed to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with him and his family, but knowing he is able to compartmentalize, not think of me, and find pleasure with other women drives me crazy. I want to get out of my head and just enjoy what we have. I repeat, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be, just let it be.

I need some tough love from an internet stranger because I really don’t have a strong support system in real life right now. 
For context, we have been together almost 8 years. We starting living together after about 1 year and got engaged after 3.5 years. We’ve been engaged for almost 3.5 years (2019). He proposed to me the day after I found that he was looking at a girl’s bikini pictures from 2015 (he had them bookmarked in his history tab…this girl wasn’t a model or influencer it was someone he knew). My knee jerk reaction was to say no but I love him and said yes and was ready to put that aside since he had never made me insecure before then. Every time I was excited to start wedding planning or showing him Pinterest boards I made he seemed disinterested which made me not want to try to plan anymore, so I put it on the back burner. I won a free engagement photo shoot in summer of 2020 and when I told him I was clearly very excited his response was “I’ll go”. We got the edited photos back and I thought they’d be cute on our first Christmas card together and while I was making the card his response was “is this really who we are now?” About 2 weeks after that he TEXTED me while he was at work saying he’s not happy with his life and doesn’t know what to change about it so he wants to break up. I was absolutely floored and knew I wasn’t about to get broken up with over a text message, so I didn’t answer. When he got home he said “I’m fine now, I don’t want to break up”. We barely talked about it after that but I decided to move on and mentally prepared myself for an eventual breakup. Most of 2021 was spent just existing in each others presence, not really spending time together. There would be a few random times when I’d be petting our dog or we’d be sitting in the car and he would break down crying but wouldn’t talk. He didn’t want to hang out with me or our friends, he just wanted to play video games or watch YouTube. Fast forward to Christmas of 2021, he was the most miserable I’ve ever seen, he couldn’t even fake a smile. I started mentally preparing myself for what I thought would be a breakup, but it didn’t happen. Eventually I realized his misery was causing me to spiral because I was putting in so much effort to make him happy and it went unnoticed and unappreciated. I stretched myself so thin to try to make him happier. 
The whole year of 2022 I’ve been advocating for myself in this relationship, asking for communication, asking for the occasional romantic gesture (flowers or going on a date that I don’t have to decide every detail), and telling him everything that’s been eating me up inside about our past. This past summer, I got fed up of begging this man to put effort into us and receiving nothing so I asked for a week of space. I realized that I was holding a lot of resentment from the past things he said (or didn’t say) and did (or didn’t do). He has said a lot of hurtful things to me in the past which I’ve internalized and my brain loves to play those things on a loop when I’m feeling down. One of the days of this break, I went back to our house to pick our dog up and he looked at me like he wanted me dead. He told me he had been “plagued with the thought of whether or not he wanted to be with me”. We had about an hour long “fight”, I went back to the place I was staying for the night crying and absolutely sure we would be over when I went back the next day. The next day, he bought me flowers and apologized, saying he knew he wanted to be with me and he knew it would take a while for me to trust him again and he would be patient with me. Then he took me out to eat for the first time since 2019 (I wish I was kidding). Since then he hasn’t done anything. We’ve gone out a few times but I’ve planned and paid for it all. 
I’ve been in a depressive episode this past few weeks and we talked a few days ago and I brought up breaking up. He assured me he wants to spend the rest of his life with me but my brain just doesn’t want to believe it anymore. I want so badly for this to work out but I don’t know how it can if I’m not getting my needs met until he thinks I want to break up. The thought of him being with someone else or the thought of me ever dating someone else isn’t exciting to me, it’s terrifying. I know the choice is to forgive him for everything or let him go, and I would let him go if I knew we would get back together eventually. I’m so afraid that breaking up would be the wrong decision and I know if I broke up with him it would probably be done for good.

i have worked hard to be a better friend, family member, and eventually partner.  i was in a healing / self actualization period of my life and wasn’t looking for a relationship.  but i think part of me felt really alone and i enjoyed his company. 

i was naive and moved quickly in the beginning of this relationship (relationships are notorious for opening up old wounds, not an excuse just explanation). we ended up getting a dog together after we had been exclusive for a couple of months.  i was so excited because i can’t have a dog at my apartment but he’d be both of ours and stay with him.  however, now a year later, because i care so much about my dog and don’t want to lose him - i feel stuck (i’m graduating in the spring and plan to move out of the city and take my dog so part of me is trying to stick it out until then).  i feel like if i leave the relationship, i lose my dog

however, we have been together for about a year and i still feel like emotionally we aren’t on the same level.  i can elaborate more on this but i want to focus on a situation that occurred recently.

we went on a break bc a situation occurred where i felt used by him.  i told him i needed space and he needed to sort his shit out.  a week or so later we talked about things and i told him the only 2 boundaries i needed him to respect if we were getting back together would be: 1. make sure the dog never goes without food or a place to stay 2. don’t put me in a position where i feel obligated to dish out money just bc u were irresponsible

so last night i go over to his apartment and see there is no dog food.  i ask him what the dog ate for dinner.  he quickly and sharply answers “food.”  He became defensive when I asked about what he was going to do about the dogs breakfast since this was later at night (he buys the food and i pay for the insurance along with pretty much everything else so that’s all really expected of him…)  The next morning I decided to walk and feed the dog for him so he could get extra sleep before work.  I went to feed the dog and there was no food or anything in the fridge I could give to him.  I ended up feeding him a can of peas to hold him over and then ordered a bag of dog food to be delivered later that day.

later i went over while i thought he was at work just to stop by and feed the dog since he didn’t really eat breakfast as usual.  my partner was home from work early bc he didn’t feel good.  he could tell my mood was off and asked what was wrong.  i told him i was upset/annoyed that the dog had no more food and that I felt like i was put in a place where i had to purchase it for him.  we vowed to take care of him.  we are his whole life and he doesn’t deserve to suffer because someone else was irresponsible.

he would tell me “i don’t have the $ rn” or “i was gonna get it later!” but it’s just like, knowing the boundary i set as well as just taking care of your pet, should you budget his food in money and time wise?

he would say “sorry, but…” or deflect.  He often turns the situation onto me as if somehow i am to blame.  He would say that he would’ve found something in the kitchen to give the dog and get the food later.  Maybe he would have, but I don’t want to sleep on the fact that my dog might go hungry that night / day.

I left after feeding the dog and I haven’t talked to him since.  Not really sure what to do.  So might as well ask strangers on reddit

I always try to take responsibility for when I do wrong, it is part of being emotionally mature and I feel like he just can’t do that.

Long read, I guess.

I’m a female, was in a relationship with a girl for a year a few years back. I was madly in love and thought it was mutual. We met online, the attraction was so strong that we ended up at hers in less than 2 hours. Since that day we would seen each other almost every other day, and every date felt like the best day ever. At some point she started to get very sick and could not figure out the reason behind it, we would end up in the emergency room a few times, and she became very anxious and depressed. I tried to be with her as much as I could, but she decided to end the relationship. I tried to make things better but she became very mean at first and then just disappeared from my life. Like she would not talk to me and just stopped replying. 

I did not get the closure that I needed and eventually ended up seeing a therapist about it. It took me some work, and lots of tears but eventually I opened up to casual dating and later on met my current partner. 

So, of course, classic, my ex contacted me when I was about half a year into my current relationship. We met and talked about the past, she said she was at a very bad place mentally and could not keep up with our relationship at that point. As much as I still do not appreciate being ghosted, I do remember her being in a terrible mental state dealing with work, health and family issues. I was with her whenever she needed me, but, I assume, she needed space. Anyway, I learned how to forgive and understand. I couldn’t help myself but went out with her a few times, but it was mostly just casual talk, nothing inappropriate from my end despite her not-very-subtle hints. I said “no” to her on multiple occasions when she wanted me to come over to hers for “a movie”, or wanted to “come up” to mine for a washroom/glass of water. 

A few days later, after our last walk, she called me and said that she actually got a new place, a new job, and a dog that I always wanted because wants us to try again. I explained to her that she is a little too late, I’m in a new relationship, it’s been almost 2 years since our breakup, and even though I do have feelings for her, I can’t cheat on my partner. 

So we cut our conversations short and would only send occasional “happy birthday”/“Merry Christmas”. The point is - she never left my mind. I would literally think about her all the time since she came back into my life. It’s been 2,5 years now. 

About half a year ago, I had a terrible breakdown - work has been hard on me, my family is in a war zone in another country and my current partner did not have much capacity to handle it. I felt extremely lonely and messaged my ex just saying that I feel bad for the way I handled her asking me to get back together, I should have been more understanding and I don’t want her to feel like diminish everything she did to turn her life around. And she was and is the biggest love I’ve ever had, but sometimes love is not enough and there are many other factors.

She thanked me and wrote a few words of support.

I recently bumped into her and asked her out for a coffee to catch up. It went well and was friendly. One thing - she asked me - why don’t I have a ring on since I’ve been with my partner for over 3 years and she knows how much I want kids and family. So I just joked about something like “it’s not the time yet” and so. She smiled and said, “when I called you back then, I wanted to marry you. I was ready.”.

A few days after that, I asked her if she wants to meet up one more time, she took forever(and I mean - over a day) to reply to each message I sent and eventually said that even though she enjoyed time with me, she does not think she wants it to become a regular thing. I thanked her and we haven’t talked since. 

I’m lost. My partner is trying to take steps into getting in line for IVF as she knows I’ve always wanted to be a mom. But now I’m slowing down as I am not sure whether I make the right decision. 

I miss my ex terribly. I almost feel like I’m getting to my pre-therapy stage when I have nightmares about her leaving me again. I almost feel like deep inside she would want to give it a try if I were single, but it almost feels like a terrible idea to end a relationship my partner and I worked so hard for just for “a try”.

Even when we had a great time together I had thoughts like ""This is surely going to end but when and how?"". I knew that the future didn't look very bright. We already were close to a breakup couple of times before but overcame that and recently she told me that she was also considering breakup but would prefer to continue and overcome the difficulties (God I wish she would be the one breaking up). 
I can't imagine the pain she is experiencing. But I felt that it is better to end now rather than 1 or 2 years after as the pain would feel even more unbearable then. I thought that it would be best for me to progress without relationships even though our relationships were comfortable and convenient. I needed more time and resources to myself and also thought that I am not ready to settle down for now and can't imagine a future not only with her but with anyone.
How do I cope with that?

Partner of 10 years pushed me this evening. Never laid hands on me before btlut he's been having anger issues the last 2 years so we are going to couples therapy. Anger issues as in getting mad at topics raging about them to me then shouting at me for not giving the right response.

We were out at a pub quiz with my parents. We both drank quite a bit. It was a good evening. On the way home he realised ge couldn't make a cigarette because he'd left stuff at home so he started ""jokingly"" running off quite far with me calling him back pretty desperately. It's black out and we live in an unsafe area that I don't feel comfortable walking in alone in the dark.

We had a bit of an argument with me asking him not to do that and him insisting he was joking.

He grabs my arm a little after this. I'm not sure why, I don't think I was unsteady but my reaction was to yank my arm back. I have autism and I don't like being touched at random. My partner got angry at this and shoved me. I stumbled but didn't fall. I was shocked though.

I asked him to please go home and I would follow behind and he swore at me and ran off again. I rang a friend to try and process the situation. He turned back up and accused me of turning him into a monster to my friend, said I was overreacting and that because I was a woman I could just cry abuse and be heard - all this without hearing anything I said to my friend.

He then walked next to me for the remainder of the way home but purposely was dropping slightly behind me so I couldn't see him. This frightened me quite a bit. I'm an anxious person anyway. I asked him to walk in front as I was feeling scared and he refused and again said I was overreacting. I had a panic attack on the way home.

It wasn't a hard push and it's been ten years and I love him but I always said if anyone puts there hands on me I can't do that. I don't want to leave, we have a really difficult dog together and are staying with his dad plus house prices are out of this world atm. Plus I really do love him but although pushing me is out of character I can't say thay purposely doing stuff to make my anxiety worse isn't.

I'm also scared of being alone. I really don't think I'd find anyone else or would want to. It hasn't been great for a long time but I've been pushing therapy in hopes to sort the problems. I don't know what I'm asking.

My husband(m24) and I (f24) have been together for a very long time. When things are great the are amazing but lately we have been arguing non-stop. 

We have 2 beautiful children but they are a lot. They require most of our attention, so I do feel we are both exhausted. We keep arguing about him playing his game, he loves playing Minecraft is his only “down” time but I don’t really get any downtime at least not daily. For the most part housework is split 50/50 so we have a true partnership. 

Here is the issue, as soon as I bring up a topic he doesn’t agree about we immediately start to argue because he won’t see my side of things, and I am tired of it, I am tired that every time I share my feelings about something he immediately dismisses me our tells me that’s not true, but if I dare to do that I am not being understanding.

We can never come up to a resolution with our arguments. We keep brushing our issues under the rug and pretend everything is okay again until it’s not. and we have a big blow out. I am not sure if he’s gaslighting me when we are arguing and I truly don’t think I can do better than him. 

I don’t want to divorce him I just wish I was bable to share my feelings with him without him immediately dismissing me or pretending our issues are not real.
