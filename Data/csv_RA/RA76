- have contacted Woman’s Aid who offered to house me and my children in a refuge…I really don’t see why I should have to leave my house.

My ex (29m) and I (29f) reconciled and have been engaged for 3 months, going to therapy and overall happier and more in tune than ever. When we broke up last year, I reached out to his ex-wife (28f) to make certain I wasn't the other woman when he and I first started dating ( turns out they were separated at that time and BOTH were seeing other people, but she claimed he cheated on her with me? ) She told me how he treated her in the past and how awful he was, revealing that he was abusive and a serial cheater, etc. etc... I felt sorry for her and we kept in touch. When my now fiance and I reconciled, I obviously confronted him about the claims she made, to which he vehemently denied, but did admit he wasn't nice to her (apparently she threatened him if he tried to get a divorce and it was a toxic marriage). His family also expressed doubt about her claims and have told me stories about her that challenges her narrative, like her being ugly to him and how she cheated on him when they first got married... I also later find out she would block and unblock me when he and I were dating.

She found out my now fiance and I have been talking again months ago. We had a brief conversation to which she said she wouldn't come between him and I, whatever that means. After that, she became distant, and began to exhibit inappropriate behaviors toward my fiance, and I know of them because my fiance tells me everything. My fiance told me that she FaceTimed him at midnight, and he answered half asleep, not knowing who it was. He said she was probably drunk, and then she tried to FaceTime him again, and he didn't answer. He asked her why she tried to facetime again the next day, and she said it was a buttdial. Today, I noticed on my fiance's fb page pictures she tagged him in- she  changed her privacy settings to show the old tagged pictures to make it known she was the wife from years ago.

Most of our issues that we’ve ever had have had to do with substance use. When I was a teenager, I was a problem drinker. I acted like a jerk and also had an emotional affair right after high school graduation. We broke up after 5 years together, reconnected after about a year, and decided to rekindle the relationship. He was supposed to move in with me (I moved across the country post-break up) last year, around June ‘21. He ended up postponing and confessing to a drug addiction and that he wasn’t ready to be sober. We kept in touch and kept trying, and he agreed to complete sobriety and moved in with me this past May. 

Within 4 days of moving here, he broke his promise. It wasn’t for anything horrible, just smoking weed, but it crushed me. We promised things would be different this time and he lied… This happened 3 more times before he pushed me into a new deal. He would be sober for 3 months only, just to prove he could, and then he would be able to casually do drugs a few times per month. Obviously this wasn’t optimal for me, but I wanted our relationship to work so I agreed. He hasn’t been able to handle this either, and has failed an additional 3 times (or maybe more, these were just confirmed by urinalysis tests or literally finding the substances around the house). 

The most recent thing I found was a vape. And sure, I know in the grand scheme of life, if it was just this it wouldn’t be a big deal. But it’s just a constant pattern of making promises and then having no intention of keeping them. He says it’s crazy for me to break up our relationship over a vape, but to me it’s way more than that. It’s about commitment, responsibility, trust, honesty, and restraining impulsive behaviors. Am I being irrational or stupid about this?

One night last week he seemed really agitated all night. I kept asking him what was wrong, he kept telling me it was nothing. At 9PM after the kids went to sleep I suggested that him and I watch TV together. He sat down with me for about 5 minutes, and then got up and just said he was going out for a drive. At like 10:30 he texted me and told me he was at a bar in town getting a drink with one of his friends and that he was stressed from work.  He didn’t come home until 2:30AM. I don’t care if he needs to unwind, it’s just so out of character of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night we both went to sleep and then when I woke up about an hour later (11:30ish) he wasn’t in bed anymore, his phone was still there and he came back in at 1:30, when I asked where he was he said he just needed to go on a walk.

My (33M) girlfriend (30F) have been together for about 5 months. We've gotten along great thus far, and we have so much in common. We celebrate and support each other for our differences. We are able to share a space and exist together with ease, and neither feels like we need to entertain the other.

She is very mature, understanding, and supportive of me, and she is so sweet. I have been extremely forthcoming with her about my past and she has been very accepting. We have a wonderful intimate connection as well. There is just one issue for me: I really don't like how she is when she drinks, and some of her drinking habits worry me. 

We have had about 3 ""arguments"" I guess. Each of those times, alcohol has been involved. I drink when we go out, but I rarely drink too much to drive. A couple times a month, it seems that she drinks to black out, and to a point where she's extremely hungover. This alone  doesn't necessarily bother me, but I can't ignore the correlation between her being shitfaced and wanting to start arguments with me. A few times, we've agreed to leave the bar ( one time I had to be up at 6:00 am for work) and I noticed that she frequently ""sneaks"" another drink. Like a double highball. I have alcoholics in my family, and this behavior concerns me.

Last night, we were drinking at home. We were having a lot of fun, laughing together, and watching TV. I wasn't really monitoring her alcohol intake, but eventually she started getting very long-winded and sharing a lot, which is usually a sign she's been drinking. For transparency's sake, I had a few drinks and had also eaten an edible. Around 3 AM is when the argument started. Out of nowhere she said something like ""oh and if you're wondering why I was mad earlier today, it was because your brought up your ex."" I thought about it and remembered what she was referring to. Around 3 pm that day, a commercial for perfume came on the TV and I said the name of it, I guess before the commercial disclosed the name of it. My gf asked if I'd seen the commercial before, and I said, jokingly, ""no how do you think I know?"" She said ""oh right your ex,"" and it ended there. I didn't know she was mad about it until she mentioned it at 3 am, but I told her I understood and apologized. I know she doesn't like hearing about her, and it wasn't my intention to bring her up. I asked her if, in the future, she would like me to lie in order to avoid bringing up my ex, and she pretty much said yes. 

I didn't argue with her, I was understanding, but she just kept bringing it up. She went out to have a cigarette and I got ready for bed. She came back, got ready, and laid down with me. But she started bringing it up again, saying something ""I hope your feelings for me are as intense as they are for her despite that I'm less problematic."" I didn't really understand this, but eventually I figured out that she was pretty much saying that, due to trauma bonding, I still have feelings for my ex-girlfriend. I told her that I absolutely do not. I honestly hate my ex girlfriend, and the more distance I put between myself and our relationship, the more I see how she was toxic and emotionally manipulative. I have her blocked on EVERYTHING. Despite me denying it, my current gf continued to insist that I \*do\* have feelings for my ex. That they aren't logical or rational feelings, but emotional ones. I continued to tell her that she was wrong. And eventually she said something like ""I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're making it about winning an argument."" I pretty much told her that she was trying to tell me how I felt, and if her position is that I have feelings for my ex, then yes, we do have an argument. She mentioned that when her and I met (before we were dating) my ex and I had been planning to meet at some point, and that I wanted to do it to get closure. My current gf had told me ""thanks for being honest and let me know if you do end up meeting with her."" I never met with her, because I decided it didn't make sense when I wanted to cultivate the healthy relationship that was developing with my current gf, and I didn't want to put that at risk. Regardless, my current gf was still bothered by this, and this was the first time she'd brought it up as a reason that I have feelings for my ex. I told her that I would like to talk about this when we haven't been drinking, and she got very defensive ( I didn't say ""you're drunk,"" I was careful to specify we'd both been drinking. She kept bringing it up and would not let it go. Eventually I said ""we're talking about this tomorrow, and I'm sleeping on the couch."" I went to go sleep on the couch, and around 15 minutes later she came out and woke me up, saying something to continue the argument like ""I want you to sleep on this and think about what kind of closure you would have had from that meeting."" I reiterated that I didn't want to speak to her about this anymore tonight, and to please let me sleep. She continued to try and get a last shot in, I continued to tell her that I wasn't interested in speaking, and eventually said ""I'm not going to sleep on anything, I don't want to talk to you about this anymore. Good night.""

She said ""Fuck you, honestly."" And walked back into her room. I didn't respond to that.

Don't get me wrong, I want her to voice her feelings to me, of course. I don't want her to bottle them up. But I wish she would do it when we were sober, because I feel like she's impossible to have a productive conversation with when she is drunk. But this has happened too many times for me to brush it off has a one time thing. Over drinking and then starting arguments with me is clearly a habit of hers. I'm not the biggest fan of alcohol to begin with, but it really scares me when someone I love completely changes when they drink. Last night was the worst example of that. She just wouldn't leave me alone, and she wouldn't listen to me when I told her I had zero interest in my ex. She kept making abstract distinctions as to why it was okay for her to mention her ex all the time because they were together longer. I felt like I couldn't say anything right. She wouldn't give me space when I asked, and she was being totally irrational in my opinion. Worst of all, she said ""fuck you"" to me. I would never say that to someone I loved. I know from experience that you can't ""fix"" people like this. You can't force someone to get help with their drinking. I think in my heart I know the right decision is to just cut my losses and end it, but I wanted to see what everyone else thought.

Let me start by saying I'm a Democrat that currently lives in a red state. This is relevant informantion.

I visited my relatives in a predominate blue state last week. I've visited several times over the years and they want me to move in with them. I've been greatly considering moving with them because I want to move away from this state I'm in. I really love them but I've noticed something off when I visit.

They seem to look down on me. I think they've become too ""woke"" or ""pc"". Now like I said I'm a democrat myself. I use to be republican but have since changed.

Now don't get me wrong I think it's okay to be ""woke"" and at times ""pc"". There's plenty in our society to critique and I'm not one to shy away from those conversations but it feels like they just do these things to look down on me. I'd be fine if it made sense but they don't seem to have any rule to their actions.

For example they will say something racist and later if I mention race in anyway in the most casual sense they'll say I'm racist. They'll make fun of where I'm from but they were born here too and lived most of their life here. They make off hand comments about things like that make it seem like they are just using their politics to look down on me.

Anyways Idk what to do it's stressing me because I was looking forward to leaving here but now I don't think I can.

I talked to my fiancé again from some of the advice I received, and I really appreciate everyone who gave advice on what to say. Long story short, he didn't take it well, and he did something else that really broke my trust. I talked to him shortly after my post and had a few notes from what I mentioned above. I told him about how he changed since my practice and that I felt like an object since too. From ignoring numerous no's after giving him too many chances, I told him I was done with the relationship because it had been going on for months. But he said I was being unreasonable and that he ""gave me space that I asked for. When I told him that I never asked for space, he asked what would happen if our kids never learned to step out of their comfort zone, but I told him that that was unrelated. The bottom line was that he ignored me numerous times over the past few months, but he said I wasn't being fair. He also that he downloaded some photos from my old circus Facebook account (a separate one I used to have for silks only) and posted them for encouragement, and I had no clue until he told me

He said he wanted to show me for encouragement because I was ""better than I thought"", and he took me to an Instagram I didn't know he had. It wasn't his main, and the account was mostly for memes. It also had a different name that wasn't related to anything personal, but he said some of his friends followed it. He showed me some posts that came from downloaded images of my high school/college performances, and he never asked for my consent. He even wrote that I was lacking in confidence, and he showed me some comments that said positive things. But there were also one or two that were somewhat lewd from people I didn't know, and the bottom line was he never asked for consent. He also scrolled away from the lewd ones quickly too. I planned to post my silks comeback on Facebook/Instagram after my first recital, but it hadn't happened yet. He told people that I came back on his account, and he said he planned to show me the account/encouragement closer to the wedding. He also said I was being unfair because it was a ""part of me that he found attractive"", so I should be willing to do more in bed. He wasn't like this before I got back into silks (after years off) and coming to my practice, and he's been a different person since. He even admitted to getting off to some of the photos, but that he'd rather do it with me. That really bothered me because some of the ones he posted were of me in high school on top of everything else

I'm currently working on moving in with a girlfriend temporarily, and she is going to help me move. My now ex-fiancé also made a post about how I was being ""unreasonable"" and ""getting upset at him for supporting me on silks"". He also said I was projecting my insecurities onto him for trying to be supportive, but he didn't include the sex pressure or wedding performance he was pushing for. I also asked him to take the photos down, but he said he wouldn't. It really feels like an invasion of privacy. I also talked to my parents as some suggested, and they were happy to learn I got back into silks albeit sad at the same time. My dad is really upset at him and said he's trying to look into the photos being removed, but I'm not sure if much can be done. Mom said that me getting back into silks likely triggered something that was always inside him since he knew I did silks in the past, and he became excited when I got back into it. It's just been really stressful, and I'm taking a break from silks for now. I'll try to go back someday, but I'm just really stressed and will probably take some time off from work too.

Everything seemed perfect at the start as it always does. I knew within a few weeks I loved her, we both said it about a month in and not long after I bought a ring (although due to covid i didn't actually propose for like a year and a half). Within 6 months I moved in with her and her mum so we could save money for a house (which again thanks to covid didn't happen). 

In January 2021 we found out we were having a baby which made us both happy as we'd both always wanted kids and 9 months later our perfect little boy was born. During the pregnancy we decided we wanted our own space to take the baby home to so we started renting a house. 

No one tells you when you have a baby how much changes between you and your partner, we really struggled with it, and still do honestly. However the difference between my partner and I is that I have accepted that things have changed. I'm not happy with it, but I've accepted it, while she still says she wants things to be how they used to be. 

Now like every couple we've had our minor issues, but lately they have built up and i'm miserable. My partner only works 1 day a week so I pay for almost everything, however due to not making much its gotten me into debt and whenever I get the slightest bit cleared she wants something else. This week it was a new fridge and other kitchen appliances. 

Her binge drinking hasn't helped either. I start work at 6 and I've missed about 4 shifts at work due to her strolling in at 5 in the morning drunk out her mind.

The biggest thing though is that I'm just not happy. And I never thought i'd be in this stage with her, there used to be so much love there.

Please excuse my english.
 
A bit of backstory: First of, our love life hasn't been great almost since the beginning, he told me a month into the relationship that he has a rather low libido. That didn't stop us from being intimate rather frequently at first (1 or 2 times a day) like in any new relationship. I imagined that I could manage the situation even if the frequency would drop to say 1 time per week. I know I screwed up there. Well, after 6 months we were already at 3-4 times a month and it's been going progresively downhill since (max 10 times in the last year, it's been more than 3 months now). It's been over a year and a half since I last initiated due to fear of being rejected like many times in the past. I have always dealt with low self esteem and don't think highly of my appearance and I must admit that, even if he denied it at first and blamed the stress due to his job, I took his lack of desire personally.

As time went on, he started making subtle (more recently not so subtle) remarks about my looks. Never the body itself, more like the style and overall appearance. First, it was the choices of nail polish, him mentioning red as a more feminine color. Then was the hair, him prefering a shorter style, similar to the one I had when we met (I have grown it since then), mentioning that I haven't dyed it in awhile. Then there were the clothes, he said I turned to a more androginous look of jeans and hoodies rather than a more feminine approach. Overall, he says I am not feminine enough and that I used to look and act more like a woman. My body looks pretty much the same and (if you ask me) my style hasn't really changes that much although I have grown my hair (now with bangs) and adapted to a slightly more contemporary casual style. He recently admitted that he would be more attracted to me if I were more feminine and took better care of myself. I know appearance means a lot to him and he insists on looking good in social circles because so do I. But I don't know if this desire of his for me being more lady-like is normal, like in most conservative men or has he changed his attitude towards me because he got bored of the relationship? 

I have been feeling really alone and sad lately and I notice he is trying to make us work and so am I - I've done my nails red, bought more feminine clothes and plan on getting a haircut. But I just feel sad, empty and unworthy of love, all the time now. What if this doesn't change anything? I miss our sex life. I miss being desired. Now it's just conditions and criticism. Or is it just in my head and this is normal?

I accepted it, but almost broke it off, which killed me and was the stupidest decision I ever made, because we said further down the line we might meet up again when she and I were ready.

It ended weirdly because of my mental health problems which doesn't help, and is probably a huge turn off, but she cared. I then stupidly texted her two weeks later and said ""I missed her"" in a conversation, to which she said she ""still wasn't ready for a relationship"" and that ""she doesn't want me reliant on her"".

I work in a mall center. We are a small shop and she works right in front of me(like 20 meters away). 6 months ago we constantly looked at each other for weeks, then eventually we started dating and that turned into a romantic releationship. She was the perfect match for me in every way possible. She was really low key and focused on her goals and I really liked that about her. We've had deep talks and conversations that I was not comfortable to talk with anyone else. She was like my soulmate and the perfect girl.

I lost her recently and that was entirely my fault. She liked me but I didnt make her love me. I had a lot of trouble with managing my stress and a lot of the time I would take it out on her. I realized what I had done and did everything I could to rectify the situation but was too late. I am at bad spot in my life and I know no one likes deadweight and depressive grumpy moods. Seems like she moved on but I didnt. My boss moved me to another location(mall) until I heal but I feel that thing wont come anytime soon.

We have booked a family holiday for Christmas and I have said to her that I plan on flying back a bit early to meet someone that I had plans with. We discussed this and she started to get visibly triggered and said that I always complain and that she finds it hard to converse with me. She then went onto  say that she feels that I don’t put enough effort in with her. 

My mum told me she was crying and incredibly upset after I left the argument and was accusing them of not parenting me correctly. My mum said she didn’t think that I had any neglect when I was younger and that they can’t be responsible for who I am as a person. I was very confused by this comment 

To be honest, the argument with my sister didn’t upset me because I planned on talking it out with her but the comments coming from my mum have upset me immensely and made me question everything. it seems as if my sister thinks I have a fearful attachment style  from emotional neglect in childhood.

TLDR: I (34M) have reached a critical relationship impasse with my girlfriend (31F). We have been together for 5 years, we live together. We are stuck in our relationship. She wants kids and a house, I want those too but want the everyday state of the relationship to improve before I can make that kind of commitment. She doesn’t think she should be the one to meet those needs. This state of ambivalence began during the worst of the pandemic but this critical bottleneck has lasted around a year. I’m looking for tools or advice to try and work through this, specifics described below. 

I’m going to try and write all of this as objectively as possible. 

My girlfriend wants to take steps forward in the relationship, which involves the typical steps into adulthood - becoming homeowners and starting a family. She says she cannot wait much/any longer, which is fair enough. I totally understand the biological constraints here - if I am not going to be the one she has children with, then she needs to find that person. 

Here’s the thing - I have no issues taking those steps forward in principle. She would be a great mother to my children. We go so well together in so many ways. Her family is fantastic and we all get along well. I’m certain we could build and share a beautiful home together. 

On top of that, I love her very much. I find her physically extremely attractive, I love all of her little quirks and faults, I love the way she sees the world and the unique perspective that she gives me. I love that she finds value in things that I don’t, it gives me a new understanding of the world. I love that she knows about lots of things that I don’t. I am so incredibly curious about her. She can be very kind and nurturing. Quite often the day-to-day of our relationship is generally pretty good, we often have a lot of fun together. 

The reason I have difficulty making the commitment above is because feel that I simply do not get enough reassurance or affection from her. She doesn’t seem to find me sexually attractive, and we have sex too infrequently for my liking, maybe once every two months, and she never initiates. Beyond physical intimacy there’s an emotional intimacy that is often lacking - sometimes it feels more like we are roommates or siblings than romantic partners. 

We get on well in many ways but simply don’t share the kind of intimacy I that would like on an everyday basis. Put it like this, when I get home from work I don’t always expect her to be happy to see me, but, it would be nice to come home to a smile and a hug. Often I am told off and pushed away for displaying affection. It makes me feel like a kind of immature idiot for wanting to touch my girlfriend, but I am always so excited to see her I can’t really help it. I feel like I have a lot of love to give. 

When I look at all the reasons I love her (paragraph 4 of this post) I don’t feel that all of those things are reciprocated in the same way. I’m not sure if she likes my quirks or not, frequently she gets pretty annoyed if I am forgetful or bad at multitasking. She even tells me sometimes that my breathing stresses her out. I am not sure that she is engaged in many of my interests. She rarely asks me what book I’m reading, what I learned in my day, etc. I can’t quite tell if she likes me for me, or if I am just the male in her life at the moment where it is the ‘right’ time to have kids and buy a house. In short, it’s very difficult for me to make what is the biggest commitment ever (children) when I don’t always feel loved or appreciated in the day to day. 

When I voice these concerns to her, she tells me she has already given what she can give me, and that if I can’t deal with that, then, tough. The fact that she says she wants to have kids with me should be enough. She says I need to work on loving myself and that I shouldn’t really expect to get love and affection from her, that it’s not her job to make me feel attractive or to take interest in my interests. Moreover, and perhaps most important, the reason I’m not getting this kind of affection from her is because our relationship is not moving forward in a way she would like. She makes me feel really bad when she says these things, and I start to question how valid the needs I’m raising are, and whether or not I’m being reasonable. 

I get where she’s coming from, but I also sort of feel that one of the main points of a relationship is to enjoy eachothers company. I feel like if we’re missing parts of that, or if I’m not feeling that, then it isn’t going to get any better when we have kids. 

We’ve been to couples therapy about six months ago, which I think has unpacked or given form to some of the issues in our relationship. But we stopped when in one session, the therapist told my girlfriend that she couldn’t treat me in a certain way, I can’t remember exactly what the issue was now. My girlfriend felt like she was being attacked and didn’t feel comfortable returning. 

We’re both sick and tired of being sick and tired - the protracted ambivalence is exhausting, as is the kind of cyclical behaviour dynamics I am describing. I think we both have a reasonable perspective, or at least I tried to be as objective as possible writing this, out of deep respect to her. The relationship feels one-sided on both sides for different reasons. 

I look at other people who seem to effortlessly glide into making these decisions because it feels right and wonder why it is so hard for us. On paper it looks good but there’s a bottleneck we’re struggling with. I want to make it work but I’m also tired and frustrated. 

To avoid asking for moral judgment, I am asking for specific advice on processes or tools we can use to hopefully work through this. I need to know if there is something I can do or work on, or if it’s time to call it quits.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7540401,public,self,I (34M) have been stuck in a state of relationship ambivalence with my girlfriend (31F) for a year.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yugi9i/i_34m_have_been_stuck_in_a_state_of_relationship/,all_ads,6,,

We barely text or chat. This already lasts for like 3 or even 4 weeks. I don't know what to do to help him. I started to think that it's not that simple and that he is just distancing himself. 

We get along really well, I would say. I think we cared about each other, and we both were an important part of our lives. Idk. Since about 3 weeks, he started to act differently. I noticed that almost instantly cause he stays in bed for almost all day and does basically nothing throughout the day. I asked what's going on and he said he just feels weird and low. But he basically started to ignore me and it hurts a bit - cause when you get close to someone and that person avoids you it always hurts. 

He told me that it happens sometimes. That he sometimes has weeks or even months like that. Basically avoiding everyone and he just sits in his apartment all alone.

The problem is that I don't know what to do. Whether I should just give him space and hope that when he finally feels okayish our relation will be just where it was before or text him and try to force some kind of chat and be all annoying. Like a karen next door. 

The worse part for me is that it also affects me in some way.

Apologies in advance. 
Well as the title states, my fiancé and I were great. I have two kids of my own and we didn’t plan on having a baby any time soon let alone two but we couldn’t get enough of each other 7 months ago. But low and behold I was really emotional one night. I couldn’t stop crying so the next morning I decided to take a test because I didn’t even care about what made me cry. Instantly I felt like I was going to be sick from anxiety about having 3 kids. I told him trying to make myself as excited as possible but his response was pretty plain. Fast forward 4-8 weeks to my first ultrasound and my sister joined us (she was too young to be involved with my first two and wanted to be this time) and she made a joke “there’s only one in there right?” And jokes on us because there was definitely two. 
He started laughing maniacally. Which I understand. He doesn’t have any children of his own and I feel like any reaction there was the appropriate one. When we got home that night he apologized for his reaction and I said it was okay. He hugged me for about 10 minutes after that. So that was the first trimester. We were still good. 
But then he started pulling away. Every night he’d play games instead of seeing me or play on his phone while I was trying to talk to him. Lately (just now hit third trimester) I’m a whale. I’ve gained about 50 pounds. Which isn’t saying much since I only weighed 100 to begin with. I feel like my breasts have sagged so much and my nipples consume my entire boob. Along with not being able to see my feet or anything. He hasn’t tried cuddling with me in 2 months. Not even trying to hold my hand. And now he’s taken sex off the table. I’ve been the only one initiating it and it actually really hurts.. I told him I didn’t know if I could stay in a relationship like this because I needed affection. He says we’re fine he’s just worried about all of the complications that come with twins. But even so he could at least try kissing me goodbye, or texting me to see how I’m doing when he works 10 am to 11 pm (he only has that on the weekends) I have cried almost every night this week because I don’t feel I’m good enough anymore. And I know it’s just hormones. But I really don’t know what to do. I’m just really lonely.. 
and I will say this has been my loneliest pregnancy. Before I had my grandma and my mom and my entire family beside me. This time I go to my appointments and no one checks in and there won’t be a baby shower so I’ve had to get everything on my own which is double of everything and no one has offered to help while taking care of my grandpa because my grandma just passed away which yes. That’s why I don’t have her here this time. Not because she doesn’t want to. She would’ve been so excited.

Not sure if this is the right place, but I have seen similar posts. 2022 was easily the worst year of my entire life (33M). I am really coping poorly with all of this. I had been dating my ex since the beginning of the pandemic so just shy of 3 years now. 2022 started by getting fired from my job in February. I had been unhappy in my job (Front End Developer/ Web Developer) for a while, I was also training new hires making significantly more than myself on how to utilize our code for projects. Anyway, I fell into depression as this was the first time in a decade I did not have a job. I also continued to apply and fight and take as many interviews as possible while collecting unemployment.

My fiance has a terrible relationship with her father. He was abusive and more, don't need to get too much into that. But her mom who has always been her support left him and asked to stay with us which I gladly agreed to even though I was going through my own stuff. She wound up staying for 2 months and I was taking her to her medical appointments to help her through what she was going through. She also made us many financial promises to get us to have a wedding and mentioned helping us buy a house, and watch our dogs while we were on honeymoon. We were both so happy.

After her Mom went back to her state to continue working on herself, I started a side business selling pokemon cards online. It was going really well, helping pay the bills and at least keep us afloat. I want to mention wedding planning going on while all of this happening. Me being a typical male did not help as much as she wanted me to. Anyway, the next snag on the year hit as I was purchasing Pokemon card products to sell from a source I thought could be trusted and wound up getting scammed out of $1000. No one would help me and I simply had to eat the loss, which caused me not to be able to sell for an entire month. Meanwhile, still no luck on job front regardless of making it to several final interviews (for Front end Development).

A few times this year my SO told me she thinks I need to go to therapy to handle my depression and how to deal with the things going wrong. I never told her no, I just wanted to land a job to be able to afford to go to therapy. She also asked me to help her more because things were tough. I would show effort and help and I thought I was always doing enough especially because she would tell me ""I can see the effort you are putting out and you have been supporting me so much better lately"".

We both take a much-needed vacation and I take her to NYC for the first time in her life. We did a tour of the city and spent time with my brother, so many happy memories even though the year is so so hard on both of us. Then we drove to my parents to surprise my mom for her birthday. all of this went well, but we did hear the news that my SO mom decided to go back to the abusive dad. This devastated my SO and me. My mom even told me she had a breakdown in the car about it. During this time my SO and I were talking about starting to have kids so we both were preparing our bodies. She got off birth control and took blood tests, and also began to take prenatal vitamins. I quit smoking altogether. I tended to smoke weed at night out of habit after all my responsibilities were done, regardless I took the doctor's recommendation and simply quit cold turkey.

Fast forward one month to September, we both have birthdays early in the month and normally go out together for it. Her mom decided to visit and discuss wedding stuff. Well her mom pulled all of her financial promises from earlier in the year. She said not very kind things about me not doing enough or being enough, and my SO defended me but was clearly torn up about this. My SO also told me that was not her mom who visited, ""it was her dad"". Several times after this she said ""I believe I am going to cut off contact with my mom after the wedding, I am just not okay with her going back to him"". After this all through this month into October, all I heard was how excited she was to marry me. Conversations and texts, we were planning to have kids together, how could I think anything different? Therapy was brought up once more for me, I said confidently, I will make an appointment after the wedding, Let's see if I land any of these jobs I have interviews for. Unfortunately, I got to the final interviews again and was passed on.

The Friday a week before the wedding we went on a date that felt great. Saw our favorite comedian live whom we discovered early in our relationship. Everything seemed great. The following day I was supposed to go to a Convention for Collectables while she went on her bachelorette retreat with her friends. I had friends come in from out of town to meet me, but in the morning my SO had a panic attack and I skipped breakfast and half my day at the convention to comfort her until she left. We both went and did our things. Sunday she told me that the panic attack was anxiety about her mom being in town and that she felt so refreshed and couldn't wait to marry me. That same night I started feeling sick. She got back home on Monday and in the morning I tested positive for covid. She brought me supplements to try and kick the sickness faster and she went and stayed with her mom the week before the wedding. So now I am alone recovering from covid. She is with her mom. Then the Friday before the wedding she tells me she wants to call off the wedding. I told her we just need to get through the ceremony and reception and we will be on the much-needed honeymoon we had planned. I told her we could get back to ourselves just her and me on the honeymoon. Anyway, wedding day comes, an hour before the ceremony she calls me and tells me she can't marry me. Completely Blindsided me, My world fell apart. (Let me say this is the healthiest relationship either of us have had, our lives were thoroughly tangled together, 2 dogs, planning on kids, all of it). I didn't see her (or anyone else for that matter) all week because I was quarantined, I didn't know she was even having these thoughts prior to the day before. she had her friends take her phone so we didn't have contact at all for a couple days.

She came by to talk to me and break up with me and I convinced her we should do what we had always mentioned and seek couples therapy together and also go to therapy solo for ourselves. She responded by saying we should take a month apart and seek therapy for ourselves before doing any group sessions. She didn't talk for a few more days. We are now at Thursday the week after the wedding, She calls me saying she wants to come home. I tried being the strong person here because this was a very emotional call. I told her I think what is best for us is to go through with the time apart and therapy and come back together strong and ready to figure us out. I also told her my biggest fear was going through the time apart and then going our separate ways without trying. She told me she had the same fear. Left off on a really positive note. The plan now was she takes our younger dog with her and stays with her aunt in a different state while we figure ourselves out. I went to my friends house while she did this to give her space. After the weekend with my friends I come home to a letter on my pillow from her. She thanked me for the couple notes and snacks I got for her trip (Simply thinking about her because I am still madly in love with her). The letter she wrote me was so emotional. Talked about how she felt and everything we could do to fix it, she mentioned she didn't want to give up on us. She wanted to choose me every day and figure things out together. The letter gave me so much hope. I was seeing a therapist twice a week at this time and so was she. We had no contact for 2 weeks and were supposed to have 2 more weeks but she texted me saying she wanted to come home the following weekend. I got nervous because I couldn't tell if this was good or bad. I tried staying positive all week and just hoping she'd come home and work on things. But she asked to Facetime me Friday. This was the single hardest call I ever endured. She told me her mind was made up and that she was breaking up with me and moving out. My worst fears came true. I kept trying to convince her to go to therapy with me and give it a chance because everything she was saying I did wrong was fixable. But here I am the Sunday after this call, Devastated... I have only slept 2 hours total since Friday. I tried everything to get a full night sleep, Melatonin, Excercise, getting out of the house, smoking again, nothing shuts my brain off. Nothing can bring me comfort from losing what matters most to me. I widely consider her my best friend, Love of my life, But she told me she still loved me but wasn't in love with me anymore. I know I am not perfect, I have always been willing to work on my imperfections and am the kind of guy who would do anything for her or anyone I care about... Hell I even went out of my way when I was struggling to help a homeless stranger because my gut told me to. Anyway, Here I am. Lost, I feel like my entire world was uprooted. I have a final interview Monday/tomorrow but I cannot sleep. I am trying my hardest to come to terms with the fact the future I pictured isn't reality. Ive had several emotional calls with her that ended as good as it could. She is clearly torn up by the decision, but her mind is made up. I don't know what changed but she is ready to throw the entire relationship away without trying. When I tell her this she told me she tried to support me all year and it drained everything from her. I wasn't able to be there for her the way she needed me to be due to everything I was going through. I am confused because I want more than anything to address my shortcomings. I never refused to change. She said I showed up with this fight for us ""too little too late and Why didn't I show this effort earlier"".

Anyway, I am sure there are some gaps since I am running on no sleep. Appreciate any advice and ill answer any questions because I'm sure there will be. I keep trying to convince myself that the future will be better, but my love for her never died. I also keep telling myself ""The right person wouldn't have walked away when I needed them the most"". I feel like she abandoned me and abandoned her family (me and the dogs, we are each taking one). The last thing I will leave here is that she said she was unhappy for a long time (8 months). But only communicated minor things and never told me the full extent or that she ever had doubts about us. Anyway, welcome to my life. I want 0 part of life without her. Dont get this confused with hurting myself, I would never do that. Our lives were just so tangled together, We did everything together. Things I used to do alone became things we do together. We were essentially the same person. There was so much good in this relationship, she didn't deny that. I don't know how you leave someone you love like this.

We are long distance because he is in the military. I flew out to see him for a month at his duty station. I love this guy to the ends of Earth but the way he makes me feel is humiliating. We’ve had a conversation about him not asking me out yet because his excuse is that he can’t give me everything a relationship requires if he’s not physically with me in person. I’ve known him since I was in high school so next year when he finishes his military contract in July he’ll be here living in the same hometown as me and we had plans of moving in together but it’s weird that he hasn’t put a label on things yet and frankly I’ve been stupid enough to keep talking to him this long when a relationship is all I want. 
Now here’s the things that really put things into perspective. Sex is great with him but due to long distance he’s been very persistent on always asking me for pictures even if I say no or else he’ll be upset. I hate doing that but because I love him I still do it. He said it’s due to long distance that he asks me for pictures and videos. I have brought it up that it makes me feel uncomfortable and that I no longer want to do that but he says he has needs and I need to fulfill those. Another thing that bothered me is how much he follows girls on social media that post inappropriate things and showing their whole body. At first he said he wouldn’t unfollow any girl and I left it at that instead of causing any issues. Now that I brought it up again he unfollowed them but changed his privacy settings so I wouldn’t see who he followed and that really sucked. I asked him why he feels the need to follow them if he has me and he said it’s because I don’t fulfill those needs so he has to look at other girls. I expressed how insecure that made me feel and he said it’s not like he’ll ever meet those girls irl so I have nothing to worry about. I’ve since deleted my social media since it gives me a sinking feeling everything I see him in some girls likes. The fact that he’s not willing to unfollow any girl I tell him to because he says that they’re his friends and that he’s just showing support by liking their pics , like what?!??? I’ve tried to be calm with things but I only brought them up because it really bothered me. I do wanna bring up other things how he never even brought me flowers to the airport when I went to see him and he was one hour late, on top of that he always wanted me to pay for dates because I’m his “sugar mommy” and never even compliments me on pics I post or anything, it’s as though we weren’t a thing. I don’t feel loved, I don’t feel like I get attention. I feel insecure and miserable that he doesn’t care for me as much as I do.

We've been dating for a year and a half, and she moved in with me 4 months ago.

She was living with her family, working on their family business, and taking classes part time. Her family aren't exactly the best people for a variety of reasons, so she jumped at the opportunity to move in with me. By doing so her family immediately fired her from the family business. It was a huge fight and a lot of drama, they are not exactly on speaking terms any more.

Since she was no longer working I encouraged her to start going to school full time and that i would be willing to pay for some of her schooling. That is what she is doing. She has also insisted on cooking every day and keeping the house in order.

Over the past month I've noticed that she's been feeling a bit down. Noticeably less energy, more nightmares, bit shorter temper, etc. I've tried to ask her if anything is wrong, but she always insisted she was fine. As far as i could tell no definitive event had occurred to change her mood, so I didn't push to hard.

Just a couple days ago I came home from work to her crying. I immediately hugged her and asked what was wrong and what she needed. She said she ruined dinner and was afraid that id be mad at her for wasting food.

I was... rather confused. Why would I be angry about that? Shit happens, its fine.

Eventually the conversation went on to when she said she has been feeling like a total burden ever since she moved in with me. She said the reason she cooks and cleans and all that so much is because she feels like its the least she could do for being such a bother. She even said the only reason she has sex with me as much as she dose is because ""it's one of the few things I can do to repay you""

I feel absolutely horrible and stupid for not seeing all this awhile ago. Which of course makes her feel terrible in turn. All I want is for her to be happy and feel loved and succeed in life. She is so not a burden to me. It makes me intensely happy to support her and her dreams. I've tried telling her this, but I don't think she entirely believes me.

So how can i make her feel like not such a burden?

So anyway. Her boyfriend of 10 years died earlier this year and I imagine she is taking it really hard and still grieving. I feel bad adding to her stress and making her more upset by arguing with her and telling her when she upsets me.

Receiving the Knick knacks is always exciting for me and I enjoy and my dad enjoys collecting it for me over the year. He is a truck driver with no friend. My mom told my dad the stuff he sends me is junk and she wants him to stop. I overheard this and told her I don’t want her to say that stuff to him cause it will make him feel bad.

She got really annoyed and apologized and huffed out of the house saying stuff under her breath that I couldn’t hear. 

So… what do I do? Do I just keep my mouth shut to keep the peace? I don’t want to fight with her and make her feel worse or more stressed.

Even though we were distance and it would be really hard. Fast forward a year and she makes the decision to move in with me in Kansas. due to her personal life at home, the timing worked out pretty well. We both know it was probably way too soon, but we had known each other for 2 years prior and we thought it would be okay.  It is also important that this is my very first serious relationship. She has been engaged once before than didn't pan out.

After we had moved in, I had expressed concerns with this other guy she had been messaging. I would glance at her phone and see a new, flirty text from him. So naturally, I asked about it. Was assured nothing was going on and was just a platonic relationship with a good friend. The flirty messages kept coming and my paranoid, insecure brain did the unthinkable. I invaded her privacy and found multiple instance of exchanging pictures, and sexting this guy while we were dating. Then in the coming weeks, found out there was at least 2 additional guys she had sex with while we were dating. She claims she doesn't remember these two happening while we were dating. I was devastated. We both agreed we still want to make things work and try to get some help/therapy. I genuinely don't believe she would ever do these things again and she not the person she was then. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just at a loss on how to feel. I only every feel okay when we're hanging out together. But when she or I are I work it's literally all I can think about.

Me(m18) and my gf(f18) have been dating now a little over a year and we’ve been almost perfect.

So where the story starts is on the last day of school she went to her friends house and I had a baseball game. Everything normal. But when my games over I look at my phone and find all these messages from a dude at where my gf was at saying that she kissed him. His words. So I confront my gf about it and she says she didn’t. I find out Later that one of her friends told the dude to say those things to me. And my gf and him used to date but very small in 6th grade but he also used to like him before this.So now idk what to believe now. So I ask the girl who’s house is we’re my gf was at and she says that she didn’t do that. So now I feel better about the situation but now since then I have been overthinking a lot. And my gf helps a lot with it. And she does a lot for me which makes me believe that she didn’t so now 4 months have gone by and she still helps me a lot and she’s my fav person in the world and we talk about our future and how we really do believe that we will last and we barley argue but when we do we apologize both and the arguments are never bitter. She also has gotten me lots of gifts. But yet I keep overthinking about her and this kiss that this guy said happened keeps coming in my head and I’m having a very tough time getting rid of it.

Well it may have been a fairly standard thing and I reacted like a douche bag, I think I am a bit rude sometimes so I don't think I am innocent here, which is why I accept it.  

She was doing the dishes, and then just basically started punching me with a fork, but she then pulled away and didn't hurt me, I think maybe she had the fork turned away, it was just in her hand at the time.  I haven't been forked to death. I actually think that's what happened, the fork was just in her hand as if it was a full fork attack I'd have been seriously injured.

I just think she's abusing me, every thing I say or do is not up to standard with her.  I said I don't want to let our two year old feel trapped in her room, so if she runs out her bed I won't block her, I'll just try something else like reading her stories in another room.  I get a big tut or sigh with that, and I say so now I'm not even allowed to be a parent?  

I said it did work as she settled and went back to her bed, then she says "" Well it didn't she's crying again "" 

Yes she is but it worked short-term

She's just a total cold blooded arrogant twat who does no wrong.  As I type this she has just brought my daughter down stairs and you don't see me tutting or sighing away, I'm just like what ever that's what you decided so we will go with it.  

I really want to leave her, she won't change and will realize one day the grass wasn't greener.  I don't think she will ever change, I've always had to change, I'm still a bit of a prick but I have made changes.  I have yet to see any from her.

To start off I'm gonna clarify that I just recently ""beat"" major depression, which I had been battling for 4 years, most of which unknowingly. This is important because that entire time I withdrew from any sort of flirting or dating, so it's safe to say I'm very rusty lol, so if my question seems easy to fix or simple I'm sorry. I'll try to keep this as short as possible although there are a lot of details so I apologize for that as well (it's pretty fucking long, I'm so sorry lol), and I appreciate you taking the time outta your day to read this, it means a lot. 

Anyways, here is the backstory. this summer I went to a get together at my best friend's house (I'll call him AA) which included other friends of his from our college, some I knew/ am friends with, and a few I didn't. One of them (I'll call her BB, she's F22) told AA immediately after that get together that she liked me and wanted my number, but upon AA telling me this I told him that I wasn't mentally ready for relationships yet since I was still battling my depression, which was true. We hung out as a group a few times since then and I definitely get along very well with BB, she's very funny, laughs at all my jokes, is quite intelligent, a bit snappy (but I like that lol) and just generally enjoyable to be around. She occasionally would brush her hand against me or tap my shoulder or leg when I made a joke, which to my surprise I was quite comfortable with.

This Friday however we celebrated a Friendsgiving at AA's house and BB was also there. Although I talked with everyone at the event, her and I definitely spent a large amount of time together, again which I enjoyed. As a group we ended up playing cards against humanity where her and I were on a team and throughout the whole game she would rest her hand/arm on my leg for minutes at a time, which again I was very comfortable with. We were laughing and getting along really well, she drank a fair amount but I don't drink so I'm not sure how much is too much lol, but to me she didn't seem drunk at all, maybe tipsy. Anyways the event ends and the next day I'm with AA again and few of the guys and they're all complaining about how BB was loud, obnoxious, annoying and drunk during the whole event. I was confused and told them I actually enjoyed her company and everyone seemed to disagree lol. 

My question is what the hell do I do lol. I do think I like this girl, as ever since my whole depression thing I've been really uncomfortable talking to girls/being touched and I'm so comfortable with her, which may be a byproduct of me depression going away but still I enjoy her company a lot and I'm fairly certain she still likes me (if you think I'm wrong about that please let me know lol I'm rusty) as evidenced by her following me around most of the night, and the frequent/prolonged touches and eye contact. But everyone else has a problem with her, am I missing something? AA has been my best friend through thick and thin and his opinion is important to me because we've always looked out for each other. However he is not a fan of her at all, but at the same time is the one who introduced me to her lol. How do I handle this? My current plan as of now is to just hold off on making any moves or shooting any texts her way until the next group get together and reassessing after that, does that plan sound good? 

Anyways thank you for reading this again and any advice/words of wisdom you may have for me are greatly appreciated. 

*too long didn't read* my best friend introduced me to a girl in his college classes this summer via a big get together this summer. She has expressed to him that she likes me, and has sorta flirted with me in person via frequent/prolonged touches on my thigh, laughing at all my jokes, lots of eye contact etc. I definitely enjoy her company and wanna get to know her better and possibly take her out, but everyone else in the group, including my best friend, seem to have an issue with her, claiming she's very loud, annoying, rude and drinks too much (I don't drink so idk lol she seemed fine to me). Am I missing something? I find her very funny, intelligent and enjoyable to be around. What do I do next?

We appreciate each other so much just the way we are. I see something rare and special in her being and it's not only me. She does so many great things for the world and people  to make them feel special. I'm really proud of her approach towards them and I admit it to her openly but I believe some of them can't understand that's how she is. Many guys catch (or caught) feelings to her but she don't (or didn't) recognize it. I often see how others look at her and what are their intentions. Often I get worried and I warn her about their 'game plan'. When she tells them she's in relationship they are getting vicious and often really hurt her then she blames herself for that and how she made them feel. But some of them want to impress her in front of me and that's pathetic. I got through couple of situations like that with her but I can't see the end of it. She doesn't want me to worry so much so she doesn't want to tell me if something is happening until it's really serious. The other way round - I only had similiar situation once and I had to cut my friend off because she couldn't understand that I have someone else.
I wonder why people want to destroy something that's great and happy together just to feel good with it? They are so convinced that they will be so happy with someone and meanwhile they don't respect the other people feelings. They just want to claim that happiness and give nothing back. 
I don't want her to feel bad about it because I don't believe it's her fault at all. But I feel bad about how others constantly want to pick her up even when we are together and they know about it.
The thing is I don't feel really jealous, maybe a bit insecure about myself and don't know how to deal with it. I'm just in two minds for a while.

I, (29F) started a brand new teaching job during the summer with, ""J"" (25F). We have been getting to know each other and we bond over our students whom we both share, we just switch classes depending on the subjects. I consider her as my friend but lately i dont know how I feel.

I have been doing a lot of self care for myself lately. Like slowly changing my style, hair cut, working out at the gym more, etc and everytime i do something, J always gives me a beautiful smile and compliments me and for some reason, i enjoy hearing it from her.

A while back, she kept appearing on my Friends You May Know on FB &amp; IG and I admit that I stalked her for a bit. Until that moment, I have never thought about how beautiful, amazing, and fun she really is and the more I saw on her social media, the more I started really liking her. I normally have my social media private but i really want her to see it so i took it off private. I have never told her that I've seen her popping up on my social media but i have hinted about having some in case she asks to follow each other or not. Although its fine with me if she doesnt want to or not since I know based on experience that you SHOULDNT add your current coworkers! Haha but thats a different story


Anyways, lately I have been thinking about her. Like ALOT. I constantly think now ""what is J going to think about this outfit"", or whether shes going to like how I styled my hair, etc. I sometimes will daydream about her like when a song that reminds me of her starts playing and even fantasizing about her. It has been getting hard to look her in the eyes or even talk to her because I will start to get nervous and stutter like crazy. There have been times where she wondered if she did something wrong because I would avoid her but lately shes been chalking it up to my personality change that has come with my new appearance (Idk maybe im going thru a life crisis haha). Anyways It's confusing me so much because i have never thought about another woman this way nor do i even act like this around guys im interested in. I dont think I like girls (theres nothing wrong with it at all, i have just never felt like this towards other women before). What do i even do?

My roommate started talking to his girl over a year ago, but they've just been on and off (talking for the most time, dating for a while, broken up but still talking, etc.) since they first met. Frankly I always thought their relationship was weird and too demanding for what it is, but it's not my relationship so I've stayed out of the way and let my roommate do his thing, it's his time anyway and he got mad at my friend for saying something about how much time he spent with his girlfriend.

This year, things have become much worse. In the past, the drawbacks of his relationship with his girlfriend have always just been that he has less time to hang out, nothing really crazy and this is pretty expected with relationships. This year, he has just fully upgraded to not hanging out with friends anymore because he will be with his girlfriend multiple times a day. This has really been causing one of our close friends to become angry, because my roommate will commit to a plan and then just miss it without saying a word. He will do this to me too, especially on daily things like when we agree to go get groceries (which really pisses me off because I'm reliant on him for his car) or really anything. In most cases, you just have to assume that he will not  come for whatever he said he would and he wouldn't say a word to us about it.

In the past I was fine with his relationship as it really didn't have any negative consequences on me, plus my roommate really does not like when people talk to him about his relationship. This year I have just continually felt like I have been paying a price for the amount of time he spends with his girlfriend and I have to be the middle man between him and our friends now - since he just lacks the ability to talk with any of them I guess.

So this is actually kind of complicated to explain. I’ll try my best.

Some context: I’m autistic and was sexually abused as a child and when I was 14. She was raped as a teenager.

I don’t really have friends I could tell all this because they don’t know about me being abused/her being raped.

I (19 nb) started seeing someone (18 f) and we have been dating for about 2 and a half months. Last Tuesday night I picked her and some friends up from a party. They were all pretty drunk and after I dropped everyone but her off we went to my home. We originally planned to get something to eat but she said she was too tired. We’ve never really been naked around each other because I never had a relationship before and said I wanted to take things slow. She’s okay with that and tries to make me feel comfortable. So we started making out. I told her I was kind of uncomfortable with making out with her while she was drunk. She said she wasn’t that drunk. So we continued. Somewhen she started taking her and my tops and bras off. I was okay with that at the moment. I didn’t really know what to do next because I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable or remind her of what was done to her and was just kind of overwhelmed. She also tried to take my pants off. After I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that she immediately stopped. It was kind of awkward afterwards and she asked me if I wanted to tell her why I was overwhelmed. I haven’t told her about being abused before. At that time I went non verbal because I was really overwhelmed. The next day she apologized for making it weird over text and I said it wasn’t her fault and it’s okay.

I am very toxic and I need help...

I have been in a relationship for 3 years now (we are in our late 20s). My issues have always been here but have now become too much for our relationship. We have tried talking about it, finding solutions but nothing seems to last. It reached a point where we decided to contact a couple therapist next week. 

We love each other dearly and were talking of getting married one day and hopefully having a family. But as things are now it is impossible and unthinkable.

1. I am a very impulsive person. I get angry first before thinking rationaly. I tend to tear everything down, scream, whine instead of taking a step back to breath and think calmly as soon as something irritates me.

2. I tend to be a ""my way or not way"" girl. I get very easily frustrated if things do not go according to my plans or people do not agree with my views. I am the eldest in my family and have already been called bossy or that I can't be too much like a mom. I like deciding what we are going to do, eat, etc (my family, friends, collegues etc)

3. I don't give my boyfriend enough alone time or space. I tend to always be on him, either physically (hugs etc) or by always wanting to do stuff together or talking all the time. I grew up with 3 siblings so I always had someone to talk with or do stuff with. He grew up as an only child and is used to spend time alone. I am too clingy and I get bored being on my own for a while.

My boyfriend is my total opposite. He is calm, rational, will avoid fighting over stuff that do not or should not matter. He likes to play video games on his side, is ok with silence, believes it is better than unnecessary bullshit.

How can I change? How can I let go of all these negative aspects of my personality or at least control them and myself better? We are fighting too much and I am afraid to loose him.

We truly love each other and after a plethora of very mentally abusive and neglectful relationships I’ve been in, I am over the moon that I found my soulmate and someone as wonderful as he has been for the past 2 years. 

We are very open on a myriad of different subjects, and one of the most controversial ones is abortion. Both he and I are pro choice, although he is slightly more restrictive in his opinions, but in the end it always comes down to “woman’s body and woman’s choice”. During our last convo I asked him how would he react in a hypothetical case that we weren’t together and another girl he’s with decided to terminate because she doesn’t want a child currently, and while I have heard a lot of different opinions about termination, this one I have heard for the first time and he said if he found himself in such a situation he would be there for his partner and all, but his willingness to try for a child again would be significantly decreased. As in, it would take quite a lot of talking to convince him to try for another baby again, his reasoning is that no matter how hard he would try to forget the first child, the thought of her/him would always be in a part of his brain and he wouldn’t be able to completely forget it. 

He wouldn’t blame the partner, he wouldn’t be mad or weaponize that against the girl, but it would be much harder for him to find a legitimate reason to try for a child again.

She’s been really busy with traveling and life and i’ve tried to be as understanding about it as possible. But I can’t lie, sometimes it hurt. I never expected her to devote all of her attention to me but I just wish she shared a little more with me. Now, I got back home from seeing her (we’re long distance) about 3.5 weeks ago. When she was with me she had a lot of college work she needed to do that she put off by spending time with me. I told her I was okay with her focusing on that after I got home and I can give her space. But, after a few days went by I was feeling disconnected and lonely. I told her I know she’s busy now but once she’s done with her applications we should plan to do something together. I brought this up causally several times so she knew it was important and so she didn’t forget. The day she finished them she planned something with our friend but didn’t plan anything with me. Now I don’t expect her to not plan anything with friends and to plan things with me first, but the fact that she had time for that and it didn’t make her think oh, my boyfriend has been wanting me to get back to him about when we can have a date, I should do that now - hurt. I brought this up to her and she got a little snippy with me about it at first but then listened and was apologetic. A week goes by and still, nothing is planned. I bring it up again and she apologizes. Another two days go by and nothing. At this point she’s about to leave for a trip in a few days where i’ll hardly be able to keep in touch with her for about 4 days. So, I finally just did it myself. I asked if we could watch a show together the day before she left. She said yes, and that we could figure out exact times for it the day we do it. She tells me a time and I call her as soon as she said she was ready. When she called she said she was busy packing and I thought to myself okay, I’ll talk with her until she’s done and then we can watch something together. About an hour goes by and there’s been no mention of it so i say hey, when do you wanna watch something together? She said oh, i’m tired. I wanna go to bed. I have to wake up early tomorrow. At this point I just start crying. I tell her how all of this has collectively made me feel unloveable and worthless as her boyfriend and all I’ve been asking for for the last 2.5 weeks is for one date to be planned. She was extremely apologetic and reassured me that she loves me and cares about our relationship deeply, but never made any promises to do better or planned anything for when she got back. I could tell when she was on her trip she made way more of an effort to stay connected with me. Usually she’d only send me a few texts here and there but this time she actually called me every day while she was gone, even if it was only for a few minutes. But at this point I still feel immensely hurt by what happened and I feel emotionally withdrawn and shut down in our relationship. I hate that I feel this way because I know she’s making an effort to fix what happened. And I want to be okay, but I just feel so hurt still. I don’t know what to think about this.

TW for mental health and SH 

My partner had a hefty amount of friends during school however lost a bunch naturally through growth and just general falling outs over small stupid things. He had a few really good close friends or so we thought who just ended up ghosting him a bit after school. And since then he has no one he can really call a friend outside of his family. 
This absolutely breaks my heart because I know him better than anyone and although I may be a bit biased, I know for certain he is the most loving and caring person out there. 
He struggles a lot with severe diagnosed depression and social anxiety however never really talks about it or how having no friends would contribute to this. That’s just his way of coping I believe. Even when he did have close friends, he would never tell them how he was actually doing even if they asked as if he didn’t speak about it, he wouldnt have to acknowledge it in a way. 
In saying this, I try not to bring it up ever to him because I know how embarrassing or awkward it would be to discuss this. 
His family brings it up from time to time saying “it’s no way to live without friends” and he always shrugs it off with a nonchalant attitude, but I know he is hurting inside. 
I can admit he does have a very dark sense of humour and his intelligence can get the best of him at times making him stubborn or argumentative, but everyone has flaws. And he rarely makes this an issue. 
He is so funny, so smart and can talk about absolutely anything in depth and happily. 
He would be a great friend and I know this because he is genuinely my best friend. 
Instead of talking to him about how it might make him feel to have no friends, I try to tell him as often as possible that he is my best friend because it is true. But I seriously don’t know if I am supporting him well enough. I don’t know if I am doing enough to help him. I am not trying to cure his depression but I just want to know if I am doing enough. 
I tell him he can always come to me. Everyday I remind him that I am here to listen and provide advice only when he wants it. But other than that I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to pry at him for how he’s feeling, ultimately making him feel worse. 
He makes it known that he is happy to just do his own thing. He plays video games, builds computers and all that sort of stuff and we often play and build together as I share an interest in that, but I’m sure he’d want someone else he can share his hobbies with. :( 
It absolutely breaks my heart. 
I struggle with my own issues, a lot of self harm and bipolar mood swings, and I’m worried if he were to struggle to cope with both my issues but his as well and feel as though he has no one outside this relationship he can turn to then he might just give up. 
I know this problem will most likely solve itself with time but I am not worried about the future I am worried about now. He doesn’t put himself in positions where he might have the chance to meet new people due to his social anxiety. I am just worried I am not being as supportive as I should be. 
I have been in this position before. I have had no one to turn to outside of family before and it hurts and is so dehumanising. I don’t know why he struggles with this as he is the most kind hearted person I know and he would honestly do anything for a friend. 
I also think sometimes, if for some reason we were to separate, he would have no one outside this relationship and his own family to talk to which is added pressure. 
Please just let me know if anyone else is in this position and how they help with this. I just don’t know what to do.
