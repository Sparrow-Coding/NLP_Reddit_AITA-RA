I've also gained around 10 kg since we started dating, I have very low self-esteem because of that. I don't feel comfortable with him going down on me, I don't feel comfortable being naked or being touched on my thighs or belly. I am not overweight, but definitely not as skinny as I was previously.

I am also having some gynecological problems - uterine fibroids, bleeding after intercourse (just a little bit, but it scares me every single time). My gynecologist said that everything is fine and I shouldn't be worried (it is possibly because my bf is a bit too big for me).

My boyfriend (19m) and I (19f) have been dating for about 3 months now. We were good friends all throughout high school, and after we graduated we admitted that we had always liked each other. We have been inseparable ever since. He is the best partner I’ve had, he treats me very well. He has the most kind heart and that is one of the things I adore about him. I know that 3 months is nothing, but it has felt like forever. Our relationship is moving fast. We have sex frequently and sleep at each other’s houses often. It seems obvious, but this is where our problems are stemming from. A bit about my past for context. I was raped my senior year of high school by my then boyfriend. I thought I loved him, so I continued to allow him to sexually use and abuse me until I left for college. Towards the end of my first semester of college, I was held down and raped multiple times by a boy I considered a friend. I became severely depressed and attempted to end my life. Dropped out of college and moved back home. Spent some time sleeping around and using sex as a form of self harm. Finally started therapy and practiced abstinence until my current relationship. He knows that I was raped, but he does not know my full story. There are times when I get “flashbacks” and he doesn’t know how to deal with me during them. I do my best to communicate but it is not easy. I feel like I am quick to agree to sex, even if I’m not fully in the mood. Part of me feels guilty for saying no. I know I am safe with him but it is obvious that I am still somewhat stuck in the past. He has noticed this and told me that sometimes he feels like he is forcing or pressuring me to sleep with him. He feels guilty for it and I can tell that it is eating away at him. He is nothing like those other guys, and it is my fault he feels this way. I am the one who is unable to set boundaries.

In this context I mean that he will watch their streams, support them through donations, mod their streams, but also DM them and hang out with them in person. Essentially, all his female friends are attractive streamer women who share his interests. I have shared my insecurities with him as he has toned back on hanging out in person, but he is still actively texting with them on a daily basis.

I'm talking about being out of work and having the pressure of trying to find something new, while my wife is coming out of 2 years of little to no sleep with a rough pregnancy and a baby and we have our three and a half year old toddler to contend with on top of everything.

It could be worse as I have a part-time gig, but that's probably gonna fall away in the new year. I'm fortunate that I've built up a financial cushion over the years, but I can't rely on that forever and the spectre of having to find a new job is always hanging over me. I'm in the middle of a few processes, but it ain't easy and I've always found job searches tough. I'm good at what I do, but I can never seem to convert opportunities and so that monkey is always there on my back, jabbering away in my ear... My wife is/was so tired and I'm so stressed we only ever see things from our own perspectives (me: you should give me more leeway because of the stress I'm under / her: why can't you be around more to help with the kids).

Any spark has long since gone. I genuinely can't remember the last time we kissed or even touched. Don't even mention sex... I used to always say 'I love you' before going to bed, but noticed that she rarely said it back - don't know if it was deliberate or not... I've stopped doing it due to the breakdown in our relationship and now can't remember the last time the L word was used by either of us. We're just not bothered. OK I'm not the most romantic or outwardly affectionate person in the world and I have my own issues which have really weighed on me the last few years, particularly some chronic physical symptoms that I can't get rid of, but I feel I'm not getting any signals.

We used to get nice personalised cards for each other on birthdays and Mothers'/Fathers' Day, but our wedding anniversary was three weeks ago and all we could muster was a forced 'Happy Anniversary' and then we went about our daily business as usual. I had actually bought her a card the day before, but when I saw she hadn't got one for me, I didn't bother writing it. Or maybe she thought the same thing and didn't write hers either…

We are civil most of the time - no blazing arguments - but I know she's not happy and I know for sure I'm not, but in my life I've been very good at bottling up those emotions and ploughing on regardless. It's a vicious circle - I know the more I withdraw (not on purpose, but because I'm dealing with my own shit right now), the less she gives too. And on it goes… I feel it runs deeper than just being a tough kids phase.

I feel like we've drifted apart the last couple of years and I worry that it's just a natural acceleration of the underlying weakness in our relationship. I'm worried that I ignored the golden rule of sexual attraction. Don't get me wrong, she's not unattractive (think petite, girl next door, brunette), but I've never been massively physically attracted to her or had any sexual urges other than what you get from abstinence. I remember when we started dating it was weeks before we slept together. I didn't push for it at all and when we finally did I remember feeling a bit weird about it, like I was having sex with my cousin, rather than being super passionate. I worry about the fact her long-term relationship before me ended after 7 years because they basically just became friends who lived together...

I came to realise early on in our relationship that she wasn't sexual at all and could easily go without, whereas I do like regular sex, though looking back she only seemed to care about it when kids were on the agenda. It's sad to say, but I feel like we both wanted marriage for the wrong reasons: she because she wanted kids / didn't want to get left on the shelf and me because I didn't want to be a sad bachelor much longer. I wouldn't say we were ever madly in love, but then again I don't think I ever could be.

I'm now thinking: can I live the rest of my life like this, in a sexless relationship where there's a constant undertone of something's not right even though she's such a kind caring person at heart. I know we need to get this out in the open some time and we will. It's just the time hasn't been right given my situation with work etc. I sort of think if I was sitting on the counsellor's couch and she/he said ""but do you *want* this to work?"" I don't think it would be a no-brainer. But then the thought of throwing in the towel is terrifying.

Sorry for the essay, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thoughts welcome.

**TLDR**: in a really tough spot in my marriage, not helped by young kids and redundancy. No sex, no love, no affection, just a clear unspoken separation between us. I worry that the sexual attraction element could be a real deal-breaker going forward.

Part 1

Long Post - Been together 2yrs and live together. His actions throughout the night has me currently convinced that he was with someone else and/or doing something else. Spent the whole night questioning myself and being in denial. If I’m overreacting to this I’d like for someone here to call me out for it. 

Yesterday he mentioned that he was going to visit his friend that lives an hour away from us and they were going to game together or whatever at his place which is an hour away. 1. He’s never done that before since we’ve been together and 2. He took the Xbox with him which he’s never done either. He had to of arrived by 4pm but I had to text him for an update at 11pm since I didn’t hear from him all day. He knows I will not blow up his phone while he’s out (have never done that), I try not to text him when he’s out with friends and only will if it’s an emergency, he knows i need some sort of communication after 6hrs if either of us is out late because idk I value our safety?... Not 1,2,3hrs but 6hrs… cmon man like I’m trying really hard here not to be overbearing and I just wanted simple communication in return. 

At 11pm I texted him “how’s it going?” Still trying my best not to upset him while he’s with his friend for some reason…. He responded “good over here! You?” Look after 2yrs we both know how each other is feeling/acting just by what we text and his response was cold, dismissive and just not him. He was trying to shoo me away.. as if he didn’t sending me multiple “I miss you” texts earlier that day just because…. 

After that 11pm text I called him at 2:15am since I’ve heard nothing and again it’s so not like him/us to be this avoidant and out this late…well he answered. Didn’t hear anything in the background no video games and no friend. I stayed calm over the phone. Talking to him over the phone felt like pulling teeth when trying to get him to answer my (very basic non intrusive) questions and he didn’t seem to notice or care about the time or my concerns.. He ended up coming home at 3am. Sorry but how am I supposed to believe that he spent 10hrs playing video games with his friend who is married and who also has a damn job to get to in the morning.

We have been in an open relationship since day 1 and one of the first things I told him when we started dating is that i don't want it otherwise, he told me that's what he wanted too so it was fine. We moved in together in the beginning of september as roommates (we both have our own room and space) in a new country. We are here for only 6 months, on a study exchange programm. 

We started arguing a lot since we moved in, mainly because he wanted me to stop seing other men. I told him it wasn't what we agreed on, and I could stop for a small time until he felt comfortable again but it was only temporary. 

Fast forward a month, we have been having 1-2h talks every day about him feeling bad that I want to see other men, and me telling him I suffer from the lack of freedom and trust. A day, I sat him down to tell him I can't put up with this anymore and that if we both feel unhappy and cry our heart off every day, it's probably just because we don't have the same needs anymore. I told him that even if we loved each other deeply, it would probably be better for us to split as our couple was structurally f*cked up. He answered that if we split now it would kill him. 

Now, a month later, I am still with him because I am scared that he would actually do it. I'm not sexually attracted to him anymore, and my feelings are starting to wear off too. I act happy and tell him my birth control is what makes me have less libido, and have sex with him the more often I can bear to have peace. 

I genuinely think he loves me and he seems so content that we are ""happy"" again together and that we managed to get over our fights. 
Meanwhile, I constantly think about how my life could be without him, about when we will split up, and I am starting to have dark thoughts. I feel helpless: I don't want to be with him anymore and I feel like I'm the worst assh*le because of it.

I have no idea of what I should do, and I wonder if some people may have had a similar experience and could share how they handled it.

I'm a 29 year old Muslim woman. So basically, an old hag. I'm getting emotionally manipulated by my parents to go on dates with guys I'm not even remotely interested in. ""Don't you want a family? Don't you want children? Do you want to die alone? You're going to be so lonely and full of regret when you're older."" Etc, etc. 

Two months ago, my parents set me up with a guy in their state (I'm across the country). So I say, I'll accept a phone call from him on the condition that no one forces me into anything. And this is where I made a mistake. I was naive in thinking that I wouldn't be forced and/or emotionally manipulated. 

Anyway, he texts me. We have a short phone call. We don't have anything in common. Our personalities don't mesh. We exchange photos and I'm not into him physically. Not even an ounce. I can't imagine being physically intimate with this man. 

I give him no indication that I'm interested. In fact, I'm super dry. Eventually, I start ignoring his texts. Guess what homie does? He calls my father! He says something along the lines of, your daughter isn't really giving me time. Is everything alright?  

But if you think his audacity ends there, you're wrong. We haven't spoken in about two months. Last time he texted me, I was very dry and eventually ignored him again. Again, this was about two months ago. So what do you think he does this time? HE CHASES DOWN MY FATHER AT THE MASJID. He says, oh just so you know I'm cutting my trip to my home country short so I can be back here in time when your daughter is here for the holidays. I'd like to see her soon. 

The audacity of this man. THE AUDACITYYYYYY. 

Already, this has caused so much turmoil in my family. I almost fought with my mom over this. I hate that. I don't want to fight with my mother over this idiot. 

What do I do? Of course, the natural course of action would be to simply tell him off. But there's no guarantee he won't go straight to my father. After all, he's already done so twice!!!! If I tell him off, he'll go to my dad and this can of worms will open all over again. And it'll cause drama and chaos within the family.

I may also be missing certain elements, so feel free to ask for clarification if needed.

For the last 3 years I (32M) have been in a friends with benefits situation with two friends (30M and 29M) who are in a relationship. I am not in a relationship with them, but meet them very often (usually one/two times per week). 

They opened up their relationship a long time ago and when they moved to the country I (and now they as well) are living they used Grindr (popular chat app for gay men) to find friends with the possibility of more happening at some point down the line. That's how they found me.  

We started just as friends, but as time went on at some point the relationship got sexual, and has continued that way. They are both amazing friends and doing 'stuff' with them both is great, but we also go to movies, play board games, drink together, chat together etc. However, from the start I've been somewhat closer with one of the two (29M) as he's more communicative over chat, we share more hobbies, he's more emotional while his boyfriend is more rational. 

I think 30M has always been a bit unsure about his boyfriend (29M) chatting to other men on the side due to how easily he makes connections and perceiving himself as the less desirable of the two. They fight about this every so often, and their communication about this specific matter has always been a bit troublesome. 

They also just moved house, and some things have gone wrong in this process so they've been more stressed lately and fighting a bit more. 30M has also been far more negative the past year, where he sees our friendship as a place to complain about everything else in life, but not giving much positivity back. 

This has now come to a head when I visited them last week. I was feeling shitty, and they invited me to come over. We chatted for a bit, and I decided to sleep there for some intimacy. I don't usually initiate sex as I want to be conscious of their relationship, and that was also the case this night. At some point during the night I woke, and 29M did as well, and at that point things did get sexual between us, while 30M was not involved but lying next to us. We weren't trying to exclude him, but he's a notoriously deep sleeper and doesn't like to be woken up, plus, he's less sexual so doesn't always like to be involved. That still doesn't excuse that we didn't try, so that was definitely a mistake. Later he left the bed and went to lie on the couch in a different room, clearly signaling that his feelings were hurt. 

I stayed the rest of the night, and in the morning 30M didn't say a word to me or his boyfriend so I left after saying sorry to him through a closed door. I also sent him text messages afterwards to apologize for misreading the situation. Later during that day I chatted to 29M a bit, but got nothing back from 30M. 

The next day I got a message from 29M that 30M talked to him and decided unilaterally to close the relationship. 30M did not send me anything, and when I asked 29M whether that closing also included me he said ""I guess"". 

I didn't hear anything from 30M for a week, and only then did we chat over text where he did apologize for the no contact and me getting caught in the middle of this. I told him I felt incredibly hurt, kind of like a discarded toy, as he didn't even tell me how he felt even though we've been great friends for years, and the problem originated from the two of them not being on the same page. When I go there of course I try to be cognizant of how they both feel, but I also assume that they talk to each other about what they allow or not allow. 

He also said the following things:  
\- When I come over I have more sex with 29M than with him. I don't think this is true.  
\- He feels like our friends with benefit relationship is just about the benefits. I don't think this is true, and for me the benefits are also part of the friendship, the intimacy of it is important to me.

Somehow the whole conversation left me feeling like it was slightly too easy after 3 years for him to just drop me, even though I knew from the start that I wasn't a part of their relationship so that it could happen. I just thought that as good friends at least I would also be respected. He also made me feel like I was the one only in the relationship for the sex, and not for the friendship.

This leads me to right now. How do I move forward with the friendship if I do so at all?

She loves exercise, playing the piano, watching football, writing and baking (I have to say, her cakes do look very professional). She is an elementary tutor (not even a teacher) and is currently breaking in to the sports media world - I think she has like 4 jobs which is odd... so she is a school tutor and does sports writing and broadcasting some weekends. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her.

In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously. She comes from a wealthy family (she is also a shareholder in the business valued at roughly $3M) - I only know this from google search results... she is elegant and classy but you probably wouldn't be able to tell her family are rich as she's humble and doesn't brag or anything. She is not that well travelled although she says she would like to do more of that in future. Instead she is focusing on the London marathon which she got in to through the ballot.

I just feel like she's boring - the main thing I struggle with is the fact she has a lack of social life so not many life experiences... I also don't understand some of her values - she told me she's going to get a lot of Christmas gifts for her niece and nephew... she said she's got some creative ideas but she'd basically be spending $200 on each so $400 in total. Absurd.

I've also recently noticed on her IG bio she has put a link to her running page - this page has about 130 followers (random runners) and she has about 10 posts... these are from random dates so not that consistent. They are all selfies/ pics of her running in just a sports bra and shorts... it appears she's trying to become a running influencer but she hardly has that many followers so it's a bit embarrassing too. A lot of these are her showing off her abs.

It appears she is trying to revive this page perhaps for some motivation for the marathon but I just feel it's a bit... unnecessary. I don't get why she has to flaunt her face and body like that.

3 weeks ago, she attempted suicide. I can't explain it, but I had a feeling to check up on her. I found her, half dead, on her bathroom floor. I called the cops and we went to the hospital. Rosie survived and voluntarily went to the pych hospital.

She's been out for a week and started school again. We have hardly spoken. Trust me, I want to talk to her. I want to be friends again, but I have no idea how to go about it. I don't want to pretend like nothing happened, but I have no idea how to talk to her about it. I abandoned her when she needed me. Now, I don't even know if I would be welcomed back into her life.

So during the 3 months prior of the long distance relationship we lived in the same small town and we would almost hang every day, she didn't have many friends in town so I would always be around to a company her as she was originally living in a bigger city prior to meeting me (hour and a half away from me). She would always say to me how she missed living in the city going out with her friends dressing up and would also mention how she would feel financially safe as all her exes would be loaded and take her to fancy events and travel while I'm not well off at the moment since I'm in still in university and how it sucks how I cant bring her those things. She has told me that Im genuinely the best bf shes had ever, and Im the first person shes truly loved and we talk about our future all the time. But about 4 months into our relationship she would always state how I don't bring that too that table and how shes wishes i was few years older. It always sucks that she brings that up as it feels like theres nothing I can do but just listen. So fast forward to now I am home from
university as I'm taking it online and we would hang roughly 2-3x a week as I came back mostly for her as she missed me and felt lonely. She moved back to the big city after I came back so its tough to meet her everyday but I would always make the effort and drive out after work and leave right before work starts (3 hour roundtrip). I would ask what time shes off so I can calculate when i can arrive and usually have a 12 hour shift from 4-4 so I can be pretty tired but I am willing to sacrifice sleep for her. So when I nap at her place before I work I tend to snore loud, I never used to snore but usually when Im tired I've been told i do. So she would be irritated. I told her im sorry snd I wont sleepover if she has work the following day or at all if it bothers her. But every time Im over she insists I sleep over and I comply but now I'm deemed selfish and how she has to baby sit me because I snore, ask her what time shes off, how her day is going,how she has no time to hang with her friends and how now I am a nuisance to her, controlling and overwhelming her.

We spent the day/ night together when we were with a group of friends but it was like it was just us. Anyways he lives in nyc and left the next day, after hooking up I expected to never see him again. 

I got a text from him the next day, he got my number from my friend and was like hey I want to keep talking to you. Anyways, we’ve been in contact everyday the last month in a half. Texting everyday, calling for hours, FaceTiming. It’s gotten to the point where he was like “I’m absolutely crazy about you like I don’t know what to do I like you so much you don’t understand” then we planned for me to come visit this weekend since the city is only a 5 hour drive for me. 

This is where it gets confusing. The last couple of days he’s been completely MIA. The man was basically proposing living in my city and then BOOM nothing. He was ignoring my calls and texts, finally texted me “hey I’m so sorry I’ve been so busy” which I said is fine! It happens. This behavior continued which I brushed off bc I was seeing him in person in a few days anyway. Well last night he texts me saying that” he is going to be too busy this weekend and that I shouldn’t come. I’m a really nice girl and he doesn’t like hurting people “ which confused me. So I responded asking if he “ was still going to come visit me for thanksgiving and that his message confused me if he could clarify his feelings , did he want to continue talking to me? “ he left me on read.

We were basically kids when we started dating. She's very shy and reserved, probably has social anxiety.

Regardless, I feel like our relationship is pretty lacking. I see all these couples in my close circle who study together, are at each other's houses all the time, go to the cinema, go ice skating, so kayaking, share the same group of friends… None of that applies to our relationship. We basically see each other for like 10 minutes during break time and another 10 minutes after class, and then she goes home. She's also rarely cuddly and affection-showing.

We had a fight about a month ago in which I basically told her how I feel about this, and she denied everything saying that it isn't true. This discussion started because, for the first time in years, I had a weekend with my house all for myself (my parents went on a trip to Italy), I obviously told her to come and she declined, telling me she had to study for an exam she had NEXT THURSDAY. Also, since we started dating, I had always proposed her to go kayaking, but she always said no. Then I found out that a couple of weeks before our discussion she went kayaking with her group of friends in the same spot where I had always asked her to go.

Anyways, we had said discussion, and I pretty much ""forgave"" her and we kept on being together. Everything was relatively fine for the next month, and I couldn't really demand to see her much because we both had exams. So we pretty much overcame that discussion until this week. Basically, my birthday is in six days and I asked her to have dinner with me and my parents that day (she's never met my parents and I've never met hers, I've always proposed her to meet them but she's always declined, and when I've wanted to meet her parents she always says that it's not a good idea). Exams are now no excuse because the trimester is over, but she tells me that she doesn't want to meet them because ""we're not at a healthy enough point in our relationship"". I tell her to stop making excuses because she's always declined to meet my parents even when we were at our peak, and that if she's neither interested or committed in our relationship she should say it. We have a heated WhatsApp discussion and now we won't speak to each other. I refuse to approach her and discuss this because I'm always the one who takes action and is interested on being together. When we're mad at each other, even when it's her fault, she never approaches me, it always has to be me, and I'm tired of this.

I (f32) will explain a bit the situation and each guy whom I'll be calling Love (m27), Cotton (m33). 
Here is the deal: 
1. Long distance relationship, both. 
2. I'm a college grad, make okay-enough-for-me-money very confused and feeling like shit about what to do with my romantic life. 
3. Love: After I sworn I wouldn't be in a long distance relationship again, he showed up. 
Im in love with a guy that's financially very unstable, no dreams of the future as in doesn't want to go to college, or have professional growth; but he's the most emotionally supportive person I've known. We have visited each other for months. I've got my own place, he visited for 3 month and it was great. I visited for 3 months, he lives with his mom so I mentally prepared to get into this new situation, but that was a one time card. I can't visit him again cause he lives with his mom, he can't visit cause he works and the ticket is $1300usd (I've paid all of the tickets so far) and staying for a week doesn't seem cost/efficient to me or him. We talked about when will be seeing each other again, and the only option we had was: we will figure it out... And since I came back home months ago we haven't talked much, I think I gave up :(
He doesn't have the income to apply for marriage cause he must over the poverty wage. Marrying is the only way we could have a life together, if he ever manages to get the income, what's next for me in the relationship life happy and in love but having to deal with almost all the payments. 

4. Cotton: college grad, prob same income as me. Dated for 3 years back in 2017. He's a kind and sensitive guy. We got engaged back then, but didn't marry cause I would have had to go on a fiancee visa and wouldn't have been able to work. I was finishing college needed to get done with my internships and find a job. So I gave up, didn't want to wait all that long. Didn't date anyone until I met Love. 
We reconnected with Cotton after all these years, and I still feel affection for him, I never loved him like I feel Love but I was younger and the relationship with Cotton does have a future. 
Ofc I feel bad for my relationship with Love, but as much as it pains me to say it or to think about it, it is relationship with no future unless we would want it always to be long distance (which I definitely don't). I'm also feeling like after everything we went through with Cotton, we could give ourselves a second chance. Obviously we wouldn't marry right away, I do need to get to know him again after all these time. 
As disgusted as it makes me, marrying is the only vehicle to move the relationship from long distance to in person.

TW: self harm, depression and suicidal tendencies.

I recently started going to a new school and have seen this absolutely beautiful goth girl. Everything about her is perfect. Perfect height (6’0), I found out she is into role reversal too so she likes shorter men like me, perfect body and perfect music taste (We both like Slipknot, Metallica and System Of A Down). I really want to get to know her and find out more about her. I made a post on a confession account saying that “Ngl that proper tall 6ft goth girl could absolutely demolish me please give me a chance🙏🙏” trying to make it sound more comedic. She put in the comment section that “they need to shoot their shot” and I liked the comment and followed her account. She followed mine back. Recently though I found her Reddit account by accident when searching for a different subreddit and I don’t know what to do. On her account there was lots of her art (though she had posted this already on her insta) and their meanings and it made me feel super sad. It turns out her beautiful art was actually about how alone she felt and how she felt like she was “a monster”. There were also posts in a self harm fashion subreddit mainly talking about her road to recovery but her most recent post made me feel ill. Her most recent post which was only to her followers was about how she felt disgusting in her own skin and how she doesn’t feel worthy of love. I had never felt ill from just reading a Reddit post before and knowing this is how she felt about herself felt like a tragedy to me. What would you guys recommend me do? I thought about messaging her just as someone trying to make new friends and meet new people, what places and activities would you recommend for me to do with her as a first place to meet (keep in mind I haven’t talked to her or messaged her before).

Both of us were super awkward, but we got to talking and found that we both really enjoyed deep conversations about serious topics. Eventually we started cuddling, kissing, and eventually having awkward but cute ""fun time."" Things went fairly well from there. We texted back and forth, he took me stargazing, he was the first guy who's place I spent the night at, all that good stuff. However, about 6 months in, he really started to fade out. Not responding to messages, saying he was too tired to hang out but posting stories on Snapchat of him hanging with other people, avoiding every attempt I made for us to get together no matter how accommodating I tried to be, etc. Eventually I got pissed enough that I sent him a long rant about how I didn't deserve that kind of treatment and that if he didn't want to be in a relationship he should have been man enough to say it to my face instead of ghosting like a coward. He apologized and said that he didn't want to hang out or be together because he ""wanted to be his best self"" around me and that he ""didn't want to feel like \[he\] was giving me less than 100%."" I told him that was bullsh\*t and that I never asked for his 100%, just for some effort. He apologized again, but I was so pissed I just blocked him on everything and had a good cry. I unblocked him a few days later just to say we could still talk someday if he ever wanted to, but that I would not reach out to him and could not be anything more than semi-distant friends with him. He said okay, apologized again, and that was where I thought we'd leave it. Until....

Guess who got a message on Grindr a month ago? Yup, he reached out UNSOLICITED and asked how I was doing. I decided to be friendly and go along with it. We chatted for a while about how our lives have changed (quite a bit for both of us) and a bit about how we'd left things. Tbh, after reflecting on it some more, I do feel like I overreacted to an extent. His living situation at the time wasn't great. He had his parents and grandparents suddenly moving in with him, having to find a new place for them all since rent went up, finishing his education, just a lot of stuff. I'm not excusing how he treated me, I just took the time to analyze why he did some of the things he did. I said I was sorry for being quite as harsh as I was, but he said ""stop saying sorry, you don't have anything to be sorry for."" After that exchange, we basically just started texting normally again. And oddly, he's been the one reaching out to me every day, at least twice a day to talk. This is extremely strange as before I initiated every conversation we had. He never reached out of his own accord before now. This has all left me feeling pretty confused. Full disclosure: I'm on the upper, high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. I'm indistinguishable from neurotypical people in a lot of ways, but one of the biggest ways in which I struggle is understanding the intentions of people. I can't read into subtext, I don't understand subtlety, and I take people's words at face value. What I'm trying to say is I don't know or understand what it is that he wants from me. Does he just want to be friends? More? I'm planning to confront him in person sometime soon, but I want to try and go into it with a better initial understanding of where we're at. Sorry this took so long to read. If you're still here, tysm for listening to my ranting. I hope that maybe you can see this through the lens of your experience and maybe shed some light on all this for me.

Given how complicated it’s been (lots of step-relations), it’s gone extremely well. We’re compatible as hell. 

When we first started dating, the sex was through the roof in quality and quantity. At the beginning, she said things like “you’ll never be able to keep up with my sex drive” and “I can’t wait to move in so you can go down on me every day.” This was extremely important to me because I’ve been in relationship with mis-matched sex drives and it’s miserable. 

We’ve been living together for a year now, and it’s clear that sex for her is only going to be a weekend thing, if that. If someone has to travel for a weekend, or if a weekend coincides with a period, we can easily go two to three weeks without.  We’ve been averaging 3 times per month, with two of those being quickies. 

She claims it’s a new job that is stressing her out. But the quantity of sex started down hill well before she got this job. I understand that quantity of sex will decline in all relationships from the beginning hot sex stage, but this is a *dramatic* decline from when we were dating. We once had sex nine times in three days. Now she won’t even French kiss me unless it’s a weekend. 

The most alarming thing to me is this: I’ve told her I can survive with weekend sex if that’s all there is, but it would mean a lot to me if she would give me a  routine tug on Wednesdays before bed. No dice. And no reason why not. So I’ve been waking up with insomnia, sexually frustrated with painful night erections, and I’ve been generally despondent that she could prevent my despair with a five minute handy once a week. I’m screaming out SOS and she’s ignoring my needs. I just want a weeknight tug, if only for some evidence that she cares about me. I’d be happy to do it myself if she would rub her boobs on me. Nope. She says she needs time alone to decompress from work (she goes to bed three hours after me). 

Now, before I get the advice to do more around the house to help her de-stress and feel more in-the-mood, let me say that when she got her new job, I started doing 90% of the cooking, 90% of the cleaning, all the outside yard work, all the dog walking, and 50% of the child care for her daughter. I also have to care for my own kids and I have a demanding job.

When we got to the hotel, in an attempt to be chivalrous, I carried as much of our stuff as possible. One of the bags had electronics in it, my wife offered to carry it, but I didn’t let her. While checking in, the bag fell off my suitcase; I caught it, nothing broke.

My wife angrily said, “Dammit, I told you I wanted to carry it,” then went to grab the bag. It was wrapped around my suitcase handle, plus I admittedly felt she was overreacting. I grabbed her hand, which was on the bag handle, and said, “I’ve got it.” 

It was obvious she was angry, her whole demeanor changed. I kept on as if things were still good, as this didn’t seem like a big deal to me. I got the cold shoulder until we got to our room, at which point I asked what was going on. She straight told me she couldn’t believe I “hit” and “yelled” at her.

I’m posting this here specifically because I can’t believe she would accuse me to that. I’ve never laid a hand on her, and the only times I’ve raised my voice to a “yelling” level has been when she’s yelling at me - maybe 4 times total.

This hurts so damn much, and confuses the hell out of me. Two days ago we celebrated our anniversary of meeting for the first time at the same spot we did. We talked about how much we loved each other, all the effort I make with little things to make her smile, and how cute we are together. She even asked me to move forward my move in date to next month. She even came over the night before I was suddenly sent this message the following morning. 

I feel so lost and hopeless right now. I don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated that after all the history and love we had, this occured via text, without even giving me an opportunity to discuss. She even knows how much I insist on these important conversations being in person, and when we had a relationship-threating issue last year because of actions at her end, I worked really hard to work through the issue and make it work with her. It feels this time, she's made no effort, let alone an attempt, to fight for us and put what we have above the rest. We were so perfect and so much was right. 

As for her reason, it's somewhat true, but I think it's a strong misunderstanding and she's jumped to a conclusion. I can only think of an instance 2-3 weeks ago, where I went to a close family friends party and met their friends. To naturally extend the friend gorup and get to know their friends too, I did reach out to see if they want to catch up over a coffee/drinks. They already knew I had a girlfriend and was purely innocent. My partner already knows I'm very social and like to get to know everyone as a means of networking. We went overseas separately this year, and no such trust issues were flagged. This reaction has completely blindsided me. But we never had this chance to talk it through. She's always said I've never given her a reason to appear shady.

Her two close friends have blocked me too and I think she's blocked my number too. Aside from going to her place, or sending something via the post - I'm not sure how else to reach her. 

I'd love to hear some thoughts on the situation! Is there anything I should do? is there anything I can do? I'd love to try save our relationship and work through this together, but I'm not sure what to do. I care for her deeply and what we had was worth so much, I'm inclined to work through the pain this has caused me too.

He then asked me if I expected the man to pay. I ignored this question because I found it stupid--if he was going to ask me out, then I am his guest and he needs to pay. So I moved on.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance. He complained about the menu prices the entire time and made me really uncomfortable. I guess he noticed this because as soon as he saw me looking uncomfortable he rubbed my leg and suggested he really wanted to pay. The total for both of us was 55.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out.

He then texted me a week later saying he was sorry and wishes we could have kissed and wats to meet again. Why do this to me?

He’s in grad school rn, and I’m finishing my undergrad degree. We are both in therapy and pretty self-aware, so I believe that we are pretty mature and intelligent for our ages. I’m going to be kinda vague bc I know he goes on reddit, but i’ll do my best to give as much info as I can. 

We moved pretty fast to the point where I’m pretty much living in his apartment at this point, and we have very strong feelings for each other. I’ve never felt anything even close to how I feel about him, and I already can’t imagine my life without him. I care about him deeply and always want him to be happy and feel loved by me. However, I grew up in a environment where people’s promises were almost always broken, so I trust actions so much more than anything words can convey. This also makes me super hesitant in vocalizing how I feel about him because even though I know what I’m saying is true, it feels wrong. I am more comfortable showing my love in actions: cleaning around his apartment, affection, getting small things for him, etc.

He is almost the exact opposite. To him, words confirm actions, and I think they are by far the most important form of love that he needs to receive. Most of our issues thus far have stemmed from him feeling like I don’t care about him as much as he does me. This is partly due to my habit of withdrawing when I am going through something instead of leaning on him for support and comfort. Again, I grew up only really having myself to find comfort in, and I feel the need to deal with my issues independently. However, I think this is more an issue of me not showing love in the way he internalizes the best. 

I kind of operate by the idea that we already know that we care about each other. I wouldn’t be sleeping at his place every night or telling him intimate details about my past and fears for the future if I didn’t care about him. I don’t feel the need to hear or give reassurances everyday or even every other day. I think he does feel that way though, because even when I feel like I’ve been making an effort to vocalize my feelings more, I find that he still does some things to kind of “test” me. It has begun to make me feel analyzed and/or doubted. 

I want to do better to help him feel secure, but I also want to only say things to him when I truly feel it deeply. I also worry about sentiments becoming less meaningful when they are said all the time.

She didn’t know anyone there, and immediately began trying to make friends- and was handing her number out pretty often- take that how it resonates. She also continued to go out to bars after she moved, which made me feel a little uncomfortable at the time because of the fact that she was going alone (she didn’t know anyone) and also because people probably perceived/acted towards her as if she was single. She would go to clubs w her friends when they came into town, as well. Keep in mind, this was also early on in the relationship and there had unfortunately not been a whole lot of time for us to build that trust in each other before she moved. Fast-forward a month or two though, and we had essentially worked through most of that together (bless her for how patient and compassionate she was towards my concerns). She also offered to wear a promise ring when she went out (which I was elated to get for her), and would call me at the end of the night after she made it home. *important*, she had also reassured me at that point that she wasn’t there for guys’ attention, that she would tell them off if they tried to make advances towards her, that she didn’t dance with guys, and she stated that she wouldn’t get drunk the point she didn’t know what was going on, only tipsy. At this point, I began attending therapy as well, to work on my own trust issues/insecurities due to other relationships which have ended badly, because I didn’t want to unnecessarily project those insecurities/past hurts onto her and I wanted to make sure I was being a healthy and reasonable partner. She had a promiscuous past, which at times made me anxious, and I’d get in my head- but she also attended therapy for it so I tried not to let that weigh in. I digress, things seemed to be going well- But then, kind of took a turn for the worse one day when she mentioned in passing that she wanted everyone to think she was sexy, that she wanted to captivate everyone in any room she walked into, and that she wanted them all to think she was attractive (the last part was something along those lines). To me, this was upsetting, because it felt like she still wanted attention from other guys, though she had said previously she didn’t want anyone else’s attention in that way. When I asked her for clarification, she seemed to throw out many excuses and claimed that she didn’t mean it the way it came off (but later said “even if I did mean it the way you took it, what’s wrong with that?”). As much as I wanted to, I had a hard time believing her- my trust took a hit and I began feeling uncomfortable once again with her going out to bars and the like because I now didn’t feel certain about her intentions. Regardless, I stayed with her, and it would be another couple weeks before we were off to a wedding together for a family member of hers. While at the wedding, a few more things happened. She danced with a guy she had met that night, who happened to be a family member of the bride, while I was in the bathroom (I saw her w him when I came back). It wasn’t anything overtly inappropriate, but she had said she doesn’t dance w other guys while she is in relationship. She also got very drunk and gave her number to the Uber driver on the way back to the hotel (because he was sad, and she wanted to help, but still kind of an odd/poorly judged gesture imo, as he could have been anyone.) When I brought this up to her, she said she didn’t remember doing that (again, she said she doesn’t get drunk to that point when she goes out). She gave me reasons for each of the things that contradicted what we had previously discussed, and why they should have been an exception. But, in the end, I didn’t know what to think. Her words were not lining up to her actions, and I didn’t think the things she was doing were necessarily respectful to our relationship or the things we discussed and had agreed on. She wanted to break up because she felt I should trust her word (even though she would contradict herself in word and in action), because we talk about things too much (what we agree on, boundaries, concerns, etc. etc.) and stated that the things we talked about were unreasonable/ridiculous and believed we shouldn’t have to talk about those things to the extend that we did, and that I would need to go through more therapy to see her point of view on things. She had a tendency, at times, of telling me the reason I was concerned with x,y,z was because of my past trauma, which felt very invalidating. Nonetheless, I’m still so in love w her… I wanted to be with her forever and if this truly was all on me, or if I was acting unhealthily, unreasonable, or inappropriately distrustful towards her word or those situations then I want to change and try to give things another shot.

This is a long story with some trigger warnings:   


TW:Drugs, lying, suicide.

So we met working together at Kmart in I wanna say 2017 and I thought she was super attractive exchanged info and we went and played Pokémon go and it was great. Well at the time I had a heroin addiction and I mentioned this to her and low and behold she used to not quite as bad as I was more for recreation if there is such a thing with that kind of drug but still...   


So fast forward a year or so and we've had a great time just using and messing around it never really got more serious than that for me at least and I told her I wanted to make sure the next time I say I loved someone it was the last because I use to throw that word around allot and it didn't mean much back then. Well here's where things start to get screwy I guess you could say I was picking up for us one day and I had my pc left open well she went through my Facebook messages and saw I was talking to someone else and here's the kicker I don't even remember who it was or what was even said as I was high as hell. Well when I got back I could tell something changed and I eventually found out she went through it we fought I lied and said I was just testing her and they were fake messages (ya heroin is a helluva drug who would believe this?)   


So after about a year or so when that happened some stuff happened with her mom and she got kicked out and I told her shed always have a place with me and I meant it so she moved in....for all of 5 or so days. Now let me say I'm clean now and I know how stupid and fucked up this stuff sounds but you need to realize its behind a 10 year opiate addicted brain so with that preface let me explain. Obviously when she got kicked out she was super emotional even when using and I was well not at all I had the emotional maturity of a potato and not a good Idaho potato but like a rotten one grown in sludge. So when she would cry or want to be held or whatever I just sat there and was like what's wrong why are you crying again etc. etc. all I wanted to do was play video games. So after the 5ish days I was like can you just go some where else for a few days I fully wasn't expecting her to leave permanently. Well she did... and for over a year we really didn't have much contact, I know she wound up dating a guy she lived with and that didn't work out and I guess he treated her like shit and gave her some self esteem issues I believe which is bull shit because she's literally fucking perfect but that's neither here nor there.  


So here we are about 4 years after meeting and about a year ago I decided to get clean and get my life going at the time using my life goal was suicide I had no drive no motivation no nothing I was literally just living waiting until my mom died to take a hot shot and dip out... Well life had another plan for me and after about 6 months of not using that heroin cloud went away and I realized I don't want to die I want the wife the kids the white picket fence and everything that comes with it. So we start talking again and hanging out not always about sex but that does happen some times and I'm realizing that I really love this woman no matter our status relationship wise we've kind of always been there for each other she's the only one I've never been bored with in the bed room also and the sex is stupid as in like she's made me not be able to speak before and not even joking its dumb as hell. But its not just that I start realizing all the stuff I took for granted and that quote ""You don't know what you have until its gone"" applies to me so hard here its not even funny.   


So I've written her about my feelings about what I want and how I want it with her oh and I forgot to say yes we eventually said we loved each other mine came quite a bit later but how I said before I wanted it to matter I did end up saying that I love her so just had to remember to put that. Well I've sent her a bunch of FB messages usually after we hang out and I get to enjoy everything about her and they are stuff that I've just never said to anyone else or even thought about anyone else. I never wanted kids or marriage and I'm like I will adopt your daughter (who also has special needs). That she can have access to everything of mine electronically until she feels secure enough in us if she needed to I mean I've written her a blank check on anything that she needs for me to do to bring us back closer and back together. Well I asked her straight up if anything was still there for her and she said it wasn't any more and I asked her when that happened and she said ""honestly it was back when I found those messages"". That was years ago and let me be clear here I NEVER even now have even kissed anyone else and I don't even want to I've gone on a few dates recently and had to make some excuse to not sleep with this chick because I don't want her to know that happened and that I was with someone else if there's even .0001% chance of us getting back together that's not my style also since we still kind of fool around rarely I wouldn't want the chance of catching something and giving it to her.  


So I've written her these messages and shell send me back stuff like ""I love reading these"" and recently I mentioned ""you're probably bored reading these"" and she said not at all. So I know this is very jumbled but I tried to get the main points in this is really my first post outside of gaming on reddit but I have no one else to get advice from after cutting all my ""friends"" off who still use etc..(not that they would give good advice any way). But is there salvaging this ? What else can I do I think not sleeping with anyone else for 5 years and only talking to someone else especially while high and losing the love of my life over that is kind of harsh I've been cheated on before and forgave my exs but obviously she's not them she's her own person and can decide what she wants. I just feel we never gave it a real shot it was drugs and hook up that was it, I wanna show her off to the world I want to give her everything I can and make her know she's the only woman in the world for me I want to help her with her career and take care of her and her daughter and hopefully have some kids together but like I'm getting older   and drugs stole enough of my life and I've told her ill do whatever it takes and that's not exaggeration. I never even knew what real love was until her and the thought of not having her as my partner is super sad. Oh and one last thing and the reason I even decided to post here is that after she told me she had nothing in the tank left for me out of no where about 2 days later this chick I've known since about the 3rd grade popped back into my life, we've hung out quite a bit for the last 3 weeks but nothing has happened sexually, I actually think she was more using me as a emotional crutch for some other guy she is into but thats another story. But the reason im bringing this up is when we were talking about relationships I had talked to her about my love and she noticed every time I mentioned something my demeanor changed enough that she knew I still love her. So if nothing helps from this and it really is over, how the hell do I move on when I can't get her out of my head even when someone else is right in front of me?

So I posted some and she isn’t in them but after I posted she unfollowed me on Instagram and I don’t necessarily care that she did, but I don’t want to have been an asshole for posting those pics or have her think I did it to get back at her.

This is a long one. sorry. We have been dating for 2 years. He has a female friend that I always had a weird feeling about after witnessing some slightly offputting interactions and convos between them but he never blatantly cheated on me with her. 

We have talked about these things before and he always reassured me that there was nothing strange happening and they never were more than friends nor did he ever feel anything for her and vice versa. He told me she has had a long term bf for a while and all the years they were friends before we dated they would call and text via phone or discord almost daily but only really as distant friends and to game late into the night or watch anime, nothing weird would ever happen before we dated or after we started dating, that he hardly considered her a friend. I believed him.

Then one night I was looking for a meme that I knew he sent her so I just went thru the little gallery on imessage where it shows all the attachments you and someone have shared thru text, not thinking much of it, (he was ok with this.) and i saw a picture of her in a dress. 

 I asked why she sent that to him and he casually told me she was just asking for help on what to wear. usually id just drop it and move on but this time I asked to see. He immediately snatched his phone out of my hand which alarmed me and I tried grabbing it back just instinctively bc he snatched it, then he wrestled for it saying to not do it, that I shouldnt, basically pleading. I let go and began asking why he was suddenly so against me being on his phone. he said “because. I lied. it wasnt just her asking me about what she should wear. it was something else and I didnt want you to read it because I know it would upset you.“  

We just generally werent protective of our phones around eachother and would often play games on one anothers phone or just scroll thru yt or insta explore page etc on eachothers accounts just because or i’d do things like airdrop funny cat memes or cute photos he found to myself etc. so this was kinda weird. I have nothing to hide and he always said he didn’t either. But this wasnt the first time he lied to me about/ omitted something that seemed small but ended up being big. I then decided to go through his phone right in front of him in that moment. I dont go through phones in that way usually so im not proud of this. If he wanted it back at any point after I started looking I wouldve obliged.

I found some convos between them that happened around the time him and I first started dating where he was constantly calling her step mom, “🥺🥺mommy”, asking her to be his step mom, saying he needs a goodnight kiss and he needs his stepmommy, indirect jokes about her jking him off, and more convos from the past where he is making jokes about her helping him grab something from under a bench, asking her to punish him and teach him a lesson and requesting she be bossy to him more often etc. and she kinda was just soaking it up. 

I was reading it aloud to him and he was just like yeah. yep. that happened. I asked him what that all was. He revealed that it was a long running joke from before we dated and it all started from his friend group making jokes about the Hub and it was really nothing serious and that he was like that with all his friends so he didnt see it as anything wrong. 

I asked if he was as insistent and frequent and as detailed with the jokes with his other friends as with her. Shes the only girl in that friend group. eventually he admitted that he didnt rly say stuff like that to his other friends as much and that he would initiate stuff like that with her but it didnt mean any thing and he never saw her as attractive, he even said he caught the ick when he found out what she looked like. 

We had a long fight about it and in the end I learned it was going on for the first couple months he and I dated thru text and call but he said he realized it was wrong at some point and stopped talking to her like that and didnt speak to her as frequently. I asked why he didnt bring that up sooner because I would have liked to know, why would he lie to me?  he said he just forgot and doesnt even remember the exact point he switched up his behavior around her anyway. 

I found a lot of other convos between them that bothered me but I am even less sure if i am biased about it so I dont know if its worth mentioning. I feel icky and weirded out but I have no idea what I should do. I do believe he stopped and he has apologized and is willing to cut her out and try to rebuild trust. I dont know what to do. 

TLDR; found out bf would engage in weird stepmommy, suggestive, seemingly sexual convos with female friend here and there while we dated. he says he stopped and that it never meant anything. I love him a lot but this has me shaken more than usual so I am not sure, I need outside opinions, what do I do?

Tuesday she reaches out to tell him she's thinking of him. They start talking. Now hes hiding his phone from me, changed his laptop password, always putting his phone face down, waiting until I look away to get on his phone, or switching apps so I don't see. I'm pretty sure he was on the phone with her when i walked into the kitchen last night cause his phone had the little green bubble to say its being used for a call and then he flipped his phone upside down. I told him I was not comfortable with this friendship bc they have had history. He tells me he cut her off last night, not blocked but just told her they couldn't talk anymore. Ok, so why is his snap score going up when he only uses snap to talk to me and his sister? it just doesn't make sense. He said he was being secretive because he was looking at engagement rings.... but he told me last November he had put a down payment on one. So it's like i just keep catching him in lies and now hes having a breakdown at work. He said : ""I cant lose you and our daughter (we started dating when i was pregnant)  my parents will kill me. I'll lose the access to my medication that I need"" 

so.... you're not concerned really about losing us, its more the benefits that being with me brings. 

Clearly this is sketchy behavior right. like OBVIOUSLY something is going on. I'm not the type to go through phones but he goes through mine all the time. I feel like I'm being crazy. But I also feel like there is no other explanation. What do I do? Thinking about spending some time at my grandmas house to get away but I feel like that could make things worse. I'm going crazy. How should i go about this moving forward? Do I just take his word for it?? Do I demand to look through his phone? Do I just leave? I am at a loss.

A bit of context.  
Me(M37) and my partner(F35 which I will call Lise) have 2 child(an 7 yers old boy and an 4 years old girl).  
We started dating in our early 20s, always with a great compatibility, having fun toghether.  
Lisa has a Nutrition degree. A good professional, but very low income(\~50k/y)  
I work IT with a very good salary(\~250k/y)  
She worked until the last month of pregnancy for our first baby and got back to work 6 month later.  
But after a few months, we both agreed that paying for child care was expensive being almost her salary and would be better if she stays home with him.  
And even after our second kid was already four and going to child care for a whole year, Lisa is not at all thinking about working. She became a housewife.  
We both were always ""modern"", I never wanted to lock my wife home and pressure her to only take care of our children,  by the contrary I always give her support to follow something she would appreciate doing. I think is important for all of us to have a life.

She was the same, looking to grow a career and climbing up the ladder  
But it seems that after those almost 8 years gap she kinda settled down to be a home mother. taking care of the house chores all by herself(and kind not letting me do stuff, which I like cleaning, cooking and so on).  
She seems to be happy, but sometimes I few he envy(in a positive way) a few of her college friends who have a life outside their house even the ones having children too.  
On the other hand, she always felt that the work was not a good use of her time, given the low salary.  
Money never was or is a problem. My earnings are more than enough have a very confortable life for all of us, but kinda sucks for me to be a provider. There will be instances she will ask for stuff to buy.   
Nothing fancy or expensive, but I feel like a father for her, given her money. Just to get it straight, I kinda have hoped she would get back to work, to be contributing parters. I would not mind paying ALL the bills and her using all his money just to buy and expend with her personal stuff. Is not about money itself.  
My heart is split. Because all in all we have a amazing time togheter, she is gorgeus looking and take care of herself since we are togheter and is a great mother. 

But I fear that I see her as a person, an independent person it fading away,  because of her choice(apparently) of being a housewife. Even that is a mental battle for me, Am I over stepping her choices? just because I may being prejudice on housewife.  
And if that happens I may lose a very very good partner.  
What can I do next?

We have been dating for 2 years. He has a female friend that I always had a weird feeling about after witnessing some slightly offputting interactions and convos between them but he never blatantly cheated on me with her. 

We have talked about these things before and he always reassured me that there was nothing strange happening and they never were more than friends nor did he ever feel anything for her and vice versa. He told me she has had a long term bf for a while and all the years they were friends before we dated they would call and text via phone or discord almost daily but only really as distant friends and to game late into the night or watch anime, nothing weird would ever happen before we dated or after we started dating, that he hardly considered her a friend. I believed him.

Then one night I was looking for a meme that I knew he sent her so I just went thru the little gallery on imessage where it shows all the attachments you and someone have shared thru text, not thinking much of it, (he was ok with this.) and i saw a picture of her in a dress. 

 I asked why she sent that to him and he casually told me she was just asking for help on what to wear. usually id just drop it and move on but this time I asked to see. He immediately snatched his phone out of my hand which alarmed me and I tried grabbing it back just instinctively bc he snatched it, then he wrestled for it saying to not do it, that I shouldnt, basically pleading. I let go and began asking why he was suddenly so against me being on his phone. he said “because. I lied. it wasnt just her asking me about what she should wear. it was something else and I didnt want you to read it because I know it would upset you.“  

We just generally werent protective of our phones around eachother and would often play games on one anothers phone or just scroll thru yt or insta explore page etc on eachothers accounts just because or i’d do things like airdrop funny cat memes or cute photos he found to myself etc. so this was kinda weird. I have nothing to hide and he always said he didn’t either. But this wasnt the first time he lied to me about/ omitted something that seemed small but ended up being big. I then decided to go through his phone right in front of him in that moment. I dont go through phones in that way usually so im not proud of this. If he wanted it back at any point after I started looking I wouldve obliged.

I found some convos between them that happened around the time him and I first started dating where he was constantly calling her step mom, “🥺🥺mommy”, asking her to be his step mom, saying he needs a goodnight kiss and he needs his stepmommy, indirect jokes about her jking him off, and more convos from the past where he is making jokes about her helping him grab something from under a bench, asking her to punish him and teach him a lesson and requesting she be bossy to him more often etc. and she kinda was just soaking it up. 

I was reading it aloud to him and he was just like yeah. yep. that happened. I asked him what that all was. He revealed that it was a long running joke from before we dated and it all started from his friend group making jokes about the Hub and it was really nothing serious and that he was like that with all his friends so he didnt see it as anything wrong. 

I asked if he was as insistent and frequent and as detailed with the jokes with his other friends as with her. Shes the only girl in that friend group. eventually he admitted that he didnt rly say stuff like that to his other friends as much and that he would initiate stuff like that with her but it didnt mean any thing and he never saw her as attractive, he even said he caught the ick when he found out what she looked like. 

We had a long fight about it and in the end I learned it was going on for the first couple months he and I dated thru text and call but he said he realized it was wrong at some point and stopped talking to her like that and didnt speak to her as frequently. I asked why he didnt bring that up sooner because I would have liked to know, why would he lie to me?  he said he just forgot and doesnt even remember the exact point he switched up his behavior around her anyway. 

I found a lot of other convos between them that bothered me but I am even less sure if i am biased about it so I dont know if its worth mentioning. I feel icky and weirded out but I have no idea what I should do. I do believe he stopped and he has apologized and is willing to cut her out and try to rebuild trust. I dont know what to do. 

TLDR; found out bf would engage in weird stepmommy, suggestive, seemingly sexual convos with female friend here and there while we dated. he says he stopped and that it never meant anything.

My husband is a deep sleeper, he could honestly sleep through a tornado. Meanwhile, I could wake up from our eldest shuffling around in her bed 2 floors down. So, very light. 

Husband is back to the 9 to 5 job, he worked over the summer and fall helping on his family farm. He gets overtime plowing for the city in bad weather, usually overnights.

We have 3 kids, I'm a SAHM. 10, 2, and 5 months. The 5 month old still sleeps in our room and wakes up 1-2 times a night. The 2 year old is transitioning to a toddler bed and is waking up several times a night as well. 

Husband has 5 alarms set that he sleeps through. He always wakes up at 715, but they start at 645. They are the loud beeping kind. We've tried lights, the vibrating ones. The only thing that seems to wake him up is me kicking, shoving, or whisper yelling at him. He'll turn it off and go right back to bed until 715. I'm so tired of it. He won't get rid of the alarms, apparently he ""feels like he gets to sleep in"" if he gets to snooze, and it ""gradually wakes him up instead of having to get up instantly."" But they don't wake him up, they wake me and the baby! We've slept separately before, but he always wants back in bed, because it ""isn't fair that you get a king bed all to yourself"".

He is also putting up a stink about helping with the kids at night lately. He says he doesn't remember in the morning, but he can say some rude stuff in his sleep.  His sleep is important, he's too tired, I'm already up kind of things. Last night I was up with the kids off and on all night and when the baby woke up at 630 for a bottle, I asked him to help feed him. He whined that he's so tired and he barely ever gets any sleep and why should he have to get up early (he fell asleep at midnight after plowing). I'm just annoyed. I get way less sleep than him, I'm with the kids 24/7, I take care of them and the house, I bring the kids to and from school and speech therapy, I'm tired too! Just because I don't bring in money doesn't mean what I do isn't work.

It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he d say sorry and start with the love words.

He charms almost anyone and I look like the bad person, although I think I did nothing wrong. He was saying he was always used by women and blamed me for withdrawing my love. I was just scared and wanted him to make things right. I told him twice I did love him , but wouldnt mention it often.

I cried that night and in the morning he hadnt bothered to send any text of apology , so blocked him but then after 2 months unblocked to phone him and say I miss him. He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late.

I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye.

I have deep rooted self worth problems and I know that, but I have no idea how to fix it or what to do. That’s not the point. The thing is I can’t help but always feel that I’m not good enough for my bf. For your information, I’m an introvert, I can barely hold on a conversation with any stranger even if I tried. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is super extrovert and doesn’t mind being the center of attention, he’s always been good with words. Because of his extroversion, I always feel like somehow other girls would be attracted to him due to him just being a funny, nice and good looking guy. I know he’s super loyal and thinks that I’m his world, but I just can’t help but feel like I’ll never been good enough for him and he’ll be better off with someone else. It’s not like it’s be hard for him to find another since he’s just so likeable. Since he’s so good with talking to people, I often feel like he’s happier with others than me, since I am not the happiest person due to my mental health. I just feel that he might not feel the happiest with me even though he tells me he is and it is worth it to stay with me through the thick and thin even when I fall into the deep end. He doesn’t have much female friends, when he makes one he always tells me, but every single time I feel like they’re just trying to get with him.

My girlfriend (me F42 her F36, 2 1/2 yr monogamous relationship) has a new guy friend (M - late 20’s??).  She’s recently spent 5 months in North America and a month in Europe. The month she was in Europe - August this year, she slept with someone two days before we were due to meet up again (after 6 months) awful... I was on holiday, taking my Dad to her country to meet her Mum and generally have a holiday. I struggled with that. A week later we were on the plane home, a couple of her actions made me question her and then she came out with “I’ve got something to tell you”…. Several plane rides around the world is difficult when you’re trying to process your girlfriend slept with her ex girlfriend….so she’d slept with two women in a week…

Now the cherry on the cake is that I don’t get to eat cherries. My girlfriend has sex with me, but I don’t get to have sex with her - she touches me, but doesn’t want to be touched. It’s been this way since about 4 months into our relationship. This is hard for me.

We had a rocky few days when we returned from Europe, I considered breaking up, got insecure, and then decided to see how it went with the view of seeing a sex therapist (these issues are mixed up a bit…) and then things have been really nice and I’ve been ok and generally getting over it.

Before she had sex with these two people, I’d convinced myself that it was her that had a problem with intimacy and being touched. But that was incorrect, she clearly wanted to have sex, just not with me.

I like to describe her as a supermodel in disguise. She’s ridiculously hot and comes from a European place of intrigue. She’s described never being able to have guy friends cos they always fall in love with her.

But… now guy friend is on the scene. And he’s moved into our little community, he’s living here. (We are a group of 15 living on a bunch of land) He’s a dj like her, has been inviting her to things, weekend camping, working on his project together, invite to mix together, watch a documentary together. She’s into all of it. And….. whilst in Europe, he also made the effort to go see her and spend a few days together. And he hadn’t known her long in our own country.

She’s been talking about how she really likes new guy friend, and she’s happy she has a new friend and a new group of people. She’s not lived in our country so long (3 years) and has struggled in the past to find her people.

I woke up at 5am today. I’m struggling. I think it’s normal in this situation. I feel a bit trapped. I feel alarmed and insecure about the presence of new guy friend. And perhaps I don’t trust her? I normally manage to put the sex thing to one side - we have such a lovely relationship. It saddens me and frustrates me at times but nothings perfect… but also I won’t accept sexless forever. (And she touches me, I can’t touch her). I don’t want to start making a problem and causing her any problems in wanting to spend time with her new friend. I don’t want to assume but also have a bit of a feeling he is motivated by attraction to her. And she is a lesbian that has very occasionally slept with men. Anyways…. The extra cherry is….. 6 months before I met my current girlfriend, I’d had a rough ride where the woman I was living with had gotten involved with someone else in our community, I actually moved out for three months cos I couldn’t cope with it.

My (F26) best friend (M30) has a whole group of childhood best friends who are the most wholesome and wonderful people I've ever met. I went through a rough romantic breakup at the beginning of the year, and M30 and I reconnected. (We've been friends for about 5 years, worked together, and lived together as roommates for a year - then grew apart unintentionally once the pandemic hit and we moved out of our apartment). We became very close very quickly and I was integrated in the friend group.

I'm an abandonment trauma girly and I live with a lot of irrational fears that previously prevented me from doing a lot. So this summer I became a Yes Man- anytime I was invited anywhere, to do anything - I said yes. I hadn't floated the river or really had any ""fun in the sun"" my entire adult life because of insecurities, and I overcame so much in the past 6 months. I thought I was being a good friend by always agreeing to activities and being available and never flaking. I fit into the group well and was invited to almost everything. 

During this period of time, I was still in the process of grieving my relationship. I got on an SSRI and I feel mostly healed now, a lot in part to my new(ish) and awesome group of friends. While M30 was trying to integrate me into the friend group (so I was everyone's friend and not just his) - he suggested I spend one on one time with others - without him around as a friend buffer. One of my biggest fears/insecurities is inviting people to do things \*I\* want to do. I am happy to spend time with others, doing their activities - and me and M30 have quite different interests and hobbies. Eventually I worked up the courage to invite one friend group person to get mani/pedis, and another to a concert. 

Fast forward to recent days, M30 is making comments like ""wow, wish I was invited to a concert"" (we have drastically different taste in music, and he playfully mocks my music taste all the time). I explained to him my fear of inviting him to something and being rejected, or him agreeing to come - then having a bad or boring time. The issue evolved into something bigger, of me never inviting him to do anything. Keep in mind, me and M30 spend anywhere from 4-7 week days together, doing things solo or with the friend group, or playing games online - and then I end up taking my social recovery days as an introvert and don't plan anything. 

We were supposed to take a 3 hour road trip this weekend to meet some of his other friends - which feel through supposedly. I was so excited to meet these people, and spend time with him. So I thought, now's my chance! Our plans, that he planned, fell through - it's my turn to save the weekend. So I said, the weather is decent on Saturday, would you still like to do a mini road trip and find a cool hike or a hot spring? His response - ""I'm good.""

I asked if he was mad at me, he said ""no, but I feel different now. I shouldn't have had to ask you to invite me to do things"". I explained my fear again, and how it's my biggest character flaw and I'm working on it... but he hasn't responded. He doesn't need me, ya know, he has a whole group of incredible friends - and is definitely of the ""I don't have to put up with what I don't deserve"" mindset. I just feel like I messed up so terribly without even realizing until it was too late.

He then asked me if I expected the man to pay. I ignored this question because I found it stupid--if he was going to ask me out, then I am his guest and he needs to pay. So I moved on.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance. He complained about the menu prices the entire time and made me really uncomfortable. I guess he noticed this because as soon as he saw me looking uncomfortable he rubbed my leg and suggested he really wanted to pay. The total for both of us was 55.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out.

He then texted me a week later saying he was sorry and wishes we could have kissed and wats to meet again. Why do this to me?

Also, sorry for the long post but I want to paint the full picture. Tl;dr at the end of the post.

Some context first: my boyfriend \[35M\] and I \[32F\] have been together for three years, living together for two. We both work as chefs, I work as a personal chef for a well off family, and he works as a sous chef in a restaurant. We earn more or less the same amout of money and therefore we contribue 50/50 to household expenses, such as rent, bills, groceries etc. We don't fully share finances as he has way more expenses than I do, (for example my car is paid off but his is on finance, he pays two phone bills, etc.) but anything that's a joint expense is shared equally. 

For the best part of two years, we've had no issues. We both would pull our weight around the house and we would both contribute equally to the chores, so for example if one of us cooked dinner the other would do the dishes, if one of us dealt with the laundry, the other would vacuum, etc. 

It all changed in the summer. I used to work as a head chef in a small restaurant, but the pressure of the job was getting to me. I couldn't handle it anymore, I would end up working every single weekend, work 60/65 hours a week, often finishing past midnight, I would have to go in on my days off, we were very understaffed which made dinner rushes much, much harder than they needed to be. Pay was good, but not good enough, so I quit restaurants altogether and went private. I have to admit, I lucked out. The family I work for has another chef who prepares their dinners, and a whole different team for weekends, so I only work Mondays to Fridays, I start at 7:30AM and finish at around 5:30/6PM. It's still a lot of hours but there's no more pressure, no more dinner rushes, no more complaints and angry customers, no more team to deal with. I cook their meals, I go to the farmers market for them, I clean the kitchen, I come up with the meal plans for the week, I bake whatever the kids ask me to bake. While it's nowhere near as demanding as the restaurant used to be, it's still not an easy job. I'm on my feet all day, I spend most of my time doing prep or cooking, and while I'm only cooking for a family of seven and not a restaurant with over 100 covers, I have no team to help. 

Ever since I got this job, my boyfriend started slacking on chores. Within a month, I was the one doing everything around the house. I cook, clean, do laundry, fold said laundry, take care of the groceries, the whole lot. If I don't do it, it doesn't get done. If toothpaste runs out, and I don't buy a new tube of it, he won't. Laundry can pile up until the basket is overflowing and dishes will stay in the sink until I eventually deal with them. I'm constantly picking up after him, picking up glasses, mugs and dishes he leaves around the house, if he has a meal and I'm not home, I'll find the dishes in the sink when I come back. Groceries are also my responsibility. If I ask him what he wants, I don't get an answer. I have to decide what we're eating for the week, what to buy, what we're eating when, even what snacks and drinks to get. It's exhausting. I confronted him about this a few times, and his response every signle time is that his job is so demanding and that he's so exhausted from it, and I always have my evenings off. I'm not debating whether he's tired or not, I'm sure he is, but so am I. Sometimes he acts as if I don't even work, like my job is easy compared to his.

We work the same amount of hours. For three days a week, he only works daytimes as well. He starts at 9 AM and finishes at 6, then he has two full days which are normally 12 hours ones, and he usually has either Saturday or Sunday off. I'm expected to take care of the house and use my time off and days off doing chores and such when he spends his days off sleeping until late in the day and not really doing anything. I would be okay with this if he started contributing more financially, but I find it unfair that money's shared 50/50 and chores are 100/0. 

I have been giving this some thought lately and I'm nearing breaking point. I feel like all I do in my time off is laundry, it seems like there's always something in the sink that needs to be washed, and I'm so, so tired of being the one who cooks dinner every night. I come home from work at around 6, shower, and then right away there's either something to clean or I have to start making dinner. After dinner, I either clean up right away or it'll be waiting for me tomorrow. I was never a slob, I've always kept my house tidy even when I was living with flatmates, but I've never had it take over my life this much. I'm doing chores for two, cleaning up after two people, doing laundry for two people, and I can't take it anymore. 

How can I make this work? How can I get through to him and get him to understand that he should contribute and that I'm not his maid? I need help finding a balance before this gets to me. I'm growing resentful and it's making me dislike him. I'm seriously considering breaking up with him over this, so I'm willing to try anything to make it work before it comes to that.
