He is a very intelligent man, very caring, and deeply loving- we share a deep friendship, which is what makes the love so special. I find him immensely attractive inside and out- he is kind, compassionate, introverted but confident, polite, patient and generally respectful. However, I have noticed on various occasions that he does not like holding my purse. At first I thought I was imagining it, but once when I handed him my purse because I was carrying two large bags of shopping, we had a huge fight.He said he would rather carry other stuff than carry a woman's purse, and asked me never to do that to him again. I don't understand. I proudly identify as a feminist, so I'm kind of annoyed that this bothers him. Even if I ask why, he gets irritated and says he just does not like it. 
I am kind of serious about him and am thinking of a life together but although it's been ages since this incident, I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know if it's gonna be one of those things where I'm like "" I should have known then that he was a pig"" or it's something I can just let slide and not overthink.

When we used to be just friends, we used to talk about a  lot of things including relationships, and we used to have same opinion on these things, which might differ from the popular opinions. We used to make fun of couples that spend every hour of the day talking to each other, used to do everything together, and had no personal lives. Their personal lives were mingled together. Even as best friends we used to talk through memes, and once every 10-15 days, we used to have a phone call or VC. We limited this, because we actually wanted to have something to talk about otherwise, and talking every other day limited this. Whenever we used to talk about something, we had detailed discussions. It was one of the best things I ever had, I had no emotional dependency on her, and the lack of communication, or how much time she's taking to reply to me never bothered me.

Now fast forward to time when we started dating, in the initial days, things were going great, we used to talk like a normal couple, ""how was your day? Did you finally solve that issue at work? How's your search for apartment is going?"", normal text based conversations. Now I don't know what going on with me or both of us? As I have nothing to talk about regarding anything on regular basis, I know everything I need to know about her life but still I just make feeble attempts to talk to my gf through memes, so that in turn she can talk with me, I want her to have those boring and repeated conversations with me as it make me feel happy and loved, I want her to ask me about my day, my life, or anything of that sort, I feel she doesn't initiate these normal conversations from her end, its always me, who's making attempts to initiate conversation, but she will randomly call me up from her end, out of the blue every 10-15 days, in the middle of night or day and we'll have a brilliant conversation.

Now all this stuff, maybe since it's my first relationship, or whatever, it bothers me, which I know it shouldn't because I know everything that's going on with her, and vice-versa. And because of this I get irritated, and agitated. So one day, I asked her if she's okay or there's something wrong with us, ""She told me she's fed up with work, she's overworked, as she has recently switched to a start-up, there's issue with her roommate, and every week she forced to go to her parents place, in order to escape spending time with her roommate, and she also has PCOS, and on top of that, she's desperately trying to move to a different space, so the last thing she wants to do at the end of day is to look at her phone or any text, as throughout day she keeps getting those goddamn notifications from slack. So she's isn't able to behave like she used to as she can't have an hour or two for herself.""

I realise she's busy and for that I emphasise with her, I know for a fact if I was in her situation, I would have vented out at someone already. But as a human I have emotional needs, and all of this is bothering me. And the last thing I want to do is -- fight with her, and tell this to her face  ""I need to hear your voice, every third day because it make feel happy"". 

I feel this information is important -- contrary to her I have a chill job ( though I'm paid third of her salary) and have time for personal self, and some of that time, I want to spend with her on some days.

TLDR : GF is over-worked, and going through all sorts of problems, because of which she is emotionally unavailable, and which is irritating me.

During summer he started to spread rumors that my ex approached that group of friends (he was in it) just to fuck him. 

I'm sorry, I'm not speaking from pain or jealousy anymore. Yes, I used to, but now I'm confused about her feelings towards him. He's the typical bully that causes trouble and steps on everyone he doesn't respect. And I'm one of those guys. 

He tried to fight me after a party. I was talking with my (then ex) gf and I got upset and told her to please fuck off in a rude manner. Then he came and stepped up to the conversation and I told her to forget me and get with him while I pushed her off. (Yes, I was an imbecile but I was furious and drunk, I didn't hurt her and didnt do it to get her to fall, I just wanted to get her off my face, it was a gently push). 

Later he started screaming to me telling that he's going to punch me and he brought a friend with him to fight me. 2 vs 1. My gf saw everything and did nothing to stop it. I was all by myself in a corner. 

Today we were talking about life and he came into the conversation and she said that he's a good person, that he is Immature but he has a good heart. I repeat. 2vs1 and trying to humiliate me in front of 100 people at the party. 

I don't really know how to feel about it. I know they had sex and a connection but cmon... You can't say that kind of person is good hearted.

I'm sorry if this is all over the place or poorly worded but my head is a little all over the place. The title sounds bad (and it is) but I don't know what to think.

 Me and my husband have been together for 5 years (dating 3 and married 2). We normally agree on most things and disagree with others but this has caused me to view him differently. He has absolutely nothing against people with genetic problems or down syndrome but he wouldn't want our kid to, in his own words, suffer. He thinks the world is a harsh place to people with disabilities (and it is, I'm not denying that) but I told him people with down syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc can go on to live wonderful happy lives and denying a child the chance because the world is cruel or people are mean is really horrible in my opinion.

I've suggested him videos of people with down syndrome etc talking about their lives and experiences and show him that they can still have great lives but he won't.  I told him that even if people are born 100% perfectly healthy they can still go on to suffer in life based on many different things but he just thinks that because they are born different they will definitely suffer and it's not fair on them. He has never spoken to someone with down syndrome or personally knows anyone with it so I don't even know where this came from. I understand people and kids can be cruel to people who are different and I'm not saying life will be perfectly easy for them, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve a chance just like everyone else. It comes off as a bit eugenics-ey and overall leaving a bad taste in my mouth. I really love my husband and he's never said anything like this before and now I'm really thinking - is this a big red flag? i just don't know what to think.

I have had a crush on this one girl for a while, so when I asked her to be my homecoming date and she said yes, it was one of the best moments of my life.

Eventually, she would start leaving me on delivered for more than a day but I would still snap back within a couple of hours. But, one day, she had left me on delivered for two and a half days straight, no communication, nothing. This had been happening for almost two weeks now so I decided to do the same and leave her on delivered for two days as well. She didn‚Äôt take it well and proceeded to remove me off all her stories and then leave me on delivered for a week, not even talking to me in public. I still haven‚Äôt heard anything from her. One of my friends told me that it‚Äôs what they do, and I should‚Äôve snapped her back immediately because it‚Äôs some sort of girl test. If it was, I can see how it was my fault, but I still don‚Äôt understand yet. I think maybe she wanted me to make a move first?

My closest friend (20M) and I (19M) have a thing where we'll sometimes just go for a few rounds of ""ask me anything"". Last night, I started running out of good questions and asked the question ""who are you most jealous of?"". He thought about it for a bit and then said my girlfriend (18F), in the way that I spend more time with her than him. His exact words were: ""like occasionally we'll go two weeks or so without hanging out, but seems like you guys still make plans semi-often, if that makes sense?"".

Some context:

* We've been friends since around the beginning of the year, but we just kinda hit it off, and I consider him my closest friend right now. He is aro/ace and has told me he struggles with the idea of ""not being anyone's favorite person"" since he doesn't date and feels that everyone around him will eventually just move on to romantic relationships. I never know of a good way to respond to that because I feel that is a valid concern in his situation.
* I have felt like he is a tad clingy, to the point that I was worried when we first met that he might have been hitting on me (didn't want to lead him on). Homie frankly texts/calls me more than my girlfriend does, maybe even close to double. He consistently tells me to tell him to fuck off if he is bugging me, but I've never had the heart to do that.
   * To add to that, I am the type of person who is perfectly ok with not hanging out with friends often. I could go for months without seeing someone and then easily just go back to exactly how we were before. He definitely is not.
* I started dating my girlfriend about 2 months ago, so still very early on, and this is my first serious relationship. We knew each other for about a year prior and just started dating at the start of our second year of college here. Very honeymoon phase right now, full head over heels, but also she is the first person that I've met who is genuinely similar to me. Anyway, that isn't quite as important to this post.
* I am an engineering student. Also a design lead for our university's Formula SAE car. What that means is I am *very* busy - like 8 to 8 a lot of the time. Essentially, I consistently have to choose who I spend my limited free time with.

I like to think that I'm doing a fairly decent job of balancing keeping up friendships and my relationship with my girlfriend, but apparently not. There's also the struggle that he's not a STEM major, so his courseload is far lighter than mine, so he has a ton of free time, while for me it feels like every minute counts. I make an effort to hang out with friends and not just get sucked into the temptation to spend every moment I can with my girlfriend, which I will admit is strong right now.

And that makes that first point of context very difficult for me to address because even though I love the homie like a brother, I couldn't choose him over my girlfriend. I just physically couldn't. It frankly breaks my heart just thinking about it. 

He did mention how he should probably bring up those concerns with his therapist and I've encouraged that. To be honest, I'm not sure I can even do anything myself in this situation. I've communicated it as clearly and as gently as I can, but I just have limited amounts of time and I have to make choices. 

I guess this whole situation is what I need advice on: my relationship with my girlfriend is going fantastically, but I really don't want it to hurt my friendships, especially when I hear things like that from my closest friend.

I became friendly with a few people from other departments during my time there. One of these was a 37 year old single father of one (L) We weren't close by any means, in fact the opposite was true. I only interacted with him because he was in the room while i was chatting with others and it would be rude to ignore him. He made me quite uncomfortable. It started with weird comments here and there.

- He asked me if I wanted to go on a weekend away with him at one point, which I obviously refused. He played it off as a joke but then continued to ask me to join him on this weekend away each time I saw him for the next week.

-One day I got caught in a rainstorm and my clothes were soaked through. I stood at a radiator in an attempt to dry them. L asked me if I wanted to ""take them off"" to help them dry better and acted disappointed when I didn't.

-Always caught him staring at my chest even when I wasn't wearing anything revealing.

-Constantly asked me if I wanted to go for drinks after work.

I could go on. He always made me uncomfortable, I don't know what it was but I didn't feel right around him.

The day after I finished my internship I got a message from him on Instagram. He told me about how he had a massive crush on me and wanted to keep in contact and go for drinks some time. I didn't know how to reject him so I never replied (childish I know). I deleted Instagram soon after as I never used it and forgot about L and his antics.

Yesterday I logged back in to Instagram only to find multiple messages from L. Each one had a week or 2 between them, and they were all asking me to go out for drinks. I thought the months of silence would have gave him a hint that I wasn't interested.

Because I was so young compared to most people in my office, I was used to being treated as such, and it became a joke to exaggerate my youth. L used to engage in this banter too, which is possibly why I felt so uncomfortable about his feelings. Especially because I look very young for my age (I've been told I look 14).

I truly apologize for the length of this post, this is my first time attempting to deliver this concisely, please bare with me guys.
For context: 
Halloween night, I got invited to a party by a girl I was interested, but she never showed cause of drama with a friend, so I was at a function with almost all strangers .
Thankfully the host was a sweetheart and invited me to hang out anytime afterwards. We went on a date about a week ago that was honestly one of the most engaging, genuine, and open dates Ive been on in a really long time. She's transparent about her feelings, as well as her likes and dislikes, was forward, and made it clear that she wants to see me again, both verbally and via text. I havent been this sure that someone is genuinely interested in me EVER, especially with how anxiety-filled and flighty modern dating has become.
Here's my dilemma: She communicated to me that she's neroudivergent (not sure in what way, I feel rude asking) and as a neurotypical  person with no experience dating someone who isnt, idk if it has any impact on the following, or if Im correct in assuming that I'm a dummy and should cut my losses:
She's not big on responding to texts (an observation, not something she told me) in pretty much any context other than short term time sensitive stuff. 
I asked 2 days after our date if she was free today and she had a project (we both work in the same art medium), but didnt offer an alternative date or time, which is always bad sign.
Then, 2 days after that, I mentioned a cool hole in the wall spot related to something we'd talked about on our date, and she said she'd love to go there and that we should, and I said I was down, but there was no reply after. I was nervous about suggesting ANOTHER day or time after already suggesting one cause I don't wanna sound like a pushy dick with some ""are we there yet?"" type energy. So I just left it at that.
The next day, I caved to my intrusive thoughts and said next week would be a little busy cause of Black Friday (I also work in retail) but that Im free pretty much any evening after work that week, and she hearted the message, but no reply.
Since then she's liked my IG stories, and I sent her a couple memes, but thats been the extent of our interactions because in my experience, EVERYTHING is telling me she's not ACTUALLY interested, but her in-person actions and what she's said are saying the contrary. On our date she also told me she was relieved that I initiated our plans, because she's usually the one that has to, and now Im stuck between trying to plan a specific date AGAIN or taking a hint that may or may not exist and just waiting to see if she picks a day herself.

We‚Äôve visited many times and really enjoyed our visits so we figured we‚Äôd give it a longer time period. Part of the decision was fueled by the increasing cost of housing in the US and just working so hard in our jobs and feeling like we could never get ahead and always being exhausted. 

My partner presented the idea of moving abroad to me about a year ago, I was against it at first (other than my job I was very happy where we lived, strong support system, easy access to hobbies, likeminded people etc) but over time they made a good case and I agreed to doing this because not many people get this chance and I know I‚Äôd always wonder ‚Äòwhat if, or if only we did that?‚Äô.  Despite being really happy where we lived other than the increasing cost of living and our jobs. We saw it as an opportunity to maybe break out of the grind to an area that has things we both enjoy, not have to work, and pursue personal projects. 

Fast forward to today: we‚Äôve lived abroad for 3 months now. And I‚Äôm not enjoying it the way I thought I would. My anxiety came back in full force with some mild depression. I‚Äôve been open with my partner about how I‚Äôm feeling, my concerns about our finances (we aren‚Äôt working, and living the proposed budget is much more tight than we thought it would be as the area is much more expensive than expected ), the size of the town (I didn‚Äôt think this would impact me like it has, it was actually one of the allures but I‚Äôm not handling the slow and quiet well), and being far from my support system (having a hard time meeting people). My partner has generally been supportive and open to talking through things and reassuring me about our budget, pushing me to make connections in the community (which has proven to be very difficult) 

Though a few times they‚Äôve become annoyed/frustrated because they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm keeping an open mind to the possibilities here. 

The last time we spoke in depth about what our future living here holds I expressed that I wanted to move back after our deadline. They kind of threw a couple things in my face that we had talked about previously. One being that we could have delayed this decision by a couple years and then claiming I insisted we do this now. Though the way I remember it was that they were like ‚Äòwe could delay this a couple years but we may lose our window of opportunity if we don‚Äôt do this now‚Äô and I was like ‚Äòwell why don‚Äôt we do this now if this might be a small window of opportunity?

During this conversation my partner expressed that they aren‚Äôt ready to think about going back to work (they left an incredibly demanding and stressful job as did I) or make a decision about whether we stay or go back. They want us to have more time to experience being here and chat more in depth at our halfway point to make a decision (which isn‚Äôt far off). 

Please keep in mind that we‚Äôve agreed that if either one of us doesn‚Äôt like living here we‚Äôd reevaluate and move back. 


Also, thank you to anyone that has made it this far. 

My question is: when we have our conversation(s) about staying or leaving, how do I communicate in a logical way (they think very logically) that I want to move back and transition back into a life similar to what we had before? Ive learned a lot about myself with this move, better understanding my values, my limitations etc.

I (47M) have been dating a woman (34F) for just over 3 years. I love my GF, she is kind, funny, smart, and we have an amazing physical and sexual relationship. I am essentially addicted to her. Both of us have physical touch as our primary love language, and we really feed each other heavily (cuddling, random touches, massages, and of course sex). Even after 3 years the NRE hasn't diminished. 

She‚Äôs also impatient, impulsive, myopic, probably has borderline personality disorder (at least she and her therapist think so), is an alcoholic, and a divorced single mother of two disrespectful children who she parents very poorly and who have a range of their own emotional issues including physically violent outbursts and attachment disorders that are untreated.

-

When it‚Äôs just us, and she‚Äôs not drinking, and she‚Äôs not in some avoidant funk, it‚Äôs amazing. We‚Äôve had a few amazing vacations together, and we never want to leave and head back to ‚Äúreality‚Äù.

She is a very high functioning alcoholic. She finally crashed out this past winter, which ended with me taking her to a rehab/detox program (at her request). Since then while she continues to say she wants to be better, she also refuses to do the things necessary and lies about what she is doing to stay sober, or whether she has had a drink. She flat out tells me she lies about it to me and I can't trust what she says regarding her drinking. This feeds into me not trusting her about anything. Her doctor prescribed her a medication to help, and she got it filled, but never took it. She attended AA meetings for maybe a month, before she claimed they didn‚Äôt help her. Since then she has had a major relapse about every 2.5 months like clockwork. The last one ended up with her calling me completely smashed after drunkenly wandering away from her 10 year old‚Äôs birthday party hosted by her ex husband (I wasn‚Äôt invited). I had her on the phone, and knew her general area, and spent an hour looking for her before finally finding her collapsed by the side of the road (in a bad part of town) with her phone lying on the ground by her head. She then said she would go on the medication, but also said she would probably lie about taking the medication, as she does about whether she‚Äôs had a drink or not.

I‚Äôm pretty sure earlier this week she was drunk again. I could smell it on her, and she was in a very familiar negative emotional state. When she drinks she can be extremely emotional, and hates on her self. She also can be very aggressive verbally towards me, and attack me (also verbally) in ways that I have a hard time dealing with. I kind of seize up. She has several times relapsed and along with it tear into me usually over text.

There‚Äôs more there, but there‚Äôs also other things, probably all related to her drinking. She has an extremely low self esteem, likely caused by her own emotionally abusive mother and her ex husband who was violent, and extremely emotionally abusive and would regularly call her worthless.

Either way, she frequently shuts down, and goes into an avoidant mode. She will say things like she‚Äôs not worthy of anything good, that I deserve better.

A few months ago, things started really going downhill again after a good summer, when she pressed for us to get married, and move in together. I told her that I needed at least 1 year of a stable relationship, before I could do that, and it caused her to get angry, go avoidant, say that I never intend to marry her, etc.

Also I suspect she started drinking again more after that, or maybe she was already drinking.

She does weird impulsive things that make her life harder on herself. She lives in a small apartment (4th floor walkup, no elevator) and had one rather untrained, but still loveable dog. She then impulsively took her children to the animal shelter, and adopted a large puppy, that turned into a fairly large dog. She has done almost no training of the dog, he jumps up on people, breaks things (he‚Äôs broken hundreds of dollars worth of things at my house), and is generally out of control. I tried training him a bit, but how she handles the dog, and how her children handle the dog in my absence kept destroying any progress I made, and I gave up.

She‚Äôs myopic, in that she pays far more attention to what‚Äôs in front of her than the big picture. She regularly will be late to doing things with me, sometimes making the entire plans be scratched, because she is focusing on what‚Äôs in front of her. Multiple times I have been on the phone with her, and she is interrupted by her children, or even just random people on the street, and she gives them her full attention, and I sit listening to her have this conversation, before ultimately hanging up after sometimes 10-20 minutes. She‚Äôs incapable of saying to random stranger walking by on the street who engages her (when she‚Äôs obviously on the phone) that she‚Äôs on the phone and can‚Äôt talk. I can generally forgive her giving her attention to her children, but they usually don‚Äôt need help, they just want all her attention at all times and think its funny to interrupt her.

Her youngest child has needed to see a therapist (she even pleaded for one multiple times) or even a child psychiatrist, as long as I have known them, but she hasn't done anything about it. She claims its too difficult to find one, and just gives up. She claims she doesn't have time, but its just not her priority.

She only deals with life stuff when her back is against the wall. Instead of calling and dealing with a minor problem, she puts it off until it becomes an unavoidable major problem (think not paying a small bill that she can afford, but requires a phone call, until it goes to collections). This causes her various problems to constantly mount up and overwhelm her. Her life is fighting the fires that she could have dealt with earlier, but avoided.

Also, in the 3 years she has planned exactly zero dates, vacations, things to do. Its all me. Every date night, dinner, weekend away are all my suggestions and up to me to plan.

She also regularly tries to make me jealous. She mentions the men who dm or text her from her past, old boyfriends. She‚Äôll tell me the stories of what they did sexually. She‚Äôs extremely secretive and protective of her phone. She won‚Äôt even scroll through texts or photos if I‚Äôm within eyesight of her screen. I‚Äôve told her this makes me feel insecure, and I understand she‚Äôs a beautiful woman who is going to get messages, but I‚Äôd appreciate it if she didn‚Äôt keep messaging back with these people (which she admits she does, though insists its innocent) and also to not rub it in my face. She laughs that off and tells me I have nothing to worry about. I just have low trust of her in this regard and can't shake it.

I‚Äôm just tired. I love her so much, and I love that good wonderful person I know she has inside her. I want to be with that woman all the time, but she‚Äôs not that woman all the time. The relationship has generally been a good 1-2 months where I can put up with the myopic, impulsive behavior‚Ä¶the rude disrespectful children, the untrained dogs, the general chaos of her life as she only takes care of problems when her back is against the wall‚Ä¶ I just want the good stuff all the time, and I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible.

Its started to really take a toll on me. I used to go to the gym regularly, now I just don't have the energy. My focus and effort at my job have dropped. I haven't had any consequences, yet, but I just know I could do better, but often just cant focus, because I am thinking of what is currently happening with her.

The idea of being without her, the idea of her being with another man pains me. I want her, I want her to be with me. I do love her children, but don't want to live with them or help parent them when their own parents wont. Or to train her dogs. Or solve all her problems for her. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs really serious about stopping drinking. I feel like I‚Äôm parenting her more often than not. I just want her to take care of her stuff on her own, so that we can be together. I say these things to her, and she promises to change, but it never lasts. As soon as she feels happy, having compartmentalized her problems away, she falls back to the path of least resistance.

The Al Anon 3 c's continue to ring in my brain. I didn't cause her behavior, I can't control it, and I can't cure it.

I don‚Äôt want to lose her, but I don‚Äôt know how I can make this work. I‚Äôm pretty sure that I can‚Äôt, but don‚Äôt want to admit that to myself. Just the idea of not being with her though just kills me.

I'm so lost and I'm not sure if I'm in the position to feel and know what I think and feel is valid or to get professional help.

For context on what I've been through:
I'm having trouble finding myself to be comfortable at the fact that the person I'm seeing is still awfully close with their ex. I understand there are people who stay on good terms with their ex and that's fine by me but they still seem to act like they never broke up. It's as if they're closer than ever. I know they're just friends, so it'd seem like I'm the one who has the problem. I tried to confront my S.O. about it, but it would usually end up in them suggesting that I seek professional help. They're not entirely wrong, who knows if I'm really just exaggerating, but this feeling has been going on for months in which I can't find it to confide in my S.O. or my friends anymore because I know it would be mentally draining for them to hear the same problem again.

If their situation lasts, I'm starting to think of leaving. What's holding me back is that I love my S.O., I'm not sure if it's worth leaving what we have just because of the discomfort I have with them (S.O. and their ex) being so close as if their relationship never ended.

As such, you'd also be right to assume that my personal life has been practically non-existent for the vast majority of my life, and on the few rare occasions it did exist, it's been a disaster to put it very mildly. To the point: around 7 years ago, to a degree by accident I met the girlfriend of one of my coworkers and by extension her sister. I think at the time I was 27 and she was 20. I've been never able to admit it out loud to anyone but for over 6 years she's a on my mind almost constantly. That said, a lot of things have changed over the past 6 years and to be perfectly honest I am a completely different person, inside and out. Financially, physically and in terms of comfort, I've exceeded even my wildest dreams: there is nothing more I could possibly want or need. Back to the topic at hand, I could never find strength to talk to her, despite having several opportunities - I just knew what the outcome would have been. Hell, I had to be the best man and she was the bride's maid at her sister's wedding(third most painful moment in my entire life). We do get along incredibly well, we are on great terms, even though we rarely see each other: I've probably seen her twice over the past 4 months. But whenever we do, I end up mentally drained for at least a month. I'm not fooling myself and I'm perfectly aware that she is looking for something completely different. And that is fine. If anything I wish she finds it and that she's happy. That's not the point here. The simple truth is, 6 years is a long time, and as I said, a lot has changed since and plain and simple, I simply want to forget about her and move on with my life. All this is affecting my productivity and is exhausting me more than anything else in my life.

My apologies for any spelling mistake, since english is not my native language.

So I (28F) and my (27M) boyfriend started dating a short while ago. He and I met when we were teenagers at school, and even if we never made it official at that time, we had kind of a thing going on for a while. After many years, we met back and decided we were happy together and started officially dating.

We are both childless and have not been married yet.

He and I both were not looking for anything serious when we met again, but when we spent a while together, we both changed our minds.

Marriage and kids was soon enough brought up. We have a lot of fun, and even if we both are young and unexperienced in serious relationships, we love each other and make plans for the future.

Let me put you in context for what I have doubts about right now and need your opinion. I come from divorced parents. My father has a family in an other country and we don't have a good relationship (I remind him of my mom) my mother has substance and health issues and we don't have a good relationship either. The only family that I have ever truly interacted with was my mother's side of it, but there is a huge financial gap between our families that I feel makes it harder to really bond. They are extremely wealthy, and we are not. I have been recently explaining to my boyfriend that all of this was very painful to me and that maybe it was best to simply take some distances from everyone, since it always feels icky even tho I desperately miss them. This is something that literally haunts me, and maybe I should make an other post about it.

I have many cousins, but one of them was in my class, at the same school where my bf and I met. She is the opposite of me. Blond with blue eyes, tall, has degrees and money, impeccable reputation etc etc. I am a tiny brunette with dark eyes, and I know I will not be nearly as financially successful as any of my family members are, and I don't know what my reputation might be, but I have the feeling I am the hot headed one. Which is not an issue to me, even tho I wish we could have some sort of healthier relationship.

Yesterday was my cousin's birthday. I was talking to my bf about it, saying I wouldn't go because I felt sick and didn't want to put anyone at risk (we never know). He acted like he didn't know we were cousins, which is stupid because this is a small community, and I happen to be on her christmas pictures every year (she posts, I don't), we went to the same school, we both were known there, I told him about my fam many times, like... sure. Whatever. So after I clarified we were indeed related, he started saying they were both very good friends back in the time. I didn't know that at all, but even if I didn't mind, I decided I'd act like I was jealous as a joke. So I was telling him something like ""Oh so both of you were sending each others links to songs on MSN while you and I were NOT dating, huh? That's very interesting, and how come you both have been hiding it from me for so long?""

Now. And I know this is stupid, but I can't get over it, people. Help. That's where he replied: ""No, honey, you know your cousin is way out of my league for that to happen"". He could have said ""No, we were just friends"" or ""I didn't like her that way"", but he said ""You know she's out of my league, it wouldn't happen"".  
I asked him ""so she is out of your league, but I am not?"", and I honestly hung up and tried to avoid talking to him since. I feel childish and I know I should engage a conversation about it, but I still have no idea what to make of it or what to tell him.

This honestly rocked me to my core. I love my cousin, and there is no conflict between us, but at that moment I felt very, very tiny. Like. I don't know how to explain it, but it was very humiliating. Please, any advise on how to manage this situation?

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the whole meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her. I told her that sometimes couples fight and that I couldn't have read her mind since I didn't know I was supposed to pay again on the second date.

I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my shoes and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.¬†

I live alone. The complex allows renting out rooms, as long as the owner occupies it. My coworker, with whom I work closely, has a friend who was looking for a new place, and I agreed he could rent my extra room for a few months.

It‚Äôs been a week and it‚Äôs awful.

I‚Äôve told him a few rules of the house that he doesn‚Äôt follow (eg leave the bathroom door open when you‚Äôre not in it so there‚Äôs never any confusion about whether someone is in there or not). That in itself pisses me off. But the biggest thing is that our schedules clearly don‚Äôt line up - I am a teacher and he works remotely. I have to be at school for a certain time every day, no excuses. So my sleep schedule is important to me. Go to bed at 10, wake between 6-6:30. But his schedule is so different it wreaks havoc with me. Every weekday he cooked his dinner at midnight - I can hear the pots and pans, and he talks loudly to his parents on the phone (they live on the other side of the world). On the weekend, he‚Äôs gone out ‚Äúwith friends‚Äù at 11pm and came back at 3am on Friday and 5am on Saturday. I‚Äôm fairly certain he came back drunk both times too, as his footsteps sounded different than usual. 

I can‚Äôt keep living like this, but I also can‚Äôt dictate how he spends his time as we are adults. My current plan is to explain to him that I‚Äôve noticed our schedules don‚Äôt line up and it‚Äôs been negatively affecting me and my work so I‚Äôm wondering if it makes sense for us to continue this tenancy. If he agrees, I‚Äôll refund him half his rent for the month and give him until the end of the month to find another place. I‚Äôm fairly certain he can move back to where he was, but if not, surely my coworker can house her friend for a little bit instead, even if she ‚Äúneeds to keep a room open for her brother.‚Äù I‚Äôll also let my coworker know of this conversation. 

Should I do anything differently? Is there a way I can make sure I salvage my work relationship while also setting my own boundary of ‚ÄúI need my sleep schedule to be respected and that simply can‚Äôt happen with his schedule, through not really anyone‚Äôs fault‚Äù?

When we first got together he didn‚Äôt have any pets. I have a dog who is 13 who I barely take with me when I go visit him for the weekend. He stays at my family home most times but has come over couple times.


Shortly into our relationship he got a chicken. Without consulting with me, at first I was so jealous cause he stopped doing things he use to do for me cause he was taking care of her. He stopped open my door or carrying my bags little thing like that that made me feel forgotten. I also felt like because he always says we would be together forever that why wouldn‚Äôt he include me in decisions that involve us.


I feel like I am a pet person I like pets but something about him not including me or hearing me out really starts the pet off on a bad slate ‚Ä¶. Is that silly ?


I ended up falling in love with her and all that went away. Well I would still be jealous sometimes but like jokingly. 
We had the chicken for 7 months and she died by a rattle snake bite.she died a couple days before Halloween.

the very next day he decided to foster a dog for a friend that he now plans to keep.

We‚Äôre both at the same points in our life so nothings weird with the age gap. 

Onto the problem. I‚Äôm diagnosed with depression, anxiety and adhd. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have any diagnosed mental health issues. He is understanding and tries his best to be accommodating and helpful whenever I‚Äôm feeling unwell, but it‚Äôs hard to explain things to someone who‚Äôs never felt the things I‚Äôm feeling. 

Last night he casually brought up the fact that I can come off very rude or defensive to others and there was a situation earlier in the day that I thought nothing of until he brought it up. Someone had asked me for something and I just said ‚Äúno‚Äù with no further explanation and the person started making comments and was just generally mad at me the rest of the day. I truly didn‚Äôt think ANYTHING of it, didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to explain as it was such a small ‚Äúissue‚Äù. But now of course I am second guessing myself and spiralling thinking of all the times I may have done something that my bf found off putting or rude and didn‚Äôt say anything to me. 

Because of my mental health, I can go from being perfectly fine to unstable over pretty much anything. As soon as he left I broke down crying, felt like an awful person and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how my mental health affects not only myself but him as well. He always says he‚Äôs fine and has no problems in the relationship but then brings things up about my personality or behaviours that makes me feel like a horrible person.

I love him a lot and I don‚Äôt want to breakup with him over nothing but it‚Äôs really hard to be in a relationship when you don‚Äôt love yourself. I just don‚Äôt know how to express to him that I get so easily ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by him saying pretty much anything negative about me. I don‚Äôt want him to feel like he can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt tell me how he really feels.

He would make these guys think that he‚Äôs interested in them. He would get his female friend to talk to them over the phone. He was smart enough to do voice calls and those who asked for vidoe calls were ghosted. Then they would come up with an excuse to ask for money and the guys would send it. They banked $60,000. $30k each. Over the 5 years. 

He‚Äôs still in the process of trying to ‚Äúclean‚Äù the money. 

Apparently a female friend of his had this happen to her when she posted on Reddit so he got an idea from it and they started the scam together. 

This shook me to my core , this is next level psychological scam. His justification was that they always posed as a 18 year old girl and the guys who wanted to hit them up were 35-54 years old. 

But even then , Jesus Christ man calm down, they‚Äôre still human.

Early on i expressed to him that i can get anxious and he has ADHD, so i did a lot of research and i understand how to handle quite a bit that i wouldn't have known before being with someone with ADHD, we're a distanced relationship and don't get to see eachother too often but when we do everything has been perfect it's only when all we have is texts and facetime that i get anxious 

We've both had relationships before that have hurt us, i've been in a toxic relationship with an older guy from 14-16 and he says he was in one with a girl who cheated on him and has now got trust issues which of course i will be patient with as i would give him the world if i could, my only expectation is that he gives me even just half of what i give him. 

He finds it hard to express emotions so usually i just get an i love you or saying i'm beautiful, but when he's been drinking he expresses it more deeply and says things such as 'please never leave' 

The issue i have is that recently, last time i saw him was last weekend, since around wednesday he hasn't been calling me as often or texting me much and of course i picked up on this. Last night he went out drinking for the third night in a row (not uncommon, he usually goes out on weekends) but i thought he was only going out for dinner so around 11pm i texted and said ""hey, i think theres a few things we need to talk about are you home"" and he didn't reply but he was active so i was annoyed as he told me before if he was going off me he'd stop talking as much, so thinking this was what was happening as he hasnt been as talkative i followed it up with ""if youre going to be active but not reply then dont worry about it, have a good night love you"" 

He didn't respond to me till the morning when he said ""morning xx"" and i didn't reply as i was busy but i tried to call him about an hour later, he hung up the phone and just said ""im busy"" and then all day today has been blunt, said he's pissed off at me for saying he was active while he was out, and has generally been ignorant such as watching my stories but not speaking to me, and not saying i love you back when i say i love you. 

I want to communicate in a healthy manner and directly but i can't tell what is going on here and what he's doing 

I find it quite upsetting as last week i didnt reply to him for just two hours and he accused me of not wanting to speak to him, but i reassured him i was just at work and would never react how he is right now

She told me on the first date that she was moving to Korea for 1-2 years in July to teach English. I fell for her hard though, and we agreed that it didn't matter and that we would cherish our short time of 3 months in the UK together before doing long distance, and that I would visit her etc.

I quite enjoyed my new job, however cherishing the short time available with my GF meant that I was very much always distracted. I would meet up with her every day, often finishing work early and skimping on my responsibilities. She worked only part-time, as she was fresh out of Uni. We lived in the same town, so I would cycle down to hers and we would go eat out and have fun basically every day like we only really had 3 months together. Sometimes on weeknights, I would stay over at her parents' house and cycle back to mine in the morning, just in time for my 9am meetings.

I know for sure that if I did not have a remote job, none of this would have been possible, and it might not have even been feasible or expected for us to meet every day of the 3 months.

Eventually, this intense routine and work/life balance started to affect my job noticeably. I was falling behind on projects, which was starting to cause me stress. Also, my lack of alone time was making me less productive, as I would find myself doing stuff during work hours that I would have usually done in my free evening time. I started telling my gf that I needed to work late some days, and when we would meet I would be noticeably cranky or carrying residual stress.

I ended up becoming rather discouraged in my new role, adopting a fuck-it attitude and basically doing the bare minimum, so that I would be able to focus more on my relationship with its impending pseudo-expiry date. This was contrary to what I wanted when starting the role, as I was keen to give it my all, but the job kind of felt like a burden at this point (which I know is a bad attitude). I could tell that people were disappointed in me, but I didn't have the time or motivation it would require to completely turn that around (by going all out and working extra hard to compensate etc.).

The day came in July when my gf left the country, and I immediately had loads of free time on my hands. However, instead of using that time to regain face in my career, I found myself going to the gym, learning piano, reading and basically just reaping the benefits of having a remote job with no time spent commuting. Although I was able to improve at work slightly, other things distracted me such as: planning my visit to Korea; video calling my gf on my lunch break (she was 8hrs ahead) etc.

Often I wouldn't have the time to call my gf at lunch, especially if the pressure was high at work. If I did find the time to call, often I would come across stressed out due to work, and I think my gf would interpret this as me feeling negatively toward her.

I know to her, a video call seemed like a meagre feat of effort, however, whilst she was in bed, I was typically in the middle of my day and the act of sitting down in front of the camera for 30 mins to 1 hour would drastically break up my productivity, or affect my weekend plans. I admit I even started to dread the daily 1pm calls eventually, but I feel guilty for this.

After a month or two, with the 8 hour time difference and our communication only being a few messages a day and a few calls a week, there became a sort of rift. She was upset with me, accusing me of lacking effort, meanwhile, I was enjoying a more balanced life with more hobbies and less screen time, whilst still feeling fairly secure in my relationship. I booked a flight to Korea for around October and assured her that when we were together again, things would be different or back to how they were.

October came and I flew to Korea, with the aim to stay about 6 weeks. As part of my work's policy, I had to use up all of my annual leave on this trip, only working the odd few streaks of days here and there to break up the leave. I spend 8 weeks in Korea. Whilst I am there, things are very sweet for a bit, however, reality soon sets in.

My gf works in the day whilst I go to the gym or whatever, and then as soon she finishes her job, I have to begin working until midnight some days (8 hours ahead). Also, coding work is quite stress-inducing, which definitely shows in my behaviour, and I can't really give her much attention whilst doing it. I feel awful because here I am staying with her in the apartment she works for, whilst practically never being free to spend time with her apart from the weekends. Often I am so stressed out that when she approaches me for some attention, I have responded coldly or in a way I regret. 

I am now doing a bit of travelling before I return to Europe, still working remotely, and currently in Vietnam. Again, whilst we are apart, it is difficult to find the time to call her. She is upset and feeling like I do not love her, and I feel guilty and stressed. I am putting in less effort than ever into my work/job, and I just feel quite lost at this point. When I think of dating other girls, I feel like it would just end up being the same, or even that I would just be chasing a short-term distraction from my life.

I feel like the problem may lie in my low self esteem, as I spend a lot of time worrying about not being stable, ruminating on thoughts of what I should be doing, and feeling a bit tied up by my job and lack of rewarding activities, which leads to a low mood and ultimately difficulty showing love and affection. Sometimes I have found that I have absolutely no sex drive, and this only comes back when I do something in the day that activates my brains reward system (eg. complete an important task or do a gym workout). Most days though, when I can't get that serotonin from doing something rewarding, I basically act like a loveless jerk and its horrifying seeing the effects unfold on my relationship. I have had this in the past when I have felt particularly claustrophobic, such as during lockdown.

When we first started dating we would go do activities and usually things that I've never done before but he has. I noticed a pattern that he enjoyed going out when it was with a group of friends and I and not really just us two. During the pandemic we stopped going out and just hung out at home not spending much. Since then he has gotten a much better job position/pay at work and I know he has a lot saved. What really started to bother me is how he does not like spending on us. I make less than half of what he does a month and I often contribute to our going out dates that we have even though I am in a very tight spending budget since I have bills to pay (I live on my own while he still lives with his parents so he doesn't spend much on bills and pretty much saves everything). 

Before we met, he often would do a lot of activities and dates with friends and so he has pretty much done everything that I have wanted to do. His mom would often tell me of places where we should go/vacation to but he wouldn't want to bc of his dad being so strict. So we sort of comprised on doing things nearby that we could do instead without having to vacation/spend so much on.
Recently I really wanted to go to the city to enjoy the festivities happening (something that I've never done before but he has several times before). Throughout our date night he made a few comments which I tried to brush off how I am expensive bc he has spent $50 on me or w.e.. it really did bother me but I tried to ignore it. The following day I really wanted to see a musical (which I paid for it) and planned on paying for dinner that night. When we headed to dinner he made yet another comment which is when I lost it and started crying.

He often makes me feel like I am not worth some spending (which we occasionally do) and makes me feel bad or guilty for wanting to go out and do things. He's already done many of these things with others (including girls he was interested in) and I am sure he's paid for all of it. I do my fair share or paying so he doesn't have to feel like he's always the one paying. I really don't understand why he is like this if when we first started dating he would always say how he wants me to experience many of the things he has and introduce me to many other activities. He always complains about money now and doesn't want to do anything.
What made me want to post this is the fact that last night we had this talk about how he doesn't want to spend anymore and today he's out with his young cousin bowling which I know he is paying for. 

I don't want him making me feel bad for making him spend on our dates while he is out spending money on others that he wants to. Like am I not worth the spending? Is it just ME that he doesn't want to spend on? I spend on us ALL the time too. I really do not understand what I am doing wrong. I want to understand and see how I can make things better.

We had both recently gotten out of a long lasting relationship and wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious. Although, after we had been on a couple of dates, I was sure he was the one for me (and I could feel he felt the same). We are both very reflective and know what we want and are worth. 

After about three weeks I noticed he was a bit unsure about something, so we talked about what was to happen between us. Turns out he was afraid that he like would waste his ‚Äúyouth‚Äù by not being single and fearing that he would look back on these years and feel like he missed out on the fun single life. 

I truly understand that he wants to experiment and so on - I have done that as well - so we made an agreement to ‚Äújust be friends‚Äù so he could experiment and go out drinking at clubs without feeling guilty if he were to dance with a girl or what ever. Also - if we were to end up together, I would rather wait until he is truly ready. 

The problem is that he still acts as if we are together. He has talked about me to his friends, I have met his family and siblings who all like me, calls me almost everyday and we also often end up having a bit of fun in the bedroom‚Ä¶ and lastly, every time we are together, he tells me how he hasn‚Äôt wanted to be with anyone else than me. 

I can feel that I can‚Äôt go on for much longer in this ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù. But I am afraid that if I ask him to choose whether he wants me or not, he will choose the single life.  

I am well aware that I am young, but I feel like he is the perfect match for me and I think I love him. What in the world should I do or discuss with him?
