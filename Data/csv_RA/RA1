Bit of back story on this “friend”, before we were dating my girlfriend met this guy through a mutual friend of theirs and they kicked off pretty well, have similar interests etc etc and apparently they were getting quite close almost to a relationship until my girlfriend decided to back off once she learnt of his age (33) she was 19 at time and got together with some one only 3 years older then her (most recent ex) a few weeks after backing of from this guy. 

However this friend (M33) didn’t react very well to her backing off and started to stalk her at work, he would wait for her to finish late at night in the car park, stalked her to her exes apartment twice and even one one occasion when she went to check up on him at his home he took her keys out of her car’s ignition and wouldn’t let her leave his house.

All of this screams dangerous too me but now 6 months into our relationship my girlfriend is dog sitting for him while he’s at work. She goes over to his house for an hour a day to let the puppy outside etc but I worry because he has access to camera and garage doors remotely.

And to add further uncertainty she went back to his house when he got home (she told me) to show the tricks she was teaching the puppy but she said to me she would only be gone for 20 minutes she didn’t come for an hour and a half, after 2 missed calls and 3 texts from me. She apologised for being so long but it just makes me anxious.

We escalated things from kissing to s*x really quick and it got awkward. We got into arguments (confused over our feelings, what are we convos and more stuff) over the next couple of months and she just stopped talking to me before summer. I really really like her and I feel safe around her. We didn’t talk over the summer and she randomly hit me up to go out a month ago but she ended up coming over to my place. Ended up just kissing, nothing more intimate. She is super flirty and we ended up talking about what happened. We agreed to start talking again but as friends, she always told me she’s not looking for a boyfriend at the moment and I thought I would be alright just being friends with her. I’m not alright with it and the memories hit me pretty hard and  I’m also an overthinker so that makes it worse. I told her I couldn’t be just her friend because of the feelings I still had for her and we got into a discussion that ended up just in cold silence. I thought I was doing what’s best for my mental health and also respecting her decision of just being friends. For me this was the most logical approach for both parties to be ok. I’d rather not talk to her (which is already hard) than having a friendship of false hopes because it would be selfish for me to expect something from her because she doesn’t owe me anything and would also end up hurting me more being with her and thinking of it as more than a friendship. I care about her but I have to put myself first. The thing is that she told me she wanted to have a talk after our discussion and that she did not want to ignore my feelings and I didn’t reply. She called me drunk a few weeks later saying that she was in love with me. She sent me a song that reminded her of us, I told her to text me when she was sober but I guess she’s embarrassed and full of regret since she hasn’t said anything.

Now, I am the kind of person that likes when people are being authentic, when they aren’t afraid to be real and when we can have deep meaningful conversations with. This goes for all my relationships. And usually most of them go just fine without having this strange “feeling” I have been getting with her.

Whenever we both notice we have these commonalities we both just look in each other’s eyes like we both are subconsciously saying “you feel that too right”. It’s like a overwhelming feeling of europhia. Moving forward, I find myself almost compelled to learn everything about her. Purely for its own sake. It’s like I really want to know how she thinks and how she sees the world. I want to know her life story and each time I learn more I get this overwhelming feeling in my chest. It is honestly becoming sickening. I feel like I have the energy to run a marathon and be completely fine. This feeling will not go away however. No matter how hard I try. It gets projected onto everything else I have going in my life. In a sense it’s making me a lot more optimistic. We do “flirt” I guess, I just find ways to let out this feeling. Looking into eachothers eyes for 5-6 seconds usually does the trick. I swear we can both feel it but we don’t say anything. We’ve been sharing deep personal stories with each other also. I really don’t want this to be love, for several reasons. I mean I suppose you can love friends but I’ve never felt this way before. If anyone can share some insights it would be interesting to get another perspective. Again this feeling in my chest feels so good but also terrible at the same time. What an experience.

I've never done it, but I know it has to happen in some cases. I apologize that this is longish, but I will be around reading responses and/or replying.

For context, my family consists of three cousins, all women, who are like my sisters. I never considered myself an only child as I saw them every week until I was about 23. Since the Pandemic started, I have often seen two of them, Olivia and Sophia. One of them, Emma, none of us had seen. We were worried but chalked it up to Pandemic anxiety, which is fair.

Earlier this year, I reached out to Emma about a topic. From that topic, she turned it personal and said she wasn't doing well. That her partner, Ashley, of nearly 7 years, had been unemployed since 2019 and was driving up my cousin's debt. That she refused to get any sort of job and was citing health problems, but Emma explained that she's been with her long enough to know that's just a bullshit answer and she could get a remote job doing *anything.* I asked if she had talked to her about this issue as I can imagine that's a lot of strain on my cousin, and she said yes. I told her I didn't really know what to say as I generally liked Ashley and thought well of her. I left the conversation by telling her that I think she should address her debt issues again with Ashley as her apparent health bills were the debt drivers. I assured her that if she ever needed help with anything, emotionally or financially, we were all here.

I thought this was concerning, as Emma is very private with her relationships and doesn't ever reach out about this stuff. I kept it in my mind until I could properly bring it up to some family without having Emma distrust me. Throughout the year, Emma started going to my other two cousins about it. Saying she was struggling financially and felt like Ashley had taken over her life. Emma and Ashley live in my Grandfather's old house. We all own it, but let them do whatever they want with it as they pay the bills and take care of it. Or so we thought.

I recently visited and found the entire property overgrown everywhere, you could barely see the house. It would take serious money to get it under control and back to looking decent. A neighbor I knew had seen me park and waved me down to catch up, but also to cite concerns about my cousin and the way the property looked lately. He was in agreement with me that he thought Ashley had a ""natural"" green thumb. Ashley used to have such beautiful plants all over the property and we adored what she had done with them. But, it was obvious that Ashley had let things go and per the neighbor, had fired 5 of the lawn keepers my Aunt had hired to manage the property. This is an 8-acre property. It needs to be maintained a little.

This Tuesday, I saw my cousins for the holidays and will see them again tomorrow for Thanksgiving. Emma hadn't gotten here yet and so I thought now was the best time to express concern. Olivia and Sophia immediately agreed with me. They said it was alarming to them too that such a private person as Emma was confiding in us about Ashley. Per Emma's sister, Olivia, Ashley had been diagnosed with Autism and it had consumed her entire being. For context, Olivia's daughter has Autism. She explained that while she's happy that she finally got a diagnosis for herself, she is afraid she has let it consume her entire personality and was using it as an excuse for things. It's the reason she won't get a job, doesn't have many people in her life besides our cousin and the way she just would not let anyone help with things she thought she had under control. And thus, was dragging my cousin along for the ride without wanting to help herself in order to help my cousin. It appeared as though Ashley was purposely isolating Emma from many people in her life where Ashley did not have the upper hand.

I believe it is at a point now where my two cousins and I sit Emma down and express our concerns. That we have listened to her say she isn't doing well and will support whatever she wants to do, but want her to know that she isn't alone and that if she needs help getting out of this, we will be there. Our families are well off enough that we could easily get her back on her feet. She's expressed interest in moving somewhere else for a fresh start before, sometimes it has felt like she meant away from Ashley.

Would it seem like we are overstepping or appropriate as Emma as dropped conversations about it?

Still it is part of a pattern of avoidance and distraction that's pretty harmful to me and incompatible with the life I need to live to keep my mental health from slipping\].

I've known since I met my partner that I can't change them, I can only support and help them. But at the moment I don't even feel very capable of supporting and helping myself.

Ok so my sister has recently started dating a guy, and from what she told me about him he seemed really cool.

But once I actually got to meet him him I didnt like him at all. He acts ignorant, and swears/smokes drugs in front of children, and he also got my sister addicted to nicotine.

I would be fine with him if he was a black person that acted normal/white, but acts ""black"" (like an aggressivley bad person) on a daily basis.

The bad part is my sister has started acting like him and being mean to me and our parents.

My parents don't like him either and threatened to call the cops on him since its California, and shes legally a minor still.

In the past, he’d asked if I’d like to be more than friends, to which I said no.  I didn’t give any excuses that made this no seem temporary and simply expressed I wasn’t interested. Things seemed fine after and it’s been years since.  We only talk or hangout once a year at most (he moved away, we sometimes meet when he’s back in town) and those convos are 30 min or less.

We just spoke again a few days ago and made plans to meet up soon.  Today, I got a text that said “Good morning, beautiful.”  If my memory serves me correctly, the only other time he has ever said anything like this was the last time he made an advancement or asked about changing the nature of relationship.  We don’t have the kind of friendship that uses these sort of addresses for each other at all and it honestly threw me.  I’m now not sure what to do and how to respond.

I know that the information I’d like to seek is if he is still clear that our relationship is platonic, but I’m not sure if that’s a jarring follow up to a good morning text or if my response will seem presumptuous and “impolite”.  Very confused and second-guessing myself, but also need to discern exactly what’s going on — especially if we’re meant to meet up soon.

a few weeks later, he got kind of aggravated when i had a rough week and couldn’t Zoom when he asked and he said he hopes that when he gives someone so much time/attention, they would let him know if its appreciated or if he should “fuck off” and i should say no if i am not interested and his “ego won't be bruised” i kind of just laughed at his bluntness and was sarcastic (he is very sarcastic). we still zoomed once or twice during which he said things like he gets addicted to people bad for him.

anyway a month later, i let him know when i was coming to his city and he was very down to meet and suggested times. the day i was most free he was tired, next day we were supposed to meet and i was out in the gay district w classmates and he didn’t want to come pick me up as he said at 10pm there’s nothing to do but gay bars and no point meeting in middle either we both separately go to my hotel, or I go to my hotel. i didn’t really wanna travel alone so i said let’s just meet tomorrow. i guess i texted him id be ready while he was already in middle of lab experiments but we were going to have dinner. he was about to call a lyft when he confirmed it would be a little later than i expected if he’d have to meet me in my area and not in middle. i said i would only have an hour before having to leave for plane so it was up to him, if traveling 20 mins or so for an hour was okay for him. he said the same: so he didn’t come. I said he seemed tired, and he said he has been lately and he said next time we plan.

When he said good we didn't chance it due to my plain, I said maybe, that I am disappointed as i was really excited to be around him. He never replied back! Which is super unlike him! This was a month ago. i just saw on the apps he’s back in town!!! the reason why i’m considering writing to this person with this weird mess is:

\- i feel like we had a special connection enough that i has wanted him to be my first makeout after my ex. and kinda set me free from that situation. No one else has caught my interest like him despite many dates.

\-I am thinking of making out with him but not doing anything more. I understand we'd prob not chat after that cuz look how easily we dissolved after conflict and he never told me he was gonna stop his promise of our zooming/texting daily.

\-I feel bad how it ended after all that build up and it made me regret a lot my part in us not meeting up.

Last Friday my(36f) husband (37m) and I had an impromptu dinner with my parents. He was running late from work and decided to meet us at the restaurant...no big deal right.

As we were leaving the restaurant he gave me a peck on the cheek then got in his car and took off, leaving me to walk to my car down a dark alley by myself. He didn't walk me to my car, make sure I got in safe, follow me home since I had had a drink...nothing. When I got home, I calmly explained to him that that behavior wasn't ok with me. Well, he picked a fight with me, and accused me of trying to put on a show in front of my parents. When I explained to him, that wasn't it, I just expect a certain level of human decency from my spouse; he doubled down with his stupidity and said he did that because I've yelled at him in public before? When I asked when, he couldn't come up with a single instance and said he wasn't going to go ""tit for tat"" with me.

He then continued the fight by telling me I was selfish for not waiting to drive to the restaurant with him and because I occasionally don't pick up his calls so I can talk on the phone with my friends instead. He thinks the latter his unacceptable because he could be calling for an emergency, and it might be the last time I talk to him, which is his go to reason, and quite dramatic in my opinion.( he apparently also can't grasp the concept I have a life outside of him and the relationship). 

We of course have communication issues because he is unwilling to consider anyone else's perspectives and doesn't take ownership of his actions ( he'll say sorry you feel that way instead of sorry my actions have made you feel that way). But I'm just sitting here wondering when I became such an afterthought to the person who vowed to love me for the rest of our life's?

MIP will never think about you, no matter what it is, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, MIP problems are the most important problems, so don't even count on help, support or something like that. The MIP does not see your problems, because he will always believe that his condition is much heavier than yours, and you are just a weakling and a rag because you can't get together.

Any of your discontent, aggression, scandal or reproach WILL worsen the state of the MIP. You will not be able to express what you would like to change even if you do it in the mildest form, because your partner will immediately fall into an attack of apathy, anger, fear, etc. You literally won't have the right to be sad, you're sad - it makes your partner sadder than you 1000 times. As a result, you feel sad, bad, want support, but you sit and calm your partner.

Get ready for the fact that you will not be able to just break off this relationship. The MIP will always occupy the position of a weak legless kitten, which if left alone, it will not stand. So you will have to endure this relationship until you hate this person, but even then it will be extremely difficult to break up.

Do not make plans for a fun life, because at any moment everything can end. I'll give you an example: my birthday, I'm sitting with my girlfriend, I got gifts, we're going to celebrate, but suddenly ... she has anxiety, I calm her down for about an hour and a half, I give her a pill, she behaves extremely inadequately under her influence and eventually falls asleep. And I... am left alone on my ruined birthday. And so it can be with anything, a romantic evening or a trip can be easily ruined in a moment. 

No matter how harsh it sounds in relation to people with mental disorders, but I would not wish anyone to go through a relationship with such a person. This is much worse than a relationship with an abuser or manipulator, because they pursue some goal, and there is no goal here, there are only endless tortures and tortures of you. If you give up and fall into a terrible state, your partner will never even try to get you out of it.

I (19 female) had my first relationship this year with a someone from my class in my university we dated for only 3.5 months and broke over over a small small fight and miscommunication ,our breakup was a mess and broke me into million pieces it took more half a year to recover from depression i am very thankful to my friends who were with me during that time , my ex was the most amazing guy and i regret that i couldn't save our relationship , regret that i didn't get one chance to sit and talk to clear things out and how desparate i became  and i still can't get over him even after all the toxic things he did after our breakup.
 After 2 months we started talking again and it gave me hope that's maybe things will sort out we talked only about random stuff and have simply conversation i couldn't bring anything about our relationship cause in my mind we were finally talking i didn't want to bring the pass and lose my last chance to maybe make things right, then we stopped talking and i got to know he started dating someone else i was broken in pieces and was so disturbed
During that time I met a guy K who is my current boyfriend he had a crush on me for a long time helped me though my depression have and all the hardships he is amazing but i came in relationship with him just because my ex started dating i didn't have any romantic feelings for him and still i just don't see him someone i wanna have a future with. 
Fast-forward today my ex broke up with the girl he was dating , me and kwe completed 3 months together but i Don't love him even though he was with me though all the tough times , i don't like when he touches i ended up throwing up, i feel disgusted when we kiss , he doesn't realised i feel forced with being physical with him i have told him this .
I don't know what to do anymore . I can't leave Someone who loves me and was with me when i was low . 
I still am madly in love with my ex even after every thing he did i think of him even whn i am with K everything remind me of him and i just can't get over him except him i hate anyone approaching or even touching, he was the the only person i could share anything i want who understood my feelings, my first love my first kiss my first time being intimate with someone. My first for everything 
feel like I'll go in depression again from past 8 months it feels like hell seeing him every day in class and not able to talk.

Trigger warning; mention of stillbirth and small mention of abuse.

This has me in a really tough spot. My wife and I divorced a long while ago (not specifying when to try and keep this from revealing too many details). I’m 30 she’s 29. We were together in total about 4 and a half years. She wanted to divorce because I honestly wasn’t trying. All I did was be in our game room and leave her by herself. Never listened to her or cared about her needs. I wasn’t there for her when her aunt died for reasons I don’t wanna talk about here. My wife tried really fucking hard to fix things and make the relationship work. Her last relationship, the guy abused her horrifically. Physically emotionally and sexually. I do think she settled for me as a safe option despite really loving me but I just was jaded from my work and other life stresses and I just didn’t put in the work she needed me to. I was heartbroken when she told me it was over and I tried to get her to go to marriage counseling with me but she was done. It was too late. I made a lot of other mistakes but don’t wanna get into that. 

I was always secretly insecure in the relationship because I felt like she was still in love with someone from her past (not her abusive ex). She never really told me about him but he had taken a picture of her and her dog and when she talked to me about it, she just had this look in her eyes like she missed that guy and had feelings for him she wasn’t able to talk about. Besides that I never heard about him and the couple times I asked about him she would shut down the conversation but always seemed so sad just at the thought of him.

Anyway onto the current issue. I found her Reddit account by accident. She posted a picture of herself on a subreddit (not nsfw) and there she was. I couldn’t believe it. When I clicked on her profile there were other posts. She’s already with someone, been married a few months and I’m pretty sure it’s the guy I suspect she was in love with before me based on some comments she left on other relationship related posts. I want to say right now that she never cheated on me, there was no infidelity. I want to be happy for her but when I saw her picture I knew I was still in love with her and miss her so much.

The reason why I want to reach out to her: She had another Reddit account linked with her main one where she posts on r/babyloss. Turns out she and this guy had a baby boy a couple months ago and the baby was stillborn. Her posts on that subreddit are agonizing to read and I know she is in so much pain. I’m worried about her. I’m worried that she’s not getting the support she needs from her current partner. I’m worried about her mental health because while we were together she really suffered with depression and anxiety and she almost harmed herself very badly at one point. But she got so much better the year she left me. Started working on herself and accepted that I wasn’t going to change for her.I can’t stop thinking “what if that was our baby, what if we were still together” and how much I would show her how deeply I love her and I would make up for all of my mistakes. Deep down I know she loves this man a hell of a lot more than she could ever love me. Part of me knows that she and I were not right for each other and I put her through hell when she trusted me to be a safe place for her after the abuse she endured. I know deep down that this guy is probably the love of her life. But the other part of me is holding on to hope that I can reach out to her and be a friend at the very least and help her through this pain. I’m angry at her for leaving me because if she hadn’t none of this would have happened to her. Angry at her for moving on with him. Angry at her for spending years with me when she clearly never stopped loving him. The heart wants what it wants I guess.

I don’t know what to do. If I reach out I don’t plan on telling her I found her accounts because her posts are so vulnerable, I don’t want her to feel like I’m reentering her life just because I know so much about what has happened to her. She doesn’t have any social media but I still have her phone number and honestly I’ve been thinking about reaching out for months, before I found her accounts on here, to see if she would be open to having me in her life. My mom supports this idea I have but now that I know she had a baby and lost that baby I have no idea what to do. This is so distressing for me and I can’t stop thinking about her. I just needed to get this out and I hope all you internet strangers can give me some food for thought.

tl;dr: I found my ex wife’s reddit account. Turns out she had a stillborn baby and is in a lot of pain, sharing some things on her account and I feel so bad for her that I want to reach out and help her. I still am in love with her and miss her greatly.

Edit: she also recently had a death of someone she loved dearly that she posted about in a grief subreddit and fuck I can’t imagine the pain she is in right now and if she is getting what she actually needs from this guy and other people around her.

I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay when I started crying. I panicked about being left with the whole bill. I also was honestly extremely insulted because I had invested a lot getting ready to impress him and was excited to see this guy, and this felt like a massive smack in the face.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

**TLDR:** Guy bullied me into paying and I was really really shocked and unsure how to handle it. How do I avoid this happening again? my mom said it would have been rude to ask upfront if he was paying and i wasted my time and feel terrible and traumatized. I also feel as thought I was unintelligent, thoughts? there are men who fight in WARS and this guy was afraid of paying a check, can't believe I wasted my time

Update: He texted me a week after this ordeal, says he was really excited to get to know me, he ""doesn't see not paying as undervaluing me at all"", he wishes we could have kissed, and really wants to meet again.

Sometimes I feel like I’m not prioritized enough, but at the same time I feel like I should appreciate him for trying? He keeps actively messaging me throughout the day, everyday and keeps the conversation going. I’ve noticed he replies his discord buddies faster than he replies my texts though when he’s working. Also when we hang out, it’s usually at the gym for an hour and then we split ways after. Usually he has to go because he has plans. He never asks me to lunch or dinner, mainly because he lives with his twin and his twins gf and she cooks for them. First of all, he has a very active social , gaming life , and he’s an admin of a gaming discord so not sure if I have to take that into consideration. Also he’s in his mid 20s so not sure if that has anything to do with his actions either. He also lives with his twin and I notice their plans involve each other alot. Most the time he already has set plans, but it’s to game with his discord buddies/ work. The thing is, he always asks me to go to the gym together atleast 3 times a week) and then he invites me to sleepover on Saturday. I’m confused because he still actively tries to see me a few times during the week but everytime is so short. I can’t even say he’s using me for sex because we only have it on Saturday when I sleep over. But in the morning, I usually have to leave before 12pm because he has to run errands with his brother or something work related. Except One time he made me leave early to go to church!! when we hang out, we never hang out for more than 2 hours , but I’m confused as to whether I should appreciate the fact that he’s constantly trying to see me a few times a week and constantly keeping the conversation going. I just think it’s weird how it’s never for more than 1-2 hours and why it’s only at the gym. Never for boba or food. But Even if reply with one word he’ll keep the convo going all the way to end of the day. I do feel like he games with his friends for a couple hours atleast, which is partially why I don’t feel prioritized. 
Also he met my friend for the first time the other day, and he seemed to be really interested in her, they met after I told him they play the same game. He decided we meet over boba, which I thought was weird because he never asks to get boba in general (besides the initial first date.) most the time he was asking her questions, and then he had to leave early again due to plans. After we all met, he texted me that he could help her in the game etc. so I relayed that message to her. But later that night he asked what she thought of him. Is this normal behavior after a guy your dating meets your friend? I told him she thought he was chill. He then replied with , she’s chill too, but I’m super chill. It was the fact that he kept bringing her up. The thing is my friend made it known she had a boyfriend during the meet up. The next day we were trying to figure out whose house to go to next time we hangout, and I told 
him we can hangout at my house if he wants to meet my mom. He then tells me , he’ll meet my mom if my friend is there. I asked him why and he said he thinks there will be more to talk about with all 4 of us. Which sorta makes sense, but is also kinda weird he can’t just meet her wihout my friend.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7625646,public,self,Should I ditch the guy I’m dating right now.

I have 3 older biological brothers who seem to get on quite fine with her so I always thought I was the issue. 

One year ago my husband and I moved next door to my mom and (with no prompting from me) he started to get really annoyed with her behavior as well. I always strive to understand people and their behavior. I find it allows me to be much more patient with them. 

Here’s some examples: 

1) she asks us to come over to pick up laundry for her bc her machines are broken. I return a couple of hours later, mention my baby (8 mo F) just awoke crying  and i have to get back but my mom launches into a long story about how her washer/dryer is working again. I cut her off to say sorry I have to get back home and she looks shocked by my rudeness. 

2) she has this compulsion to show us things in her house when we walk in, different little decorations or tchotchkes she’s gotten. It’s not enough for us to smile and nod at them, we have to hold them while she tells a story about them before we’re free to go. Again, it doesn’t matter if we are pressed for time. 

3) she seems to be endlessly confused about things—- printers that don’t work, Amazon delivering things she didn’t order and again, no matter what is going on (screaming baby or the middle of a work day, I WFH) she has to stop me until she gets enough time/the reaction she wants. 

i guess she’s just sounding like a lonely boomer and I’m an ungrateful daughter but I’m trying my best to understand her.

I’m a more confrontational person, I’m blunt and feel addressing things is the best way to improve. Recently we got into an argument when I mentioned I had purchased a sex toy for myself. He said he felt it would replace him and he wanted me to not use it, or at the very least not get another. I was upset cause like, for one, he’s summing up our relationship to something replaceable by a vibrator, and secondly, he’s asking me not to use something that won’t even affect him?

Recently I was thinking about her and how badly I messed up. We had periods of talking and not talking, and our most recent conversations had been super flirty and tense. I think she felt the same way about our relationship as I did, and since we had gotten older, we started acting on our feelings. The last time we had hung out, we spent all night talking in my room, having deep conversations, touching non-suspiciously if that makes sense, just finding ways to touch without being explicit about it. We slept in my bed together, which had never happened before, and I was so giddy. We didn’t spoon or anything but our legs were wrapped around each other. The next morning though, I woke up and felt so gross, I was so uncomfortable around her, even though I knew I liked her. Anyway, I started thinking about her again and how I totally screwed up by not acting on what had happened that night and talking with her. I wanna reach out again and try to connect, even if it’s just as friends, but I don’t know if that’s the best idea. I treated her coldly after and we haven’t talked at all in two ish months?

I wanted to post here to get a unbiased opinion on my problems. 

I (21F) have been having mayor problems with my (24M) boyfriend. We are two years together and live together but i will be moving out because we think it would be for the best. We are so young and need to concentrate on building our careers and work on our mental health.

I actually broke up with him because i couldn't take it anymore and we got back together because he missed me and didn't want anyone else. We are in a in between stage of our relationship because we want to see how it goes before we decide to make it official, but we are still exclusive.

I started noticing that i was falling out of love and back again. I have the feeling he doesn't have the need to try because he has me and it gets better gor a month or two and then it is the same old same old. I never got flowers from him and he never compliments me. I always have to ask if we can do something on the weekends because he always is doing something with his friends. Before we broke up he used to tell his friends everything when we were fighting instead of talking to me and would do what they would say because he was literally writing them in their group while i was talking to him and asking him to please put his phone away. There was stuff like oh she said this what should i say back and that stuff. I was never offered small gifts while i was buying them for him. It's just exhausting. It was fine for sometime even perfect and i don't know why he is being like this again. I don't know if i am doing something wrong but I'm not the controlling type. I don't like it when he is out with friends that he is writing me all the time because i need that time gor myself. Even if he forgets we have something planed and he decides to just not come because he was having fun with his friend i understood. I even understood when he forgot to buy me something for my birthday. Every fight we had was because i asked hik a question or said  something bothers me, he starts yelling and then blames me for starting the fight and that i overreacted. 

There are good times don't get me wrong but i feel like his friends are his priority and that he just doesn't understand my feelings and thinks I'm one of his crazy exs so that he can complain about me to his friends so he gets attention from them.

My husband (35M) and I (34F) have been together seventeen years and married for eught years. We have one child together. 

Around 18 months ago my husband started making an effort to become more friendly with colleagues. He had been working there about 4 years and preciously had maintained separate work/social circles. I think perhaps covid restrictions played a part in this.  About a year ago he started becoming more distant, less communicative and seemed low in mood. 

He expressed he was feeling quite low, had some family stuff going on and that he was feeling a bit burned out. His sex drive tanked. He went to therapy and after one of his sessions he said he thought we needed couples counselling, which came as a big shock to me. We've always had a very loving and happy relationship and although the sex frequency had dropped, I felt I understood why. 

Then there were signs that he was at the least having an emotional affair with a colleague (24F) for whom he has direct managerial responsibility. To begin with she was friendly with me, I met her BF, who I thought was lovely but she never made the effort to build any kind of relationship with me. My husband and I have always had an open phone policy but in our whole relationship I never felt the need to check his phone until this point. They would message each other 20+ times a day. The content of messages was never sexual, but at times was overly affectionate and intrusive at all times of day. Given that we were having a difficult time I express that the friendship as it was crossed boundaries of what is appropriate and requested that he toned it down. He denied anything more than a good friendship and made me out to be overreacting. He has several female friends and this is the only one I have a problem with.

A few months later, he gave me the talk. That he loves me but isn't in ""lust"" anymore. At first he suggested separation, then reconciliation with therapy. The whatsapp communication with this colleague seemed more appropriate but I find evidence of deleted Instagram DM conversations and he was sending fire emojis in response to her story while he was out with me. This is absolutely not his typical reaction to friends' posts nor an emoji he generally uses. She was confiding extremely personal issues with him about her relationships, suicidal thoughts etc... basically baiting him for attention. 

We had a massive argument and a few days sleeping in separate rooms. He eventually admits that the friendship was inappropriate but is adamant that it ""never crossed the line"". For various reasons it would have been extremely difficult for a physical affair to have happened but I don't doubt things were potentially heading that way. I requested that any contact is strictly professional but he decided to confront the situation and explain to her that they needed to set boundaries and why. 

When I asked how she reacted, he said she was fine with it and understood. This was not true. Apparently they argued and she said I was trying to control him and I only know the censored part after yet more partly deleted messages, which I know to be because he didn't want me to see what she had said about me during that conversation. She made a couple of attempts to try and resume the friendship but he now sees this behaviour for what it is. Her reaction to a conversation about boundaries just confirmed her intentions. 

I'm really angry and upset that she has disrupted our lives at an already difficult time in such a pre-meditated way. I'm angry that she gets to make comments and judgements about me but he's asked that I don't rise to it for the sake of the work environment. She's leaving in a few months.  I feel like so angry that she gets to walk away from this without and consequence on her life but I'm left to deal with the emotional turmoil and regret of not confronting her. 

We are going to therapy and our lives are slowly getting back on track. My hard boundary is any more deleted or secret messages, regardless of the reasons why, will end our relationship but there are times when I think about it and I struggle to contain my feelings. I'm angry at him for gaslighting me about the significance of this relationship.

He’s told me bits and pieces about what happened since then, but never any details. I don’t think his mom did much to help him when he told her about it as a kid and even though his parents are divorced, his mom has let his dad stay at their house on random occasions while my bf was visiting home. As far as I know, my bf doesn’t really have a relationship with his dad, but he also doesn’t hate him. I’ve suggested therapy to him a few times throughout our relationship because I love him and want him to live his best life. I’ve noticed that he has issues with trust, intimacy, communication, and even addiction, all of which I think stem from his traumatic childhood and all of which have affected our relationship. I can sense that he realizes there is a connection between his past and present, but he doesn’t want to face it and he doesn’t want to see a therapist. He’s said that he doesn’t want to dwell on what happened to him, so he’s pretty much swept this trauma under the rug for his whole adult life (besides telling me about it at the start of our relationship). He says that he doesn’t trust doctors or one-on-one therapists, but that he’d be open to couples therapy. I wish he would just take the leap and go to individual therapy because I know it would benefit him and our relationship in the long term, but I don’t want to be pushy or controlling. I’ve done a lot of research on sexual assault and childhood trauma (as someone who hasn’t experienced it so extremely myself), so I know that I can’t force him to go to therapy or heal his trauma. Does anyone have advice on what to do in this situation and how I can be supportive to my boyfriend? Is it a bad idea to keep bringing it up to him and talking about therapy?

and then there’s some general relationship things that are bound to come up- hiding sex before marriage, not being able to live together until marriage, stuff like that that would cause a huge shitshow between me and my family if i countered any of them. they have good intentions because of their troubled backgrounds and how they experienced toxic relationships outside of the church but it’s just hard.
my boyfriend knows the whole thing is very hard on me. i would also say i’m a christian but so much of the strict rules are just because of my parents. i can tell it frustrates him that they have these rules and it kills me that it upsets him, but at the same time i can’t lose my family. especially my mom, i love her more than anything. help.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7625602,public,self,torn between boyfriend and family,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z349ey/torn_between_boyfriend_and_family/,all_ads,6,

For context, I (27M) and my gf (26F) have been dating for 5 years. We've been struggling for a long time now due to a variety of factors and I finally broke and started venting to my friends to find solace.  I've also gone to my friends for advice about a specific situation.  

The situation is that I suspect my gf has BPD (Borderline personality disorder) as she is displaying all the symptoms, but there's no real good way to tell my gf this.  I have a friend who also has BPD, and I vented to them about the relationship a bit while also asking to see the similarities and how I can help my girlfriend out.  She strongly agreed that she probably has BPD as they are all similar symptoms, but now I feel like I'm in a pickle.  

Question 1: Should I tell my gf that I think she has BPD and needs to get a diagnosis?

Question 2: Should I tell my gf that I vented to my friends a bit and asked them for advice?

Like I'm not sure what to do. With question 1, if I tell her, there's a good chance she'll explode and say I'm gaslighting her into thinking she's crazy.

He did change. He has been treating me better than the first time we met. So I have hopes. Till recently, when I caught a cold, I texted him and he just sent back a sad emoji.

Hey y'all, this is my second time using reddit and I'm really hoping someone can tell me the best way to go about things. Sorry that this is so long, but this is the first time I've let it all out and I don't know what information is relevant.

Before I explain my side of the story, I want to preface this by giving you the rundown on our history and why I feel so terrible about all of this. You guys can skip to ""**Current Situation**"" if you don't want to read my rambling.

Tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read a wall of text.

**Background:**

I guess I can't say much about our childhood or else I'll get taken down, but the long and short of it is we met in middle school, she pretty much adopted me into her family because I was poor and had serious family troubles. Then in high school she started getting severely bullied for her weight which resulted in lingering self-esteem issues. She was a beautiful person, inside and out, who didn't deserve any of it, but I was completely incapable of helping her. It was only when she left for college that she started to improve in any way.

Anyway, she went off to college out of state, and I started detailing cars which eventually evolved into a full-time job. Whenever we talked, it seemed like she was doing pretty good. I was happy for her.

And then toxic ex came into the picture.

I'm gonna call him Darren because that's his name. Darren (then 28) threw up a bunch of red flags from the beginning. Aside from the age gap, I immediately got the sense that he wasn't a good guy. He would casually neg her about her eating habits and appearance, he got jealous over several of her male classmates, he was incapable of holding down a job, and there was a night early on where he got too drunk and had left several hickeys in a very visible place despite her repeatedly telling him not to. Throughout all of this, I tried to support her as best I could. He managed to isolate her from her family (who disapproved from the beginning) and I didn't want to leave her without a support system if the situation ever became unsafe.

After two years, it eventually came out that he'd starting texting an 18 y/o behind A's back. She left him once again and this time she transferred back to our state so that she could hopefully leave him behind for good. During this time, I managed to convince her to take up volunteer work with me. We started going to an animal shelter over the weekends and she immediately fell in love with it. The other volunteers are all super nice to her, most of the dogs have become obsessed with her, and it seems like everyone there is able to see her for who she is, which is amazing. I expected her to stop going when her next semester started, especially since she's still working, but she refused to give it up, not that I was complaining. It felt great to finally have my friend back.

Not even a month after they broke up, though, Darren arrived on her doorstep crying and begging her to take him back. Despite her rejecting him, he'd keep coming around almost daily, swapping between ""I made a horrible mistake and I'll do anything to win you back"" and ""I guess I'll just go back to my ap since she's the only one who cares."" A managed to hold out for another month of his constant harassment before finally conceding and giving him a tentative second chance.

Of course, Darren couldn't manage to behave for even a month before going right back to his previous behavior. This time, though, he started to focus on me. He'd start sending me threatening texts to stay away from A and that ""I'm the only man she needs, not you."" Eventually, it got so bad that he confronted me at the shelter. This is the first time I think I messed up: instead of ignoring him, I went off on him instead, calling him out on all of the BS he put A through in their relationship. He started screaming that he was gonna kick my ass (which he can't. He's 5'5"" and all chub while I'm 6 ft and take care of myself) until the owners had to kick him out, after which he came home and started threatening A. This confrontation ended with another breakup.

After the second time dumping him, A's father pulled me aside and told me that he was really worried about his daughter. If the last time was any indication, it seemed like Darren wouldn't stop harassing her until he got what he wanted, and we were all terrified of what would happen if she took him back another time. The two of us, along with his brother, came up with a schedule where we would each spend a few days at her house to make sure he wouldn't be able to confront her again. Of course, since her dad is getting older and her brother has his own family to worry about, I ended up being the one with her most of the time.

**Current Situation:**

As we were afraid of, Darren ended up becoming a huge problem. Even four months later, he is still stalking her home and work. So far, he's come by the house eight times, tried to approach her in public another three, and burned a bra in her driveway claiming that it was her favorite (It wasn't. No idea whose it was.) A is finally in the process of getting a restraining order against him after being begged for months, but it's been a long and stressful process.

Throughout all of this, I've been pretty much living with her. I'm no longer staying the night since her place doesn't allow pets and I have a rescue pittie at home, but I spend a great deal of time with her whenever I can or whenever she feels unsafe. I can't even say that it's to protect her anymore. I know I should be thinking mainly about her safety, especially since his unhinged behaviors seem to be escalating, but I just missed being able to hang around like this.

And this is where I messed up big time. We were hanging out together last night like we usually do. Since Thanksgiving is around the corner, she bought one of those apple pie wines so we can unwind after what feels like a lifetime of stress. I usually don't drink a lot (Read: AT ALL) because of the situation with my mom, but I ended up drinking half of the bottle on an empty stomach and it hit me harder than I thought it would.

We hung out for another hour or so just chilling out and playing Violet on her Switch. I don't really remember the specifics of the conversation, but some way or another we ended up cuddling on the couch and then I kissed her. I don't know why I did it. I immediately regretted it and tried to leave even though she was telling me it was okay. It really wasn't. I stayed long enough to sober up while she just pretended everything was normal, and then I walked home and passed out.

I woke up today feeling absolutely devastated. I texted her a long apology around noon and she texted back that she left for her grandparents' this morning for the holiday but wants to talk in person when she gets back.

I just can't believe I did that. I feel like I took the trust she had in me and became another predator the second I was able to. I'm already never going to drink again, but please Reddit, is there ANYTHING I can do to make this up to her? She already refuses to believe that she's beautiful or smart or worthy of respect. I'm so afraid that she's gonna take this situation and think it's something she deserved to have happen to her.

What the hell do I do now?

It wasnt a big deal or anything, we were just going to go to a club together that we both wanted wanted go to. Last Saturday she had messaged me saying she might not be able to go as she might be going home for the week, but she wasn't sure yet. On Sunday morning, the day before, she message me again saying that she would would away for the week and that we should go another time instead. 

So I decided to go with a couple of friends instead and if was an OK night but I was still dissapointed she didn't come.

Today I was walking home from class when I I her and she just waved and said hello to me walking past, I didn't have my glasses on to be 100% sure it was her but my friends later confirmed that it was. This confused me because she had told me the night before she was still at home and that she wouldn't be back until next week. (This is the day after we were supposed to go out). This means that she had just been lying to me for days about going home and what she had been doing, which caught me off when I seen her and she reacted as if it was expected to see her there and she hadn't been lying to me. 

I don't know if there been a misunderstanding or she has just been playing with me this whole time but I don't feel good about it. I feel like I want to be annoyed but it's also almost like I already expected it to happen and I'm just disappointed that it did.

So I've been in a predicament for a while now and I need some advice, I (27M) I've been polyamorous for about 5 years now, I have a long term partner to whom I'm engaged and have a little one. My issue is not to do with my family however, it's to do with a person I was with when I was monogamous. 

She and I have kept in touch over the years since our relationship. We don't talk alot but almost every time we do there is a spark, and we open up a lot with each other. This has also caused both of us to not talk as much as to not hurt the other.

The major issue is that we aren't even in the same country let alone hemisphere! She is French and im Australian. Unfortunately it was her having to return to France that ended things between us. As much as I have wanted to travel, I have never prioritised it. 

What I've always wanted to do is to see her again, to the point I'd fly to France just to see her, even if I do get rejected, I feel it would be worth it just to be face to face. My other thought is to see if she would come on a holiday to Japan with me.

My partner knows all about how I feel and that I have kept in touch with my ex, and she is ok with all of this.

See my last post for details on the cheating. He broke up with me on Friday. Yet he says he doesn't want this to be the end, and we're basically acting like we're still in a relationship. Neither of us has changed our facebook relationship status', he still messages me like he did when we were together, and is sweet and loving to me- which partially feels good, but it's mostly extremely emotionally confusing for me. Yesterday he left a message of mine on read, and that made me feel insecure and prompted me to look at his twitter likes. I saw the last thing I wanted to see. A picture of some girls tits, which he replied to with a compliment. My heart dropped in my chest, because he keeps hurting me and hurting me. He says sorry afterwards, and acts like he feels shame and remorse, but how can that be true when he clearly can only think about himself right now? I called him and told him I saw his twitter likes and he asked what specifically I saw, and I told him. He called me weird for going through his likes and I ended up apologizing in the moment. He gaslit and manipulated me. When I asked a friend about it all, she reinforced that I was right to feel as though he was gaslighting and manipulating me. I've never been cheated on, and I never had a relationship that felt so validating at the beginning. I'm not prioritizing myself.

Never thought, i would post on discord but my situation made me do it. I am 27(M)

I loved a girl, we have been living in different countries, but we got together and met continuously, i was too attached with her, even though i didn't have any thoughts of marrying her but i somehow developed feelings after 3 months when she started to communicate less.

she use to share each and every single details, as i am trying my level best to make her happy with everything whatever i could do. giving presents, surprises even we lived far away. went to meet her in her countries many times.

After i shared my feelings she said she don't know and then she said she doesn't feel the same as i do. but she said after meeting you i realized a man will do anything when he wants to do. i thanked her for sharing her feelings and communicated less but i was still in touch.

she became even more distant and because everyday we spoke and now sometimes i texted her she responded after days and sometimes after hours and even once she asked me a call to ask about my trip, i gave her a direct time as i was trying not too be available too much to gain her attention, but still it seems it doesn't work either.

I cried randomly many times, thought of moving on, but still its hard i don't know why never thought i would be here in the mid night, but i really need some kind suggestions, i feel crying randomly while walking or even while working sometimes, i never did anything wrong but we had some arguments sometimes which i always tried to make it up.

After replying late, after days when we had the call, she sound so excited and happy and shared what happened during that day and texted for a while and upon i asked something she saw and didn't respond in 3 days, i was thinking to reach out but i haven't and thinking not to do it.

We bonded because we have a few important things in common and I enjoy her company. After a year is when we started hanging out outside of work, I even met her kids and some family memebers which is important since she doesn’t let just anyone around them. When I met her mom and sister they both said they’ve heard so much about me so I’m assuming I’m significant in her life just as she is in mine. 
Ever since we started hanging out I realize how bad and inconsiderate she is as a friend. For example we would make plans to go shopping on Thursday and on the day she never texts me and then the next time she texts she’ll pretend it never happened and then she’ll make plans again. 
One day I was fed up and told her off. she apologized to me and she started getting better with keeping her word. 
We were supposed to go to brunch for her birthday today. This was planned since Sunday. She said Wednesday since she’ll be at work but will be off the next day. I texted her first to ask if we’re still on for brunch and she doesn’t text me until three hours later saying she’s too tired to go. She just came from work , went to the grocery store and has to prepare food for thanksgiving. 
I understand that but once again, her situation isn’t new. She knows she has to work . She knows she’ll be tired from work and she knows she has children to take care of so if you know that then why make plans in advance? 
Like being friends with her, I’m starting to see why this whole “you don’t know who your true friends are until you have kids” thing is complete b.s. her kids btw are not newborns that need to be tended to every second. They are (around) 12 and 7. 
When we do hang out she brings her kids. I’m fine with the little girl since she’s ok with hanging with her mom but her son understandably doesn’t want to be there. What’s not acceptable is how rude he is. Like once her and I were talking on the parking lot after shopping while him and his sister were in her car. The son decides his mom is talking too much so he starts honking the car horn multiple times so his mom would hurry up. Like I get you don’t wanna be here but at the end of the day you’re a child, you go where you’re taken and you behave. There was another time where his mom asked to help him with the groceries and he said no because it’s his birthday. The last straw was when him and his cousin were whispering on how much of a hungry hippo I was because I brought ice cream at the ice cream shop we went to. I just can’t stand being around him. 
I have a baking business on the side and sometimes I participate in the farmers market. I’ve done this five times so far. Every time she tells me to send her the details because she wants to go but then not once has she ever showed up. You know who did show up ? My two coworkers, they were the first ones in line to buy one of every product. I just met them and they’ve already shown me more support than my own friend. 
 I’m just wondering if this friendship is even worth it anymore or if I should just walk away from it. 
I love her but she’s inconsiderate, last minute, and doesn’t respect my time but she’s a single mom so I guess that’s supposed to be enough of an excuse. I’m not even sure I want advice I’m just glad that I finally get to write down my probably jumbled up thoughts but all commentary is welcomed. 

TLDR: My friend ditched me but it’s okay since she’s a tired single mom.

I decided to post and ask for advice about an issue that I've been struggling with since I was a little kid.  

The issue is about the relationship with my older brother. We have 7 years age difference and we have a really bad relationship. For as long as I can remember we'd always fight for absolutely no reason. He'd always threaten to kill me after I become an adult because no one would prevent him from doing it. He tried to attack me physically a lot of times but our parents would get in the middle to stop him.

As I grew up I started to view things differently. I started standing up for myself. I also tried to speak about it with our parents, but they said that no matter what, we should stick together in this life and that there is no one that'll ever replace my brother. And also that all these fights are just 'brothers being brothers'. I'm pretty sure that they are just ignorant until our arguements start to annoy them.
They will try to break us off by just saying love each other and stuff like that. 

The thing is that there is no love at all in this relationship. I grew up worrying everyday if he is going to fight with me for whatever reason he'd think. Recently he came in our room and asked me what's up. I told him how my day went until he started telling me that whatever I did is nothing, unlike what he did in my age. Most of the time he will fight with me just to make a point that he is better than me. He will mention ANYTHING just to make a point that he's better. And he will stop when he is unable to find something else to mention.

Sometimes he behaves like a normal brother and is kind of a good person. But most of the time the opposite happens. We live in our family house together and we cannot separate due to financial reasons. But I don't know how long I can take this, with our parents telling me that it's okay.

I also forgot to mention that I have an older sister with 12 years age difference and we have a very good relationship.
