We live together and at the time we had been together almost 2 years. The ""cheating"" happened about 2 months before our anniversary. I use quotations because some people might not consider what happened to be true cheating since to my knowledge he did not have sex with the other woman.

The situation:

We had a kink friendly party at our house in July of 2021. Not a swingers event or anything really sexual. My boyfriend and I are not in an open relationship but he does do impact play with other women from time to time.  A friend of a friend (F20) came to the party. My boyfriend is way more social and extroverted than I am so I didn't think much of it when he and the other woman, we'll call her Anna hit it off. Anna was new to the kink community and she had lots of questions about impact play and general kink questions. My boyfriend offered to do a scene with her to help her see what she liked/ didn't like. In our community, that's perfectly normal and I had no problem with that. They had their scene and they chatted for the remainder of the night. A few days later my boyfriend asked how I felt about Anna. I told him I thought she was nice and I'd be ok with her coming if we hosted another play party or just hanging out with her in vanilla life. After this conversation, my boyfriend did not mention Anna to me again. Maybe a week after this I noticed a change in my boyfriend's behavior. He was very protective of his phone. Previously he had no lock on his phone, but he put a passcode on his phone. He seemed distant and he was spending a lot of time in the spare bedroom late at night. One night I came into the spare bedroom to check in on him. He had fallen asleep and the bad influence voice in my head told me to look at his phone. When I unlocked his phone (the password was his birthday...) It opened to his Discord messages with Anna. I saw on several occasions they had lengthy sexual conversations and they exchanged nude photos. I was shocked and hurt. My boyfriend doesn't even send me nude photos but he was super comfortable showing Anna his body and commenting on what he wanted to do to her. The next day I messaged Anna on Discord and I was upfront with her. I asked if my boyfriend and her had been sleeping together and I let her know that I had already seen their conversations. She told me that they never had sex and that my boyfriend never told her that we were not in an open relationship. After this conversation with Anna, I confronted my boyfriend. I told him Anna told me about what they'd been doing and I asked him what was going on. He was extremely apologetic and he promised to stop talking to her. I cried for days and we slept in separate beds for a few weeks. Since this incident, he hasn't talked to Anna again that I know of. We also haven't hosted or gone to anything kink related since this. My boyfriend says he wants to be done with kink altogether, but I feel like he's just saying that because he thinks I blame his cheating on the impact scene he had with Anna. I still think about how hurt I was when I found out that he wanted to have a sexual relationship with Anna. I was already struggling with my self-esteem so his cheating made me feel like I wasn't enough to satisfy him. We discussed breaking up, but he insisted that he wanted to stay together. To my knowledge, he has been faithful for the past year, but my heart still hurts. Sometimes I wonder if he's with me because he loves me or if he's with me because things didn't work out with Anna. I don't know how to heal and move past this. We've talked and I've been reading strategies for recovering from infidelity but I'm still feeling sad and betrayed. I worry when he works late or when he seems a little distant. I don't want to make him feel like I'm trying to micromanage his life. I just don't really trust him the way I used to. How do you effectively rebuild trust in a relationship? Why does the wound still feel ""fresh"" after a whole year? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My (25F) boyfriend (24M) sexted with a girl we met at a kink friendly party. It's been a year and he's been faithful to me, but I still feel betrayed and I don't trust him.

He has been there for me throughout that time, and has always been so kind and loving. 


That being said, lately there are 2 big issues.

1. I’m someone who is aiming very high in my career goals, but he is content doing, well, just enough to scrape by. He’s doing fine financially, but he’s pretty openly expressed that he won’t be seeking to change much about his life over the next few years. 

There’s nothing wrong with that, other than it’s just becoming more and more… annoying I guess? He despises the job he works, but is basically too lazy to find something else. I just keep imagining what life would be like if he just wanted more.

It extends to things like his health as well. He knows how to cook, but for the last 1.5 years or so I haven’t seen him touch a vegetable. He spends all day playing video games on days off, which I do too so that’s no issue, but I at least make an effort to exercise regularly which he steadfastly refuses to do.


2. The larger problem, a lack of intimacy. Not gonna get graphic, but gay sex can be a lot of work sometimes, so I never expected us to be having sex constantly every day or something like that. But even at the start he didn’t want to have sex much, yet it’s gotten so much worse to where we have very basic sex (no penetration, just kissing and touching basically,) once a month at max.

He says nothing is wrong and he just hasn’t been feeling horny much. But it kinda ties into the first point where he has no desire to live healthier. He’s tired constantly, and not from work, it’s just purely a horrible diet. 

I’m a young guy, I’m horny, and I’m starting to feel like a monster for lusting after other guys way harder than I remember doing before. I’d never cheat, but the thought has crossed my mind at low points and I despise that.


He is such a kind, loving guy, we share a ton of interests, but this stuff is wearing me down and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve tried talking about these things, but I don’t think I’m conveying how serious it is to me. He is so perfect in every other way, and need advice on how to move forward in a way that might salvage this.

For context, my (21F) dad died roughly 6 months ago. My BF Tyler (21M) was there for it all, and even was there when we put down my childhood pet a couple months later. He is a great man. Consistent, kind, and loving. I love him dearly.

However, my mental state has been lacking as of late. I’m not doing anything to take care of myself, and am starting to realize how burdening that must be on Tyler. While I am an independent person who deals with her emotions like an adult, I have been snippy with him lately.

I’ve been consumed by our relationship. He texts and calls me constantly. I never have any real space, despite letting him know that I prefer it. I feel guilty when I don’t respond to his texts right away, yet burdened emotionally when I do.

I feel like I need to embark on this next journey of self love and exploration alone. My entire life (academically and personally) has changed since my dads passing and even before. I’ve been using all my extra energy on this relationship and not myself. Tyler has been so strong and present for me, that I feel guilty feeling this way.

We have many mutual friends, which scares me slightly. I don’t know how to navigate this in a way in which we both keep our mutual friends.

So, what do I do? Do I break up with him and truly heal from these personal tragedies alone?

I was pregnant and unemployed, my boyfriend had a good job but his boss told him that unfortunately the company was going to go bankrupt soon, so he adviced him to start looking for another job, while he would keep him in the company as long as he could.

It came time for me (F32) to give birth. My bf (M39) decided to wait in looking for a job to spend time with me and the baby, because he thought he could find a job soon enough when he needed to.

Turned out he was wrong, has been looking for a job since when our baby was 6 month old, now she's 10 and he's still looking. 

In the meantime, a few month ago, I was bored and spending time on LinkedIn, and I found 2 job postings that I could be a good fit for. I asked his opinion in sending my resumes, and he said, sure, why not. I guess he didn't really think I would get anything.

He did ask me how was I planning to work with a baby, but I was confident I would find a daycare if/when needed. 

A couple of months go by, I was called for interviews with both companies, and I passed both. He started to change his mind then: what if he find a job in another city, what then? What's the point of me working since with his job he can make twice my salary? He doesn't want his daughter to go to daycare this young...he was expecting me to be home for a couple of years after having the baby...and we have savings to survive for at least 6 more months.

I told him in different circumstances I would have waited, but I was tired of being constantly stressed because of the money, and that him and his job have the priority, so if he finds a job in another city I'm goong to drop mine and go with him, but in the meantime at least we get some paycheck! 

When I accept the job offer he goes on for days about how I'm just working to satisfy my ego and not for the good of the family, I'm just putting more stress onto our shoulders, I'm just being selfish, he doesn't understand why can't I just wait. 

I start working and I find a daycare for our baby (that of course I pay for entirely!) But unfortunately my first week of work is my daughter's transition week at daycare, so I've taken the mornings off to be with her and in the afternoons I need to go to the office and I need my boyfriend or a babysitter to look after her. 

He refuses to give our daughter to a babysitter, and offers to take care of her, but resents me so much, cannot look at me in the eye, never even congratulated me about the work, keeps making me feel shitty for working, doesn't even know what I do or who I work for, and my job is a general taboo around the house. If i speak of it he changes subjects or goes on the phone, he never asks about it. If I can't do something because I'm working it's immediately ""I don't give a fuck about your work"". 

He also states he is my best friend and when I complain about the lack of support he says he IS in fact supprting me by taking care of our daughter when I need to.

However, he was clear that he was someone who typically needed a lot of space, but this being my first relationship I always assumed he was mad at me or something.

That even when I would be lying on his chest, a girl he had a crush on since last spring, he would feel nothing. About 2 weeks ago, he texted me saying that he needs a break. He said he needed to get his priorities straight and that he felt like he was not in the place to be a good boyfriend right now. He said it was nothing I did, and said I was nothing but “great and an outstanding person in general.” When I called him on the phone, he sounded so nonchalant saying he had lost feelings in the week prior.

He texted me at 1am telling me he was breaking up with me because it was too much stress for him. He again didn’t talk to me about how he was feeling beforehand. I called him and he agreed to try to work on himself. The third event happened a week later. For context, I was R’d when I was 18. He got mad at me for still being friends with a girl who was present when I was R’d. But this girl had no involvement in my assault. She was just in the same house, but had no idea of what was happening. He was mad I didn’t tell her and blame her for my assault. He kept telling me that I clearly didn’t learn my lesson the first time and that I am too dumb to realize how people actually are, so he was ending it. He said he didn’t want to be the guy whose girlfriend was R’d. I called him and we agreed to work things out. Mark has had an incredibly traumatic childhood, and even now his family situation is very toxic. He has started to open up about his problems and realize his faults. He said he’d go to therapy as soon as he could afford it and begged for another chance. I gave it to him. But now I am feeling drained everytime I hear from him, or talk to him. I can’t look at him the same after everything he has said and done. But I know I am the only good thing in his life, and I genuinely believe he is working on himself and needs time to do so. But I can’t help but feel so guilty and just wish I had let him walk away everytime he tried to end things instead of fighting for our relationship. It’s almost like, he has tried to put in effort too late, because now I’m already disassociated from the relationship. But I feel so guilty about potentially breaking him if I end things.

I was hesitant to date her at first because she has a child (5F) from a previous relationship, and I wasn't sure I was up to the task of taking on a father-figure type role.

She recently moved out of her mom's place, where she was living rent free, because her mother refused to feed *gf's* rabbits and watch her daughter at a moment's notice. I'm not a parent, but I feel like that kind of expectation is unfair to someone who is already letting you live with them rent-free and already doing some of the babysitting for you so you can work. 

As time has gone on, I've realized that her child is very poorly behaved and is very defiant when that behavior is corrected, to the point of flat out telling her mom ""No"" when she's told to pick up toys, turn off the TV, get ready for bed, etc.

I'm sure most of this is because my gf doesn't follow through on consequences, for example, Emmy (daughter) will throw a fit over something, be sent to time-out, and then be given what she wants anyway, which I feel defeats the purpose of time out.

I've tried suggesting that maybe Emmy needs some actual consequences for her bad behavior, like an early bedtime or no TV for a day, but my gf feels like that wouldn't be fair.

She's recently moved into her own place for the first time, and is stressed out because the school keeps calling to tell her that her daughter is acting out in class.

On top of all that, she's worried that she won't be able to afford her apartment without child support payments from her ex. 

I feel like something needs to be done about the situation because it seems to me that she's biting off more than she can chew, but my previous attempts at asking her to slow down a bit and plan things out a bit more for unexpected events have been met with ""I'm 34, and I want to move forward in life.""

I want to be supportive and helpful, but I'm genuinely not sure how to go about doing that. Does anyone have any advice for navigating this situation? Am I being too harsh towards her in my thinking?

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend is in over her head between taking care of her child and moving out on her own for the first time, and I'm not sure how to help.

So my gf and I have been together a bit over 2 years. We’ve both grown and changed a lot in different ways. Things have been good, i’d say not super amazing, and but not bad at all. I’ve graduated college and she’s finishing her senior year. 

 Anyways , recently, I found out that a really close family member died from violence and it really shook me up. It was unexpected and it just really put me in a tough spot. Ironically enough, the incident happens just days before my girlfriends birthday so i’m trying my best to be there for her but i feel alone myself. 

The night of finding out about the passing, my gf was with me. The entire family stopped what we were doing and met at a family members house to comfort one another. While there, my girlfriend was supposed to goto a Halloween party prior to the news, and I felt bad because i wanted her to have a fun holiday/birthday weekend, but i also wanted her to just be…there for me i guess. She asked if i wanted her to say and i said sure, but that she didn’t have to if she needed to go since it was 12am and i’d be heading home late (2-3am). So she stayed a bit and eventually left , and ended up going to the party which kinda made me feel a bit upset but i let it go. The next couple days she didn’t really check up on me and how i was feeling, but was complaining about her birthday plans which felt a bit off because I didn’t know how to give good advice or lend a good ear when I was heavily grieving.

Anyways, the kicker is when on her actual birthday, we had a nice staycation. It was really good for me as well because I needed to get out of my room and we got to have a nice night at a fancy hotel. Anyways, we got back home afterwards and started having petty arguments. Like she said i told her i’d do something that I didn’t. Instead of admitting she was wrong when her story didn’t make sense, she just said “well you just didn’t hear me”. Which made no sense because how could i agree to do something i never heard??? That was so confusing. Then later that night she said she’d wash my work clothes for me and I took her up on the offer. When i got them to her it was late and she had a load running so I suggested just throwing it in with her clothes. She insisted she could stay up and wash/dry them separately without falling asleep. Fast forward , we wake up the next morning and my work clothes are soaking wet and the dryer is full of her load i told her to throw mine in with. At this point i’m super aggravated so I don’t yell, but i blatantly tell her apologies mean nothing if you just keep doing inconvenient things. 

Long story short, she says we need to talk after work, and tells me she wants a break until we can be nicer to each other. I tell her honestly, i’m not in the mood to fight for a relationship. I know i’m a great partner who’s loyal, funny, and sooo caring etc. The past 8 months i’ve been talking to her about being more of a partner and not a beneficiary because i’m always investing in her stuff but it never really feels reciprocated. I don’t really know if things are over because the ball is kinda in my court, but i’m not the one that called the timeout. It really rubbed me the wrong way being given an ultimatum days after losing a close family member. It just feels very…icky. Like have empathy and be there for your partner whose gone above and beyond for you..right? Don’t get me wrong she’s been super supportive in ways that involve my important moments, but in terms of how i’m feeling or what’s going on with me, she just doesn’t really give effort imo.

I (25 M) have never had interest in a sexual or romantic relationship before. I appreciate and support others in seeking these things, but it’s something I never developed. 

About a year and a half ago I moved in with someone I was introduced to through mutual friends, and we hit it off quickly! We had a lot in common right away and I have enjoyed his company immensely. Living with him was the first time I’ve lived with someone else besides family members (I’ve lived alone) and it’s been a very wonderful experience.

Over the past few months we have gotten closer and closer. We have a lot more in depth conversations about a lot of things, we have been sharing dreams and goals for the future, and confiding things in each other that we both previously kept secret. 

So, over the time we’ve grown closer, I’ve noticed some changes. 

1) I find myself thinking about him often, wondering what he’s doing when he’s not at home, daydreaming about him, and imagining him as part of my future life 

2) I’ve even had dreams about him

3) I’ve considered what it would be like to kiss him 

4) I want to spend more time with him than any of my other friends 

I’ve come to the conclusion that these things mean that I am developing romantic feelings for him, but I don’t know how to move forward with that because I’ve never had them before. Does anyone have any advice? Should I ignore the feelings or talk to him about them?

So far, on a lot of levels, it's been a very great relationship for me. He's very loving, respectful, and sweet to me when we're together. I am the same way with him. He also is good about giving me time with my kids and not expecting me to be able to be together all the time and I do the same for him -- if he wants to go hang out with friends, I can stay home and do my own thing. I'm introverted and have been on my own for a while, so I do appreciate being able to have my own home, spend time with my kids, etc., without his involvement necessarily, although we do do things together with my kids at times, too. He also likes having his own time and space and seems to prefer that I do most of my kid stuff on my own which is fine. My kids also really like him which is a plus. We've both discussed the future together and neither of us want to get married again to anyone, nor rush any kind of living together. We've been dating six months.

Ok, here's where I start to want to pull back. He is very guarded. I've been telling him I love him for a few months (he's very easy to love) and he's not said it one time to me. His thoughts on the subject are that he wasn't raised hearing that he was loved and it's hard for him to say it or feel it and he's not there yet. Ok, fair enough -- no one should be saying anything they don't think or feel or feel pressured to, but I also think that if you don't know after six months if you love me or not, that might be a red flag that I'm not for you. Also, it's very confusing for me because the way he touches me and acts around me is very loving, so it's a giant mind fuck for me to have this guy not actively acknowledging he loves me, but treating me better than anyone else has and as I would want someone who loves me to treat me. I also think I hold some responsibility in how I'm feeling because I'm a lover and I want everyone to know how much they mean to me and how much I appreciate and love them, so when it's not reciprocated back it freaks me out. He and I have discussed this a couple of months ago because my natural reaction is to pull back when our relationship is on the path that it keeps growing and growing and his feelings are still not being expressed and/or felt. He said he's trying and he's getting there, but he just has a hard time coming to terms with serious emotions like that. I tell him that it's important to me to know how my partner feels about me verbally and not just by me trying to read their mind and equate their actions to a feeling, and he says he understands and knows that I need to hear from him more how he's feeling.

He also for a long time wouldn't mention me at all on his social media. Normally, I don't really care about this because I'm not into social media much myself, but, again, after six months of traveling and dates and pictures here and there, it bothers me that he doesn't even really talk about me with his kids or acknowledge me in public social media where they could see hey, there dad is dating someone. The flip side of that is that he has met my parents probably ten plus occasions and we actively hang out with them on the weekends sometimes as couples. Yet, he doesn't even acknowledge me to his mom.

So, now it's the holidays. I just asked him what his plans were for Thanksgiving. He says he doesn't know and I invite him to have thanksgiving with me. He says he doesn't think he'll be much fun to be around. I tell him that I love him and I don't care about that as long as we get to spend some time together on Thanksgiving. He ignores me for a while and then writes back that it's not about me.

At this point, I'm hurt. There's not been any real improvement in the ""expressing how you feel about me"" part of our relationship that was lacking before, and now that we're here in the holidays, he's continuing to kind of shrug off my feelings and my role in his life. It's not to the point that I want to break up, but I also know you can't change anyone and if he truly does just not really love me and/or not ever really be capable of telling me how he feels about me, I'm not sure I can emotionally handle that without wanting to throw up walls to protect myself and eventually close myself off to being emotional with him.

He has been trading currency for almost 2 years and although he is getting good, he hasn’t made any major financial gain.
He has recently started applying to trade for other companies (around £600 per application) where he has to trade their £100k and make £13k profit in 2 months. If at the end of the 2 months he hasn’t made the money, he has to re-apply. Long story short, he is on his 4th or 5th go now. 
He also pays to be in a private chat to get tips but works a 9-5 so trading isn’t ideal for his schedule as he can’t trade at peak times. 

I recently found out that he has maxed out his credit card, has gone into 2 unauthorised overdrafts with 2 different debit card companies, taken out a third debit card, is overdue on his car insurance and has several store cards with overdue balances to fund his lifestyle whilst all his income goes towards trading.

This is from what I know of, he has no idea I know about this other than the credit card.

Today I tried to confront him but he denied all of the above. He has mentally prepared himself to go into bankruptcy as he says this is what it takes to achieve his goal of financial freedom. He tells me I don’t understand his position but all I want is for him to go after his goal within moderation. 

He is living outside his means, how is he going to cope when he moves out? 
He has reassured me that he will get the money each month for bills and that’s all I should worry about as his finances are personal and none of my business. 

He has said that as I am getting on his case about his finances, this is causing him stress and essentially I am stopping him from following his dreams. 

I have faith he will be successful, I just don’t want him to sacrifice everything he has/could have because he can’t control himself.

Basically we didn’t stick up to our own values and stand up for ourselves.

Next he started doing a YouTube Channel. Then he he went back to the health app. Now he is working on some adult entertainment app, revamping the story app that has no users, working on some therapy AI app also. He is now working on 4 businesses at the same time. This has been going on for 5 years now. He says he hasn't been able to make money because we fight a lot and all 4 kids needs him every 5 seconds. He swears he is going to make all this money. We even done a couple business together that didn't pay all our bills or barely even one of our bills.

Without being mentally or financially prepared I got married to a loving and caring partner in my 20s. About 2 years into my marriage I started getting a feeling that my and now my ex-wife's paths are diverging. I was ambitious and interested in growing and exploring the world, and she wanted to take on more of a housewife role. She had some sort of a chronic desire of staying in her comfort zone and it became a major point of contention between us with more and more responsibilities falling on me. During the length of our marriage, I built a career and was able to financially support us both. She supported me along the way by caring for me and greeting me at home with a plate of warm food after a long day at work. Despite my constant push for her to build her own career or get an education in whatever field she felt comfortable working in, she could not become self-sufficient after all. I am good with finances and saw how much more we could have achieved if both of us had jobs, but also I wanted to make sure if something happens to me she can take care of herself.

During the worst fights we would discuss the possibility of divorce, but understandably she felt after all the years together she had nothing and I had everything (decent 401k for my age, high-paying job, promising career). I felt that I cannot leave her in such financial shape alone to start from nothing, so we would talk and she would promise to try again and do her best, and that's what I needed to hear in order to give us a chance over and over again. At some point, she took a huge U-turn on her latest promise and that ended the marriage for me. We divided everything 50/50 including my 401k, I took on all the remaining debt and ended up agreeing to pay about 35% of my income in alimony payments next 5 years. I was financially devastated but felt great because I got another chance in life.

A few years after the divorce (I am in my mid-30s) I met this awesome human being. We fell in love right away. She knows what she wants, she is direct, educated, curious, social, energetic... she is everything my ex-wife was not. We are all humans, so no one is ideal. Every quality has its positive and negative sides. Being direct, for example, makes her more confrontational and turbulent in the eyes of someone like me who is quiet and grounded. Throughout the length of our relationship, I experienced my happiest and my worst moments with her. I had about 6 serious relationships in my life, and I never (if ever) cried so much as in my latest relationship. Nevertheless, I do not want to portray her as a monster, she is a great partner with an enormous heart. She is just a... human, like all of us. During these two years we were together I grew like no one other I know. She is very argumentative and won almost every argument we ever had, but because she is able to explain herself so well, it allowed me to see how I can harm people without even noticing it. So much shadow work has been done, totally worth it. The issue I have with her, I guess, is that she won almost every argument and rarely said that she is sorry. She is one of those people who cannot say sorry for some reason and would die trying to tell you why she is ""right"".

**Dilemma** 

We are both in our mid-30s and being together for 2 and a half years now. Like any couple in a serious long-term relationship, we talked about our future together and whether we want to start a family. She brought up the topic of engagement and marriage multiple times and I told her I need more time before I am ready to commit. On one hand, I do not want to end up in another divorce, on another, we both have types of personalities that more likely than not look for a way out when the situation seems hopeless. I do love her like very much and I feel that she loves me back. We are very attached to each other and spend a lot of time together.

Recently we had a conversation about kids and she said that if we want kids we should plan to marry rather soon because once we hit 40 it's understandably will be too late for both of us. I already know that I want to marry her, but now that I am aware of the approximate deadline for a proposal (and it's sooner than I hoped) I feel uncertain and scared to commit. Nevertheless, I have been shopping for an engagement ring this past month and started actively thinking about how, when, and where to propose. The more I think about the proposal, the more stressed I feel.

She is an amazing human being and deserves the best. I have been building a custom ring for her ordering a custom-cut center stone from one vendor, a perfect mount I know she will be crazy about from another. A perfect adventure that in my mind will end in my proposal is already fully planned and booked... but suddenly we had an argument where once again I was told all the reasons I am wrong and she is right... and I almost called everything off.

I want us to have a family, and I think I want kids, but I am not ready to commit my life to someone so soon, not after the lesson I went through in my 20s. I also do not want to commit to someone, who in my eyes can be unfair to me. On top of everything else, several couples we know got divorced recently and that makes me feel that my chances for ""forever love"" are very slim.

I guess what I am looking for here is some perspective, or people reflecting on their own experiences. I know that I can wait if I am uncertain, but if I wait we are likely not having biological kids. I also know that my own happiness is in my own hands, the failures or successes of others do not predict my chances in any way. Maybe I should stop trying to control my life and let go? Maybe damned if you do and damned if you don't? I recently read a great quote: ""That if you risk all for love and it does not work out, there is no failure because all stories are, in truth, hero tales. And no growth of the heart is a waste. Ever."" which made me reflect on my past relationships and realize that all those failures brought me here I am more often than not feel very happy.

Some obvious answers: Yes, we went through couples therapy, and we are both aware of the work we need to do. Yes, adoption is an option.

Other than missing 5 days once, it was literally every day. We exchanged anywhere from 4-20 texts each daily. I understand it was only texts, but we talked extensively about many things and  I got attached. It ended abruptly in a way that I find very confusing. He is in jail for a nonviolent crime and we started writing because our family has a history and we are from the same town. Our last conversation was entirely normal and showed nothing out of the ordinary. A couple days prior we did have a convo about my ex who he also knows, but I highly doubt that played a role in anything that transpired. He is the most respectful guy I have ever talked to and our conversations are something he said he treasured.

Ok so four months ago we have our final text on this jail app. Everything seems normal. The following day I don’t get the usual good morning text so I went to check and his name showed “released.” I knew this was not the case, and figured something else was going on. He had given me his sister’s number and always said she would let me know if he got transferred. At that point I wasn’t worried and assumed I would hear something.

I waited 8 days and still heard nothing. I was getting anxious so I texted his sister first. Keep in mind her and I do not formally know each other. 

Me: “Hi it’s Cassie, sorry to bother you, I just wanted to check if Gary is okay? He no longer shows up on the app so I was worried and wanted to make sure everything is alright.”

Twelve days later she answers me and writes, “Hi Cassie, Gary got transferred!” (The 12 day timeframe isn’t too unusual, with processing and Covid lockdowns it probably took him a few weeks to call or write her.)

Her response threw me off and was not at all what I expected. Does this mean he didn’t want to talk to me anymore? Or what? I am baffled and this seems out of character for him to ghost me. But that was all she wrote.  I replied back “Oh ok, thanks for the update!” 

Does he think I no longer want to talk to him because I didn’t specifically say that to his sister or ask her for his address, etc? (I just asked if he was okay.) OR is this his way of ghosting me?

For some context, we have been dating for 1.5 years and are pretty serious. We lived tgt for 1 year and have met each other’s family. He got a great opportunity back in June and he immediately accepted the offer without discussing it with me first and how it would affect us. I told him prior this job offer that I’m not too keen of doing a long distance relationship as I found it unnatural. However, he still decided to take the offer. I’m happy for him but I just wish he also thought about us and thought about this move properly. We decided to find a solution around this situation and plan a way to be tgt again. He just kept saying “we’ll see and decide then”. Which pisses me off because it lacks planning and reassurance. 

Fast forward to November, we are doing a long distance relationship now and we are falling apart. He is having a rough time because he found out that he does not like the country he moved to. We have been thinking of how I can move there after my uni. He then started to realise how there is so much issues with the visa application etc. I somehow lost my cool and told him “Next time, know about all of these first before making decisions and how it would affect others.” I believe it’s the lack of planning and vision that I am upset about and how I’m feeling resentful towards him for making this decision which will likely be the cause of us breaking up.

We just started hanging out again after a long break and have had sex a few times, but I’ve been struggling with feeling a little bit guilty every time I’m around him.

3 years ago he ghosted me after a small argument,  which was really out of character but still hurtful. About a week later, I found out that I was pregnant (who else doesn’t trust an IUD anymore?) and went through every emotion in the books. I landed on “this isn’t the ideal situation but I want a child and am able to care for it” and started to feel okay about it. When I went in to confirm, I was told it was ectopic and was not a viable pregnancy. I had to medically end it to avoid the possibility of a ruptured fallopian tube, a potential emergency, and/or fertility issues in the future. It was harder than I expected, but I didn’t really have a choice. 

I wanted to tell him while this was going on, but he wasn’t talking to me or answering my texts/calls. When I heard from him 2 weeks later, he was asking to come over to apologize and talk. I planned to tell him that night. Unfortunately, he’d been silently going through a rough time and confided in me that he had attempted suicide while we were apart. Obviously, I didn’t feel this was the right time to pile on, and as more time passed it became harder to say anything.

Cut to the present, he’s doing much better and we’ve been having fun hanging out. It might sound silly, but every year around this time I get a little bit sad and think about the baby that I thought I might have had &amp; I think the fact that he’s around during this anniversary has made me feel guilty about the fact that I’ve never told him.

He was involved and deserves to know; I think I would want to know if the roles were reversed. But, since there was no option and the result doesn’t affect his life, am I telling him more for my own benefit than his? I’m a little bit afraid that this will end our situationship, or worse, our friendship, but I think I need to prioritize honesty over my desire to keep him close. Should I tell him this, and if so what’s the best way to go about it after all this time?

I want advice because i can't keep it up anymore, everytime they feel unwell i feel extremly bad, like a bad nurse or something, i feel like i messed up everything, we talked about talking things, saying out loud what we want and what we do not want, but when i say something that goes against their feelings everyting goes down again, And i want help, so many times people said me that i just need to cut the relation ship, but i love them so much, they made me change for the better, and i feel like if i left them i wouldn't be better than their familly and that i will be left alone, no body has ever loved me the way they do, but after two ultimatums in the 6 years they haven't change or put the effort to go to therapy, i've told them this exact thing im writting, but nothing has changed and when it does, it's only for a moment, and to be honest, i don't feel the same for them, i often feel like a mother or a sibling or a nurse around them and not like their partner and my personality has changed due to that, im not jolly anymore, everytime i act happy or have hope on something, on anything, i just remember their nihilistic words, those deeply depressing and obscure thoughts on things, and it makes me sad, because i know their happy side, and their true side, and when they get caught in the trauma, they doesnt't feel like my partner anymore

I had suspicions at first when it first happened, but I just trusted her so much at the time (we were both 20) I didn’t really entertain the idea that she could have cheated.

It was a Saturday night, and I was with my friends at a hockey game while my girlfriend was out with her roommate and some guys which she always claimed to be just her roommates’ friends. We’ll call her roommate Bella. I really liked Bella but I don’t stay in contact with her anymore and you’ll see why later. My girlfriend always expressed dislike for these guys to me and I believed her at the time. I mean on the weekends visiting she’d always try to have us avoid them and I’d never really see them, but her roommate would hang out with them all the time and try to get us to hang out. They lived in the apartment right next to my girlfriend and Bella.

At this point in time I would come up to her at college every weekend because she and all my friends were up there. She’d never talk about these guys to me except with annoyance because Bella was always hanging with them and they’d be over and she said she didn’t like them. When I was up there I rarely ever saw them. I knew her roommate was shagging these guys but I didn’t care being that it wasn’t my girlfriend, I trusted my girlfriend. Things were so good with her I never really considered the possibility of her cheating.

Anyways, the night this happened I was with my friends at this hockey game and I got a call from her crying terribly saying “don’t be mad at me please don’t be mad at me”. I asked what had happened and she said that she “danced” with one of these guys as in grinding. But her explaination was that he was forcing her too and he grabbed her ass without permission and all of this stuff. She was crying really bad and asking me not to be mad, she was leaving the bar early as she was on the phone with me and immediately I wasn’t angry because I 100% believed her with no doubt in my mind. I was angry at this guy for forcing himself on her according to her.

After I hang up, I check Snapchat and I see this photo on Bella’s story of them with faces touching really close together and his arms around her, essentially hugging her. It definitely was not okay, and I’m assuming Bella knew this as well which is why I was so confused as to why she would post it. Now down the line I’m wondering if it was to let me know what my girlfriend was doing, and if that was why she would always try to get us to hang out with these guy friends. I tried attaching a blurred version of the photo to this post but I’m not able to attach it. It was very bad and only inches away from kissing. I don’t know at what point in the night this was posted and now I’m thinking a little bit in my head about what happened. Did my girlfriend see it was posted and then call me to save herself? When I confronted her, she said he grabbed her like that to take the photo. Anyways I ended up believing her and I confronted the guy letting him know to leave her alone. From that point forward Bella and my girlfriend fought a lot, and the end of the semester came, and they were no longer roommates or talked. They had fought some before but not on a no talking basis like this. I just chalked it up to problems they were having like cleaning the bathroom and other roommate issues. I also believed a part of it to be because of that night and my girlfriend said it’s because Bella let it happen.

A couple weeks later before they moved out, I found a blurry Polaroid picture outside her window on the ground. I bought a Polaroid camera and film for her, and the photo was with the same film I bought her. I showed her and she thought I was crazy for suggesting it was with her camera just because it was outside of the window of her apartment. This could be nothing, but I found it weird, like someone could have taken a photo, she tried to stop it making it blurry, and then threw it out the window. This could be me going crazy looking into every detail.

Ever since this incident, there have been other guys I’ve been concerned about as well, but never really approached her on it. It’s just she would always ask if I was cheating (which I’ve never done), and I never asked her. I feel like I have more reason to believe there’s a possibility she was cheating but when I brought this issue up about that specific night about a year later, she got really mad at me for even suggesting it and that I’m blaming her for getting assaulted.

I really liked Bella and according to my girlfriend this was the reason they stopped being friends, but I have a hard time believing it now in hindsight. Maybe Bella was trying to allow me to find out.

I don’t know I hope this was coherent enough, if you have any questions I’ll respond with answers.

In 2019 I hit it off with a girl who lived in the Philippines, fast forward a few months I was traveling and I went to meet her on Christmas 2019. We both met in Manila and flew to her home province. We hung out for two weeks and it went well, but I had to fly home in order to return to work. Also I had plans to work online there, but they didn't pan out. I promised her I'd fly back in May 2020 and then the pandemic happened. During the pandemic she got stuck in Manila for 7 months waiting for her work contract to start (cruise ship worker), but it never did so she had to fly back home. This took a tole on her mental health as she eagerly wanted to return to work.

&amp;#x200B;

We kept in touch every day calling each other and cheering each other up during the down times. 2021 she was stuck in her hometown and tried a couple small business endeavours, but ultimately was still bummed out because her contract never started. She is older than me so had different priorities than me (wanted a family asap). I told her we need to wait since we weren't in the same place, we needed to consider work and also where to live. During the pandemic she bought land behind my back and told her Mom I bought it. She apologized later. Also she had no idea about saving money, so it was impossible for me to talk to her about the importance of savings during our pandemic LDR.. After many ups and downs and multiple breakups we broke up in December 2022.

**Finally the Philippines opened again in Februrary 2022.**  


In April 2022 I flew to the Philippines for a motorcycle trip, she insisted on meeting me and we did. One thing lead to the next and we were seeing each other again. I hung out with her for 1.5 months and I helped her with her resume/cover letter stuff. It was awesome being with her and hanging out.I left to do a motorcycle trip, which she said was fine. She got jealous after a few days when I told her in advance I was hanging out with some people. We were off and on talking after that because I was fed up that she was jealous even though I told her exactly what I was doing and I that I loved her and only her. A few weeks later she got called to Manila and her contract was going to start. She flew to meet me in Bohol and we hung out for a week, we had fun, but it was frustrating because when she was upset she wasn't being open with me anymore. I expressed this to her and finally she said she was just so sad that her contract was starting because we initially had plans to meet after my motorcycle trip and start everything together.. House, business, family, etc.. She went to Korea to work (still working) then I went back to her home province, I tried to figure out a few business endeavours on my own, but unfortunately had to plan to go back to Canada. She freaked out at me a few times since her work contract is really tough, long hours. Anyways after that I got frustrated again and said we're done and started hanging out with someone else. I hung out with this new girl and we hit it off really well, she was very passion driven, had a savings, and very motivated to try new things. This really resonated with me because I'm also extremely passion driven. I extended my stay to hang out with her, while she taught Yoga in Siargao, it was really cool. After a month I flew back to Canada and said I'd be back to be with this new girl next year.

One of my friends messaged me for relationship advice (she's also close to my ex). At the end of the conversation she asked how I was and with the new girl, I said ""things are good."" Then she said ""Oh I'm so happy because your ex is so happy with her new boyfriend on the ship."" I broke down. I lurked her Facebook page and in one of her posts she was down talking my new partner. Even after weighing out my situation, I told my new partner I needed space. She understood and I eventually just said ""I can't make you wait for me, since obviously I'm not ready to date anymore."" I messaged my ex about the nasty post she made about my partner and she said ""I don't care about your situation or partner, my new partner is so supportive of me and isn't so selfish like you."" I questioned myself as I went out of my way to help her numerous times counselling her during the pandemic, helping with her resume, and other things.

Later I found out (through my ex) that she wasn't dating this guy, she just liked him, but didn't want to jump into something she wasn't ready for yet.

He is incredible. I have learned so much about how to be a better communicator in a relationship from him and we fit so well together. We are a true team. Best relationship of my life. We have talked marriage and are planning on moving in together in 3 months. 

Background on us: I am a person of color and he is white. We are also both democrats. I want to preface this by saying I have friends with varying political views. We are also both agnostic/spiritual. 

His family: His family is extremely religious. Which is fine. Everyone has their own beliefs. They are incredibly conservative. Which is fine, everyone has their own beliefs. When I say his family I don't mean just his immediate family. I mean his entire extended family as well. I met them for the first time a year ago and it was absolutely horrible. I'm not trying to put words in their mouth but I felt like they were uncomfortable with my race, because they made comments about ""my culture eating this food"" . They also quizzed me about my religious beliefs and kept asking me if I knew Jesus and wanted salvation. They also discussed politics throughout the whole dinner. My boyfriend told them to stop multiple times but they didn't listen. I went to the bathroom and started crying. We left and he kept apologizing and told me that they have many views he absolutely disagrees with. 

Well last month we went to a wedding for his cousin. I had a panic attack on the way there because I was so anxious. I was the only person of color at the wedding and I felt so self conscious. No one really talked to me (he was in the wedding so he was busy for part of it). I'm not saying every event has to be diverse but I just felt out of place. I also kept overhearing people talk about their beliefs (why do these people talk about politics everywhere?!) and they said some things I absolutely disagree on and felt horrified by to be honest. 

I understand that I'm not dating these people and I'm dating him, but it's like every single member of his whole extended family (at least the side that was getting married) believes people like me are sinning and horrible. No one said anything directly to me at the wedding but I felt so isolated. 

I talked to my boyfriend and told him that I didn't want to attend any more events with his family. He feels so bad and is so sorry but said that it's his family and he will want to see them for weddings/holidays and he hopes I understand. 

While it's not as big of a deal if he goes alone now, what happens when we have children? They'll go with him some times and I don't want them to impression them with some of their beliefs. 

Now I know other people can say the very same thing about my beliefs and not wanting their kids adopt democrat beliefs etc. But the difference is that I never talk about religion/politics unless it's an appropriate venue.

I started with a job, didn't like it as much and ended up switching on less than a month, which made me shift nearly 20 kms away from where I had tried to settle.

During this time in the new city, I went to a bar once, only once, and this amazing girl (25F) approached me out of nowhere, asked for my number and we started talking, and then we started dating. Less dating and more her showing up wherever I am and spending time like that, together inside four walls. I've been swept off my feet and taken aback by the way our situation has evolved.

It's been 5 months since we started talking, and now I like her more than anything in the world. However, we are in a thing called a situationship, where we aren't boyfriend-girlfriend, kind of like an internship. I have lived an extremely boring life of 21 years - I haven't socialized or done anything remotely close to a relationship, and the situationship is something I don't understand yet.

She doesn't expect anything from me, she keeps saying that she would expect something from her boyfriend and I'm not her boyfriend. This hurts me so much because all of this is uncharted territory for me - I have never been in a relationship, I have never had a job, I haven't had to shift to a new city and fend for myself (College hostels are different). 

I am so frustrated with myself because I was so engrossed in work and didn't do anything for her birthday eve. I'm sitting here today, on her 25th birthday, writing this post while she sleeps, and I haven't done a thing for her like get flowers or get a cake. I want to better than this, I want to do something romantic but I don't know and I'm just grinding my brain thinking why am I this wrong about so much.

I am confused because I don't know what she wants because she doesn't tell me. I don't know what someone wants in a boyfriend, I thought I did because I watched shitty sit-coms and rom-coms but I simply don't. Please help me.
