however, he always gets salty/mad whenever i hang out with other people. one time i told him i’m going to drop off pills at my friend’s place after i finish work and he got pissed at me because i stayed over for coffee. i understood his point of view, because he wanted to eat dinner together and i knew about it and he was hungry but instead of just saying that he wishes that i came back early he started insulting me and screaming at me. he always makes me cry during arguments, saying awful stuff that isn’t even related to what we are talking about. he always finds excuses to get mad at me. he always asks me when exactly i will come back, etc.

im in the middle of moving and he said he will help me move my stuff. he helped me a lot which i’m really grateful for and he even offered to get a cargo bike to help me move all my boxes, etc. day before moving the biggest things out of my house, my friend texted me that she has a drivers license and that she could rent a car and help me move my stuff. i told him this and at first he was happy but the upcoming day he got mad that i didn’t ask him for help with moving the boxes to the car or something like that? i told him that he helped me a lot already and i can manage to do it with my friend and that he can sleep in (i was moving in the morning). he started joking about “girl power” and i was like ??? so basically i spent 3 hours moving everything and when i came back he was salty towards me. i asked him what’s up and he would just keep silent while we went out to eat when after like an hour of convincing him to talk he finally said that he just wishes he could help me because i took so much time for no reason. he says that if he would be able to do it with me instead of my friend it would’ve taken a lot less time and started calling me slow in communication, slow in everything, etc. i started crying in the middle of the road and he told me to stop making a scene. he said that it was a waste of my money, that i should’ve just done it with him and he would’ve paid for the cargo bike instead of me paying for the car. i thought he is saying all of that because he cares for me (which i don’t doubt that he does in general) but i think it might’ve come from a different place?

especially after today. me and him are both working today but he works a bit longer than me. he asked me if i could stay longer to wait for him and i said that im inviting my friend over after work. he started being salty and said that “oh we shouldn’t sleep together tonight then” and i was shocked. he started saying some weird stuff and acting weird the moment i said that my friend is coming over. 

he does that almost every time i want to meet up with someone else. it doesn’t stop me from hanging out with friends but i just wish his reaction wouldn’t be so harsh (almost) every time? he doesn’t have anyone besides me that he likes to spend time with, he doesn’t really have close friends here like i do because all of them moved out of the city we study in. i think he wants me to distance myself from my friends as he claims they aren’t good friends. i think there is other reasons for that.

i just don’t know what to do. i already told him how i feel but he always finds an excuse that backs up his side. he takes accountability for his extreme reactions but he thinks he has a reason to react like that. i’m just tired and i don’t know how to explain this to him. i know he cares about me and loves me. he has been helping me out financially recently as i’m struggling with money. he listens to me, supports me and is very emotional with me. he is in general an amazing boyfriend besides the arguments.

I’ve (26f) been dating this ex-classmate (28m). We matched on bumble 4 years later after graduating. We already knew each other before.

First and second dates went great. He constantly tells me I look pretty and, well, it seems like he’s into me. Or at least there’s attraction. 

I always thank him too and try to tell him he looks handsome aswell.

Yesterday was our second date and he hugged me, held my hands because they were cold, and let me grab his arm while walking. 

It was really sweet. He also expressed that he’ll text me again to hang out again and thanks me for my company, etc. And a lot of really nice things that make me feel sure that this can be going somewhere. (at least a next date)

He efforts a lot (pays for dinner, picks me up, tells me a lot of complintments…) He’s a gentleman.

So… in person everything’s great and I notice he likes me.

But when it comes to text… things don’t really flow. Before our first date he made. bit more effort to talk to me online, sent voice notes, etc. But now He only texts me good morning or late at the end of the day.
(We texted a month before meeting)

I try to engage a little text conversation but it doesn’t really flow. He also takes his time to reply (sometimes hours)

He’s really charming in person, and I love the way he looks at me, and how he makes sure to communicate that he’s interested .

But. even though he might not be a great texter in general…. it doesnt take a lot of time to conversate a bit more like in the beginning.

(Eps, seasons, specific characters introductions, etc.) What am I supposed to do?

I(F24) and my partner(M25)are long distance, to start. We play games, we video call, we message each other. Sometimes we have a chance to fly out and spend time together physically, but money and the pandemic are tight. 

My partner has shown an increased interest in doing something routine, and I offered up a show I really loved and introducing it to him. He loved this idea, as the show is still running. The idea was, we’d catch up together and watch new eps together, etc, while video chatting. 

Well… his sister inserted herself. The first season, I was told I could ONLY watch filler episodes with him so his sister could show him all of the action and important characters. I was told that she’d give us a list for S2 episodes that are “okay to watch” when she finished S1 with him. Essentially, all major events were going to be watched with her. 

This made me lose interest in watching the series with my partner. I didn’t really feel like there was much of a discussion. I don’t want him to tell his sister no, but I also don’t like that I can’t experience the show with him either. (Filler episodes are great BUT the entire point of this was for us to start something and be routine together — which, by the way, his sister wants to watch all of the new episodes with him once he’s caught up. I can “watch it a second time after.” I dropped the entire idea of us watching together period.)

This isn’t the first time. There’s been other shows and insistences where she’s inserted. I’m just running out of ideas to do at this point. They’re both close and I empathize with that, so are my brother and me. I’m not going to start a fight or argument either. I just really, really, really hate that this is reoccurring. I hate that the one show I finically DO get to show him and enjoy it with him, I can’t… because his sister has a ban on what eps are good to go and aren’t — which is most of the series.

Yesterday my gf went on a girls night out which I have no problem with. She kept in contact with me most of the night ( I kept myself awake until she arrived safely at home).

She told me that she couldn’t move because the club was too crowded. At 2:20pm I decided to talk about the topic in person, i picked her up from work and immediately asked her to tell me what exactly happened. She told me sort of a different story, she said that the dude danced on her while she didn’t move, he grabbed her by the hips but she supposedly tried to shook him off and told him to stop but he kept dancing anyways. I don’t believe she telling me the whole truth because it’s just a simple as saying no or moving to another place, she was with group of 5 girls and didn’t bother for asking help to any of them . Even if she didn’t dance back, she did nothing about it whatsoever. I don’t think she even respects me because how the fuck you just stand there letting a dude grind on you four fucking songs and act like you are not at fault.

I said that I was happy to be friends as I really enjoyed her Company and actually cared for her as a friend as well. She agreed and said she wanted to remain friends and didn't want to let this connection go to waste. She said she needed some space but not 100% distance from me. So I decided I would give her some space and just hope that we would be on talking terms after a while.

It has been 3 months since I have moved here and I made 2 quite close friends, Emily(19) and Alexa (19). We basically shared two rooms where mine was used only for studying and me and my room mate (Alexa) basically lived in our other flatmate's(Emily)  room 24/7. We share everything till now room, utilities, expenses, friend circle and even the study material textbooks were bought collectively with me and Alexa going half and half on the cost 

Last five days have been a hell of a ride for me. After a shitty college group presentation and zero sleep i felt that these two were ignoring me and being hurt, I kind of distanced myself from them. Spending more time sleeping, crying and doing chores alone. Well seeing how badly it was affecting me, my school friends advised me to talk it out and that's what I did. In these 5 days they would both be going out alone to meet with my other friends and spending their time in the dorm locked in my alloted room together. 

During the talk they both told me about how I had been rude to them by not going to lunch/dinner with them when they asked (i denied because I lost my appetite while all this was happening) and that me thinking they both were ignoring was just in my head, a misunderstanding. After the talk things still didn't feel normal so i asked Emily if I could talk to her alone and then both Alexa and Emily came to talk because Emily refused to talk to me alone. 

Then they revealed that they read my texts with another one of our friend with whom Emily has a thing going on. When all three of us were drunk, Emily was crying about feeling hurt because that guy gave more attention Jenna over her, going out to smoke with her when she had warned him not to smoke again ever. While drinking i got his text asking how Emily was doing coz he knew we all were drinking and somehow the conversation drifted and I started to reprimand him for hurting Emily and told him the reason behind why she was crying. 
This was the reason why they were ignoring me and I admit I was wrong i shouldn't have told him this, I have been apologising since the day I found out this was the reason and asked them how I could make it up to them. Alexa said Emily wouldn't talk to me anymore and it's better if i don't approach her and focus more on acting normal around our other friends. 

Well we have this guy friend Daniel, with whom we all confide in our problems and he is the one who knew about all the issues Emily had with Jenna. Till now all my friends had made an assumption that I was distant with them because of how my group messed up the presentation and Daniel was a part of my group in this. So he blamed himself thinking this was the reason and while I wanted to tell him and the other guys that they had no part in this, Emily and Alexa told me not to tell them anything about this instead to lie to them and make up some other reason. They also constantly reminded me to act normal so none of my other flatmates or classmates get to know that there's something wrong between us. I couldn't act normal and that pissed them off. 

They told me to tell them what exactly i am feeling and well when I did that Emily shut me up and straight up ended everything. After this, being done with spending a week crying over this and apologising to them. I accepted whatever they had to say and asked them to clear out whatever boundaries they want  to maintain with me but they told me everything would go on as normal and just not to expect Emily to be nice to me or for her to be talking to me. 

Later on i overhead Emily talking to someone, bad mouthing me saying now that she won't be there with me I will start burdening Alexa and that last four days I had been pretending to be innocent apologising to them but now I flipped because I told them how suffocating I was feeling because of all this. 
With this I have accepted that our friendship is basically over and the issue is, I have to survive living together with these two for atleast 1 year and and since the day I moved here at the start I had made a lot of friends, whom I had distanced myself with because Emily didn't like it when I gave anyone my attention and time other than her ( she had literally said this out loud to me).

I am a female. 

On the last day of junior year in high school, my friend, M, texted me one of those YouTube videos titled “send this to someone you hate”. I honestly don’t remember how I responded initially, but I do know that she was serious. I found the whole thing bizarre. We formed a decent friendship that year and it was shocking that she wanted to end it on the last day of school for no reason. She didn’t give me an upfront answer, just that she doesn’t want to be friends. 

Before I go on, it’s worth to mention that she did tell me she had a crush on me before she ended the friendship (she told me like, months before this all went down, and it was only a few months after we exchanged numbers). I never had feelings for her and told her that, but I was willing to support her because it’s hard to open up about something like that. I was gentle about it and honestly felt flattered. No other conversation about it was brought up after that though. 

So anyway, a few days later she texts me that she is sorry for breaking the friendship and didn’t mean it and wants to be friends. I didn’t respond because I felt like it wasn’t worth it. We weren’t THAT close. We only talked in school and never outside of it.


But the thing is that since then, I’ve received a handwritten letter (during senior year at school), and multiple messages and emails asking for reconciliation. She emailed my personal gmail and has messaged me on Instagram and Facebook. This has happened maybe one to three times a year. I’m now a junior in college.

Her most recent message came a few days ago. She sent multiple messages in the same timeframe stating that she was trying to apologize in the letter she gave me, and “didn’t want to cause another argument”. We never argued when she broke the friendship. She also said she wants me to “please write her back at least”. I ignored the messages again. 

Now today, I went back on my messages and saw another message request. This time she tried calling/video chatting me. I’m finding it very frustrating and concerning. I don’t want to be friends with her again, especially with how desperately she’s trying to reach out to me. I haven’t bumped into her or spoke to her since senior year of high school, but I’m still paranoid that blocking her would be bad.

He ""dated"" a girl before me that he never actually met and continued messaging her while we dated and lied to me about who she was. He also had a female friend that he hung out with alone while we were dating, which crossed a boundary with me because it was at night time and he even introduced her to his friends before he introduced me. He also told me he dated a girl before me for a year but a few months ago, he admitted that it was a lie. He told me who that girlfriend was and said things that made me feel like he liked her more, even though now I know she doesnt exist, at the time it really hurt my feelings. I also introduced him to my best friend and he told me certain things that made me feel like he was attracted to her.

But here is why I think I am the problem. About a year ago someone dmmed me on their burner instagram account and flirted with me and I messaged them back and liked the attention. They didn't say who they were but I got the impression that it was one of his friends. I know I should not have felt that way and that makes me a bad girlfriend to him. I didn't cheat but I was not a good person and I still feel guilty. He knows I did it and forgave me.

Married for over 10 years. Two kids. Our sex life wasn’t great in the beginning. He rarely seemed interested. We almost divorced a few years into our relationship. 

We worked on it and our sexual relationship became extremely open at one point. I confided in him things I wanted to try. He was very receptive and open too. It was fantastic. Our sex life was/is amazing. He eventually confided about being curious to try being with another man. I wasn’t against it, but said I didn’t want to join. He never brought it up again. (We have done the swinger route a couple of times but ultimately decided it wasn’t for us.) 

Anyway, its been a while since we were sexually adventurous. But tonight we are having sex and he says, “That’s my boy.”

I asked him about it and he absolutely denies saying it. I on the other hand know exactly what I heard. (Sometimes in the past, he would say “that’s my girl,” to me during sex, which I liked.) 

I don’t even care so much about him fantasizing about being with a man (although, I really don’t like the idea of my body being considered manly) but it’s the downright refusal to admit it. He’s acting like I’m crazy and went into a rant about how I am suddenly accusing him of pretending I’m a boy. Instead, he proclaims he probably said, “oh boy,” which he never says during sex.

Forgive me for this is going to be a long post.

My boyfriend and i had sort of a rocky start, as his best friend at the time friend me and i clearly didn't see him as anything but a friend but i did get the vibes from him after which i slowly started distancing myself from him without creating much of a scene so that it wouldn't break up the friends group. At the time i refused to confront this guy friend about this as it would get awkward and i am not a confrontation type person. My boyfriend had a problem with this but we somehow got past it . I had a few guy friends i was pretty close to , i didn't really give the details of them to my boyfriend because i am a private person and i just like to have my things to myself. He wasn't completely unaware of them , he knew they existed and that we would shoot texts across often . This also somehow didn't sit right with him . He would complain but not directly about how i text these guys too often . I actually stopped texting these guys often just so i wouldn't have to deal with his complaining which eventually led to a fight which would get ugly with name calling, etc. To be clear he really loves me and he would never text girls unless there was a need for something major .
    In the past few years we have had countless arguments about the same friend who i didn't confront and these guy friends that i stopped texting.
My boyfriend during covid got back into weed and over did it . He had quit once before. He never had the right family or friends to fall back on . He became very very paranoid and everything that comes with the abuse of weed . I'm happy to say he's been clean for a year and 3 months now but the effects are still there , he's really paranoid. He always thinks guys are hitting on me . He says i entertain them. For example- we met with a career counselor who at the session said ""please feel free to call if you have any doubts. I am a bachelor till December"" which was clearly a joke and he wasn't even saying to me it was to the both of us . He made a bad joke about how marriage makes you busy . He to this day says i was leading on his best friend back then which really isn't true . Now anyone who comes near me talks to me (guys) he gets upset, complains that I'm ignoring him and he assumes everyday every guy just flirting with me and when I try to calmly tell him he fights calls me names questions my character. I really love him but these are red flags right . These situations are going out of hand there are multiple times multiple incidents similar ones making me think.

Surprisingly I got over my ex really quickly and found myself falling in love with my friend. He is well aware of my feelings. And when we slept with each other the first time I already told him things are going to get awkward if one of us falls in love. 

Now I’m ready for something more serious but he said he needed time. So in those 2.5 months I was there when he said he wanted and needed me with him, went home when he wanted space, talked about my own feelings too. 

He said “enjoy it” but it started to hurt me more than it gives me comfort to be by his side. After my 3.5 year long distance relationship I have no more patience for a guy to tell me “I want you but…” (both my friend and my ex did say that).

She  doesnt work much  never has any money and i didnt want her to tell me I shouldn't go because of the cost. When i got back from the trip I told her and she broke up with me.


I 45 male live with my gf46 and her 15 year old son. I work m-f every week and she works a day here and there cleaning houses. When we moved in we agreed to split bills 50/50. I had my own place already it was small and didnt need to move but she wanted to move in together so that was the deal we made. It was ok because half of the bills was pretty close tonwhat i was paying on my own for my small place.

We set it up where i write the checks for  the rent and electricity  she paid internet, garbage, and the cell phones. We then then take half of what she pays subtract it from half the elec and rent and that is what she pays me. 
As time went on she started coming up short. I covered her and she paid me back over time. Thsts what partners do. However over this past summer she has gotten 3 months behind. Whenever I ask  it turns into an arguement. I dont know why... i just ask if she has money for me and it goes south. It has gotten to the point where if i even mention anything about money she ends up pissed off and has to leave the house. I once wanted to buy another car so i didnt have to drive my work truck. Big fight becasue she cant even afford to fix her car and i want a second one. We were talking about credit scores one day and when she saw mine big fight. She feels i should be letting her use my ccard because i have a high limit. Inonce said i wanted to buy an acre of land and build a small house for us and it turned into a fight because it would be only mine because she cant contribute to the house so she would not live in it with me, that she would move back in with her ex because she can live there for free. I wanted to take her out to eat she wouldn't go because i should save my money. 

A friend of mine planned a trip to Florida with 2 other friends. The 4 of us have not seen each other in almost 8 years. I told  my gf i was going to go see them  she was mad i didnt invite her. After her reaction i felt if i told her it was to fl itbwould turn ugly. So I told her it was a guys trip and we were going to my friends house who had just purchased a home. She was mad but we decided some time apart may be good. Absence makes the heart grow stronger. 

The night before i was to leave i had made plans to take her out to eat. She called me at work and told me her sons gf was spending the night. I dont like any friends in the home alone when we arent there becasue the kids go thru my bedroom drawers. So dinner was canceled.

 I left the next morning and went to fl had a great couple of days till i tried to sign and return an email from the boat rental place. My phone stopped working.  I got to a wifi spot and messaged my gf. She hadn't paid the bill. She hadnt paid the bill for 3 months. She told me she wasnt going to pay the bill because she decided she and her son dont need cell phones so i should just get my own plan. Wtf. So i did. Rest of my trip was good. I missed my gf. I feel bad she has no money. She is having trouble finding work. So i figure ill give her money to fix her car and pay for her phone so she can call about work.

I get home she tells me she didnt miss me. I tell her i want to help her.  She tells me she likes being alone but loves me and wants have a realtionship. She asks how my friends house was and I tell her about the trip to fl. She starts yelling at me. I try and explain i told her i was going to my friends house because i knew she was going to get mad and i didnt want to leave on a trip after a fight with her.

Her response. Fuck you im leaving you.

Im heart broken. What can i say to her, how can i explain to her that i didnt tell her about fl because i didnt want to make her feel bad, mad or jealous?

And I’ve been going back and forth about if I should give him a second chance or just leave it at us being broken up.
I made a pros and cons list of staying or not and the cons are outweighing the pros. 
Also I just feel like I’ll look really weak for going back and show that I have no self-respect because why would you go back to someone who put you at risk like that. And what kind of people I would be to just let something like this slide.
And at the same time I’m just thinking about all the good times and how I felt cared for and seen and heard
Ik it’s probably not going to be worth staying because I have this saying/mindset that goes “people don’t really change they just hide it better” and he’s definitely proved my mindset right because come to find out every relationship he’s been in (and they went on a break) he seeked out someone else. Maybe I’m dodging a bullet by just leaving but I still have some feelings that he maybe could get a second chance but at the same time absolutely not.

The only thing keeping him from being on disability is that he works a tech job from home.

This is on top of my full time elementary teaching job! I'm tired and overwhelmed and over it. When he gets angry he is so nasty. He insults me and my family, threatens bodily harm, has threatened to kill me, spits on me, slaps me, and generally intimidates me. He doesn't hide this from the kids. When they hear him start yelling, they usually run to their room and shut the door.

Sorry I'm a mess right now so please forgive me if I'm not making sense. This is going to be a long post.

We met back in 2017 and were together until 2020 when he had to move to a different state for grad school (2 hour time difference). We've been long distance since then and it's been almost 3 years. I'm also in grad school but got in a school in our home city and I will be done before he's done. The original plan was for me to apply for residency in the state he's in.

I feel like we've always had communication problems but it's been getting worse to the point where I don't feel connected anymore. His phone is always on silent unless I tell him to turn on the sound so he usually takes hours to respond to my texts. 99% of my calls go to voicemail and he tends to text me back instead of calling me back. So when he texts me back, I call right away because I just want to hear his voice. However, since his phone is on silent, he misses my call again. Since he's not really good at texting throughout the day, we used to Zoom at night to just catch up and study together.

I guess our problem really started this school year since he is doing the research/lab portion of his grad school and is in lab most nights until past midnight. Lately, our texts usually consists of us saying good morning (8am), me telling him what I'm learning in school (we're both in the medical field) or cool guest lecturers in the field he's interested in, me texting him during lunch/what I'm getting from the hospital cafeteria, me telling him I'm done with school waiting for the bus or I'm home, him finally replying and saying good job or he's going to the gym/happy hour with his labmates/tennis/volleyball/softball/he's home etc (4pm), us having shallow small talks like sending pics of my dishes for dinner/pictures of my cats/he sends me a pic of his dinner, and finally us saying goodnight. I feel like we're missing substance in our conversations these days.

I asked for more study dates and told him how I just want to be on Zoom together on mute and he can do his own thing in lab, but 9/10 times, he tells me ""we'll see"" and we end up not getting on Zoom because he misses my texts while in lab. Also to clarify, when he's in lab, he's not actually doing wet lab right now and he's just analyzing data on his computer, writing research proposal, making powerpoints, meeting deadlines etc.

I discussed with him about our lack of communication and offered him an Apple Watch multiple times, but he tells him he doesn't want to be connected and doesn't want notifications. I've also tried pitching an Apple Watch in the form of a fitness watch since he's such a gym bro, but he still doesn't want one. I also mentioned that he can turn on focus mode so only people in his contacts favorite list can go through, but also veto'ed. I'm honestly out of ideas at this point.

On the rare occasions that we do speak on the phone, I feel like he's always distracted by work and is not present in our phone calls. I voiced my opinions on wanting him to be present during our calls, but he continues to either read journals or watch youtube during our phone calls. I really like telling him about my day but he doesn't really seem to care about it. To engage him more in our conversation, I tried asking about his day and what he's doing in lab, but he respond with ""oh you know, just this and that"" so I'm not really sure how to have an intellectual conversation with him.

I understand he's busy with lab, but I'm also busy. I'm a full time grad student and working two jobs at two different hospitals. No matter how tired I am, I still put in effort in our relationship. What pains me most is that he goes out for softballs every Monday, volleyball every Thursday, and happy hour every Friday with people in his lab, throw in tennis and gym in between. He also goes out with his med school friends and/or labmates to lunches and dinners.

For example, today he drove 1.5hrs just to go hiking with people from his lab. He messaged me around 630am to say good morning, as usual, I text him throughout the day, and he didn't message me back until 5pm saying he's back from hiking. Didn't respond to any of the messages I sent, not sure if he even read them tbh, but I just let it go since he does have a tendency to not respond to what I talk to him about. He told me before that he only reads the last thing I send him which is usually me saying I'm home from school or work. But throughout the day, I like to tell him whenever something exciting happens such as meeting cool professors or coming across an interesting podcast/journal. Going back to today, he then texted me again at 7pm saying he was done with dinner, I honestly didn't even know he went out to dinner with his lab mates. He also messaged me telling him he's home. I've been giving him the cold shoulder since and only asked if it was him that drove since last night, he told me he hopes he doesn't have to drive today. When he said he did drive, I'm like oh okay he must be tired I guess. He then said ""date night tomorrow babe"" but I just said nah and he said ""oooh babe"" Honestly I was hoping he would call me to talk instead since I've been feeling down the whole day and contemplated about writing this post since last night. I understand that he's not a mind reader and that he drove 1.5 hours today, but that's just my wishful thinking I guess.

The reason why I asked if he drove today was mainly because I really wanted to call him, but I was scared of going to his voicemail again. A couple weeks ago, he went to a kbbq with his lab buddies until way past midnight his time, at that point, I haven't heard from him for hours. When I called him, apparently he was driving with his friends in the car, he purposely ignored my call in front of his friends and let me go to voicemail. He told his friends that he knew he was in trouble for not responding to my messages and that they don't deserve to listen to me complain. He even jokingly told his friends what I'm going to say which was ""where have you been;kbbq"" ""who you with; blah and blah"" then I'll go ""oh okay byebye drive safely"" (which was exactly what I said when he called back, I wasn't even angry and was just concerned that it was way past midnight and he wasn't home or in lab) I just felt so embarrassed after finding out he purposely let me go to voicemail and he said ""you guys don't deserve this"" to his friends in the car. It felt so degrading and almost as if he was building a bad rep for me with his lab mates. It makes me feel like he's embarrassed of me or something. I have never met his lab mates before, the last time I went to visit him, we didn't get to go to happy hour because he had some lab work to do so I missed the chance to meet the people he's close with.

I don't need any grand gestures to feel loved, I really just want the small things like sending me a message here and there, seeing a cute post I would like and sending it to me (which are things he used to do). For our anniversary, I told him I want a handwritten card and months have past, but haven't received it yet. For my birthday, the night before, I asked if he can order me an acai bowl for lunch and I'll go pick it up. I sent him the link, specific toppings, and the time I want to pick it up which was 12pm. On the day of my birthday at 12pm I called him multiple times to check if he ordered it but went to voicemail once again. He did text me after missing my call that he was at lunch with a friend and he'll order it in 30 minutes. 30 minutes went by, I was starving at that point, so I called again, and yep, went to voicemail again. I ended up just cooking lunch at home at 1pm. Replies at 130pm saying he's back at school and that he'll order it now. (bday was on a weekend btw) At this point, I was so over it and told him I don't need him to get it for me anymore but he insisted. I'm not going to say no to an acai bowl. He didn't order it until 2pm and I ended up eating it 2 days later since I was too full from lunch.

I just don't understand why he's able to put time into building relationships with other people but when it comes to our relationship, I just don't see the effort and time. Part of me wonders if it's because we've been together for a while and he just thinks I'll be here forever.

He tells me things like ""you know you're my favorite"" or ""you know you're my special girl"" and deep down, I really do know. I know deep down that he loves me, but I just don't feel loved anymore. I just feel like I'm left on the backburner and whenever he's not doing the million other things he does, then he checks in on me.

I feel so lonely in this relationship and sometimes I wonder if I'm asking for too much or if it's that hard to love me. I don't know why I'm so sad and in so much pain when I'm the one that's planning to break up. I still love him so much, but I deserve better. I'm just scared to break up with him because I really thought he was my forever and we've been together for 6 years now.

I’ve been divorced for almost 4 years, and her 7.  We’ve both dated a lot and believe we have found our person in each other.  I know it’s early, but all signs are good.  I’m crazy about her.  

Whenever I start dating someone I have slight trust issues in the beginning.  Something I’ve worked on a lot and gotten better in each relationship.  But I’m a good communicator so that’s a plus I think. 

When we started dating my ex GF reached out a few times and so I decided to block her just out of respect for my new relationship and to avoid any possible drama.  I would not have been tempted by her or acted in appropriate with her, but just didn’t see any reason she still needed to be in my life.  

My current GF rarely has any guys reach out to her which I’m grateful for.  I’ve told her I trust her and she can talk to who she wants. We both trust the each other won’t flirt or act in appropriate with the opposite sex.  

However her most recent ex (36M) bothers me.  He reached out to her for the first time since we started dating a couple weeks ago and wanted to “catch up.”  She turned him down and didn’t show interest in his attention. He broke her heart earlier this year. He has proven to her in the past that he doesn’t respect boundaries (more on that later).  He still wanted to meet up even after she told that she was in a new relationship and happy. But she declined again and he hasn’t texted again.

I would like her to just block him. She thinks blocking is childish.  She says she can easily be mean if necessary. And will block if he continues to text or act disrespectful after she warns him.  I don’t understand why he deserves a place in her phone at all.  I don’t understand why she doesn’t just block him.  

I’ve brought it up a number of times and it bothers her.  I told her earlier this week that she knows how I feel, but that I will just let it go. Because we have both made our case and can’t agree.  She had pointed out that she didn’t ask me to block my ex GF and that I did that on my own accord, which is true.

This has been our only disagreeing point so far. I should also say that she promised him that she wouldn’t block him without telling him.  But this still bothers me because who is he to her?  Why does she owe him a promise?  But she says it’s about her own integrity.  I can understand that, but I still don’t like it.  I feel life she’s choosing her promise to him over my security in our relationship.  

Honestly it bothered me a lot at times, but the last few days I’ve just thought “meh.”  However, knowing me it will flare up again, but I won’t be able to say anything because I’ve told her I will let it go.  The one resolution we made is that if we get engaged we will go through our phones and delete old contacts of the opposite sex. And block him.  She said she will send him a simple text saying she’s blocking him and then do it. But again, I’d just prefer she never talk to him.  I know that I sound incredibly insecure, but I’m just being honest in how I feel.

There is one more side note that may affect this.  She had major strong feelings for this guy and and had a situation-ship with him for 2 years.  When he wouldn’t commit she decided to go a new direction and started dating another guy (47M).  They became boyfriend and girlfriend.  This was about a year ago.  She didn’t have strong feelings for the new BF, but decided she would try. 

Pretty early on the 36 year old long term guy got her to meet up and she cheated on the new BF.  It became an ongoing thing.  She was still in love with him. She never told the new BF about this guy.  After three months she broke it off with him and went back to the 36 year old full time.  She thought they had a chance to be official this time.  But it didn’t happen and she found out he had another GF.  This ripped her heart out, but she felt she deserved it. She cried for over a month. BuT he still had a hold on her for some time. She finally quit talking to him and felt healed and then met me a few months later.  She was honest about everything with me. 

She does really great to help me feel

I emptied the house of all alcohol (poured it all down the drain), and it's a promise to myself I plan to keep. I'm willing to admit I clearly cannot handle alcohol responsibly and so this is the best decision.

I (29M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (25F) of 4 years. We share an apartment together, and our relationship has always been great, and I am totally in love with her. For the most part we have rarely ever had any issues throughout the 4 years, however we have had lack of sexual intimacy issues in recent months, primarily down to her being extremely stressed with work, college and family issues. Aside from that, she is someone I planned to marry and share a life with, without question.

Unfortunately, 4 weeks ago I did something incredibly stupid which was finally brought to light today by one of her friends who told her what she saw.

Me and my girlfriend were attending a music festival event (we go to a few each year as we love the same music), but because of bad weather, entrance to the festival was delayed. We were drinking alcohol before entering the festival and becoming increasingly drunk, but I was still coherent. Since I don't drink all that often, I don't fully know my tolerances, but I likely over-consumed too quickly.

After entering the music festival, we bumped into one of my girlfriends close friends, although they hadn't seen each other for quite some time. I greeted her friend as I normally would, and then we all went our separate ways. Fast forward about an hour later, one of my girlfriends other friends we were with offered me marijuana - something I almost never consume. I obliged, and I was now quite drunk, and also under the influence of marijuana. For the next 3-4 hours, I have absolutely 0 recollection of what happened that night and was apparently mostly incoherent.

Today I found out that I had bumped into her friend we first saw at the start of the night whilst I was temporarily away from my girlfriend, and I proceeded to compliment her inappropriately and asked to kiss her (she declined).  Apparently after asking and her declining, I was showing instant regret, but ultimately I asked the question and did what I did.

My girlfriend today said she doesn't feel she can trust me again (despite us never before having trust issues) and proceeded to say that we should end the relationship, and instead remain ""friends"" in the apartment until our lease expires in March 2023. We have a 2 bedroom apartment, and she asked me to sleep in the other bedroom from now on.

I have absolutely no recollection of that night, but more importantly, I am so incredibly confused as to why I would have done it in the first place - even whilst drunk. I have tried to talk this through with my girlfriend, but I can't offer her any answers as I simply don't remember what happened, and it's incredibly frustrating. I told her that I would never consume alcohol again and take steps to figure out what got me to that place, but I think this might be the end for good.

I hope I can get some semblance of advice here. My (28F) bf (29M) and I have been dating for just under two years now. To be honest, our relationship has been amazing. He is genuinely the sweetest man I’ve ever met. He’s always shown me affection and grace, done his part to keep our house running, and has even helped me out of very big holes I’ve fallen in. I have never met anyone like him. However, there’s something he has recently started doing that has made me question everything. I am an emotional person. However, I am very straightforward with my feelings and have always encouraged him to share his. I don’t judge and have been fully accepting of when he feels angry or stressed. I just prefer to talk things out in a mature way. However, lately he hasn’t been responding like he used to, and it’s always when I’m being vulnerable about my feelings. Before you ask, I am very calm and non-confrontational. I never approach topics playing the blame game. So I never attack him for anything, even if he is to blame. For example, the other day I broke down exhausted because life has been really kicking my ass lately. I told him that I just feel tired and am frustrated with all these external things that have happened. Out of the blue I see him roll his eyes and with a huff he says “well I don’t know why you’re focusing on the bad stuff.” I’m caught off guard because that isn’t like him. He’s usually very kind and understanding. So I respond “ouch. You didn’t have to get annoyed, I was just sharing my feelings.” Then he does a 180 and suddenly starts saying “I wasn’t annoyed” when I call bs it turns into “I didn’t roll my eyes. I didn’t say that. Okay I said that but didn’t mean it that way. No I didn’t say it like that.” Meanwhile I’m having whiplash because I feel like he’s lying for no reason. He could’ve said “you’re right, I’m sorry.” And it’d be done. So why the hell is he lying and making me feel crazy? Thus it devolves into a fight where I’m calling out his lies and he makes up new ones until I’m stressed the fuck out and he says, surprise, “okay you’re right. I did do those things because I’m also stressing and spoke out of frustration.” LIKE IT WAS THE EASIEST THING TO SAY! Look, I’m pretty laid back. But this has happened 5 times now and I’m done with it. I told him I don’t appreciate being gaslit for 30 minutes when he could’ve just been honest but he then says he isn’t gaslighting me and he doesn’t know why he lied. WTF? I’ve tried asking how I can help prevent it, what we could do together, etc… but at this point I’m out of ideas. I broke up with him the last time he did it because if he could lie to my face about things I just witnessed, what else could he lie about? He begged and cried and offered to go to therapy so I took him back. But tonight, it happened again and I walked away from him while he sobbed and apologized. Honestly it’s an amazing relationship outside of this so I’m just confused. I’m starting to wonder if I am an asshole for breaking up when it’s likely a response from his childhood. But I can’t just let him lie to me and make me feel crazy whenever he’s stressed!

I know some people are okay with that, but for me personally it makes me feel insecure and feels like a micro-form of cheating. We agreed that we could make home videos of the two of us to replace the need for him to watch porn when I am not around and he feels the need to jerk off. However, the other day I was going to look something up on my phone but my phone was dead so I asked him if I could search on his phone. He agreed but when I opened safari pornhub was open as one of the tabs on his phone. I was shocked and just searched my initial question into Google and returned his phone back to him. I wanted to confront him about it but he always gets very defensive as I’ve caught him doing this in the past. He also has recently started making comments about being willing to pay for me to get a boob job if I wanted it (I sometimes complain of my smaller chest) and I’m not sure if this is related to the porn, or if he really just wants to help with my insecurity. I’m not sure what I should do. I did ask him causally if he ever goes on pornhub and he said he does not and he says he doesn’t even jerk off anymore. He lied to my face and I just need some advice of what I should do. Do I ignore it and let it be? Considering all other aspects of our relationship are amazing?

I would say we've become pretty good friends through work. We also are in some of the same social circles, so we were both at the same Halloween party over the weekend.

When he saw me walk through the door at the party, he came up to me and we were talking for about 10 minutes until a girl and her friend came up to him and stole the conversation. Naturally, I walked away and found other people to talk to (including my friends and other guys). My crush ended up talking to her the whole time, and when I left the party, I saw her give him a hug as she was leaving.

Today at work, he said ""I want to tell you something, but I'm not going to."" After convincing him to tell me what it was, he said ""One of the girls I talked to at the party was really pretty."" I asked him who it was, and he said he didn't remember her name, but that he thought both her and her friend were really pretty.

Even though I was sad and slightly jealous, I told him to go for it, and he said no. Why would he even put this out if he had no intention of going for it? Maybe this is me making up things in my head, but was he possibly trying to get a reaction out of me, or does he just see me as a good enough friend that he would tell this to?
