He has asked me to go with him and if I said yes he would be committed to going but i know for a fact that I won't go, and he knows this.

I hate bringing it up as I don't want to guilt trip him into not going. But I  want to know if he is going or not as I feel like I'd rather nip the relationship in the bud now than stay together longer making it harder if he leaves.

Title. We’ve been together almost a year and I just started getting suspicious of stuff like how he sometimes calls her his girlfriend instead of his ex girlfriend and keeps pictures of her on his homescreen. He’s sworn that he doesn’t have feelings for her and doesn’t even really think about her anymore but I still felt like something was off.

So today I did a really bad, very bad, super bad thing and looked through his phone. It turns out they were sending each other pretty sexually explicit texts about things they wanted to do together in the summer (we go to college together but we’re from different places so I didn’t see him for the summer holidays). This was when we had already been “officially” dating for about a month. I don’t know if they actually did the things they were talking about or not but I think it’s still pretty upsetting even if they didn’t. 

Of course I feel terrible about looking through his texts and I know it was wrong. I also feel really stupid for not realising sooner that something was up. 

I really love him and he says he loves me. I don’t know how bad this is or how I should react and my friends have had mixed responses.

Lately my partner has been obsessed with improving his health even though he is already very healthy and exercises and eats right. It is almost exclusively what he talks about. I am very proud of him and what he is doing (exercising more, stopping vaping, working out twice a day, eating exclusively meat and veggies) but it is really getting old how much he talks about it. All he talks about is how excited he is to workout again, how much he wants to lift next week, the benefits of not overstimulating your brain with dopamine, a new podcast he listened to about health, how he is going to try and go to minor leagues for his sport, how he hates himself for overeating occasionally (when we do enjoy a good meal together all he will talk about is how much he is going to have to fast after), how he would only be happy if he was healthier. 

I know I should be super proud of him which I am. I also am healthy and exercise nearly daily and help cook him healthy meals but I also enjoy living my life and I hate feel like I have to flagellate myself for being “lazy” or eating a good tasty meal once in a while. I also am sick of talking about how to improve health. I love a healthy life but I don’t go on and on about it either. He says he likes telling me all about his fitness goals because it makes them a reality for him and encourages him to be better. 

This is a new change for him, for him to be so obsessed. We used to talk about deep things together like meaning of life and movies and fun things we observe in the world but recently it’s all been about fitness and when I bring up another topic not related to fitness he seems disinterested. 

Also I am concerned as he has a new appreciation for yoga and stretching. He recently hurt his hip and has been stretching to help but now it has progressed to yoga. His ex was really into yoga and it kind of freaks me out.

He just thought he was unlovable and hated being in selfies and taking pictures. Even today like he’s got some ptsd and gets uncomfortable taking pictures. It took a lot of work for him to get to where he is with meds, lots of exercise and a killer drive. I could tell he teared up a little talking about it. 
 
He told me he’s over it and yeah those moments of growing up ugly and the trauma do leave scars behind but he’s all good now but I can see it in his eyes he’s not, he’s lying so wouldn’t worry. 

I used to take compliments for granted but didn’t realize how the guy I love so much, lived completely differently.

While the first month or two was the usual irregular periods for her the acne was slowly drying up and fading away but her personality was going lower at the same rate. 

We of course were very excited at the fact we can both enjoy sex with a little more protection that we wouldn’t be producing another versions of ourselves, but as the months gone on her usual very high sex drive lowered as her acne got better. 

Three months after starting it she pulled me over to have a “serious talk”, long story short she just said her feelings for me have faded to the love of a friend instead of a lover. While we both agreed that we would do things to rekindle the spirit we had at the start fast forwarding to the present we seemingly have broke. up for good on the same reason.

We had a short two week break from eachother because she wanted to have time to think about herself and our relationship, mind you, both our families love each other same with friends and that everyone expects us to be married quite early. After this break the talk we had was more or less the same as the first one, in that she had “no romantic love” for me anymore but doesn’t want to lose me entirely because of how much she still loves me, which just makes me insanely confused.

I brought up that the main reason for her change of personality would be the pills, but since her acne was very traumatic for her she is very closed off on stopping them. As well as not looking to change her treatment to a different brand, iud, etc. 

She stated that I did nothing wrong in our whole relationship and everything that she’s feeling is solely on herself. 

I just don’t know what to do, i’ve offered to help her find other ways to help with acne but she doesn’t want to further mix her hormones with other things as she is scared as what it would do to her.

IMPORTANT: When I’ve brought boundaries up in the past, this person has stated it’s because he’s autistic and mentally ill that he struggles to understand the boundaries — even when I’ve clearly and explicitly told him to stop, no, or I don’t want to. I am not sure if I am lacking in communication, despite being blunt, or if this is just a lack of respect. I cannot take or handle being responsible for someone else’s meltdowns, though, when I don’t do what they want/draw boundaries. 

So, this one is a lot. I(F23) am having trouble with a friend(M25) who is mentally ill and autistic. At first, these were isolated incidents but in the past month, I have been made to feel continually uncomfortable. 

To start, this person does not respect my relationship. This has been made clear several times this past week. I had wisdom tooth surgery last week, I have a bruised jaw. I am not vibing. He went out of his way to put down my partner for not being here with me. (To clarify, we are long distance. My partner can’t just fly out whenever they want, AND the surgery was minor. They’re getting ready to spend the holiday with their family, too, and all I have been doing is icing my face and sleeping. I didn’t want them to fly out here, and I didn’t ask them too. I have been very forward about the situation.)

This eventually led to me feeling physically uncomfortable with this person. He had spam texted me and he kept offering to “come over with a milkshake and give cuddles” which I shut down immediately. We are NOT that kind of friends and never will be. (Maybe the offer was innocent, but it didn’t feel innocent or sit right with me.) He continued to harass me about hanging out so I wasn’t alone. I declined again and I stopped responding to the messages. 

So, then we get to the weekend. I bought the new Pokémon game, it’s something easy and fun to do during my recovery period. He calls. (I shouldn’t have answered but I did. My friends like to party, I have been called several times for emergencies or to be a DD. It’s habit, EVEN if they make me uncomfortable.) We chat a bit and he starts putting me down for playing something “childish” and that I could “be doing more to exercise my brain” and then tries to get me to stop playing the game. I didn’t budge and stated he did not get to dictate what I was doing, that if it bothered him we could end the call.  

He didn’t like that answer, got mad. Then changed the subject. He started in on about Thanksgiving. (Another note, I don’t celebrate the holidays, which he knows. I spend them with my dogs. I’m happy spending the holidays with my dogs. Sometimes my partner and I can coordinate to do something together over the holidays, but my partner travels to see their family and I am happy for them/love hearing about it.) 

Without even asking me, he TELLS me I’m coming over to his family’s thanksgiving dinner. I try to decline. He doesn’t accept it, puts me on speaker phone, and then asks his fucking mom if it’s okay if i come over to their family dinner. The only response I could think to give her was that I wasn’t sure if I could because I have stitches in my mouth. Dude full on dismisses that, says I should be fine enough to come over and eat because HIS pain tolerance is high and puts me down for being in pain. (The surgery I had was minor in the sense of procedure but the reason I had my wisdom teeth out was due to an infection AND they had to chisel two impacted teeth out. I hurt and have nasty bruising on my face. I’m still eating soft food because I can’t open my mouth wide enough or chew things.) I stated again, I don’t want to come over. He started having a meltdown because he “doesn’t like anyone else like he likes me” and threatens to self destruct.

I (22f) and my boyfriend(23m) are 6 weeks and 4 days pregnant. We just had a talk with his parents and they think having the child is the dumbest decision we could ever make. They said it'll ruin our relationship, it will destroy our dreams, it will really take away ourselves. They also said we are definitely not ready and we need to consider abortion. Now, I want to explain our living situation to give a better light as to why they feel this way.
1. I have a stable job and I'm in school, while my boyfriend has a job of his dreams but doesnt have a consistent salary and has to pay taxes
2. We live with his brothers, who aren't comfortable with me living here. We already planned to move out regardless and are looking now
3. I have Thyroid disease. The worst situation is that it could kill me. However this haven't been confirmed, but my heart rate is so high with just sitting (99bpm) and my red blood cell count is far too high which is abnormal. 
4. We haven't discovered ourselves fully yet. This is what his parents believe. We need to become full adults and have a career that pays to have one. I can't really understand that part. What is being a full adult? You guys can answer this too.

So we left and had a serious conversation. We are in GA, so we really need to consider this quickly before it become illegal. But, we still want it but also feel it may be best to terminate.

We haven't been dating that long only 7 months and I'm just not sure if I still want to be with her or not. She amazing and a joy to be around. Only real negative thing I can say about her is that she's a little timid, which isn't really that bad of a thing cause I can be timid too.

We're both in the Army and we used to both work the same shift so we could spend lots of time hanging out with each other after work and such. She got moved to night about a month ago so we don't have as much time to hang out and it's given me a lot more time to spend with myself and just reflect one myself. I still love her and my love language is physically touch so I still want to hug her and cuddle with her all the time, it's just I don't really find myself actually wanting to spend time as much anymore with her and don't really get the same joy I used to and it's kinda making me feel bad and guilty. But I'm not sure if it's just mutual or not with her cause she has also started reaching out less to me too about spending time with each other. 

I am about to move back to the states in 2 months and she doesn't get back for about another 8 months after that. I'm not sure if I actually do want to end things or not but I don't want to wait till last minute or when I'm back in the states to end things because I don't want her to feel she was just being used by me. 

I'm going to be stationed in Texas which is home for me. I want get out of the Army and continue school (that was the reason I joined) and if I was single I would want to start my career there. She is trying to get stationed with me and wanted to stay in the Army, which is totally fine with me I would compromise and travel the world with her but I would definitely hurt me some in my career changing jobs every 2-3 years.

It's weird to think that we started dating when we were 13 and 14 but we've been through some shit together that has made our relationship stronger. His parents getting divorced, my mental health struggles, personal friendship breakups, going to college (we go to different colleges but are still in the same area. He goes to community college and I am going to a university), etc.

Again, we have literally grown up together and have this amazing sense of comfortability with each other that I don't have with anyone else. I'm an only child with a single mother. I don't have any siblings and I'm not close with my extended family. I hold my friends near and dear to my heart because I see them more as my family. My boyfriend is MY person. I tell him everything. He knows me better than anyone else on this earth. He is my best friend.

Just over a year ago I started therapy for my personal journey. I love every aspect of it and I believe it's made me a better person and gain a new perspective on life. My therapist is also another person in my life I can tell anything to besides my bf. I believe my boyfriend needs therapy. However, he can't afford health insurance which is why he chooses not to go to therapy despite how much I try to push him. But recently I've noticed a lot of things I haven't noticed before.

My bf and I share the same friend group and in our group my bf can come off as arrogant. I asked him why some of our friends would call me confident but never call me arrogant, but they would flat our call him arrogant. He sorta chalked it up to there needs to be an asshole in the group of friends therefore he is the asshole of our group??? idrk, he said he would work on how he acts in our group but we'll see. Additionally, when we get into serious fights I feel like I have to thin 5 steps ahead of him to even get my point across. My bf is so much smarter than me and always just knows what to say. And when he says something to disprove my point I have to have something locked and loaded to counter it. Some of our conversations feel more like a debate class than an actual conversation. Sometimes our serious conversations are like mind-games and I absolutely hate it. I feel like I'm being manipulated in an indirect way. I know he isn't manipulating me on purpose but that's what it feels like sometimes.

After quarantine and the pandemic his study routine (or any routine in general) has gone out the window. He is so incredibly smart (33 on the ACT, and will pass any test without studying) he could literally do anything his put his mind to if he actually applied himself. Right now my bf doesn't really have a plan for his career at all, which is totally fine with me. I very much understand some people may need more time to figure out what they want in life and I 100% support him and I've told him this. But he's currently failing all of his classes at community college. If he can't pass his classes this semester he won't be able to transfer to the university he wants. It's not that he can't do the work (it's literally community college) but he can't bring himself to just sit down and do his homework.

Truthfully, I feel like my bf doesn't care about a lot of things, things that are internal and external to our relationship. He doesn't really have a drive or passion to do anything and if I'm going to be honest, I am tired of it all. I have told so many times, I support him with whatever he wants to do but it's very hard to support him when he doesn't have anything he really wants to do. I believe relationships should be 50/50. Even when a relationship is 51/49 there is an unfair balance in the relationship, one person is still putting more effort into the relationship than the other person. That's how I see my relationship with my bf right now. A lot of the things I ask him to do, he won't do unless I sit down with him and we do it together. One example of that is looking for a place to live together.

We don't live together yet and chose to live apart for almost another 2 years so we can continue to grow as adults and as people. But his living expectation for what he can afford is a bit outrageous for where we are living. I told him he should find places that are up to his expectations, I find places that are up to my expectations and then we can come together and discuss our options. But he says he won't look unless we look together.

I am very mentally exhausted trying to support and help my boyfriend while also supporting myself as a person.

There are plenty other examples in our relations that reflect the one-sidedness of things, but this is just the surface. I love my boyfriend so much. I truly see us getting married and living our lives TOGETHER. But I don't want to be with him if he can't be self-sufficient or provide the same amount of support I provide for him.

We are currently on a 3-week vacation with his immediate family so I didn't want to bring anything up before we left. But once we go back home I think I'm going to take a break for a bit. But I don't know if I should propose the idea of seeing other people during this break? I haven't really had another SO other than my currently bf. If I'm going to be honest, it would be sorta nice to meet other people and see how they treat me in a relationship since I don't really know otherwise.

Again, I love my boyfriend SO much but I feel like I need some time to grow myself as a person if I want to continue this relationship. There's plenty of other aspects about our relationship I haven't mentioned (if we break up what happens with our friend group? I'm super close with his family, do I cut off his family? How do we split the big things we've paid for together? etc) I'm just at a cross roads right now and I need some advice.

For context, my gf and I have been together for a few months now. Everything is great, we have a lot of fun together and I love her very much. However, one thing has been constantly bugging me is our major difference in spending habit/financial goals.

My GF loves to go out. For her that means lunch and dinner at places that may cost us anywhere from $20-$50/person and some form of activity in between. It puts a strain on my wallet which at times, I had to request for her to pay first.

Money has always been an area I’ve been very cautious about. I take a small allowance from my parents and do part-time while I’m studying to earn whatever remaining I need for the month.

My gf, on the other-hand, does not need to work part-time. Expensive purchases she would like to make she asks her parents to pay. She also doesn’t get a fixed allowance and can request for more should she need it. It doesn’t help that her friends are also relatively well to do and they can spend time shopping and eating expensive food together. On top of all of this, she has a side business which earns her a nice amount every month.

I have tried talking to her about this difference before but she never seems to fully understand my level of anxiety and told me that she doesn’t mind keeping a tab on my expenditure for me to pay when I can. Whenever I make a comment about the price of items, especially food, she would show visible frustration saying things like “Why you got to worry about the price so much” “How can you go out and expect not to spend money” 

How do I talk to her about this or put it in a way she would hopefully understand me?

Lately my partner has been obsessed with improving his health even though he is already very healthy and exercises and eats right. It is almost exclusively what he talks about. I am very proud of him and what he is doing (exercising more, stopping vaping, working out twice a day, eating exclusively meat and veggies) but it is really getting old how much he talks about it. All he talks about is how excited he is to workout again, how much he wants to lift next week, the benefits of not overstimulating your brain with dopamine, a new podcast he listened to about health, how he is going to try and go to minor leagues for his sport, how he hates himself for overeating occasionally (when we do enjoy a good meal together all he will talk about is how much he is going to have to fast after), how he would only be happy if he was healthier. 

I know I should be super proud of him which I am. I also am healthy and exercise nearly daily and help cook him healthy meals but I also enjoy living my life and I hate feel like I have to flagellate myself for being “lazy” or eating a good tasty meal once in a while. I also am sick of talking about how to improve health. I love a healthy life but I don’t go on and on about it either. He says he likes telling me all about his fitness goals because it makes them a reality for him and encourages him to be better. 

This is a new change for him, for him to be so obsessed. We used to talk about deep things together like meaning of life and movies and fun things we observe in the world but recently it’s all been about fitness and when I bring up another topic not related to fitness he seems disinterested.

I need some advice if I should continue this relationship. I realised that our relationship was very boring as we share zero common interests (he likes to play volleyball, gym, starwars, batman etc.)(I like anime, reading science fiction novels, non-fictions books, fashion etc.), and his replies to me sharing something is: oooo cute/ yeaaa/ that's great/thanks for sharing!

Nowadays, our convos are: ""Goodmorning, All the best for studying, Have u had lunch, Goodnight"" (Rinse n repeat daily)

I will also share some incidents that happened, which made me hesitant about staying with him long-term.

1)  He was upset that I did not ask about why he dislike his friend, but did not tell me he was upset, so I only found out when I woke up to his profile picture missing in our chat. He ignored me until afternoon, to explain that he had a bad habit of expecting ppl to ""mindread"" or read the nuances in his texts?? Anyways, he said sorry &amp; we resolved it by saying, if he is feeling upset, to tell me directly with words, because I cannot read minds. It raised a small red flag to me, but I chose to give him a 2nd chance.
	
2) My friend introduced me to an exhibition, and I was interested, so I made plans to go visit it. I shared with him about it, and my plans to go. He assumed that he was going with me, but I was not inviting him to come with me. But, I did ask afterwards if he was free to come, and he was not. He then texted me saying that he was going on a walk. He refused to call or talk to me, and dismissed me by saying that he was not upset. After his walk, he said over text that he felt upset that I do not really care about him, and I do not reciprocate his efforts?? I felt that the whole situation escalated so quickly, from me planning to go exhibition alone --&gt; I don't really care about him. In the end, I just apologised for his hurt feelings and said I will do more on my end. 

3) He forgot my birthday because he stressed from school, but on my birthday, he went to support his friend's performance. He made it up to me by treating me to lunch in school, a coffee drink from Starbucks &amp; a slice of fruit cake (btw, i hate fruit cake). But, i still ate it to be polite, and not ungrateful. I did not receive the pencil case he told me he was gonna buy for me, he forgot to buy cos he was busy with school. 

Am I 'justified' to say that we are incompatible long-term? I feel like I am pandering to him in this relationship, while I get nothing out of it.

The person I'm writing to is one of my dorm suitemates. I feel very attached to them maybe because I've never had *any* good friends before college. I got into college and all of a sudden, my 3 roommates became my best friends. I feel like with them, I don't need anything else and enjoy being with them for everything. I truly feel like they have transformed my life. I wrote this message at 2am to apologize after I believe I partially overexaggerated something (I treated them like shit in the game and took it way too far, then my friend kind of pinned me down until I said sorry, etc, I don't think he is to blame though, seriously).   
I think I partially sent this because he is leaving away for Thanksgiving Break to Korea, and I did not want to feel like this all break. Thanks for reading, even if only a small part. I'm not sure why I am posting this, I just feel very emotional right now.

&amp;#x200B;

***Text to Friend:***

 Hey \[best friend\], I just want to say I’m sorry for exaggerating (and this long message — only read this when you have a long time or are bored). I honestly got pretty carried away and was already quite toxic when \[other best friend (#2)\] died. I kind of just felt like I had power and some type of advantage over this game and liked the power too much to the point of carelessly saying comments that would make you and \[other, other best friend (#3)\] feel inferior. I definitely do not think neither is inferior to me — its actually the opposite — Minecraft survival is probably one of the only things I will ever be better at than you guys.

I also wish I did not make a big scene — I think that I just instinctively feel triggered or something after I get pinned by you/\[best friend #2\]even though I cause it. It kind of just makes be feel weak or almost embarrassed; then it leads to me feeling a bit bothered or unable to let it go, like today. I didn’t let you to go to sleep because I felt like I wanted some type of dignity back by forcing you to say sorry, which I guess at that moment wasn’t enough internally for me— it is now. Then I said I wanted to punch you because I felt like only then I could somehow feel regain some dignity, but I can’t bring myself to do that to you or \[best friend #2\]. Honestly, thinking about it, punching you would have made be feel better, but that obviously is not the right decision.

More generally, you are a really good friend — actually, you are the best friend I’ve ever had — I will be more transparent and good and am completely open to anything you think I should change .

The reason I would not be able to punch you or one of you guys is because by doing so, I feel like I would probably lose the most important thing in my life right now— our friendship. Honestly, these last two years with you guys has been by FAR, the best two years of my entire life in every way.

I’ve never said this towards anyone besides my family, but I truly love you guys as friends or brothers. I wanted to say that to you all during our dinner, but didn’t want you all to feel like you should feel the same way. I honestly dread graduation, not because I’m scared of what’s coming next, rather because I am afraid of not being with you guys. I know that everyone makes new friends, but I will never make as good of friends than with you. I planned on telling you all today; I am willing to live in any place (\[names of dorms I said I would not live in, and would even leave them to live somewhere else or with someone else\]) next near, because you all’s friendship is truly more important than any commodity that some extra money can bring me.

Finally, forgive what I said last — “go to Korea”. I said this out of not wanting to be honest with myself, but with all honesty, I’ll miss you all so much. I really hope you have a good break from everything.

(Also, please don’t respond, just let me know if you read it with a like or unlike and I’ll be happy with that)

My truth is something like … “I want to date someone who is more physically attractive/richer/smarter/better in bed/has no kids,” or something equally shallow.  Not proud of it, but it’s shallow indeed. 

The “plausible lie” might be “I’m not available for a longer term relationship because I am scared” or “I need to spend some time alone to get to know myself better” or “work requires a lot of me right now and I can’t be a good partner to anyone,” something like that. Imagine a believable “it’s me, not you” lie.

example: he gave me directions and then i reasked bc i wasnt sure and he was like “aaa if i was a different guy … guy from two years ago.. i would have yelled at u but im not”

months pass and well he kinda just stopped coming over and wanted to keep me and friends separated bc he didnt want to make the same mistake twice of how he merged friends with an ex of his and now theyre all friends and he was left with no one. ANYWAY.

when we broke up we hadnt had sex in 2 months. i was already anxious about not being included with friends. he also stopped coming over despite coming over 2-3 times weekdays.

i addressed it and he said i didnt understand how busy he was and how stressed and that is bothers him when i cry about the littlest things.

hes also punched a wall after i asked if i could go out with friends and told me to stay away as he has anger issues and didnt wanna hurt me

anyway he said when we broke up that he tells me things and its in my nature that i repeat myself and it bothers him a lot. absolutely no one has ever told me this is a problem of mine lol.

basically asking for reassurance.

when i asked for him to come over etc he would say i didn’t understand and that he was busy and stressed and suicidal and depressed.. hates himself etc.. he said he didnt come over anymore bc he feels he wasted time w me when he could have been working so idk he also said he didnt wanna lose me in a relationship so he rather keep me as a friend… which i am not doing. i cant wait until he leaves school and i have no idea if hes gonna keep reaching out or not i only reached out today bc i needed this file of his and even called him by his real name and he pointed it out i said thanks and killed the conversation

this is whats been happening between us as in back and fourth…

i dont know if this is just weird or we are not compatible.
im pretty kind and sweet and love loving people. i would pick him up from school, the airport, take him for groceries and loved picking him up as i wanted him to be safe and come over. 

when he would come over things were great but it just stopped. dunno. 

he helped me a lot in school but thats about it.


also very random but the last time we had sex he went soft inside me and then after that we didnt have sex for 2 months and i was so sad

also sometimes even in the beginning of the relationship he would say that i didnt know shit about architecture and i would ask why he says those things and he said it builds character.

sometimes he would be super supportive and sweet and since im sensitive he would be there im just so confused.

he also did cancel his internship appointment to come to my graduation which was nice but yeah.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7612460,public,self,was my ex a red flag… 🚩,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1of2d/was_my_ex_a_red_flag/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I have been saving like hell for this for years and still am nowhere even close to where we need to be. My partner has no savings at all, and he recently informed me he doesn't intend to save for our future mortgage. He is due to receive an inheritance soon that he believes will fully cover his contribution, and therefore feels he shouldn't have to save anything as his part will be paid by this.


I do see where he's coming from, but I also think this is really unfair and I'm not sure how to have this conversation with him in a constructive way. There's two parts to it for me. The first, I earn less and we currently pay equal, so it will take me longer to save. While I'm saving my (very limited) extra money my partner will be spending his on hobbies. He may also need me to take money out of that savings to bail him out with things like fuel or food as this has happened before, (he's not great with money for a few reasons). I could go into more detail here but I feel like this part is fairly self explanatory.

The second, and this is the one I really don't feel I can talk to him about, is that frankly it just doesn't FEEL fair that I'm having to work my ass off for our future home and he's effectively had it handed to him. He would have more rights to the property due to a bigger financial contribution, but I'd be the only one who actually worked for it. To be blunt about it, I don't feel like he would have earned it and I'm worried this will cause some resentment to build up on my part. I'm not expecting him to save as much as me or turn down the inheritance or anything like that, I just feel like he should be putting a little effort into this. I feel like he should want to save, and if not for a house then okay why not save for a holiday while I'm saving for a house? Save for new furniture? Do SOMETHING??

She and one of my close coworkers got into an argument over something over a month ago and she was mad, saying how i shouldn't be friends with them (she was right) and how she didn't wanna talk to me anymore but she said she wasn't sure when she said that, it was in the heat of the moment. 2 days after that we talked a little bit and she was dry and i fell asleep and i forgot to say goodnight and she told me how she didn't like me falling alseep without saying anything but for me it's kinda hard to do, i texted her goodmorning the next day and I didn't get a response so i knew she needed space so i texted her goodnight when the time came, the next day i still didn't get nothing so i texted her like 4 times that day and no response, i don't know why i did this but i texted her again the next day saying i missed her like an fucking idiot and asked her if we were still talking and snapped saying how she asked for space multiple times and i refused to give to her and she told me to ""leave her alone fr."" i felt really shitty and i haven't texted her since. The thing is i really like her and i just want advice on what to do next. i don't know if she's coming back and if not that's fine. I never had a relationship before so this was all new to me. and I'm wondering if there is any chance she's coming back, she told me she is straightforward and blocks people that she doesn't want anything to do with anymore but she still has all more socials and she still looks at my stories on different apps.

That was the first time she broke my trust. I found out the first 8 months of our relationship were built on lies. She then lied to me a couple times for about a month later, but I was too naive with this being my first relationship to end things. I of course gave in hoping things would change and get better but if I’m writing here you can assume things did not. Fast forward to may, and we both move out and get a place together. Things were going smoothly, everything felt like a fresh start, until August, when she lied and broke my trust again. I wanted to leave right then and there but I have no way of saving up $7000+ to break my lease, nor can I afford it alone. Things were heated, I was heart broken, constantly being manipulated and gas lit into thinking this would change, and that it was my fault she lied to me. Things slowly got better until a day after her birthday. Her birthday was the 18th, and she asked me since it was her birthday if she could drink at the apartment and have a fun night. I of course said yes, she had a couple drinks and that was the end. The next day (the 19th) I came home from work exhausted and wanted to take a nap. Before I continue, we have a mutual rule of “ask before drinking” to make sure it’s okay with the other in case of plans or other scenarios. Well, while I was asleep she drank 4 seltzers without asking me our rule. Normally, I wouldn’t be too offended here, but it was crossing a boundary and breaking my trust. I woke up, ate some food, and she didn’t even seem the slightest bit drunk. I had no idea she was drunk to begin with. We then lay in bed, things get a little heated and we start to have sex (still unaware she is drunk at this point as the lights are off) and I can just tell somethings off. I put her off me and go take a shower, go out to the trash to throw away a soda to find all 4 seltzers. I came back in the room and she proceeded to tell me how “she felt as if she didn’t consent” when she started the whole ordeal. I’ve felt like shit, feeling like I did something wrong.

I (22f) and my partner (23m) have recently just moved in together (I’m talking in the last month). We have been dating for the past 4 years however always lived in different houses.  

For context; he grew up very sheltered with a mum who did everything for him and I grew up completely opposite; I was very independent from a young age (I feel like this is relevant to why I see issues in our relationship). 

Since moving in together I have realised we do things very differently around the house. It has made me get the ick. 

A few examples of things that he does (tell me if I’m being crazy) are; 
- Lack of respect when it comes to me keeping the house clean eg. Walking through the house with dirty work shoes after I have just vacuumed &amp; mopped floors
- Playing video games from the second he gets home, to the second he goes to sleep (with the exception of me making dinner - he’ll come out to eat)  
- Inviting people to our place when I’m not there &amp; forgetting to tell me about it until after - I don’t mind that he has friends over, it’s the fact that there’s no communication around it.     
- Thinking it’s my job to do all the cooking and cleaning and it’s his job to just work, come home &amp; chill (we both work full time)

And the list goes on. 

We sometimes go for days without speaking to each other because he will yell at me for being honest to him about what is upsetting me. Then we will be fine again for maybe a day until another stupid argument starts.

All this has really made me resent him for 
everything he does, I honestly come home and dread the hours we have to spend together before I go to sleep. 

I feel the ick with everything he does and it’s come to the point where I just can’t stand him. Our sex life has not been great for the past year.   

I feel like there is nothing that is making me want to stay in this relationship. I know that I would financially be okay but would have to really buckle down on a tight budget.

The thoughts of “what if” have become more frequent after he recently reached out to me. I dated my ex for 1 year, four years ago.

Four years ago I (now 25F) fell deeply in love with someone (now 29M) for the first time. Our relationship was amazing in the beginning, towards the end though no growth was occurring to advance our relationship. We got stuck in a cycle of mundane and it felt like we were more friends than bf/gf. We dated for a year. Looking back a lack of communication throughout the relationship is what led to the end. We never talked about how we were feeling when things were growing stagnant and decided to break things off because of it. But besides that we never argued once throughout the relationship and we ended things amicably. However the day we decided to part ways, was the last day we spoke to each other… until a couple of months ago.

I should backtrack a bit and say that after the break up I couldn’t help but feel we shouldn’t have broken up. I felt if we’d just recognized things get boring sometimes and worked through it, we could’ve still been together. I never reached out though because I had the mindset of “if he wanted to he would”. 

For the first couple years after our relationship I missed him dearly and thought of him every day. We remained friends on socials and admittedly, I checked on him often. I feared the day I’d see him in a new relationship, but it never happened. After some time though I slowly started thinking of him less, checking his social media less, and moved on with using  no closure as closure. I felt that I would genuinely be happy for him if he ever popped up on my feed in a new relationship. 

Although occasionally he was in the back of my mind as a “what if”... Until I started seeing someone casually about a year ago. The thoughts of my ex became few and far between as my relationship with the new guy grew. Six months ago, the new guy asked me if I’d be interested in a relationship  to which I declined (long distance) and we continued being casual. 

Three months ago I realized I actually have growing complicated feelings for the new guy. Subconsciously I feared giving myself, my heart, everything to him… in that one day we’d wake up being strangers like what happened with my ex. I have yet to tell him how I feel. 

Two months ago I get a message from my ex. He told me has not stopped thinking of me since we broke up. He said he hasn’t even been able to date anyone since me. He said how he’s felt so guilty over the years about how we ended things and that he wished we never broke up. This turned my world upside down because I thought he completely forgot about me and that he wasn’t really in love with me like I loved him. I had no idea he felt exactly how I did but for the entirety of the post break up.

Nothing came from the long conversation we had. We talked about everything we were feeling during our breakup and our lives since then. We both realized we needed the closure. We thanked each other and I haven’t heard from him since then. But ever since he messaged me those rare thoughts of “what if” have become more frequent. I’m thinking about seriously starting to date the new guy but I can’t help but think “what if I’m making a grave mistake by not trying again with my ex for something that maybe shouldn’t of ended”.

This situation is kind of weird so please bear with me as I attempt to explain. 

So basically, I (27F) met a guy (25M) that works at my job- let’s calls him “Steve”. Steve’s not there all the time but lately he had been coming around a lot more because we sparked interest in each other. Probably about the 3rd day I was getting to know him, I found out he had a “girl best friend”. Let’s call her “Sarah”. 

That’s fine with me and all but the only thing is, I found out that he actually does stuff with her (kiss, have sex, hold hands). I asked him once if he would kiss or do anything with a girl he liked and he said no- out of respect for Sarah. SMH?? He kept telling me they’re just best friends who do stuff together and that they weren’t in a relationship. I took his word for it because from the start, he’s always been very transparent with me. On the other hand her- she is practically in love with this guy. She’s fully dependent on him for her happiness too. I told Steve that I respect whatever he and Sarah have going on and he kept reassuring me there isn’t anything going on but he was understanding if I wanted to stop talking to him because of the situation. I told him no, I’m not bothered because I actually started to really like him.  

One day… Steve and I were talking and he told me Sarah found messages from him and i and got so upset she told him he doesn’t want to talk to him for a bit. Which is weird right? Considering they aren’t in a relationship or anything. I understand a little tho just because he was fully transparent with me but not with her. I just assumed she was in love with him and he wasn’t. Me and Steve were hanging out the other day and Sarah kept blowing his phone up at least 50 times over and over again. As I was being dropped off to my car, Steve said he has a huge feeling Sarah is waiting at his house. Sure enough she was and I was pretty much held hostage in Steve’s car, he was trying to get away from me! Like a psycho maniac, she kept honking, following and chasing us down the road. I kept asking to get dropped off to my car but apparently that wasn’t an option. Finally, Steve got his mom to call Sarah to tell her to go home and she did. 
The next morning apparently Sarah messaged Steve apologizing for acting that way and that it wouldn’t happen again….

That same night Steve and I went to get food and after the night was over I went to sleep and woke up the next morning to Steve sending me a SCREENSHOT of this Instagram DM message from MY account saying “he is all mine now, move on you’re pathetic”. He was saying Sarah got these messages from my account. I told him I promise i have no idea how these messages were sent from my account considering I never sent them nor would I ever speak like that to anyone regardless of the situation! He continued to accuse me and tell me he doesn’t believe me because the screenshot “doesn’t lie?”. 
It was clearly a fake DM and if he were to look closely he would’ve been able to see how  crooked and blurry the whole entire DM looked, it jus looked sketch. 

He told me “I think this is a good reason to just stop talking now”. I told him I respected his decision but I needed him to know I didn’t send those messages. Regardless if he believed me or not but what really hurt is how fast he switched up like that. Going based off an accusation and wouldn’t even give me the opportunity to speak. Since then we haven’t talked, that was about 4 days ago. I saw him at the office here and there but we don’t make eye contact. Today was the first time we made eye contact but I’m pretty sure he’s just over me at this point- which makes me really sad. I couldn’t believe he just flipped so quickly. Over something that wasn’t true. It’s clear as day that his crazy psycho best friend or whatever she is, somehow faked those messages. Steve said there’s no way she knew how to do that considering she’s not very “tech savvy”.  I almost find him an absolute idiot at this point. If he doesn’t realize his crazy friend going thru his phone, blowing his phone up, pulling up to his house randomly, or stalking him is not normal? Good luck to him honestly. 

I hope he finds the truth out one day.. I miss him but I know I need to get over him and I’m just delusional. He was a cool person and we really connected but I guess that fairytale dream is over now.

Our last date was actually on Sunday and we went mini golfing, had dinner at this Korean BBQ place and then just parked at a view and talked the rest of the night. Wasn't my plan, but we ended up spending basically the entire day together, like 8 hours. Only reason we realized it was midnight was cause we both were in my car and just laying down talking to eachother and she started like getting sleepy, so I checked the time and we realized we had to go. It was honestly a really nice date

So she had this idea that we have a movie date at her house, meeting up at 4, and we both are picking 2 movies to watch(i think she chose the truman show and charade, im still trying to decide) im getting pizza, and she's getting the snacks. I asked what I should bring, she told me just to bring comfortable clothes, she's jsut gonna be in her sweats and stuff, and to be prepared since her bed is a little small, so we'll be squished, but other than that, yeah, just be in something comfortable and the pizza.

So I just want advice cause, well for starters, this is the first time I've made it to the 4th date with someone. Also, we haven't kissed yet, I've actually never had my first kiss, and she just found that out on Sunday, she told me she had 1 bf back in freshmen year but since then she only ever focused on school, so like yeah, shes got some experience. 

and like all my friends who I told about the date since they're always asking me how it's going since it's like the first girl I've actually made it past 1 date. So they kinda freaked me out and put these thoughts in my head and now I'm just trying to get mentally prepared. So yeah, I just want any advice or tips for it. Like how should I prepare? Or jsut anything tbh, I don't wanna go in jsut freaking out haha

I broke up for a few reasons that had been building up, including him suddenly talking to me with the intention of hurting my feelings, admitting to not trusting me, and generally losing interests in holding conversations about things beyond his interests. 

At the time, it felt right. But I have now lost my will to live. 

Each day I realize more and more things I took for granted. How special he was. All the things we’d been through and how much he adored me. How happy he was and how much he inspired me to be the best version of me I could be. How happy we were until those last few months. 

I have nightmares almost every night about how he sounded and looked when I broke up with him. I feel nauseous when I think of all the things we planned to do. I can’t be left alone with my thoughts without weeping.

People say that it takes time to get over stuff. A lot of time has passed and I’m getting much worse. As it is I feel selfish for even feeling bad, since it’s my fault. He told me to never contact him again. I will respect his boundary 

But I have become borderline suicidal. I can’t see a future without him in it. The idea of living life without him becomes more unbearable every day since it happened and it just keeps getting worse. 

Maybe this is a question about my relationship to him or to myself. I don’t know how to go on after losing him.

He found out about this post and he said this is a funny ect.

He was supposed to visit me the next day after he found out as we planned dinner together a week before he even knew about the post. Well guess what man cannot keep his promises. For context he never is on time , always late. The week before the plan was that he comes at 4pm , yesterday he asked if he could come over at 7 or 8pm. I replied that it is really late and I have early classes in university which he knew before about it. So the day comes when we need to have dinner together and he doesn't come. Why? Because he didn't want to travel during peak hours on the train (4-5pm) which is a big bs cuz I did many times and it's not as bad as he described as he couldn't get in which is bigger nonsense. Even if it was a case he could take the train 30min later and let me know, right? And ofc it upset me as he is not valid my time and energy at this point, also I should mention it is not the first time happening. But he asked if he could come tomorrow which I said no and told him come now or never. after that he says maybe u should delete me. And u know what guys I blocked him after I told him (for context he broke up with ex cuz she was talking behind his back with other guys) that his ex started to talk behind his back cuz of his lack of attention to partner.

Lately my partner has been obsessed with improving his health even though he is already very healthy and exercises and eats right. It is almost exclusively what he talks about. I am very proud of him and what he is doing (exercising more, stopping vaping, working out twice a day, eating exclusively meat and veggies) but it is really getting old how much he talks about it. All he talks about is how excited he is to workout again, how much he wants to lift next week, the benefits of not overstimulating your brain with dopamine, a new podcast he listened to about health, how he is going to try and go to minor leagues for his sport, how he hates himself for overeating occasionally (when we do enjoy a good meal together all he will talk about is how much he is going to have to fast after), how he would only be happy if he was healthier. 

I know I should be super proud of him which I am. I also am healthy and exercise nearly daily and help cook him healthy meals but I also enjoy living my life and I hate feel like I have to flagellate myself for being “lazy” or eating a good tasty meal once in a while. I also am sick of talking about how to improve health. I love a healthy life but I don’t go on and on about it either. He says he likes telling me all about his fitness goals because it makes them a reality for him and encourages him to be better. 

This is a new change for him, for him to be so obsessed. We used to talk about deep things together like meaning of life and movies and fun things we observe in the world but recently it’s all been about fitness and when I bring up another topic not related to fitness he seems disinterested.

He mentioned open relationships in the past and I said to him that if he met someone else I would end the relationship.

I was really excited when he had a trip to bulgaria planned for 7 days. I honestly thought that maybe he was going to propose to me since we have been talking about having kids.

He told me on the plane that he has a pregnant partner and 3 kids who he has been with for 10 years and we are going to meet them.  Of course I panicked at this point.  I never knew about this the whole time we were dating and he drops this on me now when I think we are going on a romantic holiday.  I ask him if he's still with this woman and he says yes.  He says we are sleeping at her home and he will be sleeping with her the whole time we are there.  He says he wants us all 'to be together'.

Of course I beg him to book me a hotel because I'm broke and have no money.  I call my mom and she has no money either.

I know that's hardly a unique statement, particularly from someone as young and naive as myself, but I'm really impressed with how far our relationship has come in such a short time. we can really talk to each other about anything, and not ""anything"" as in ""anything but that one thing I don't want to talk about."" genuinely *anything.* neither of us have ever had anything like this before. she's an amazing person and I cherish every moment I get to spend with her.

but enough of my puppy love gushing. as the title says, she's got a bad case of depression. I think a lot of it is stemming from her current situation at home, which I'll touch on in a second, but she's also still dealing with a lot of generally traumatic experiences she's been through. as callous as this might seem, I'm gonna list them here so you can have an idea of the serious shit we're dealing with:

- harassed and bullied online for years as a teenager
- emotionally and physically abused by parents
- sexually assaulted by previous partners
- used to self-harm
- a failed suicide attempt

to my knowledge, she hasn't been able to get to therapy for any of this. what's more, she still lives at home and is reliant on her parents who, as the emotional and physical abuse would imply, she does not have a good relationship with. they've kicked her out during arguments a few times in the past, but tolerated her coming back (presumably because she has literally nowhere else to go). she can't drive, has no car, and currently no regular job. she's a skilled musician and makes a little bit of change here and there off that, but often that money goes towards cheap booze, cigarettes, or weed to cope getting from one day to the next. she's self-destructive, and has been for a long time.

I'm not here to ask for your advice on how to help her. I think I'm doing everything I can: being there to listen and talk her through things, connecting her with health resources, and so on. I still live at home myself, and while I can tell sharing time with her has generally been good for her, we can't take her in. she's made some progress on the alcohol and cigarettes, doing less and even going sober a few days at a time (which is a significant step up from before we met), but not without a lot of tears. she's really stuck between a few rocks and a hard place.

she's never lied or tried to hide any of this from me. I know what I've signed up for and I've been trying to do everything in my power to help her stay in a better headspace and get healthier, but I can't do it all *for* her. seeing her struggle hurts, and to be honest I'm not sure how long I can keep watching. at the same time, I really love her deeply. I can't resent her for having problems, and it's far too late to just turn the other cheek. I don't really know how to process all of this. any advice is welcome.

This friendship goes way.....back to begining stages of high school. 
I was 12-13 at the time and this friend we will give them a fake name for the sake for their privacy we will name them Ashely. 

Ashely became friends with this girl who I was friends with at primary school we will named them Rachel. 
My friendship with Rachel was very off and on and she would tend to bully me and then I will come back being all sorry and we be friends again. 
At the time I had no idea this was too a toxic friendship. 

So Ashely and Rachel thought it be a great idea and pretty much bully me for that whole year. 
Her mother even got involved and rang my mum and harassed her as well.

It ended up with myself, Rachel and Ashely having a meeting with the teacher. 
I was blamed for everything. Rachel show evidence from a note I gave her saying I think it would be best we weren't  friends. But they never show the notes I found of them talking behind my back in their desk.


Following year unfortunately I was in the same class as Ashely. Again she bullied me.

The last year of that school before I changed school was the turning point. 

I told Ashely that I had a dream about us being naked and looking at each other.  You might wonder why I told her, well at the time we were ""friends"". Well so I thought.
I felt guilty for some reason to have this dream so I guess in the back of my mind if I confess it, then the guilt will go away. 
I was going to a catholic all girl school. So the whole confessional thing being brought up Catholic was at the time very deep in me. 


Ashely litterally ran away and told everyone I was gay. Yes we are talking about early 2000's here so at the time it wasn't accepted to be gay. 
You weren't even allowed by law to be married if you were gay. 

My mum got involved and they had a teachers meeting. They decided to friend some students in my year to join there group to stop Ashely from bullying me.

Well Ashely seem to have some sort of revenge in her and pretty much harassed and ruined my group of friends.  

Basically it got so bad I had six weeks off school and moved to a public  school. 

I realised at the public school I wasn't gay. I believed what Ashely told me was true because at the time I had a lack sense of myself who I was as a person. However once I went to a public school and their was oppostie sex I realised I wasn't.  

One year without Ashely was a blessing. Although she still try to get to me by talking to some guy at my school and he started saying stuff. But no one take notice of him, thank goodness.

Following year you wouldnt believe it!
But she came to my school!
Someone from my old pervious school who I happened to work with after school at this cleaning job. Told me Ashely bullied someone else and spread rumours, no one believed her and she became a loner. Sitting by a gym eating her lunch.
I thought to myself wow karma got her. 

However I was aboustely scared of her being at my school now. It felt like she was haunting me. 
We ended up being in the same IT class together. 
The teacher decided for us to sit next to each other, oddly. Basically we became friends and I learnt a lot that her family was pretty much emotionally, verbally abusive to her. 

It made sense to me why she behaved the way she did because she didn't know how else to deal with it. It didn't gave a excuse for her behaviour but it gave a big picture what was going on. 

Next I also discovered Ashely was bisexual and once asked me to go with her to this homosexual class for students. I said to her I wasn't gay but she believed I was this whole time. 

I realised then and there she projected  herself on to me. The part she couldn't accept of herself. 


After we finished school we went to a art course together. 
Everything was fine until this pattern of bullying started again. 
Ashely realised when we went to our art course that this other girl we will name her Jowita went to the same school we all did. But I never knew her since our school was massive and had a lot of students. 

We all sat in the same class but over time Ashely and Jowita started to bully me. It was litterally all over again from what happened with Ashely and Rachel. 

I always asked for help for some things with written theory. They got impatient with me and I felt I was in the way, so I asked the teacher if they could move my desk. 

Ashely and Jowita stopped talking to me. I felt isolated and lonely. 
The teacher for some werid reason stopped helping me. 
Later on I found out that the teacher was hitting on Ashely. Maybe Ashely said some stuff about me to the teacher? 

I remember it all came down when I joked to a class mate in class how you wouldn't want Ashely to look after kids because she takes drugs. Which a few of students did and I don't think the teacher care at all. It was obvious who was taking drugs or not. 

Suddenly after class I was in the elevator and just joking with Ashely, at that time we were talking terms.Then as we step out of elevator and I was about to step out of the building Ashely switch her behaviour and told me not to say that about her and drugs because she could get kick out of class if they found out she was on drugs.
I thought at the time she was being paraiond and the teacher probably knew like many other students and didn't care. 
I told her I was sorry but she walked off in a huff with Jowita. 

I felt really ashamed and guilty. I txt her saying I'm really sorry but Ashely and Jowita started to get really cruel and started sending abusive txt messages to me. I recalled laying on the floor in my mother's house after I got back from my class and cried so hard. 

I was then bullied by them even more so, I eventually had to change class rooms. 

Same pattern as in high school changing schools 

I was left alone by them and they never spoke to me.

My partner told me this year's later that back then Ashely and Jowita try to talk bad about me to him. Thankfully my partner told them ""I be judgement of that"" and walked away from them. 

Following year I thought to mend things with them. I recalled Ashely was like ""Oh no stay away"" but Jowita thought ""hang on let's just mend things""
and we'll... I was pretty much wasn't allowed to sit next to them. I didn't realised at the time they weren't friends but I had such a bad habit blamming myself for every situation that happen with them I couldn't see pass it. 

During that year Jowita take me to the side and told me in privacy that last year when Ashely was sending abusive txt messages to me and as well her. That it was actually Ashely using Jowita phone. Jowita asked Ashely but why? and she said I need back up. 

I still think Jowita is still responsbile for it, since when Jowita got home and had her phone with her. She could've message me and say it wasn't her back then. Plus she still gave the phone to Ashely.

After that year I didn't went back to that art course. 

It really affected my mental health I found myself crying the toilets at that art course. Plus my socail anxiety just sky rocketed. 
I try to do another different course but I was so afarid I be bullied I stopped going. I did notice I became hyper aware of things like if I saw two girls laughing I assume they were laughing at me. I ended up crying after the course as well. 


Later on Ashely showed up again probably back in 2014 -2015. We became chatty and got along. She asked if she could stay at my mum's house cause of her father was being abusive. My mum let her, eventually it got too much so...she moved out. She never really hang out with me just stay, worked and then hang with friends. 
I felt a bit used. 

Later on I notice most on Ashely's and Jowita's Facebook page of photos of them hanging out. I felt hurt and upset because they never invited me. I always thought what was wrong with me?

Then they suddnely included me in. It all came to a end when I didn't want to go to a bush walk because of my anxiety. Ashely pretty much gaslighted me project blame on me. Very toxic commication that I notice looking back. 
So she stopped talking to me. 

Jowita was nice and message me saying she didn't want to take part with what Ashely was doing.

Unfortunately with Jowita that friendship fell a part too in 2017. But that's another story altogether.  

My last interaction with Ashely would be back in 2017. When I was mentally unwell and had a crappy, terrible student therapist that made my symptoms worse. She was kind enough to ask to hang out with this other person who I knew at our art class but I didn't really knew them that well enough.
It was some thing small that Ashely did but it made me feel small and ashamed and kinda dumb. 

Ashely asked me when we were at the mall at a shoe  shop ,how much these two schools bags cost together. I just gave a randmon guess, I'm not good at maths and have dsylexia. 
Ashely knew I did not do well at school neither did she since we were in this Learning class at school together. 
Basically I gave a randmon number and she told me ""That's wrong, usally people get it right"".

I was shocked and confused why she did that because I didn't do anything before during the day we hang out to upset her. 

I asked her later on why she did that? she told me she thought it was cute. 

I then message Jowita what happened and they told me when they use to hang out with Ashely and with that same person from that art course. They would make fun of the words she would say and English is her second language. Which I look back was really mean.



I try to mend things back in 2018 after I got better and got myself a descent therapist. 

However I notice they take forever to reply back as usally it be months if she ever got back to you.  I thought I can't really have a friendship with someone like this that never replies. 

They did ask to hang out  in 2019 but I refused after going to therapy and knowing this whole time this friend was toxic. 
I back off.


However now Ashely has message me saying they coming back overseas and say they miss me after 4 years of not talking and want to meetup.
I message her back to be nice but I realised I'm actually scared of her seeing her. 

Is it even worth to pursue this friendship again?
I always think well maybe she has changed. 
However as my sister told me it's like going back to abusive realtionship. 

Thoughts?

I'm happier than I've ever been before and things are going great. She has been very open and honest with me about her mental health struggles which I have really appreciated as it helps me support her. She has been taking Sertraline up until now and has decided to try weaning herself off it as it's been years and years.

Now, when we started seeing each other, we worked through some hangups we both had around sex. Mine were around some specific historical traumas I experienced and are mostly resolved as she's fantastic, patient and supportive. Hers are broadly health based/germophobic and specifically around sexually transmitted infections. Fortunately I am vanilla as all hell and have only had a handful of sexual partners in the last ten years, so we worked through it and have had a healthy sex life for the last year. 

I didn't realise how much of this was due to Sertraline (or her own internal battle maybe?!) as she's now bringing it up again and seems uncomfortable around sex. Twice now she has enthusiastically consented until ""that moment"" comes at which point she suddenly demurs. (I have no problem whatsoever with respecting her wishes and working through it at her own pace.) I give blood regularly and therefore my blood is tested every few weeks for a handful of blood-borne infections but I get the impression her anxiety demon is pointing out that not every single STI is blood-borne. 

Here's the question: should I go and get tested? Would that help, or is feeding the demon just going to make it worse? She seems conflicted when I bring it up, switching between agreeing that it would help and telling me it's not necessary and she trusts me. I don't know what to do, as I'd like to be the best partner I can be but perhaps showing her that I'll jump through hoops for her anxiety will just make it worse...?",False,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7612303,public,nsfw,Advice on anxiety and how to handle STI worries,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1nvzh/advice_on_anxiety_and_how_to_handle_sti_worries/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,,

We would laugh together, have engaging conversations together, make funny sexual jokes with each other and it wouldnt be a problem. Fast forward 7 years and none of that happens anymore. Over the years affection has declined dramatically. Sitting here right now typing this out, i cant even remember the last time she kissed me or hugged me. She doesnt like being cuddled anymore. Its almost like shes repulsed to even feel my touch. During our 4th year i mentioned that maybe we could try new things in bed or she could go to the gym with me and we could be more active as a natural means of boosting her overall energy. This was a mistake and she lashed out at me instantly saying that this is about her sex drive and accusing me of trying to change her. Since then i try not to mention it but its unfortunately slipped out maybe twice a year and right away, its like she throws a knife at my neck with the way she reacts. More recently i stupidly mentioned libido pills because i saw an ad, not that i was serious, more of like a “oh wow they make libido pills, cool” and less then a second later all she said was no with a very annoyed connotation. I cant even say anything about sex anymore. Its reduced to us having sex twice a month which has become suprisingly and overwhelmingly frustrating since im a HL. I feel like ive tried to be a supporting boyfriend as best as i couldve been but more recently i feel like itd be easier for me if we just werent together anymore. Ive expressed my feelings of frustration and self resentment and stated my needs just to get a gray answer from her kinda like “oh well, that sucks” which is borderline heartbreaking because i feel so neglected and shes really the only one i want that affection from. She has always been on anti depressants due to depression(well before the start of the relationship) and 3 years into our relationship she started taking hormonal birth control due to ovarian cysts which I completely supported her for knowing that it would 100% affect her mood and mental state. She stopped taking birth control for over a month now and i wouldnt expect a change in her mood for maybe 6-8 months. Guys, should i just leave? Or is it worth trying to talk about it with her one more time?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7612299,public,self,My[27] gf[27] doesnt want any help with her lower libido and turns down any way that i can help.
