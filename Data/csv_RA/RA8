Throw away account for privacy 

Just wanted a little advice for reassurance. My (26f) bf (32m) have been dating for about 8 months and it’s an amazing relationship. We have a great connection, we laugh a lot together, and the sex is great and consistent. I do just get a little insecure sometimes because there has been a few times where we initiate sex and he gets erect and is obviously interested, but sometimes he can’t ejaculate. This doesn’t happen often, I’ve noticed it happens when we’ve had sex already that same day, or a few days in a row beforehand, or if he’s just straight up tired. I know he loves me and is attracted to me, but I can’t help but get in my head and wonder if he’s just not turned on by me sometimes and that’s the reason for him not being able to ejaculate? I might be overthinking it as he’s always praising me and usually always instigates sex first. I mean he even gets hard just from kissing me sometimes. I guess I’m just looking for some insight on this and if it’s normal and okay to happen occasionally",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7618408,public,self,Boyfriend can’t ejaculate sometimes,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2bqvv/boyfriend_cant_ejaculate_sometimes/,all_ads,6,,,

I tried to include as much context as possible. I'm also using mobile and have never posted before, so sorry for any formatting errors and grammar mistakes.


I (26f) have been with my partner Alex (26m) for 5 years. We've been renting an flat together for one year in the city he lives in with his family. My family live about an hour away, and I moved cities and jobs last year to be with him. When we met five years ago, we hit it off instantly and I knew almost immediately that we had something special. We said I love you on our third date, and up until recently I truly thought that we would spend the rest of our lives together. I'm actually tearing up typing this because I genuinely believe, or believed, that he was the love of my life, and I know he feels the same. But I'm at a loss of what to do anymore. 


For the sake of some backstory. When we moved in together, I slowly began to feel dissatisfied with our living situation and at the time, hoped it was just a standard case of us getting used to living together, growing pains etc, and that certain issues could be resolved if we compromised. Both of us have suspected for quite some time that he has undiagnosed ADHD, and a lot of these issues I felt were due to some of the behaviors he would have that over time, I found quite bothersome. For example, I'm sensitive to things like noise and my family were always extremely quiet and considerate of each others comfort growing up, whereas he came from a very noisy family and is just a noisy person in general.


Sometimes I felt like it was difficult to be comfortable in my own space because of his presence there. Perhaps I'm just the kind of person who needs to live alone, I'm not sure.


The reason I mention this is because I think tension had been growing in our relationship ever since we moved in together. We would argue often over small things; I felt like he wasn't being considerate enough with certain things, he felt that I was being too unreasonable etc. I'd also like to use it to point out that he has never been the kind of person to seek help for anything mental that is going on with him. I struggled with pretty severe anxiety a few years ago which was causing me to act in ways that were irratic and difficult. It caused a lot of issues for our relationship, but I got into therapy as soon as I could (CBT) which helped immensely, and I've had very little problems with anxiety since then.


Alex supported me through all of it. There were many occasions where it would have been understandable for him to throw in the towel and leave me, but he didn't. I feel so much gratitude and appreciation for him for this, but I suppose there's a little part of my mind which wonders if he would do the same for me (take himself to therapy) if the situations had been reversed. I have asked if he would consider talking to a therapist or counsellor for other reasons, but his answer was always that he couldn't trust a stranger with his problems and I haven't pushed it.


Three months ago, Alex's father, Joe, passed away. Things have been extremely difficult for us since then. Alex has experienced a lot of death in the past few years. First, his grandfather, then his family dog he'd had since he was 10, and now his dad. His passing was somewhat expected, but it didn't make it any less difficult.


Joe was a lovely, gentle man who I really liked. It's only been three months, but it feels like he's been gone a lot longer than that. Alex, his mum and his two siblings all very much have a ""get on with things and leave the grieving to when it's convenient"" kind of attitude, whereas I wear my emotions on my sleeve and cry extremely easily. Sometimes I felt like it wasn't my place to grieve for his dad. I still cry sometimes when I think about him in the hospital, although I was never able to visit him while he was there. I did ask Alex if he wanted me there, but he expressed that it'd be best if it was just the immediate family and I respected that.


I have no experience with grief or anyone close to me dying. Since Joe passed, I've been terrified over not providing Alex with the support he needs. I've felt very disconnected from the rest of the family during their grieving period, and at times I've been scared to impose or to make things worse for them. Overall, I've just made sure that Alex knows that I'm here whenever he needs me. I've provided him comfort and a safe space to talk about his feelings when he needs to. He's been very appreciated and at times has said he wouldn't know what he'd do if I wasn't here.


My mental health has taken a nosedive. I've been drinking a lot, not to the point of getting drunk, but just to take the edge off most days. This is something I'm actively aware of and working on. There have been other factors at play to cause this mental slump that I believe have caused this other than the living situation and Alex's dad, which I won't get into. Suffice to say, it's been a very sad, confusing and scary time for the past few months, but I still had hope that things would improve, because we loved each other.


We have argued many times since we moved in, but since his dad passed away it has gotten a lot worse. Our communication during conflict has always been something we need to work on. I have a habit of leaving the room we are in to be alone, and sometimes it will take me a while to want to come back and reconcile with him. It just takes me a long time for my emotions to get back to baseline. This has always been an issue for Alex, as sometimes he feels like I have been ""punishing"" him or deliberately stonewalling him. I mention this because it's relevant.


Sometimes during heated arguments, Alex has also accused me of not providing him enough support for his dad, but he has always apologised and taken it back afterwards, saying that I've done more than enough and he's so appreciative. This has only exacerbated my fears of not doing enough. I also feel like this is relevant for this next part of the situation.


A few nights ago, we had a horrific argument that I'm still in shock from. The day before, Alex had invited me to dinner with his mum and his siblings, and I had turned it down because I'd had a rough few days and was still trying to mentally recover. I actually hadn't seen his family since the funeral, and in truth, I was scared to for multiple reasons. I expressed this and apologised, and Alex assured me that he understood and it was all completely fine and that I didn't have to attend.


He arrived home the following night. I had had a few drinks and was watching something on TV, we exchanged a few pleasantries and he joined me on the sofa, but after a while I noticed he was quiet and looked really sad. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he wished I'd been at the dinner, and that his mum was asking after me.


I said how nice it was that his mum was thinking of me like that, but then Alex mentioned that his mum had made a comment about me not visiting the house the past few times she'd asked. I immediately became confused and asked what he meant, and he said he didn't know. I pointed out that I hadn't been invited to his family's house since the funeral, so how could I be turning down invitations? He said he didn't know.


I admit, I became defensive at this point, because the way Alex was talking made it sound like his mum was concerned I didn't like his family anymore just because I hadn't attended one dinner. That has never been the case. I felt like I was somehow being inadvertently guilt-tripped for something I had been told wasn't an issue. I also felt like I had a right to ask about the comment though, because I found it confusing and concerning and it was almost confirming my worst fear: that I was doing something wrong in this whole situation and I needed to be doing more for his family.


Alex immediately began to get defensive too and we began to argue with each other over my tone. I dialled my agitation back, but Alex continued to become irate whilst simultaneously blaming me for losing my cool and getting too angry. He started to become really angry and blaming, and in my shock and surprise I let out a laugh. I didn't mean to be disrespectful, it just slipped out because I was so shocked and confused at how quickly the conversation had spiraled into something horrible, and in truth, Alex was acting extremely out of character.


This was a mistake. It made things a million times worse, and Alex began blaming me for laughing at him ""while he was in pain and trying to talk to me about it"" At this point, I said that we were both too angry and I was leaving the room to let him cool down. I tried to leave, but that was when he blocked the door with his body and told me no, I wasn't going to leave this time, we needed to talk about this.


I'm not going to lie, this freaked me out. In all our five years, Alex has never tried to control me like that by physically blocking my exit. I managed to get him out of the way by gently nudging him aside (so it was really just a feeble attempt to stop me I suppose), before quickly walking to my bedroom and shutting the door, pushing my body against it to stop him getting in. He actually pounded on the door with his full force. Enough to push me back from it. I screamed. It was horrible. I've never felt afraid in his presence like that.


Things escalated from there into screaming and crying. I won't get into details but there were a lot of things said. I really just wanted him to leave me alone, but he raged that I never want to resolve things and I always just leave him, stonewall him etc. He criticised my drinking multiple times, and said that when he got home he could ""tell that I was wasted,"" and when I drink too much I ""develop the attitude of a rat.""


I've never heard him speak to me like that before. It felt like he had real contempt inside him for me that I've never seen. I think I went into shock at that moment. There was a lot of crying and me trying to make him see how fucked up it was that he'd physically intimated me like that, while he insisted that I know he'd never hurt me. I know that, but I was still scared. It was like all the tension and pain and frustration of the past three months was coming out of both of us. At a certain point he just broke down and started sobbing on the floor, practically screaming that he missed his dad and that he didn't know how to talk to his family about what he was feeling. He said he'd ruined everything and that he was sorry. He didn't mean any of it. I hate to say it, but by that point I was so broken down I felt nothing. I thought for sure everything was over.


I spent the next day in bed and he left our flat to go back home. He sent me a long text saying he hated himself for his behavior and that he understood if I never wanted to see him again. The day after that, I packed as many things as I could, my dad picked me up, and I went home to stay with my parents.


That's where I am now. I have no idea what this means for us, whether I want us to stay together or not. I have no idea if I can see him the same way. I can't stop thinking about him blocking my exit and pounding on my door. My heart is also breaking in two. He's grieving and I'm essentially abandoning him during the worst time of his life, when he supported me for so long during mine. I know how loving and gentle a person he is. I know he isn't usually like this. That he'd never ever hurt me. But I can't be physically intimidated. I just can't. I feel like that's a reasonable boundary. I also feel more comfortable with my family than I have in a whole year, so I don't think leaving the flat was a mistake.


I just need advice on what to do next. Whether people think this is salvageble or not. Whether I should have done things differently or whether I'm making this whole thing too much about my own feelings. We've barely spoke over text, but before I left I told him in person that this was likely the end of our relationship. I'm in shock. I don't even feel sad. I don't think I truly believe yet that it's over. I want him to get help and for us to reconcile. I thought we could get through anything because our love was so strong. I genuinely want to be with him, but not like this. I just don't know what to do. I'm sorry for rambling. This was cathartic for me I guess. Any advice at all is appreciated. 


TLDR: my partner of 5 years and I had a meltdown argument, likely exacerbated by the grief for his father, where he acted extremely out of character and physically intimidated me (blocked my exit, pounded on my door).

I'm not going to lie and act as if he doesn't spend more money on food than I do. He provides meals very often, I provide things that can be cooked. He provides door dash orders nights he doesn't want to cook, which is more often then not. I offer to make food and provide things in our home to create a meal. He doesn't want to do that most the time and will just order food. I cook I clean and only expect one chore from him. Taking out the trash. However, more often then not lately he will order only himself food or only get food for himself. Which isn't wrong of him, I know this. But if there's no food at home, he will order himself food and then I come home and there's nothing to cook, it just irks me because he won't grocery shop, ever. Even if he can get groceries delivered he won't. So yes of course he will be spending more money because he orders DoorDash so often. I know every time I get food, from grocery DoorDash or fast food or restaurant, I provide him with a meal as well (If it's not me exclusively going out to dinner with a friend or something) an example is I stopped by the grocery store, I'll call him, ask what he would like for dinner, and then the night goes.

Since then it decreased. 

Currently it happens about once a month, sometimes once every month and a half. When it happens it’s because I get frustrated and ask him why we aren’t doing it. If I try to initiate it he will basically disregard every attempt and pretend like he doesn’t notice (or maybe he doesn’t) when I ask what’s going on, we talk about it, he says I’m right and we will work on it and that it is his fault and then next time we are together he initiates it.
Then, nothing again. In the beginning he tried to blame it on the lack of places to do it since none of us has their own house, but this summer we literally spent a whole week together alone and it happened once. 

Honestly when it does happen it is not very good either. He just cares about himself and what he wants/likes. We have talked about this, I’ve expressed what I would like/want. It still doesn’t happen. 

Eventually I realized it was only happening when I said something about it not happening, so I decided I wasn’t going to say anything and I wasn’t going to try to initiate anything. 

After about the usual month (maybe a little more) he came up to me one day looking kind of surprised/confused and told me that he knows we aren’t being very intimate but that he understands that he needs to do something and that he wanted me to know that he would like it to happen sometime that week (very romantic lol).

For context my girlfriend and I have been together for 5+ years. We live together, own a home together, and have pets together. We have struggled with communication but recently in the last several months it’s been really bad. When my girlfriend voices what upsets her and I explain/clarify, she says that I invalidate her.

Every time my girlfriend gets upset with me she will react angrily/storm off/go cold on me. The kind of behavior where you know you did something wrong because your partner is acting all weird. When I ask her what’s wrong, she’ll tell me, I’ll explain myself and she then tells me I’m invalidating her feelings. I’m at a lost and don’t know how to proceed in a healthy communicative way. It feels like she needs me to agree with her reality for me to validate her. 

Below are some examples:
1. I woke up late for work this morning (wfh) and ran into the office to read my emails. My gf spoke to me and I responded quietly (bc I just woke up and we have a roommate) while looking at my computer. She got upset that I didn’t look at her and didn’t speak up enough when I responded. I tried to explain why but she said I was invalidating her.

2. I was looking for something and she walked in the room asking if I wanted a tote bag. I don’t need one so I said “no thank you” while continuing to look for something. She got upset that I didn’t look at the bag before saying no. Tried to explain I knew I didn’t need a bag..

3. I said to her in a neutral tone “I thought you were going to sweep the guest room” when she was sitting on the couch. I wasn’t mad or being sarcastic but she swore I said it condescendingly. When I explained I said it with no ill intentions she said I was invalidating her. 

Things like this confuse me because I am trying to explain to her why I behaved a certain why because I don’t want her to think I behaved with bad intentions towards her. Is there a different way I should be approaching this? I want her to feel validated but I don’t want to lie down and agree with her version of events every time.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7618339,public,self,My girlfriend (29F) says that I (25F) always invalidate her feelings.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2bifa/my_girlfriend_29f_says_that_i_25f_always/,all_ads,6,,,

It was my own money and we don’t share finances. I told him I didn’t like to be spoken to like that but he didn’t think he had done anything wrong. I’m scared about the future now, as I don’t want to be controlled or disrespected in my relationship.

My (36F) boyfriend (37M) and I were visiting my aunt in a different town over the weekend, and our flight back to our home city was cancelled. The airline told us they would put us on another flight the following morning and pay for our taxi to and from my aunt’s place so we could stay there another night.

In the morning the taxi arrived at my aunt’s place at the time the airline had said it would, and the driver drove us back to the airport. When we got there, my boyfriend got out of the taxi first and took our bags out. While I was still in the car, the driver asked me how I wanted to pay the fare. I told him the airline was supposed to be paying it, and he said he knew nothing about this. He told me if I paid he could give me a receipt to take in to give to the airline, and that they would refund me.

In the moment I didn’t think to ask him to call his manager to find out if there was a record of the fact that the airline was supposed to pay, but I also thought there was no reason the airline wouldn’t refund me, since they had it on record that we had been booked on the cancelled flight and that they were going to pay our taxi fare to and from our accommodation.

As I was paying the driver, my boyfriend saw what was happening and opened the door of the taxi and started yelling at me, ‘Don’t you pay! Don’t do it! Don’t you dare hand over any money! This is not your problem!’ I don’t remember his exact words, but it was a string of very forceful and angry commands followed by some expletives when he realised I'd already paid. From my perspective, his response was completely over the top, embarrassing, and disrespectful. I should also note that we don’t share finances and it was my money I had just paid with, not his.

I quickly got out of the taxi, and I’m not sure if I said anything to him as I was very upset by this point, but we went into the terminal and I approached the airline desk. As soon as I explained what had happened, the attendant at the desk said she would refund me for the taxi fare right away, which she did.

Once we’d got our boarding passes, we went and sat down and I told him I didn’t like the way he’d spoken to me and I found it disrespectful. I was in tears by this point, and I didn’t think I’d done anything wrong — I’d believed the airline would refund me for the fare, and as I’d anticipated, they had. To me, paying the driver had seemed like a reasonable course of action in the moment, not the act of absolute stupidity that he seemed to think it was. I told him I’d felt like he was treating me like a dog that wasn’t following orders, yelling commands at me, and that I was not okay with being spoken to like that. I said I would have been willing to listen to his point of view if he’d talked to me in a respectful way, and that I would have been open to hearing why he thought I shouldn’t have paid and that maybe he was right about that, but I didn’t like to be spoken to like that.

He seemed surprised because he thought he’d stayed on the right side of the line with how he’d acted (I think because he hadn’t called me any derogatory names), and that he was sorry I was upset but he didn’t think he’d done anything wrong. It was clear that he thought my decision to pay the driver was stupid, and that I was acting like an idiot. In general I’m a pretty agreeable person, and I think he thinks I’m naive and will be taken advantage of by others, and that this was what had happened here. A bit of wider context is that I think his dad used to berate him like this (but worse) when he was young, and he thinks that because he didn’t go as far as his dad used to, what he did was reasonable and normal.

I got a semi-apology from him, but I’m really worried by the fact that he thought this behaviour was acceptable, and I don’t think he fully understands why I didn’t think it was. I don’t want to have orders barked at me when I make mistakes or do something differently than he would (especially when it has no bearing on him), or to be spoken down to like I’m a subordinate rather than his partner. He’s a great guy in many ways, and until this happened I thought we mostly had a pretty easy relationship and I was very much all in for the future.

There have been a couple of other instances in the year we’ve been together where he’s told me what to do regarding something that doesn’t have any bearing on him, and he can occasionally be blunt in how he expresses himself (which often results in me crying, as I’m pretty thin-skinned). When we’ve had disagreements in the past he’s generally been good at admitting when he’s wrong and apologising to me, and he’s also made it very clear he wants me to stand up to him when he crosses the line. He’s aware that he can be a bit ‘bossy’ and ‘fiery’ and I think he attempts to tone those down with me, but I’m very concerned by the fact that he didn’t see anything wrong with this behaviour. I would never dream of speaking to him in the way he spoke to me or telling him what to do (especially regarding something that had no impact on me). And I would never yell commands at him.

I love him but I want to be in a relationship where I’m treated like an equal, like someone who deserves to be spoken to respectfully even when I make mistakes. I was once in a very emotionally abusive relationship, and I promised myself I would never let myself be treated like that again. I know I deserve better and I’ve done a lot of work to become someone who knows that, but this episode has scared me. My boyfriend is nothing like my ex (who most definitely had Narcissistic Personality Disorder — I know the term ‘narcissist’ is very overused at the moment, but my ex fit the DSM criteria to a T), but I’m now very frightened that I might be with someone who expects to be able to control me, even if not to the same extent my ex did.

What I would like to know is: Do you think I’m within my rights to have this as a firm boundary and to enforce it? Do you think I’m overreacting to what my boyfriend did, as he seemed to think I was? What would you suggest I do next?

Problem is that's the only way I can properly cum. And now I don't think I can do that with him after he put this mental block here for me. It's been 3 months and I've just never done it since and I don't even feel comfortable being on top anymore.

He's a really lovely guy other than this, honestly. But this has me fucked up.

I have PTSD from a previous relationship where that guy was every kind of abusive he could be and he also is the only other person who said this, and I feel just so sad that they share that.

After that relationship I had to build towards just being able to masturbate again, I am not the same I was sexually before that relationship due to the abuse. It took over a year and a half to masturbate without crying or getting turned off or overwhelmed halfway through. I know it isn't everyones cup of tea, but I reached a point where I had to participate in exposure therapy by masturbating and it helped: but I clearly still have some pretty major issues when it comes to sex.

I've booked to see my psychologist in a few weeks and will be talking about it to them and other professionals, but I was wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and how you made your way back, if you made your way back.

I am looking for advice on how to deal with this situation or if I should leave because of it, so anything would be helpful. For context, I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for a year. We met in early November of 2021 in the gym of an apartment complex. We both lived just a couple doors down from each other on the same floor. At the time, I was having major problems with my roommates. When Spring of 2022 came around and our leases were about to be up, we decided to move in together. He didn't want to live in our old apartment complex anymore and the issues with my roommates and I had only worsened. My boyfriend promised me that he would take care of everything as I am still a full-time student in college taking extremely difficult courses with a heavy workload. He said all I had to do was pay half of the rent and if there were ever a month where I couldn't pay, to just let him know and he would pay the full thing if I needed him to, no questions asked. He clarified I wouldn't even have to pay him back, he just wanted us to live together. I still work a part-time job and pay for everything of my own including half the rent. I trusted him, as he had a stable job at the time and was seeming to like it. As time passed and we had moved in together, things at his job just got worse. He couldn't stand it anymore. It was taking a serious toll on his mental and physical health. He and I both decided that it was best for him to find a new job, and I would support us with my student loan money through the time he was in between jobs. I paid this last month's rent with that student loan money. He quickly got a new job and started working there and promised to pay me back the student loan money I had to use for rent. A couple weeks after starting his new job, my boyfriend came down with bronchitis-like symptoms that the doctors didn't fully diagnose aside from that. They gave him a doctors note, and my boyfriend wasn't at work for about two weeks. He tried to go in multiple times during that two week period, but the cough and dizziness and shortness of breath would get so bad that he would just come home. During this time at home, my boyfriend would constantly smoke. Every day when I would come home from class he had been smoking despite the bronchitis. It made me upset because I knew smoking wasn't going to help him get better and it felt like all he did while at home was smoke and play video games. He wouldn't even take the medication the providers prescribed him because he ""didn't think he needed it"". I expressed this frustration to him but the smoking never stopped. The way my boyfriend's job works is on a point system. Once you run out of points, you're automatically terminated. He started the job with 5 points, and lost 4 points due to missing work(keep in mind my boyfriend works in a freezer so the bronchitis symptoms would've just gotten worse had he gone to work anyways). Sunday, he found out that due to all the work he missed, he got scheduled to work on a day he usually has off. This day just happens to be tomorrow, the day of his family Thanksgiving. He was so upset about this, he left work early on Sunday and came home, using his last point. He talked to me about how upset he was that he was going to have to miss his family's Thanksgiving and that he wanted to just quit because he didn't want to miss it. I explained to him that we just got out of the rutt from the last job he quit and we can't afford for him to quit another one. I also reminded him that my family invited my boyfriend's family to my family's Thanksgiving the next day and he could see them then since he would have that day off. While I know how important family is to him, we can't afford to not have an income right now. He came from a family with decent money, I did not. He does not stress out about money the way I do.  I was recently in a car accident that put me out a lot. Not to mention the upcoming rent, gas for the car I'm currently driving, my student bills that I have to pay to register for next semester's classes, etc.  Last night he smoked again. Tonight, he just came home and told me that he quit his job because he was having a hard time breathing in the freezer and because he wanted to choose his family and health over his job. This is the second job he's quit in the past 2 months out of nowhere. I honestly believe that he quit because he wanted to go to his family's Thanksgiving. Keep in mind, his family was invited and welcomed to meet my family and come to our Thanksgiving too(which is the day after his family's Thanksgiving). We also could've gone to see his family another time too. I understand wanting to see his family on a holiday, but I am terrified now that we won't have the money to keep living in our apartment. I don't know what to do. I love him, but he promised me he would take care of us while I'm in school and he's not staying true to his word. Him and I have had many issues before this, all of which he has tried to fix or get better at, etc. But I don't want to be with a man who I can't trust to take care of me when he promised me that he would. I don't want to be with a man who won't keep his job because it gets tough or because he doesn't want to.

We’ve been in a relationship for just under 3 months. Unfortunately, I am completely unhinged and mentally ill. I can’t seem to separate my childhood and relationships with my family from my romantic relationships. Today I went crazy on my man  but well within my right. I saw some stuff on his phone that shouldn’t be there and I confronted him about it. 

I act irrationally and try my hardest to hurt the other person with words just so I can affect them and I don’t know why. I am still respectful, I don’t swear at him or call him anything but I try to articulate it in a sense that will still hurt him. 

My parents were never affectionate or cared for me, I have 3 other siblings and I was always the odd one out. I’ve been estranged from my dad for almost 4 years now and he was an awful man who was so incredibly angry and jealous and controlling. I used to shame my mum and be disappointed in her for not being able to leave, thinking they didn’t love each other or was just unhealthy attachment. Here I am, 3 months into a relationship, incapable of leaving because I’m in love with him. I know he loves me too and I know he wants me to be his girlfriend for a long time but I am incapable of healing or moving on from things ever. It’s actually a massive problem. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I’ve done tests for BPD, my old doctor tried to test me for PTSD and am trying to do a test for ADHD and potentially autism. I was almost diagnosed with BPD but I was around 16 years old and in the U.K. you have to kind of ‘tick off’ a certain amount of symptoms to be diagnosed with something. In this case, my old psychiatrist ‘ticked off’ 4/9 symptoms instead of the needed 5/9 so I ended up not having a BPD diagnosis. 

Usually when I’m angry with my boyfriend I go completely mute and am unable to speak to him for hours. Even though the words are in my head and I want to scream at him, it’s like my lips are sewn shut. I’ve tried so hard to not let my mental health affect our relationship and to try and be open and communicate with him but I’ve done enough, it’s him that has to try now. 

This is sort of a rant, but I ended up telling him that I don’t plan on breaking up with him but it will take me a long time to even be normal around him again or feel comfortable.

Now my boyfriend is upset at the whole situation and told me that when he’s at his families house if the dinner is ready late (like around 4pm) he won’t miss his families dinner just to make it on time to my families dinner. My family literally postponed the dinner for HIM and this is how he reacts and comments, instead of making sure with his stepmom that the food is going to be ready on time. His excuse for not wanting to pressure her is because she “wakes up at 3am just to get  thanksgiving dinner ready for us”.  

My family cannot postpone the dinner anymore (I didn’t ask and I won’t ask them to change the time again when they already worked around HIS schedule and set it up at a time good for HIM and this is how he reacts) since we would be having it at a park because we have an extremely large family and it already gets dark at 6:00pm here. 

With the schedule we had already planned it was even and fair, each family had 2 hours with us until we had to go. Now, he just wants to please his stepmom and forget the fact that my family pushed our dinner for HIM to work around HIS schedule and this is how he acts instead.

Should we just not celebrate thanksgiving dinner together and just spend it with our family instead? If that’s the case, I will end this relationship because this is just the start of what’s yet to come in the future years and holidays. He IS my family and that’s why I want to spend it with him and vice versa, however he’s not treating each family equally and putting his family over mine, spending more time with them, and disregarding the fact that my family is working with HIS schedule to suit his needs but is still not pleased.

Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse

Background Info: When I was 8, my older brother m*lested me (he was almost 13 and entering high school). I have barely any memories from childhood, so I cannot remember the majority of it. However, when this memory came back, it was when I was 18 and already left the house. It came back because I had a similar situation with my partner disrespecting my boundaries when getting intimate for the first time. When it came back, it was so vivid that I felt like I went back in time when remembering it. It felt like I relived it. 

My family did not support me when I came out about it &amp; privately asked them for advice about how to talk to my brother about it. My father told me it was a fake memory, since I started seeing a therapist at that time - so she ""planted the idea in my head"" and mother said he was a child so it doesn't mean anything - it was ""only natural sibling exploration"" when it seems like it was far from that, my brother gave me a UTI from what he did that day. I later had to go to the hospital from having blood clots in my urine. 

Ever since then, my dad has felt the need to make jokes about the sexual a*sault from time to time and has made me feel so uncomfortable. He has said many shady things and I am starting to feel like my dad may have done something to me too. He has been physically ab*sive all my life and has always disrespected the boundaries of my siblings and I: 

-When I came out about what happened with my brother, he let it slip that he would have seen him do that to me - because when we were children, he had cameras in every room that were disguised as smoke detectors. When I felt horrified, I asked him if that means these cameras were in the bathrooms and bedrooms and he got extremely defensive and snapped at me and said ""NO! just the common areas where you kids would play, I only did that to protect you to make sure the nannies didn't do anything to you"" it's weird though because my mom was a stay at home mom and was always around even with housekeepers and nannies  - so I am confused for why he felt the need to do that? Also I'm confused why nobody was told this until after we were 18.

He does have an obsession with watching us to this day too:

-He has cameras in the kitchen, living room, and office areas that record audio. These cameras are obvious though, and he even makes comments about what we said when he wasn't there. He says it's to ""see if we are doing chores"" but it has always given me a very uncomfortable feeling like there is more to it. 

-When we were teenagers &amp; even when I moved out of the house, he insisted on having access to my icloud and letting him know the password, even though I was very uncomfortable with it. He said he won't help pay for my phone plan if I don't share that with him, when I had no form of income at the time. He also would check the wifi router obsessively and would comment and make jokes on anything sexual that my siblings and I searched, by ourselves privately, when teenagers. He would start to say shady things when I was a teenager which made me think he was reading my messages when I was sexting guys - since it seemed eerily similar to what I mentioned in the messages (for ex: he randomly mentioned kinks I talked about privately with those guys &amp; would bring them up the same day and make fun of them). 

-When we moved to a new house, when I entered middle school, he renovated it completely. We stopped showering with him when we moved to the house - since my mom did not allow it when I turned 11. He made it so every single room has motion detectors, including the bedrooms and bathrooms, in which he gets notifications sent to his phone for every movement made. He also has the lights connected to his phone and turns them off through his phone. He says it's to save money on electricity, but whenever I am in the shower or tub he turns the lights off at least 4-5 times, and then I have to walk over naked to turn on the lights. I always thought that was a little strange since it's only when I am showering or in the tub and barely happens in any other rooms. I am truly worried that there might be cameras in the bathroom now, since this has been a common thing that he has done ever since I was a teenager - to the point where I always know to expect he will turn the lights off when I am bathing. 

He has also has done other things that were a little strange, while growing up. For example, when my little sister came out about how she was m*lested as a child and told us it was her friend's father, my dad got extremely paranoid and seemed off. He asked me behind her back if she was framing him or making up lies about him doing that since he thought she was ""very mentally unstable"" since she had been in and out of the mental hospital during this so ""there's a chance she might try to frame him"" he seemed very nervous and oddly frantic. 

-I always felt very uncomfortable around him when he tried to hug me as a teenager since it felt like his hands were a little too close around the sides of my boobs when he was hugging me. I felt guilty for thinking that it was something weird but now idk. When I had an eating disorder he yelled at me and made fun of me and said that I need to gain weight since I ""look very unattractive now"" because I have ""the chest of a 12 year old boy"" When I ran up the stairs one time in front of him, he slapped my ass. I got very uncomfortable, since I was 17 at the time and he yelled ""why are you making it weird? I can do whatever to you, I'm your dad"" he got very pissed.

I think my dad may have done something and I am starting to get suspicious when remembering things that do not add up. Fortunately, I don't live in the house anymore but they do ask me to visit quite frequently.

When that woman's video came out on TikTok about how she discovered her husband was recording her minor children in the shower, I began replaying the video over and over obsessively and started having a panic attack. I haven't been able to sleep since then and have been having nightmares. I have been very on edge and ask my partner to not touch me when he's around me.

I can't stop worrying that my dad may have also been recording us in the shower as children &amp; I feel so sick when I think of my dad. My younger siblings live there so I am worried about them and I just want to ask you all, if it seems likely that he may have done this, or if I might just be paranoid. I am just not sure where to go from here and I cannot stop thinking about strange things my dad did when growing up. I feel guilty for thinking this may be possible tbh.

I’ve been thinking about and planning to move in with my boyfriend(28) for a pretty long time now and really started taking moving in with him seriously maybe four months ago-ish. We’ve been together over two years and the relationship I have with him is by far the healthiest and most stable I’ve ever known. I kind of want to cry just thinking about it because he makes me feel so safe and my nervous system is actually regulated around him. 

T (Mom’s bf) is the main culprit that pushed me to actually want to move out. I don’t want to spend too long explaining for fear no one will read my novel length stories, but I will give a summary of what it is like living with him. One time he threw a fit because I had food in the refrigerator, throw a fit because I was doing a care map (for nursing school) on the dining table, and  there was this one instance not that long ago where I was eating breakfast and he randomly picked a fight and started telling me I’m lazy, I never leave the house, I don’t do any housework, I don’t help my Mom out, I should be ashamed of myself bc I’m 20 and live with my Mom, etc (all of which are not true). For this last situation I told him he was wrong and started explaining the workload of being in nursing school, working, and how I do x, y, and z around the house and he literally just told me No and I was wrong/lying. He later told my mom that I was just being dramatic and was exaggerating and ‘all he did was politely ask if I could please do a bit more around the house🥺’. 😑. 

Anyway, when I told my brother (autistic) that I (also autistic) will be moving in with M (my bf) he got angry at me, told me not to talk to him, and left the room. The only other time I brought up the topic he covered his ears with his hands and just kept talking over me and saying that he couldn’t hear me and wouldn’t be listening. He also argues with me when I refer to the stray cat M and I have been taking care of as ours and insists on the cat being M’s and not ours. When asked why he was acting like that he said it’s because he “dosen’t want me to lose my religion.” My bf and I don’t subscribe to any religion and my family is catholic and do not approve. 

When I told my Mom I was thinking about moving out months ago she cried and tried to make me feel bad about it. Earlier today the topic got brought up again and I told her I will be moving out at the end of the semester (about three weeks). She has been crying and trying to make me feel bad. It’s working. I feel guilty. I feel like I’m betraying my family. I hate having to take care of their feelings. It feels like I have to overcompensate and over analyze things to make up for what they can’t regulate themselves. 

My Mom keeps asking me why I’m moving out and it makes me so angry. Like why do I have to have and explain to her (and defend) a specific reason to move out? I’m an adult. That’s the reason? I want to live with my significant other?

Hello, everyone. Like the title says I want to pursue a friendship, but I have a lot of uncertainty and barriers in the way. I want advice about a specific situation.

To give you some background I live in the UK. I haven't worked in a long time due to mental health issues (including anxiety). Don't worry, guys. I am doing a lot better now and actively moving towards getting back into work. I also want to get my life back on track and become less socially isolated, which brings me to the topic of this post.

The last place I worked was a supermarket, and there was a guy there who had his induction at the same time as me. I actually started the job a few months before him, but my induction was delayed. I am extremely shy but he was nice to me. He was a jokey guy and I found him funny. Anyway, I left the job fairly suddenly without saying anything to co-workers. I wasn't fired;  I just handed in my notice quietly. It was a sudden decision because I was struggling with my  mental health and various other issues. 

Several times outside of work, he said hi to me, but I was so shocked that I didn't know how to react and didn't respond to him. One time, I just stopped in my tracks and looked shocked before walking on without saying anything. This was all due to my extreme shyness and anxiety. After I left the job, I was actively trying to avoid all old co-workers,  including him, because  I felt ashamed of my mental health problems and the fact that I had left the job.

I barely left the house for a few years (due to mental health reasons) so I didn't see him in that time. However, last year, I started going out again and visited the supermarket. He still works there. At first, I wasn't sure he remembered me, but a few months ago he said hello and used my name so I realised he must do. I said hi back, but I think my voice was too quiet, and I didn't make eye contact. Before this recent greeting, I noticed he was looking at me, and a few other times he passed close by me in a way that seemed intentional. I wonder if he wanted me to say hello first. After another occasion of his saying hello, I realised that my quiet voice and lack of eye contact might come across as ignoring him. So I decided to give CLEAR eye contact to him next time and say hello before he did. I did this, and he responded. It was scary to do it, but I felt better and was glad that I made it clear that I wasn't ignoring him. We said hello to each other another time, and I felt that he was hanging about at the end of one of the aisles trying to observe me. Did he want to chat?

For the last couple of weeks,  I haven't had a chance to speak to him, but I have seen him in the supermarket and about the town (it's a small town). I just never got the chance to speak to him or even say hello. We were too far away from each other, and I feel too shy to holler a greeting - which I would have had to!

I think he seems cool, and I felt encouraged by the fact he said hello after all this time. I want to try getting to know him a bit more, but I have no idea how to go about doing this, and I am worried it might come across as a bit weird, or even creepy or obsessive. I could go to the till when he is serving, but I would feel super shy. I always use self-service anyway, lol. One of my regrets is that I never got to know my co-workers. I feel this could be a chance to change that.

What do you all think? Should I just move on and forget it, and instead look for new friendships elsewhere? Or should I give it a try? If so, how do I go about it without being too awkward or odd?

I (27f) love my boyfriend (25m) and I live with him. But it’s not my ideal relationship. Honestly, not even close. He’s asked me about marriage multiple times in the past year (we’ve been together for 2 but also dated before for about 6 months). The issue is that everytime he brings up marriage, I start to panic, yet we’re literally already living together. 

I want someone who does the little things, meets me halfway (in ideas, finances, compromise, time, energy.. everything that we can).. I want someone who pushes me to do better and be better and loves every part of me. Someone who’s social and pushes me out of my comfort zone, who gets along with my friends and family. I want to not be scraping the bottom of the barrel financially and have time and money to travel and do things with the people I love. 

Here’s the thing, I don’t know if my boyfriend can give me any of that. No matter how much he works, I end up picking up the slack in our bills (and right now, he makes more than I do). I’m not saying that any guy should ever have to shoulder all the finances but he can’t treat me to dinner because he always seems to be out of money. Can’t pay for anything on trips, never helps buy groceries and has an expensive pallet, never brings home anything little for me except like Taco Bell sometimes. But I do all of these things despite making less. All of the housework is on me unless I explicitly ask him to do something and even then, chances are, it wouldn’t get done. On top of this, we have nothing in common (except a degree of laziness and love) and I despise his family. He doesn’t care for my family either - he says they’re overbearing. They’re a little over the top but they’re at least supportive.. I get anxiety around his friends and he gets anxiety around mine. He also doesn’t like a big part of me. I work in the psychology field but even before, I was all of my friends’ counselor growing up. It’s just a part of who I am to look at things differently. I try to keep my opinions to myself though. I never give advice because I don’t want to shoulder the outcome so I always make people find their own advice and I’m super empathetic. He hates this about me. He thinks I’m “going all counselor on him”. It’s just me. Pre-trained personality that no matter how much I try, I can’t fully get rid of. I cry when I’m mad or upset or uncomfortable.. he told me a couple months ago that he hates when I cry- not because he doesn’t want to see me upset but because it makes him uncomfortable and I cry too much. Mind you, I cry like once or twice a month tops. But now, I haven’t let a single tear drop in 2 months because it feels like I’m a burden. 
We act like kids together and being with him is fun and I just love him. But I’m becoming complacent. I like to watch tv and he likes to play video games so we don’t go out and do anything. I think he has a good heart and he’s incredibly smart. But trying to talk about serious things is a chore. Every time I try to bring up one of things above, or raising kids, he shuts down and doesn’t want to talk about it. 

I’ve been second guessing myself this past month a lot..
My best friend is a guy. I’ve had feelings for him before (and him vice versa) but not so much in the past few years. I know we’re not attracted to each other now. I’ve got a good 200 lbs on him and sex is important to both of us &amp; I just don’t see people that I could break that way.. When we were in hs, we set up this pact that if we’re both still single when he’s 30 (he’s 28), we’d get married and figure it out from there.. maybe have an open relationship. We were driving around and talking a few weeks ago about how we both know we’re settling in our relationships. I told him that one of the many reasons I was afraid of walking away was because a big fear of mine is being alone and he said that he had 3 points.. all of them being that he’s almost 30. I could tell he was half joking so I just joked back, “what you wanna run off and get married?” He was driving and just said “let’s go” and stepped on the gas until we both chuckled it off. He has since broken up with his girlfriend after tension had been running high with them for a couple months, which has spiraled me into this post. 
Everything that I want in a relationship, he already gives me or would give me. He always does those small things. He’ll buy me things randomly. He’ll split grocery bills with me for no reason other than to be nice. He’ll treat me to dinner and I’ll treat him to dinner. He loves my family like his own. &amp; I love his. I don’t love all his friends but I don’t get anxiety around them either. He’s the same way with mine. He can get along great with anyone even if they aren’t his exact friend type. He’s incredibly social. Like a golden retriever! We travel together a lot. Split bills a lot. He pushes me to do better. He was encouraging every step of my education. Asks for my psychological opinion and genuinely enjoys hearing it. Never asks me to turn a part of myself off. Is ALWAYS there when I need him, whether I’m crying or not. Hell, he cries sometimes. When we disagree on something, we can usually find a middle ground or at least agree to stop talking about it and try again later. He pays his bills for sure. He even pays some of his parents.. When I want to lose weight, he’s the first one on board to help but also never makes me feel bad about myself unless I ask him to for some tough love encouragement and even then, it’s all sarcastic and light. We’ve grown immensely in the past 10 years and I genuinely can’t picture my life without him. Even if I stay with my boyfriend, I wouldn’t have to. He and my current partner are friends now. He’s the only friend of mine my current bf likes.. I’m not attracted to my best friend and honestly, I’m not even sure if I have feelings for him, but I know when I look at my future, the future I want is the one I could have with him if I did.. 
I don’t want to throw away a long relationship with someone I love, but I also know that this isn’t fair to him. But I worry about his mental health if I were to leave. Sometimes I feel like he would prefer me questioning in the relationship versus out of it as long as I didn’t act on it. 
I don’t know what to do from here. Do I tell my bestfriend all of this and risk everything? Do I stay in this relationship? Is there a way to do both without truly becoming the asshole? Does it even matter if I’m not attracted to him and don’t know if I even have feelings? I don’t know- I’m just lost and I only have 1 friend who I can bother with this and she’s biased towards the best friend because they’re also close.

In a committed relationship, I have never experienced a man who does not “gawk” at other woman’s butts or boobs whether “better” or the same as mine and it always upsets me and makes me lose respect for my man. It is hurtful and makes me feel like especially when I am not around they do it too and probably worse or even flirt with the girl.

We got along pretty well. I didn’t allow him to know too much about myself and I didn’t ask a whole lot about his personal life either. For me, getting to know someone well = feelings, which in my opinion are not good in casual relationships.

We tried to make plans to hang out during this time but he was always busy with work, which made sense. He works long hours, early mornings/late nights, is sometimes on call and lives on the land where his job is. So I never thought too much of it. He let me know that his time here in this area would be short as he was going to relocate for work this month. This kind of set me back a bit and we started to talk a little less. I work a lot as well and have a child, so my schedule was busy also. I just figured we would never meet in person.

Admittedly, even with not meeting him in person, just talking to him over messages started to make me like him. I found him interesting and I really liked a lot of his qualities. I was drawn to him very quickly. I tried hard to keep my feelings out of this but I couldn’t.

After weeks of going back and fourth with talking and making plans that never fell through, we finally met about two weeks ago. We just took a short drive and talked, it was quite nice and everything seemed to flow perfectly. Honestly, I did have a few drinks before going with him just to calm the nerves. It made me a lot more confident and he asked to see me again the next night. (That plan never fell through.) I didn’t really talk to him much after that because I was a bit upset.

He reached out again last weekend to see me again before he left for the holiday. I agreed and he ended up coming to my apartment. Things were more awkward and I was extremely nervous because I am typically a shy person when I’m sober. I slowly started to warm up to him, but I did a small action that he said gave him “the ick.” I wasn’t sure if he was serious or not. Either way, we ended up hooking up. It was short and a bit unsatisfying for that reason but regardless, I wasn’t bothered by it. After that I think he may have been completely put off by me or he was embarrassed. I started to question if I’d done something wrong but he seemed to enjoy it in the moment.

After this, I let my insecurities get the best of me and all of our interactions since have been minimal and negative. He didn’t talk to me much after that. So I messed up twice and acted out of hurt/anger and I also have a hard time with my seasonal depression. The first time I told him that we didn’t need to interact anymore and asked him to block me so I couldn’t reach out to him if I ever were to drunk text him. (I know how I am, and I know I wouldn’t be able to stop myself.) He told me that was fine if I ever did that and I told him it wasn’t fine. I think he was okay with me still talking to him but I kept pushing his buttons and said that I regret sleeping with him. He said he was sorry and if he could take it back he would. I told him that he didn’t need to pretend to care and he told me multiple times that he did care. At this point I apologized and asked if I ruined anything between us. He said I did yes I did “a bit,” and again I apologized. I felt bad and explained to him that I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and I was sorry for reacting emotionally. I went as far to say that I didn’t regret anything we did but I would leave him alone because I didn’t want him to completely dislike me. He hasn’t read my message, and now I’m just wondering if there’s anything I can do to repair this “relationship.” I really do like him and I’m genuinely sorry, but now I don’t know how I can get him to look past this.

TLDR: Met a guy on a dating app. Didn’t meet him for weeks but when we finally did meet we had a good night and then hooked up the second time we hung out. Now we haven’t talked much and I reacted to this emotionally. I gave him the “ick” and now I am remorseful for how I acted.

It sometimes feels like I am unloved and unwanted, yet we see each other often and we are always affectionate in some way or other. After the argument, she told me I could sleep on the sofa or leave. I left. 

I returned the following morning and it was uneasy. We finally sat down and held hands and I said 'Can we get through this?' to which she replied 'I hope so'. I gave her a foot massage, she gave me a hand massage. We watched TV cuddling up on the sofa and then we went to bed, falling asleep in each others arms. We woke, she then took me to work, holding hands on the way. She kissed me on the lips twice as is our 'thing' and we parted ways. I messaged her yesterday and she seemed a little off but OK. Today I didn't message her until later as I thought I'd give her some space. I asked if she wanted to see me on Wednesday to which she replied 'I will be probably be back late tomorrow and I've got some bits to catch up on'.

Me and this girl are on the same course at university and we've been friends with each other for over a year now. We met at a pub crawl, but it wasn't really until January this year that we became much closer friends when we were each others lab partners. At this point we were doing a lot of stuff together, and went out for drinks after every lab session (we actually kissed in february but thats irrelevant because we were both drunk). However towards the end of our project she began not turning up to sessions anymore. I knew she was going through a state of more severe depression but I didn't know anything as to what caused it.

I didn't really see her again until the start of the new academic year in september because I was out of the country the whole summer, but when we met up again we hooked up the first night we met. At this point our relationship turned into a friends with benefits thing, but I understood that we were getting much closer together.

It was at this point that I learned that her last relationship she was in, which had gone on for a year and a half and ended sometime around April/May, was abusive. As in she was sexually abused, had up to £5k worth of stuff stolen from her and the guy would consistently never leave her room even when asked, to the point where she had to call security on him a lot of times. In fact this was the reason she fell into a depression before, and learning of all of this I was kinda upset at myself because had I connected a few dots there were maybe a few situations I could've helped avoid. But I digress.

We're about two months from when we first met up again and I really like this girl. I know she likes me too. However there have been situations that have been difficult to wrap my head around fully even though I know they're likely due to the stuff that she's gone through. There's been times when she's criticised my flaws unecessarily, and she's often kicked me out of her house at 5am. She finds it hard to express her emotions with me, and there was one point where she broke down after sex and apologised over and over again.

Still I know her intentions aren't malicious, because whenever she says something cruel to me she apologises a lot and makes an actual effort to change. But I'm wondering if its maybe too soon for her to be in a relationship again at all, or maybe she didn't really want to be in a relationship with a friend. I'm wondering how I'd be able to talk to her about how she feels - or if thats even a good idea. I'd like to consider myself very empathetic and that I'm very capable of seeing things from other people's points of view, but I'm blatantly privileged that I've never been through a situation like she has and I can't possibly fully understand how her experiences have shaped the way that she has treated me. So I'd really appreciate it if someone could open my eyes as to what she might be thinking.

We always fought and argued here and there prior to living together but since moving in with her, it’s gotten so much worse. Multiple times now, either of us has declared the relationship over only for her to beg me not to leave and physically block the exit. The last big blowup like this saw her throwing a book at my head and when I tried to leave, she immediately switched up, blocked the door, and screamed that she couldn’t live without me. 

This most recent time came from me openly expressing that I was having a very bad day on all fronts and that I may be a little gloomy or off when I got home from work. This was met with little response from her. When I got home, she asked if I had gone to the store like I said I would if I had time to after work, and I said “no, I forgot and was just focused on getting home, but I can run out again right now if you’d like. If not, we can go together tomorrow (this was another option that I had given her earlier on if I didn’t happen to hit the store after work).” Her response was to immediately become rude, condescending, and bitter. When I told her that she was being rude and kind of hurtful, she defended it by saying that I was being difficult. 

 This is the most common issue we’ve had lately. If I’m ever not in a great mood, I’ll tell her ahead of time so that she knows I’m not just being rude for no reasons. Or if she tells me I’m speaking hurtfully, I’ll apologize and say that I wasn’t meaning to. On the flip side, if I tell her she’s hurting my feelings somehow, she either denies it, rolls her eyes/scoffs at me, or justifies it with something like the aforementioned “well you’re being difficult”. I’ve bent over backwards to drive home that we need to speak more kindly to each other and listen when the other person is saying that they’re being made to feel a certain way. I’ve also tried to get us to work on being emotionally transparent, like me saying that I was upset and angry from my day and probably wouldn’t be feeling my best right away. I’m doing everything I can to work on this and be better for her, and meanwhile I have to beg her to do the same and beg her for an apology any time she crosses a line or is in the wrong. When I do get them (not most of the time), it’s just an annoyed “okay, sorry? There.” And it’s the best I’ll get. Any other time, I’m somehow the one apologizing, or I’m just okay with not getting one because if I press it anymore it’ll make her feel bad or she’ll storm out. 

I was upset and I went to go make her dinner without saying anything else, and she followed me and said “so is this how you’re going to act for the rest of the night?” I told her that she knew I was upset and out of sorts from work and that if I was speaking badly that I apologize, but she was being unnecessarily rude and condescending and I wanted her to apologize. She continued to deflect and yell at me until I pointed out that I offered without hesitation to go back out to the store or that she could come with me tomorrow and was not being difficult, and she told me to get out because she couldn’t stand being near me. So I left. I’m sitting in a dark parking lot now. 

The reasons I would leave:
-she cannot apologize when she is in the wrong

-she does not respect our dedication to emotional transparency or communication

-she speaks to me however she wants, knows that she is being unnecessarily rude or hurtful, and justifies or outright denies it

-I don’t know who I am as an individual anymore

-she demands constant praise and (non-sexual) physical affection but does not reciprocate nor show any desire to give me the same, and I practically have to beg to get these from her as well

-is hurtful when she is in a bad mood, lies about being in the bad mood, and then later will say she was only acting the way she was because of the bad mood that I was told was not the case, but will lay into me if I tell her I am in a bad mood and don’t immediately snap out of it 

-I’m afraid that for as long as we are together, my potential is hindered

Here is why I’m scared of leaving:
-I’m in dire straits financially rn and cannot afford to find another apartment in the city. I’ll have to move back in with my parents. 

-I just landed a really great job and, since I would need to move out of town if I left, would lose it

-we have a cat together

-we’ve sunk more time and money into making this relationship work than I even want to think about

-neither of us have any line of support near us. All of our friends have moved away and she would be hours from her family if I left.

-so much of the furniture and basic stuff in that apartment is mine. The couch, tv, all of the kitchen stuff, all of the cleaning appliances, the desk, etc. If I left, she would have nothing, nor the money to replace it. 

-we’ve been planning our future together. 

-she said that it’s either me or she’s staying single for life, and I cannot live with the thought of her alone

-I still love her. 

TL;DR I’m afraid that I’m in a toxic relationship and I may be approaching the time to leave, but our lives are so interwoven that doing so would likely ruin both of our lives.

It’s had its moments of lows, but we come back to each other. We really love each other and have a strong emotional connection. Technically as of right now we aren’t together, but we’re still very close. We talk a lot, talk about our future together, etc. We want to be with each other for good. 

BUT!!! Since we aren’t together she has a FWB with a guy she met in the couple months. She sees him just so she can have sex and get that side of pleasure. She told me, “I have a strong emotional connection with you (me). I have a strong sexual connection with him.” She is sleeping with him cause she wants to explore more of what she likes and stuff. They met when her and I were “on a break” and not talking. 

I love her more than anything, I’ve never had the feelings remotely close to what I have for her than anybody else. 

I don’t want to tell her that she has to pick, cause I know she ultimately wants to be with me. Just right now we can’t cause of the distance. 

It’s a very specific situation, but has anybody ever been in a situation like this? Or at least any advice?

my only lead to why i feel like this is that in my last relationship i was frequently forced and pressured to be intimate and it totally altered my view of sex and healthy relationships, but it’s so unfair to my current boyfriend when he hasn’t done anything wrong. i just really don’t know what to do and i feel bad telling him since it’s a totally personal issue.

When we met, we fell in love fast. 3-4 days in we already had sex and I became unequivocally attached to him. Those beginning years were filled with drugs, stealing, cheating, deceit, &amp; heartache. I am proud to say that he’s really come far, that he truly is a man I can love.


Before I met him, I was taking to a guy online that I met from a mutual friend. He was quite like me. He was romantic, saw right through me. He loved me instantly. I lead him on and killed a potential future with him when I met my current boyfriend. Had he had not been in a different state, had my current boyfriend not be in a different school, I believe I would’ve went for him.


My love for the original guy never died, my boyfriend has known this our whole relationship. But I accepted him, I had his heart my home and somewhere I can be comfortable in. But there was always something missing. A part of me that I only shared with the original guy. A part of me my current bf couldn’t give.


I reconnected with the original guy recently. He still loves me, he always has. His words never fail to make me weak in my knees. When I imagine happiness I imagine him. It made me realize I really do, truly, love him. That if I still wanted him he would be there.


I’ve kept my bf in the loop of all of this. He’s very accepting. So is the other guy, he said wouldn’t hold it against me if I stayed where I am and understands fully. They’ve both been so selfless, only wanting my happiness.


Because my bf cheated on me so many times and I suffered so many blows to the heart, the idea of him with someone else breaks me. I’ve worked hard to make him mine. Despite finally being in a place where I feel we are most stable, something still draws me to the original guy. I put him through so much pain when I went with someone else. He only dreamed of being with me.


I’m young, I don’t need to be tied down to the one relationship that I’ve ever experienced. I also don’t need to dismantle it for something clearly unknown. I’m lost. If I stay where I am, I am passive to my current fate, the one that made me question all of this to begin with. If I choose the ladder, I’d have to rip myself away from my home and suffer the consequences of leaving a relationship that I had no true problems with.


During the course of our relationship, I’d always wanted to run away and forget about him. To forget about my life and turn to something new. Yet as the opportunity presents itself, by the one person who I would trust with my life to take me away, I still hesitate. The memories of our relationship come pouring into my mind, and I see all the good and bad moments before my eyes. Nothing I can compare or weigh would be conclusive. Both choices have an equal chance of being the wrong choice.

I asked him why he does it, especially since he has free porn everywhere he can look up if he has urges (I still don’t like porn), and he said “because I can??? Because I have free will?”. He said I was the most controlling person asking him to unfollow these pages, and that it was a red flag to snoop through his following (that is seen by the public eye), berated me, and called me “fucking insane” to which he then eventually apologized, and unfollowed more than 200 pages of thirst trap accounts on tik tok (some of which were of girls just a year or 2 over 18)

I’m an accountant, so early on we agreed that the finances would be managed by me, but I always insist that she sit down with me and be made aware of our financial situation so there was complete transparency with regards to our financial position. Unfortunately she has a tremendous deficiency in financial literacy which makes this even worse.

We have a child with a chronic condition which costs ~$12-$15k a year to manage, and that’s a massive chunk of my take-home pay, and the result is that we are basically scraping by on credit cards most of the time.

My wife suffers from severe emotional health issues (as a result of her traumatic past), which often impairs her ability to make rational decisions with money. It’s beginning to become a problem, since we discuss her spending habits and it’s not pleasant, but she knows she’s not in the right and accepts it. 

With student loans coming back next year and the debt we are already in, I worry that, if I tell her that I got a raise, she will perceive it as “things are ok and I can spend money a little more now” which has happened in the past. 

I’m almost at the point of where I want to cancel the credit cards in her name so she can’t use them. 

I don’t want to lie to her ever, but I don’t know what else to do.

I don’t want to be controlling, but I have to think of our long term plans and the needs of our kids.

My BF of 2 and half yrs is the most lazy person I’ve ever seen… he can’t keep a job he’s lazy. 

 he’s 32yo wants to work in IT ( a dream that will never come true to be honest )  never pays his bills , rent or food .
He lives rent free and eat free all the time . I’m always paying when we go out to eat or movies etc anything and he’s comfortable with that , sadly now I don’t ask to go out bc I’m tired of paying for everything all the time . 
I pay for absolutely everything ( I’m wrong I know but sadly if I don’t pay I’m homeless ) he keeps saying he’s working on something and he will make money eventually and will help .
He’s a nice guy we don’t argue , he’s so relaxed and calm to the point where it drives me crazy sometimes .
What it bothers me is the fact that he doesn’t care because He knows I can afford .
He told me the other day , I have to pretend he’s not here because if I was single I’d still have bills and rent to pay …
Wtf ????
He’s careless about everything in life,
Has zero priorities… he works 2 days a week bc he needs more time to be on his computer … he makes enough to pay is car insurance , phone bill at least that bc some months I have to pay his bills .
I put gas all the time bc apparently it’s what I should do as I’m the one who uses the car more ( not true but I don’t even complain ) .This is driving me crazy so I had a conversation and told him he needs to help.
He works only 2 days a week  and he’s always very negative about my professional life saying I should do more for me .. this makes me so mad literally if it’s not me we starve to death…. And I accept whatever opinion he has but when I tell he’s not the best person to talk I always get the same answer “we are not talking about me , don’t attack me “ arghh 🙄.
I know he will  never change at this point  I can sadly confirm this 💯.

He told me before he’s more “relaxed” bc he has me but today he told me I’d leave if we ever get to the point where we can’t afford rent or food bc that means we are not adding anything positive and we shouldn’t be together.
I was fuming and I told him that he’s using me and he said of course not I can just go and sleep in the car .
I found out that he has debts everywhere and the fact he can’t keep a job is a normal thing apparently he does that all the time he always complains after 3 months .
Im literally fuming … I know he will leave if I tell him too with no money or food .
He simply doenst care .
I don’t know what else to do .

I am also the first woman he kisses. 
He is mostly used to chasing women who end up friend zoning him, and he is missing the the thrill of the chase ingredient in our dynamic.
We had a conversation about our connection, he said he still wants to date me exclusively and see this through but his feelings not being intense is throwing him off. He does understand that his feelings for his past interest were just adrenaline and craving that high since it was always one sided interests until now. 
I also have had toxic relationships and did feel confused by the lack of the high, but we both feel like our connection feels like sitting in a lake calmly on a nice warm day, and it has us both somewhat confused but wanting to see where it leads us. 
We know pretty much everything that happens in each other’s lives, and we end up going on long dates that turn into overnight weekends most of the time, a couple of times when I had been upset he’ll do really nice gestures to cheer me up, and we do talk to each other about deeper stuff and I know about all different people in his life and what they are up to as well, and he does with mine. When there’s a miscommunication, we both address it calmly and immediately act.
To me it feels like a relationship already. 

I have noticed that in the past couple of weeks he is more comfortable and open with me, so maybe it is just time that he needs to make it official. I wonder if reading this shows any red flags that I might be missing. What’s a reasonable timeline for me to bring talking about “us” again if he doesn’t?

I am finishing up my last few weeks of college, and she is working full time. We met through work at a bar two years ago, started hanging out this summer, and finally started dating at the end of it before I wanted to go back to school.

She has a disturbing past, and it always bothered me, causing a lot of tension. There are a lot of other things and reasons that bother me and destroy my trust for her, both before and after we started dating. I won't get into all these details. One important story is that we went out with her friends two weeks ago to a college bar at a school her friends lived near. Everything was great until she started crying and stormed off and away without telling me. I thought I upset her. She had my phone, wallet, keys, ID, everything. I was slightly buzzed and covered in beer, soaking wet, and stuck outside the bar. She apparently was ""throwing up"" but honestly didn't seem that drunk. I felt abandoned and lost and was very disturbed that she didn't alert me to not feeling well. I only brought this up the next day. The point of this story is that I felt abandoned with nothing.

Our relationship has been rocky for three months now. I am more stressed out than I have ever been before. We fight over really small things, the same big things over and over, and never seem to come to an agreement. After a week of arguing long distance, I drove home to her mom's house to see her. I hadn't committed 100% to breaking up with her, but that was my plan. We ultimately had a good night and no appropriate time to talk with her, so nothing happened. On Friday night, we had plans to go shopping, have dinner, and spend time together. That day, she told me she randomly wanted to go to a hockey game. I said that we already had plans but would be open to it (we talked about a hockey as a future date). Out of the blue, she mentions that her friends are coming too. I really just wanted to spend time with her alone, but I didn't want to exclude her friends or her from being with them. I got upset about this and the way she went about it, and told her to go with her friends and not me. I stressed that I don't need to spend every minute with her and that friend time is important.

Ultimately, I agreed to go to the game. I went to her house, spent an amazing two hours with her, and drank an entire bottle of champagne. Her mom drove the four of us to the game and it was fun for a while. We were all drinking a ton. I am now a relative lightweight and I was starting to get pretty drunk. She said something that irked me, and I fired back with a statement about how I've been miserable for 3 months. She stormed off, started crying and we argued a bunch calmly. I ultimately said I was done and wanted to go home. I tried ordering and Uber, but no service. I called my parents and told them I needed to leave. They helped me get an Uber. My girlfriend convinced me to stay and go home with her mom in a little bit when she came to DD. I agreed and we peacefully put up with each other until her mom came.

We get in the car and start driving home, when her mom stops at Walmart. As best I can recall, her mom said I have 10 minutes to buy my gf 2 pillows. I spring into Walmart, spend $75 on pillows for her and get to the car and they are AWOL. I wait 10 minutes and then call her. She says they are inside shopping for pillows. I find them and get upset when she and her friends didn't want the pillows I had just bought her. They wandered off without me and said I had to return them. Well it was too late and the customer service had closed already. I went out to the car with my pillows and sat there waiting for her. I sat in the cold by the car for an hour. She called me twice asking where I was and why I bought the pillows. This turned into a big argument so I turned my phone off. After 45 minutes total time outside in the freezing cold, I decided to call an Uber. I called an Uber. I told my gf this and she said they were almost done shopping with her mom. I told her I was leaving and she said she was going to find her mom for the keys to come talk to me. As she came out, the Uber pulled up. She screamed at me saying if i got in the Uber, we were done. In my head, we were way past that. I had been abandoned in Walmart and humiliated for an hour in the freezing cold. I got into the Uber and went back to her house. On the ride, I called my dad and he started driving to our house about an hour from him and 20 from my gf. All of my clothes and car keys were in her mom's house with a locked front door. I recalled that her bedroom window was open, so I easily crawled into the house and grabbed only my keys and got in my car. As I got in my car, my gf, her mom, and two friends pulled into the driveway. She was screaming and crying at me and told me I couldn't leave and to stay and talk with her. I told her no, and that I was over her and done. Her friends called me a p.o.s. and I started driving away, without my pillows or any of my stuff in her house.

As I'm driving, I started chugging water. I may not have been drunk anymore, but I had way more to drink than I was comfortable driving with. I was also in a terrible mental state. Nothing mattered anymore and I was crying , speeding, and mind racing. I was getting a million phone calls from her, my mom, my dad, gf friends, and mutual friends. I got pulled over. I luckily didn't get in trouble besides a ticket. I then drove home. My dad picked me up and drove me back to our house at 2 am. She called 50 times and texted a bunch. I responded that I was done and never wanted to speak again. I blocked her on social media and everything except instagram. I posted a picture of my dog saying he was all I need to be happy to my insta story. She saw this and called me out immediately. I realized it was mean and deleted it. We kept texting back and forth but it wasn't great. i did unblock her, but made it clear we weren't together.

Fast forward to today, and we decided to try and work it out. Her friends and entire family hates me, she's mad at me, her boss found out and threatened to fire her if she shows up late again, and her mom isn't talking to her now. She wants me to apologize to her friends and mom and take total blame. I told her how I wanted to break up and only acted like that because I would never see them again. I do think my story post was mean, and that I shouldn't have gone into her house or drunk driven away, but I do know it is not burglary in my state and I only got my keys. Not sure how to go about this.

TLDR: Gf and I have not gotten along for just under half our 7 month relationship. I planned on breaking up with her last weekend, we went to a hockey game with her friends, started arguing, got abandoned outside Walmart for an hour freezing cold in the snow, then Uber back to her mom's house and crawled through her window to get my keys only and leave. Then I got pulled over and was a mental wreck.

Is it concerning that he didn't tell me their history, or am I just looking too far into it? It just makes me a little uncomfortable that he has never even mentioned it, but I could just be overthinking it 🙃",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7618022,public,self,My boyfriend hasn't told me that he's still friends with his ex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2ad6w/my_boyfriend_hasnt_told_me_that_hes_still_friends/,all_ads,6,,,

We also work together and are together pretty much all the time, so I’m sure he is not cheating. It’s hard for me to understand why he opens his closet almost everyday, potentially sees this toy and never thought about cleaning it, hiding it better or throwing it away.

The thought of having another woman’s body fluid on the toy, in his closet, potentially rubbing against his shirts that he wears, this whole time in the apartment that I also exist, drives me nuts.

And I also found out that the vibrator I had been enjoying this whole time is a hand-me-down from possibly the same woman. He lied about it’s a new one that he got at the beginning of our relationship. It’s also not the first time I found another woman’s belongings in this apartment.

Should I just get over it and accept the fact that this is just him being not detail oriented at all? I don’t want to make a scene but at the same time I feel like I have good reasons to be upset. He could though always play the privacy card.
