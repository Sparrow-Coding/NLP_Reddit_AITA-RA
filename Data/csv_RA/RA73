I don’t want to upset people but also don’t want to hide who I am. I just feel sad about the whole thing. 

So I (26F) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (25F) for 9 months now. I love her so much and I have never found a person like her. She treats me so well with so much respect and we have just started renting a place together. 

I came out to my parents just before we started dating and it was okay, although my Mum took longer to come round to the idea than my Dad. However, upon chatting  to my Mum about Christmas plans - she mentioned that my girlfriend was welcome to our big family Christmas (my girlfriend’s parents have passed away and she doesn’t have much family) however we wouldn’t be able to tell my Grandma that we were dating and would have to pretend to be friends as she wouldn’t take it well. My Grandma is 92 and when my cousin came out to her she took it really badly - saying it was a “sin” and very nearly didn’t go to their wedding (she did go though). However, she has come round to it now and she still has a relationship with my cousin and his husband and sees them often.

 I suppose I can see where my Mum is coming from as I don’t particularly want to have that difficult conversation with my Grandma either, though what really got to me was that I also feel like my Mum has a problem as I found out that she has been calling my girlfriend my “housemate” to her friends and said that our relationship was on a “need to know” basis with people. This hurt me as I know that if I was with a man (as I have in the past before I realised I was gay) she would have no problem with telling people. I told this to my girlfriend and she was obviously upset at the thought of having to “hide” and pretend to be friends for the sake of my Grandma/Mum and thinks it isn’t acceptable. My Mum said that I don’t want to hurt my gran’s feelings - and of course I don’t - but that got to me because what is so hurtful about loving someone of the same sex?

So my dilemma is that I’m feeling that although I don’t really want to have that conversation with my Grandma/Mum, I also don’t want to hide who I am/my girlfriend for my family. But I am also scared of losing them or of losing my girlfriend.

I and a male(31) she is female (44). She has 3 kids who are twins at 8 and a 14 year old. We were together for 5 years. We had been through a lot. I helped her move house twice and we had a house together as a family home. I loved her to bits. You know the kind of love that gives you butterflies and you can’t really explain it. I wanted to marry her and help raise the kids as my own. I sacrificed me having my own kids to be with her. Which was fine. 

I went through some problems at work where I was falsely accused of harassment which I was suspended for. I hired a lawyer provided evidence, proved my innocence and returned to work. After that I think things became difficult between me and my girlfriend because she was hurt through that process. But she stayed beside me anyway. 

At christmas she caught Covid and isolated in the bedroom. I spent the 7 days with the kids. It was good fun but tiring work. I think she found it difficult Being isolated from everyone when she would normally be very busy around the house. Just before she came out of isolation. One of the other kids became positive and she talked me into the idea of moving back to my flat to protect me so that I didn’t have to stay off work for another week. I moved out and at that point, she became very distant. It was difficult to speak to her and refused any help from me. But instead received help from her ex-husband which I knew from the camera notifications I was getting on my phone, nothing happened between them, but when I showed up she would give me no chat or time or let me see the kids but would talk to the ex-husband for half an hour with the kids.

Since then I have not moved back and we have drifted apart. She has now blocked me on all social media and my number. I can’t contact her and she won’t let me see the kids. I have seen a girl that I met who is 26 and I can’t fault . She is what some people would expect to be the perfect kind of girl friend. My problem is that I can’t get my ex out my head. I have dreams and nightmares about her and I do not have any of the same feelings for this new girl that I did for her. I know that this new girl is probably right for me.. But no matter what I do, I can’t get my ex out my head. I don’t know if I should be trying to completely shut her off and moving on, or trying to make contact with her somehow, and try again because I know, deep down, I adore her.

Yes, the age difference is kind of weird, my wife is 40.

So I've been in my daughter's life for the better part of 8 years now. I took a lot of care and put a lot of attention on our relationship, and we became very close. She will often curl up next to me and talk about her day while we watch a cartoon/anime or something (specifically, we're watching The Owl House and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure right now), or we'll talk about whatever. I love it.

Last week, I had to transition pretty hard to dad instead of friend, I guess; she started dating someone. Nice enough guy from what I can tell, military dude which is slightly more worrying, but I digress. I'm not really upset about that whole situation, I'm happy for her. Worried somewhat, because she's pretty sheltered and hasn't had a ton of life experience, but she's gonna do what she's gonna do and my wife and I have done what we can to make it clear we're supportive. Her... friend? Boyfriend? No idea if they're at titles yet, which is kind of what I'm upset about. Anyways, he's allowed over whenever, there's no real restrictions on her other than try to be home at 1 to maintain my wife's sanity, and they have full run of the house, just want to throw that out there to make it known. 

Since she met this guy, I've seen her for like an hour total. The only words I've been able to say are ""Alright kid, see you tonight"" or ""I'm happy you're home, did you have a good time?"" She typically just gives me a one sentence answer and then heads to her room and I don't see her until the following night. It's kind of like I lost my kid overnight and I know it sounds selfish but it's left me feeling kind of hurt.

I understand it's a new thing and I'm being as supportive as I can, but the truth of the matter is that I miss my kid and she's not talking to me more than she absolutely has to. I don't really know what to do other than let her do her own thing, but I want to know how things are going for her, how she's being treated, how work is going, etc. I get that she's got someone to talk to about anything she wants now, so maybe I just feel replaced? I honestly don't know what's wrong with me.

I know I'm probably being kind of extra right now and overreacting, it's only been a week. But still, we used to hang out for hours every day, and going to nearly zero contact after that has been awful. I have no idea if I handled something wrong and she's mad at me, if it's just because a new thing is going on, etc. and haven't had the chance to ask.

It is incredibly and brutally painful (especially being from a community where family is everything), but I feel like I was suffocating with them and would end up feeling so low about myself id take my own life or... Well I don't know how else it would have ended.

I briefly spoke to my brother about the issues that led to this situation. I gave one small example (out of many) that led me to the way I do. I feel I was justified to be offended, but he is now saying this is proof that I am getting upset about everything easily.... Now I'm doubting myself.

There are many more situations and much more context to this situation, but  in this one example what are your thoughts...

Now its widely known that I have dated white guys and am currently engaged to one. My cousins were around me and my two brothers. One cousin (who has never been close to me but it's been known she wishes my brothers were hers) started talking about distant cousins who are dating white people or have kids with them. She was making fun of their posts praising their partners, talking negatively about their mixed race kids. In the past when I stand up for myself about, well anything, my brothers would tell me im making a fuss, and I honestly didn't expect her to say that in front of me. I was a bit frozen. She then turned to my brother and said ""but I know what you do if that was me. You make sure I do what's right and make sure I date the right person. You would be my brother and make sure I don't bring shame on us""  my brother just said I support whatever you want while my other stayed silent, it carried on for a bit until I very passively aggressively said she was being judgemental (not the best way to deal with it I know). I felt humiliated on my own and for a moment shameful (even if not directed at me it didnt feel good, how will my kids be treated when I have them?).

When I brought this up to my brother he didn't disagree with what was said. Instead he felt that was no big deal and she's saying she wouldn't want to date a white guy that's all. She's not insulting people who do. She did nothing wrong and this an example of me taking things personally.

He was seeing a girl over the summer and didn't follow up on that because of him coming back to the states, but then later said he had hookups that summer, which he didn't like because he wasn't into hookup girls in the first place. In summary, there's a lot of dodgy answers, and I suppose they could all be true if you worked out the details but I wonder why he can't tell me everything in full. 

\- There's then the time when he said ""I'm not here for a long time just for a good time"" jestingly while looking at me but that was early on. It's curious because he said he wanted a serious relationship. 

\- We were friends before but there was absolutely no sign he liked me; in fact, I thought he was interested in my friend up until the confession. Which makes me only think we're together because I responded to his flirting. I also feel this is true because when a mutual friend asked him when he started liking me he wouldn't give a response.

\- He likes it when other people are observing us. On our own we're fine, but when we're around friends he smiles a lot more and is touchy with me. He enjoys the attention. When I told him a long-time friend confessed to me he started smiling and looking fake outraged? I don't know. But he's not jealous at all. Might be a good thing but I wonder how much he actually likes me and how much of it is he just wants to be in a relationship. 

\- We don't text often. Usually it's for practical purposes of meeting up and at most a ""goodnight"". He's told me he's a bad texter before but can't gauge how bad is bad for someone who is interested. We're supposed to be in the honeymoon phase, no?

\- Haven't hooked up with him yet, but there are some things that he says or does that feels intentionally sexual. idk.

\- His ex is actually weird af and batshit crazy (confirmed by other people I know), and while I feel secure that I'm not like that it makes me wonder what he even saw in her to be with her and what he sees in me to be with me. Like what are even the standards?

He's respected all my boundaries. He's been loyal. He's been considerate, kind, and good to me. Those are the important things. But my mind...it's making me think all these little things are saying something. Something along the lines of we're dating because it's convenient and fun, and not dating because there's a real future to this.

My now husband (57m) use to smoke but I refused to live with him until he had quit and stayed that way for a full year,  married almost a year later.

Jump forward to now, over two years married and he went thru a stressful time changing jobs.

I knew he snuck the odd smoke from people at work but he had promised he hadn't bought a pack himself and it wasn't a daily thing.

Recently I had to borrow his ute to move stuff and he hastily removed one of his work bags before I could use it and I just knew.... So afterwards I looked into his work bag (the one he stashed away) and sure enough there is a packet of smokes in there, with lighter.

In the past I have always tackled things head on and have found he is very good at manipulating the situation to make me the 'bad guy' and I also don't want him to openly smoke at home because I HATE it. It's a deal breaker but I don't want to throw the marriage away either.

So do I let him sneak his smokes (knowing he is buying and smoking regularly) but at least not around me or is there a way to talk to him about this?

We’ve known each other for 8 months or more. Can’t exactly remember how much time.

We are friends and I like them a lot. I think they’re funny and somewhat amiable. Thing is, AC is overly mean with me. Before I continue, my way of joking with my friends is picking on each other. I find it funny and this is how I joke with AC. Of course, I know when to pull the brakes on the insults and other mean stuff. 

However, AC just never stops telling me insults. Whatever I do, say or even think gets me flooded with insults. They’re not  terrible insults that would destroy me emotionally. I find them funny most of the time. I do, however, get tired of how much she is picks on It’s almost non stop. 

BD, is a very  nice dude but it’s very obvious that he likes AC romantically. So he either never says something against AC or joins in on the fun of picking at me.

AC and BD talk to each other normally, even in a flirtatious manner sometimes. AC never jokes the way she does wit me. They always complimenting each other and proposing things to do such as play a game or watch a movie. I suspect they like each other and good for them but fuck, I would also like to join in on the normal talk and activities. Just stop on the bickering and just be kind to one another. 

 Most of the time, I’m understanding and kind to AC and every time I do, she acts disgusted  and sometimes she even blocks me for several hours at a time. She rarely acts kind with me and when she does, it just feels forced and hollow. They never invite me to do stuff. It’s always those two having the most fun and me in the background getting shitted on for whatever reason. Other times, they just outright ignore me when I write in the group chat. They just talk to each other like I’m not even there. Shit sucks

Like I said, I’m fine with picking on each other. Since, that’s what I do with other friends but I get to a point were it’s just too much, y’know? I end up feeling like the worst when it happens, like they don’t even care about me as much as I care about them. I’m just tired of being made fun of every single time. I want to spend time like normal friends do.  I know AC is joking, or at least I like to think that

I feel like just telling AC  that it’s way too much  but I feel like I’m just overreacting most of the time. I’m sure she would also just tell me to calm down and stop being a dramatic asshole since I’ve complained many times before to AC about other stuff and that’s more or less what she always answered with.  

I just don’t know what to do anymore and what to feel about all of this. Sometimes I even wonder why I put up with her. Am I just in an illusion to think that it’s actually a friendship?

We went to the movie theater recently and the cashier was incredibly pretty and also spoke Portuguese, so the two Brazilians talked to her for a bit. 

I didn’t think much of it until afterwards my boyfriends best friend told everyone when we got home that my boyfriend liked her and thought she was hot in front of me. He looked scared and guilty and I immediately got angry. 
Everyone then laughed at me because of my reaction. But yet my boyfriend still didn’t respond. 

Then one of my friends that wasn’t with us when we went to the movies got my attention and said “ okay but she was ACTUALLY hot.” In a comparing sort of tone that made it seem he was calling me ugly; in a teasing way. But I later called him out on it and asked him if he was calling me ugly compared to her. 

My whole family decided that they could speak for him and say that he meant it as a “she was reallly hot.” My friend seemed like he decided to use this excuse to get off clean and so he went with it. But he says that, that wasn’t the case and continued to call me dumb and insult me. 

I got a little angry and defensive and tried to explain myself the best way I could because my family continued to agree with him. I felt cornered and they interrupted me several times just to laugh at me or insult me because I was “acting crazy” so I wasn’t able to get my side of the story in. Eventually I exploded in rage and started sobbing 

They continued to laugh and insult me despite how upset I got. My friend yelled at me while I was sobbing that he used  to like me and now he thinks I’m crazy. My other friend joined in and screamed at me calling me dumb over and over. 

Everyone else continued to laugh so I stood up and screamed at my friend and told him to stfu.

I stay at his house and have for the past few months. We’ve been together over 3 1/2 years. We’ve been talking about me going home more so we have space for more of our own personal time and hobbies. 

Last night I went home and texted him, I was telling him about how I don’t feel loved and such when I leave. He wasn’t hearing me so I said it doesn’t matter. He suddenly flipped the convo and was about suicidal, so I went into full therapy mode and told him how much I loved him and what he meant to me. He was so appreciative and felt better. We went to bed. I was kind of upset I didn’t get my feelings across and he didn’t listen when i tried / changed the convo when i became distant. When I woke up I went about my day getting his gifts together. 

He hardly texted me all day. He’s been obsessed with God Of War coming out and was on it all day. I understand he’s obsessed with it but no I miss yous or anything all day. When he finally took a break from the game at 1130pm i told him i don’t want to ruin his bday, but i have expressed feeling unloved at least 4 times in the past 2 days. He basically just said he’s been obsessed with the game, and i’m upset with him for using his personal time for what it’s for and that it isn’t fair to him. 

All i wanted was an I miss you, I’m thinking of you, what are you up to, how’s it going. Anything. 

Today is his birthday. I dont want to ruin his day or start a fight or have any negative feelings. But i have nothing to say to him. I’ve seen him twice to go to the store together quickly and i couldn’t muster any words.

He's a cute geek with ADHD and I'm a nerd with strict parents so our relationship is a secret from my parents. We usually just hang out at his house and do adult fun time stuff (80% of the time) or watch anime/youtube or fall asleep or go eat out sometimes/go to the movies. 

We don't have much in common besides our morals and values and anime. TBH I think he has more chemistry with his friends than me but he says it's the other way around. If you saw him with his friends vs with me you could tell a clear difference from how much he laughs and smiles and how attentive he is to the conversations and how he doesn't look like he's bored(although he has said he has trouble showing me affection). Sometimes it feels like we're lovers and sometimes it feels like he treats me like a friend or even less than that. He has worked on it since I talked to him about it and it's been getting better. 

Although I am a bit bothered by his saying ""that's how I treat everyone"" when I talk about our chemistry. But no it's not how he treats everyone. When I'm with him at times he's just on his phone texting other people. (I'm okay with that btw) But then when we're not together he just sends me memes and I send him memes but we barely have an actual conversation. I will admit I am a dry texter usually but still, I try my best sometimes to actually have a conversation with him (cause I miss him and miss talking to him) and he just says nice or cool or epic. But while I'm with him I just see him having loads of interesting conversations with other people for hours. Like the time when we were eating dinner with his family and he was just on his phone the entire time while I talked to his family. His mom noticed and did get angry at him for it although I felt completely embarrassed and hurt already.  It hurt but recently we did go out to dinner again and he wasn't on his phone the entire time but I'm not sure if that was just a lucky day. How should I approach him about this?

But I was expecting she'd have trouble having meaningful convos and stuff like that but what she meant is she has trouble showing 'love' (wouldn't call it that yet but idk a better word). She never gives compliments, when I compliment her she typically ignores them, there's no ""how are you"" ""hows your day"", no reassurance that she likes me, nothing verbally.

She's very physical in that she likes cuddling so I know she likes me but when I'm not physically with her it causes a lot of anxiety cuz there's no affirmation. (only see her \~once a week)

For context, after we made the decision to be exclusive, I found out he was texting/flirting/getting numbers of other women.

In addition, I was able to close the gap of the LDR with my girlfriend (of 3 years), which is a plus. While this is a big move, I've been able to come and visit my girlfriend for prolonged periods of time (3+ months), as I was able to work remotely. We got along fine during these times, so I figured it would be okay. 

However, there's definitely been a shift in the relationship in the past couple of weeks. She doesn't really give me much space/alone time, which is something that I need to recharge. I addressed this to her and she's been giving me more alone time, which I appreciate. But I can sense that she is unhappy by this.

There was also a problem where I recently considered flying back home to work a Christmas seasonal job for a couple of weeks (1 and 1/2 months) so I could earn money to help pay for my school (as I am currently out of school for the remainder of the year). When I discussed it with her, she was unhappy, as we had just recently closed the 9,000+ mile LDR gap between us. However, she wasn't able to see it from my perspective, as it would allow me to earn money to pay for school. She didn't even consider the purpose of me going home was, as in I feel she made the situation about herself... her initial reaction being 'well I guess I'm not worth the money you'll make at home, go do whatever you have to do' etc. 

There's also other issues of her having a strict timeline in terms of what she wants... for ex. she is set on being married by 30, at the latest. I've told her many times that I cannot guarantee her that, because marriage is something that is not on my mind at the moment. Between adapting to living in the new country and my Master's program, I feel like it's a lot more stress that is being put on me in our relationship that I do not need at the moment. This is something we've discussed a handful of times.... but part of me thinks that she is just hoping that I change.

Given the above reasons, I've come to the conclusion that it may be time for us to end the relationship.... which I plan to do later today. However, I'm really scared of feeling alone here, because she has been the main person I lean on living here. I'm fortunate enough to have some friends here, but part of me feels like I don't even deserve to be here if I'm not with her. Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation?

This past Saturday was his 29th birthday. I was excused from my Spanish class to celebrate with him at lunch. I bought him a $300 Ralph Lauren sweater and a birthday cake. I proposed to take a picture with him so that I could post on my social media. He said he recently gained weight and had to photoshop his face. I told him to resend the edited version back to me after he was done.

At 10pm that night, he updated his social media with a 100-word prose, all talking about himself (achievements, goals, life changes during the year...), not mentioning me or anything. He then sent the picture to me privately. I soon realized he also photoshopped me. He pushed my hairline down so that my forehead didn't look as wide and bald. This clearly hacked me off and offended me because he was trying to impose his aesthetic values on my own appearance, something I was born with. After I clarified, he sent me three question marks and said:"" So following that logic, you also imposed your aesthetic values on me by giving me that sweater?""

When my(F25) boyfriend(M29) and I first started dating a couple of years ago, he had a very high sex drive. He would want to have sex nearly every time we hung out. He was always openly attracted to me and made me feel desired. Things felt equally matched and it worked well in our relationship. Recently, I have to ask or initiate any time I’m interested. More often than not, he says he’s not in the mood. 

Perfectly fine, I respect him. My issue is that I recently caught him sexting girls on Snapchat and saving nude pics of random girls online. We decided to move past this and focus on our relationship, as I am not without fault myself. But I can’t help but feel that him not wanting to sleep with me is because he’s not attracted to me in the same way he is the other women he might be talking to or anonymously viewing online. 

Any time I try to talk about it in a calm, civilized manner he says I’m sexually harassing him and tells me to “shut the f up”.  I’ve tried to approach it from different angles but he always makes it out like I’m the bad guy for desiring how things used to be. How should I respond when he’s not in the mood? And how can I talk to him about this without upsetting him? 

My concern is that things went from us regularly having sex to him getting angry any time I try to initiate things. I’d love some outside perspective on the situation. Perhaps I’m being immature and not understanding him as well as I should. But it feels that something else is going on. 

TLDR; Bf and I used to have sex regularly, now he gets mad if I initiate or bring it up.

I will also attempt to be as transparent about me and my past. 

I very recently slept with someone who is in a relationship and has been for 2 years. I have slight connections to the girlfriend but not enough to completely affect my life beyond loss of 1 important friendship of mine if this was to blow up. 

Since it has happened I have been racked with guilt and anxiety. I went into this night 100% aware of their situation and even encouraged infidelity. This is also not the first time I have put myself willingly into a similar situation but it has been the first time in years- as I wanted to actively be a better person, obviously unsuccessfully. It has also been the first time ever that I went into it with an already established relationship (friendship) and feelings. Apparently reciprocated ones too but that is debatable. 

My question is what I should do from here as I think that I should tell her… But the fact I want to tell her makes me question my motives? Because I know it will make me feel better to tell her and I have already done a risk assessment on what the backlash would do to me and the fallout being manageable. 

Whether or not anything else happens with he and I, I will have left another woman who has done nothing wrong, completely shattered and to pick up those pieces- to either rebuild their relationship and trust, or alone, while I get the freedom of being honest? Seems selfish so that I clear my conscience. 

He also has not responded to me since I apologised for my actions so is either guilty or trying to just avoid me/it, or both. 

I’m not very good at introspection or being overly sensitive to others so I want to know if someone has been on the other side and affected by this. If you believed you were in a good relationship and had someone so unexpectedly tell you that your partner cheated would you have preferred to stay ignorant or were you eventually glad and accepted the truth?

She was in Europe for a short trip and the guy she was with let her go out alone even though he promised me he would take care of her. She never told me much about it but one night, she suggested she was gang banged. It’s terrible. This is someone who I fell in love with and even though we’re technically not together, I have a strong bond with. I carry some of the burden because she called me that night in an attempt to lose her assaulter but I was asleep due to the time difference.

Even though we’re over 300 miles away from each other, we keep in contact frequently. Sometimes I go visit her and we have sex and sit around and talk. It’s really lovely. But it pains me to see her in pain. This past Summer, she slit her wrist. The wound was so deep she was rushed to the hospital and lost feeling in her arm. During the whole ordeal, she never once contacted me. I would’ve dropped everything and gone to take care of her. Weirdly though, she only told the guy she was with in Europe. He is gay though. So I don’t think they’re an item. I just am confused why she would tell me. And this is a theme. 

There have been other instances where she’s been close to suicide or in physical harm. But she’s never reached out. I’m confused because when we’re together, we’re inseparable. We cannot get enough of each other. Every time I leave, she leaves a gaping hole in my heart and I’m in physical pain for days afterward. She has said the same. 

Is it likely that she has a commitment issue and struggles opening up to me? Why can she open up to her friend when they’re not as intimately linked as us?

I hope this was clear.

We greeted each other in passing for months before he finally asked for my number. Within a few days, he asked me to go out with him. We went on a first date, it went great. We went on a second date two weeks later, it went even better. The third time we spent time together, he came over to my place and we watched a game. I ended up falling asleep after smoking weed (he doesn't smoke) and he didn't try to wake me up.

We haven’t had physical contact apart from a peck on the lips. We talk on a daily basis through text, and have conversations at work when we pass each other. He was upfront about wanting a relationship. He expressed his first and only relationship was a little over 2 years ago that resulted in him going into a ton of debt. She basically used him for gifts, trips, and surgery. He told me he will be done paying off his credit cards in the next three years. When I asked if he felt ready to move forward with someone new, he told me yes, and asked me what he would need to do for me, in terms of my expectations.

Well, I have quite a bit of experience in relationships in comparison to him. Most of our conversations consist of work, his favorite sports, and exchanging discourse on funny videos. In person, he’s very reserved and I have to get him to open up enough to talk. He’s extremely shy and respectful. But he does talk about future plans with me, like different events he wants to go to, places he wants to travel to next year, etc.

I am attracted to him, and he’s really nice, but I’m afraid he’s too reserved for me. I know he doesn’t have a lot of experience and probably isn’t used to opening up. But he mainly talks about his hobbies (hockey, racing, etc) and it’s hard to connect.

I’ve been extremely torn about my relationship of two years with my partner. I was raised in an incredibly abusive household growing up, so I have my fair share of mental illness. I moved out at 18 and have fully supported myself, but I wanted to make sure I could heal and went through tons of therapy in the past four years. My partner is autistic and ADHD and came from a relatively healthy family, but deeply struggles with emotional support and self awareness. I’ve communicated to him extensively that I need more emotional support, as he barely provides any, but expects it from me constantly. I’ve begged and pleaded for him to go to therapy or have us do couples therapy to no avail. He says he keeps “forgetting” because of his ADHD which I understand, but it’s been a year. I’ve also told him my love languages and expressed my needs, yet he never makes romantic gestures.  

I’ve been incredibly conflicted because I know he struggles with his autism and I’ve educated myself to try and understand/help him. At the same time, I am so worn down. I am always comforting him during meltdowns, asking how he’s doing, reminding him to make appointments, helping him with cleaning when he’s having a hard time. However, I’ve went through six deaths in the past year, and I can confidently say he has barely supported me through any of it. Two of these deaths occurred in the past month and **TW**, but the most recent is my second friend to unalive themselves in the past year. I work full-time and go to school, so I’ve already really been struggling with this. Recently though I’ve been more mentally unstable than I have been in years. I feel like I have reached my breaking point and I made him aware (and my therapist too, don’t worry.) But the day that my friend died two weeks ago, he gave me a hug and for the rest of the day, said absolutely nothing to me. I had a very bad mental breakdown and had to call the hotline. Since then, he hasn’t checked in with me at all, knowing fully that I am doing terribly. This really cut deep and I brought it up again recently. Still nothing. 

I love him so much and we have a really special connection. We have a ton in common and our personalities mesh so well. We have healthy communication and he’s loving in other ways. I know he loves me deeply, but fuck, he doesn’t know how to show it and won’t put in the effort. I have been trying so hard to save this relationship and he has barely put in any effort comparatively. I really don’t want this to end, but I have told him that I can’t rely on him for emotional support and it’s very important to me. I’ve also told him how it really hurts me and I feel so alone. I don’t know if I can keep waiting around any longer.

My ex crush, “Cupcake”, &amp; I have known each other since we were 12 &amp; 14. I joined her church which was how we met &amp; she’s the daughter of a pastor(I’ve left her church &amp; Christianity since I was 17). There was a tiktok trend with a specific sound going around &amp; I wanted to join so I made the post about how I realized I was in love with Cupcake since I was 14 &amp; I’m a lesbian after I left Christianity. There’s nothing deep as to why I made the video. Just thought I would share the plot twists of my life &amp; I was comfortable in making the video because Cupcake doesn’t have a tiktok &amp; whoever would see my tiktok post are people who I deeply trust with this information. Cupcake knows I’m a lesbian but not my feelings for her. Cupcake is engaged to a man she recently had a child with but even way before that I never dared to hint to her that I was in love with her because I respected her and our friendship plus she’s still religious. Not even while single &amp; was out of church sometimes. Anyways, one of my friends, “Queen”(25f), saw my post &amp; said not to worry about her knowing. Next thing I know I get a text from Cupcake that says, in her words, that she wants to remain friends but out of respect for her fiancé she can’t talk to me the same way we always did(I don’t really understand what she means by that. We talk like sisters &amp; mothers but she is allowed to set boundaries regardless). Obviously hurt &amp; upset, I blocked Queen on everything &amp; messaged her younger sister, “Lollipop”(18f), to tell Queen to never contact me ever again. Lollipop then sends me a screenshot of a text between her &amp; someone I will call “Donut”(23f). Donut is Queen’s &amp; Lollipop’s sister. Donut lives with Cupcake &amp; her family &amp; is apart of their church. Donut tells Lollipop to tell me that it was her who told Cupcake, not Queen &amp; Cupcake only said it was Queen cause she saw Queen knew about it. Donut also says that if I don’t want people to get into my business that are private to not put them on tiktok &amp; to stop victimizing myself because what I post is meant for everyone to see. So I unblocked Queen on everything &amp; apologized to her a lot. She says I don’t have to apologize because she would’ve done the same thing. Queen explains that she didn’t told Cupcake anything but did share my videos with her siblings just to share &amp; told them not to say anything to anyone. From the looks of it there’s no fixing what me &amp; Cupcake had &amp; her image of me is completely ruined. Cupcake still hasn’t messaged me yet but “if” she does I will tell her that it’s probably best if we go our separate way but I feel like that would be wrong of me to do. Idk. I want to stay friends with Cupcake but our relationship will never be the same plus she’s going to get married soon &amp; I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable if I stay in her life.

It was a bit disheartening that people made the worst of things from the get-go, but I guess I could've helped the situation if I explained it right. My bad for having speech issues, I guess.

Anyway, here's the news from Saturday;

Me and my ex met up at about midday, at an arcade. My brother and his friend were here, and I personally trust that they'd be alright, but because of the stabbings that e been happening I was asked to chaperone, so I asked her if we could meet there. We sat down, I offered to get her a drink, and we got to a table. We sat down for about two minutes, a li'l awkwardly, so I decided to spark up a conversation (asking her if she waited long, how the trip into town went, just generally making sure she's good). She spent a fair bit of time on her phone (about 3-5m), and I commented on that too. Not that I minded it or anything, but to hopefully get her to say something so that we weren't just, sitting there. However, she laughed it off a little bit and went back to her phone.

I then ask why it was that she wanted to meet up (it was a little less direct than just that, but still), and I don't remember her giving a response other than just a shrug of her shoulders. We spend about 45 minutes there all-in-all, before my partner gets to the arcade as well; I'd been keeping her updated, and told her that my ex hadn't said much and seems to be on her phone more than anything else. My partner gets here, and I step outside to talk. My brother and his friend were just on the opposite side - there's a window between us so it's easy to see him, his friend and my ex. Me and my partner talk a little bit about things, and in the meantime my ex sends me a message saying she's gonna head home. I respond with ""Okay."", and soon enough she walks past me, waving as she left. Me, my partner, my brother, and his friend, all spent the time from then until 2pm on some of the games there, and the three of us (all of us bar my brother's friend, who had to go home) went back to mine for the day.

Overall, I don't really know what to say. My ex just didn't really say anything, didn't engage conversation (I know how quiet she can be, but she was quieter than even that). It was just awkward, for the most part.

Lo siento aburrido, cansado de mi, ya no tenemos intimidad y siento que ya no le atraigo físicamente. Yo no tengo el mejor cuerpo, soy pequeña (1.54m), peso 58 kilos, tengo caderas, rollitos, un poco de trasero y mis pechos no son grandes. 
Incluso antes de ser pareja habíamos hablado de las redes sociales, más específicamente el si me molestaba que el siguiera a modelos, mujeres con proporciones y cuerpos increíbles, atléticas y mayores, como todas las ""parejas"" que él ha tenido antes. Yo le había dicho que no, yo confiaba en el y sé que es casi imposible que algo llegue a suceder con alguna de esas modelos. Sin embargo, no pensé en el como iba a afectar esto a mi autoestima. Hay días en las que se me baja la autoestima por estarme comprando con ellas. A veces el de la 'like' a estados de estas modelos y les escribe que están muy bonitas. Yo subo fotos de mi a mis historias y me quedo esperando algún mensaje así, bonito o si quiera un 'me gusta'. Sé que es mi inseguridad, él me dice que me quiere y yo le creo, me lo demuestra de muchas maneras, solo no siento que me desee o que me vea tan bonita a como ve a las muchachas del ig.

It's a long story, my husband and I have had a very fucked up year, there's lots of background info that's too long to include here. Quick necessary background info- My husband is bipolar (type 2), and due to life shitting all over us, he has been having a harder time the past year. He has taken several weeks of leave from work to work on his mental health, and has been transferred to a less stressful position for a year to help. That year is almost up now. My husband and I came up with a plan together of what he would do to support his mental health when he has to return to his normal job. Previously, my husband has relied entirely on me for his emotional support. I let this happen, hindsight is a bitch, but here I am now. Again, due to life shitting all over us, I am dealing with emotional burnout (I didn't know this was a thing, but basically I feel no empathy or sympathy towards others, it's like my body has shut down it's ability to give any fucks because my emotions have been so thoroughly used and abused this year). I have had countless discussions with my husband about my emotional but out, and that I cannot be his only support anymore, as I am not able to provide that right now.

On to the plan we came up with- he decided to beat shore up his mental health he was going to exercise regularly, significantly reduce any alcohol intake, and seek weekly therapy. We came up with this plan about 3 months ago. Near the end of October, he had another mental health break down, and has been on a leave of absence from work since. He is trying a new medical procedure for treatment, and it seems to be helping immensely! I have been begging h that he really needs to take this time to establish with a therapist before he returns to work come Dec 1 (the procedure he's getting done is best paired with regular therapy per his doctor). I have reminded him that he is off work, and he has the time to find a good therapist, establish exercise habits, and all the things he wanted to do to help himself. He has done none of the things, and the other day decided he wants to go back to work now, 2 weeks early, because he feels better and he's bored. I broke down, told him I could not emotionally handle him going back without a support system, and reminded him I cannot be that for him right now, and I did not support him returning to work early. He somewhat listened, and scheduled an appt with his Psych doctor the next morning. Next day, he tells me he convinced his doctor to let him return, and he already called his boss to let them know he will be back in a few days. I broke down again, explained that I could not support him, and will not be able to be there for him regarding work stuff. He doesn't seem to understand that I set that boundary and I'm not budging. I just wanted off my anxiety meds, and am really trying to take care of my own mental health here. So now we're arguing daily, I've been sleeping on the couch, and he is guilt tripping me and trying to make me feel bad for setting this boundary ""I'm gonna have to meet with all my bosses, it's gonna be really hard, I wish you would just support me in this"". I keep explaining, but he just expects me to change my mind and decide I support him, and will play therapist as he navigates this again. I cannot mentally or physically do that regarding his job again, I have helped him with work related issues dozens of times over the last year while everything around us was falling apart. I am in emotional recovery, and I don't think he understands....

Sorry for the very long post, our lives have been very difficult this year.... But I also feel like I need to hold this boundary for my own sake and sanity, is that wrong? I feel like I'm abandoning my husband in a time of need, but I also feel like he chose this shitty path for himself, and it's more of a ""you made your bed now you have to lie in it"" kinda deal.

TLDR: GF has been distant, I broke up with her, was it right?

Background: Gf (F 20) and I have been dating just around 6 months. She lives at home with parent (Father 50s). She has a PT job at a coffee place that doesnt like unions and more than FT college, I have a FT job in a tech industry.

2 Weeks ago, she ran out of ADHD and focus drugs from her prescription. She said that throughout the year the Drs cant keep a regular schedule. 2 weeks ago she got a nasty flu and our communication dropped. I was worried about her and brought her food to get better and also got the number of a cousin (F 19) that lives with her 4 days a week. She has been very stressed with school, family, work, and mostly parents. Her parents are going through a divorce and due to English is not their primary language, she is handling all the paperwork.

On Monday I called her and offered anything to relieve stress, a date, concert, whatever. Yes, I have a good stable job and I did not mind supporting her with bills, or gas money, or tuition. She said no, cause it would just make her think of all the things she needed to be doing instead. She started crying, hung up and sent me a text saying she would talk to me later and she wanted to be left alone.

Tuesday no comm

Wend: I called to see how she was and text. No response. Before anyone judge, our daily communication was between 10 and 30 messages a day.

Thursday: Heard she was sick from cousin, left food in her garage and messaged with no response.

Friday: she called in at work. No communication either way.

Saturday: I left a VM and text saying im worried about her and about us. No response.

Sunday: (Yes I have trust issues, however this is the first time Ive done anything deceivious with her) I created a fake phone # and texted her as a wrong number with a wrong message. She texted that number back when she got off work saying wrong number.

Personally tonight I broke up with my girlfriend because I’ve realized I’m not able to fix the relationship. I’ve failed in managing my emotions and have exhibited tendencies like arguing, anger issues, name calling, being stubborn, and being overall a weak male. I want to take a moment to except my accountability. 

In the beginning of our relationship I did things on an emotional standpoint I can’t take back. I’ve never looked for help from past relationships and I’ve definitely got anger issues. From what I’ve been told. 

So from my side of it I caused my now current girlfriend to be in her current state. My ability to control my emotions has followed me again to another relationship and ruined it. 

The trauma I’ve inflicted on my girlfriend will follow her for the rest of her life but with that being said tonight I broke up with her. 

Three+ years together. After telling her I wanted to break up she began doing the things that have brought me to my decision. Before I speak on what that is let’s dive into how she took the break up. 

So recently I landed a six figure gig. 100K-115K a year. It’s a bump from my 80K gig I had before. Couple in my house and three paid off cars I’m living good. About to be debt free next year after my house is paid off in 2023. My girls argument is that I’m leaving because of the new job and that’s not the case. 

I’m actually at the point I want to leave because I’m unable to speak with her. No matter what I say if it’s a disagreement we fight. And when I fight with her it’s a never ending disagreement where she will try to end it and not acknowledge the problem. This has been a huge problem this last year. Anything I say that goes against her beliefs is met with an argument. And I’m often accused by my girl of things I will do. Imagine being told you’re going to attack me soon and start calling me names. This is what my girlfriend will say. 

Past arguments all the way back to our first year will be used against me. Ok fair. I deserve It. Despite me doing what she says which I’m sure she’s right I do not always have the intention of attacking her when we disagree.

Sometimes I just want to talk about sensitive topics and see if we can do it and it forever leads to what happened tonight. Trying to be the better person is impossible. Walking away does not work. If I tell my girl you’re being rude she tells me back I’m being rude. 

It’s as if neither of us will accept accountability. Our argument a few nights ago I walked away from a argument and slept on my couch. Only for my girl to bring it up tonight and said I was rude. The night before I tried to help her and thought she was rude.

Do you guys see where I’m going with this? We just can’t speak on anything. I dislike telling her she has to go. I dislike making her have to go get an apartment but I feel for my happiness I need to be alone again. 

I have been paying all bills. Car provided for her. No rent she’s living completely free with me. The burden I’m gonna put back on her is a hard one since she’s still in school. But I don’t know how we can go forward as we can’t agree on anything sensitive or small. 

Which makes me believe marriage and kids with her would be a living hell. Considering I’m childless. My only concern has anyone been in my situation. How should I navigate getting her out my house. I’m gonna give her $3000 back and allow her to stay until her semester is up. I’m willing to do anything but I can no longer be with her.

TLDR: My best friend fell for a very manipulative guy and she gave me an ultimatum of not speaking negatively of him or their relationship, but I can’t do that, because his behavior affects her in a very drastic way. I don’t know what to do. 

English is not my first language so please excuse my grammar. I (27f) have a best friend (23f). She met a guy (25) at the start of summer and fell head over heels for him. The guy seemed to be her type, they had a cute flirting period, the usual. The trouble began when she told me that he wants them to be friends with benefits, and, while she wants the opposite, she agreed, hoping that being with her will change his mind. She is young and this is her first relationship that involves some kind of passion, so I just gave her my lukewarm advice of ""not a good start , to be honest"", and left it at that, hoping that she will figure it out with time, as most of us did. 

After some time had passed, I noticed that this whole situation affects her in a very bad way, she became very easily irritated, whiny, she snapped at our shared friends for most mundane things. A lot of depressing social media posts and messages, self-deprecating, even. At first, whenever I tried to talk about it, she would open up and the core of her depressive state would always be the fact that this guy doesn’t want a relationship with her. I thought that this is a situation of ""he wants this, she wants that, so they really should go on their own ways"" but then she showed me some messages that they had exchange after her attempts of moving their relationship forward. And he was **very** manipulative. He constantly dangled the possibility of them being a couple in front of her, and always, always turned the situation this way so the only problem would be that she is not good enough. She doesn’t excite him as he wants, so for now his answer is no. But, in the future, who knows? He will let her know. 

This whole thing unsettled me, and I tried to talk some sense into her - tried to give her another perspective, cheer her up and get her self-esteem to the usual level. It would help for some time but another meeting with him and she is whiny, depressed and irritated again. Our mutual friends started to notice, and all the questions are directed to me - and what can I do? I can only give her advice, it’s her decision whether to follow it or not.

After couple of times of me trying to get her to understand that he is not good for her and his behavior is at least very disrespectful, she just stopped opening up to me. I tried to give her space, but her behavior started to annoy and concern my mutual friends, who found her to be ""fishing for attention"" and started to actively exclude her from mutual gatherings, which I think is not a nice thing to do. 

Another piece of context for the argument - we were supposed to rent an apartment together. My current living situation is bad, and I want to have somebody I know and trust for a roommate - and she needs to move out as well. She wanted to find a job in her desired field (design) first, and for that she needs a portfolio, which she doesn’t have time to work on because of her current job. I was willing to wait. So, we are talking and she informs me that she quit her job a week ago, I was glad and asked her how her work on her portfolio is going, to which she replied ""I didn’t do anything, I played dota all week"". Now, we all play games from time to time, but dota is very far from her usual interest pool. When I asked her why, she told me that she wants to get good at the game so her crush **may want to play with her.** I am not crazy in finding this to be VERY strange, right? When I brought her attention to the fact that she doesn’t have any savings and that she spends her time playing a game for a guy who is not even her boyfriend and does no work for her future she snapped at me and that was it. 

The next day I commented on a picture of our mutual friend ""have you no self-respect?"" with no intention to mention or ""jab"" at my best friend - it was a comment only about the post of our mutual friend. To which said mutual friend replied ""well I don’t play dota yet, so I have some left in me"". I didn’t interact with that comment and went on with my day only to discover hours later that I have been banned **everywhere,** except text messages and calls. In the argument that ensued she told me that she ""has no trust"" in me and does not feel safe sharing her thought around me and our mutual friends, that we are toxic towards her relationship (which she doesn’t have, they are not a couple) and she doesn’t want us to comment negatively on it or her crush ever. A lot of people she blocked, including the mutual friend who’s comment started it all, just said ""lmao"" and blocked her too, kicked her from group chats we used to discuss hangouts, and that was all. It impacted her greatly, she started calling them bad friends and accused us of lying to her and talking behind her back, having bad opinions of her from the very start.

Now, I can see that this behavior stems from her being very dissatisfied with the way things are going on with her crush, but she needs to see that he is a very manipulative person and has negative influence on her for herself, there is nothing any of us can do to change that. But I still attempted to talk some sense into her, and I got the same ultimatum, which hurt me. We have come to each other’s rescue several times, while one of us may have had no money, place to live in or food. We shared clothes, bed, friends, told each other our deep secrets and all that. I am not ready to lose a person this close to me to a douche bag, and yet I can’t see what I can do about it. 

What I know is that I can’t stay in a friendship with a person who can’t talk about anything else other than her crush, will postpone hangouts to play a dumb game with him all day and will break her promises just for a chance that this guy may think she is cool enough to be his girlfriend. And I can’t just ignore all that and say nothing. Several days has passed and we didn’t text or call.

I matched with some guy (26M) and we started things off pretty well. He invited me to go out to drink a couple days later and we met up! I had a great time and we talked till even after the place closed. 

Afterwards we were gonna part ways but I asked if he had anything going on the next day. He said no so I suggested we walk around the city for a bit and explore. We talked and walked for a 2 hours and a half. When it got a little late he took me back to my car and we talked for a bit, told me to let him know when I get home so he can sleep. Gave me a hug and we went our ways. I texted him when I got home that I had a great time, etc. 

Next morning he texts me that he fell asleep and also had a great time. We talked all day, and I eventually brought up the second date into the convo. I let him know and he doesn’t text me for like 18 hours. I’m like ahh well that’s the end huh. We briefly talk and I never hear from him. 

About a day and a half later, I text him this exact thing because I just wanted to move on but at least felt like I tried. “Hey, I know you haven’t responded back. I am not sure what happened, but if you’re not interested anymore I get it. Just wish we would have communicated better, so we both had our needs met. Anyway doesn’t matter anymore. I genuinely had a great time meeting you Monday and I wish you nothing but the best in life. Hope you find a job that pays well!” 

He responds like an hour and half later and this is what he said “Hey, I am actually so sorry that I didn’t answer. Tbh it’s just been super hectic this week and the last month tbh. I also had a nice time with you and you seem pretty great. I’m not opposed to hanging some time again, but i do have to say that it’s kind of proving itself that I’m not somewhere rn to commit the time needed for anything more than a friendship.” 

I did not respond and just left it that because I did not feel the need to say anything more. He doubled down on his behavior and I feel like we make time for things that matter and obviously I did not matter enough.

So me and my ex broke up, it was a toxic relationship and both sides have reasons for why the relationship ended. On her side it’s because I put others above her. On my side it’s because she was emotionally manipulative. (See past posts here for proof). 

My friends who I introduced to her however have essentially left me after the breakup happened. She went to them after we brokeup and they heard her side of the story. When I dmed them separately asking if we were ok, they used the word “monster” and said that they couldn’t believe I would do the things she told them. Now my ex has over exaggerated events and situations many times so I’m assuming she’s definitely doing that here. When I told them they’re only hearing her side of the story and that I haven’t even talked about it with them they were actually offended and said that “I never bothered to console or talk to them about anything”. They kept saying they were “disappointed” in me and they hope I will be better. I was extremely pissed and stopped talking to them immediately. I’ve been manipulated, threatened, and downright treated like shit throughout my relationship. I’m not gonna sit here and have some people who don’t know my relationship like that judge me from the viewpoint of my ex. They never bothered to hear my side of the story so now I’m not bothering with them.

I'm (F) so heartbroken. I've been dating someone I was so sure about being my person. Neither of us had ever felt like this for anyone before. Nobody ever matched my energy the way he did. For once I knew someone felt the same about me as I did them. The last two weeks I knew something changed. Less texts, less interest in me in person. I asked him about it. He kept telling me I was tripping or being weird. I tried to just let it pass but it wasn't. I had to end it. I can't deal with being switched up on like that with no explanation. I just laid here crying and read thru messages and thought back through our interactions. It all started after the first time we had sex. I don't understand it. He was so into it. He hadn't had sex for 4 years before me. Even last night we were sexting. He's the first man I ever felt safe and comfortable with in bed. He'd been so into me in every way up until then. I don't understand it. I already deleted him off most socials and blocked his number. I could still ask him about it but what's the point? He won't admit to anything. He went from reassuring me when I was insecure (I did the same for him) and promising he would always do so to telling me I'm ""tripping"" when somethings wrong. I'm so confused and utterly heartbroken. I've been treated poorly enough times to know whats worth dealing with and what's not. It feels like the world is ending. I just needed to vent. Sorry.
