Also, sorry for any formatting issues. I’m doing this on mobile. 


TL;DR : I ‘broke up’ with my friend of 8 years this year, for our own good. His birthday is coming up soon and I would usually say happy birthday. Given that I still don’t think we should talk or continue the friendship, I don’t want to be an arsehole, giving him false hope by saying happy birthday. At the same time I know not saying anything would crush him and I don’t want to be an arsehole by saying nothing at all. What do I do?


My friend “Daz” (26M) and I (26F) have been friends for the last 8 years. We met in university. We dated ‘briefly’ (2 weeks) but ultimately decided to just be friends. Now we live in different countries from each other. 

We get along amazingly. We have that friendship where you can talk about anything and everything. Time just passes by. He understands me and I him. Things have been tumultuous at times but we’ve always come back together. I will admit that this last 2 years has been emotionally taxing on our friendship. He was going through some stuff and I felt he was lashing out very badly. Unfortunately it was reminiscent of behaviour that he’d exhibited earlier in our friendship, which I’d forgiven. I was disappointed in his behaviour toward me and I didn’t want nor need to be his emotional punching bag yet again. It kind of put a wedge between us that continued growing the more he behaved horribly toward me. 

Despite that, I love him dearly and he loves me too. Fundamentally we care about each other. However, his love has always been… more than platonic. We both care about each other a lot,  but for various reasons cannot be together. I feel like his level of affection for me over the years has stopped him from truly connecting with another woman. He’s expressed many times that he wishes we could be together and that he still (romantically) loves me…

Earlier this year I decided that it’s best we’re no longer friends. Given how Daz feels about me, plus the way he’s treated me the last 2 years, and the way our friendship had started to devolve emotionally, I felt like we needed to stop. For his sake and for my sake, and the sake of our future romantic relationships I felt we needed to separate. 
I felt that in order for us to be able to have healthy relationships with other people, we needed space. We have an extremely close bond, you could even describe it as deeply emotionally intimate. Coupled with his lingering romantic feelings, I knew it couldn’t continue if we wanted to deeply connect with others. 
He got married this year and I got into a serious relationship. I’d always told him that when that happens we literally cannot stay friends because it wouldn’t be fair to our respective partners or relationships. I’ve said that from day one. Neither of our partners were comfortable with our friendship and I completely understood why. 

When I ended the friendship earlier this year, I sent a long message explaining why (could only message because we’re in different time zones). I didn’t ghost and I didn’t blame him. Because it’s not really his fault per se. After that I blocked him. 
Since then he’s contacted me via a different medium several times. I’ve tried to be polite but stayed firm in not being friends and keeping the distance. He even asked if we could be friends again and start talking again… 
Despite the fact that both of our respective relationships are now over I still don’t think it’s healthy for us to stay friends in the long run. 
I don’t hate him. I care about him a lot and actually want us both to have the best chance at happiness and in life. That’s why we can’t be friends. Not right now anyway. 

My current dilemma is that it’s his birthday coming up soon. 
When it was my birthday a few months ago, he sent me a message. Even though I’d ended the friendship I really really appreciated it. I appreciated that he remembered me. He knows how important it is to me. 

Normally I would say happy birthday to him too. 
But given the fact that I’ve distanced myself and believe that we should still not be friends, I don’t want to be coming into his life just to walk out again. I don’t want to give him false hope that we’ll start talking again. 

At the same time, i don’t want to hurt him by not saying anything. I know it would hurt really badly if I didn’t contact him on his birthday. 

I feel like either option is going to be an arsehole move and have the potential to hurt him. 

And I don’t want to be an arsehole to him. I don’t want to hurt him any further. Because I know I’m hurting him by staying away and distancing myself from him. 


So, do I tell him happy birthday? Or do I continue radio silence and leave him alone to heal and move on?

She's my biological father (Roy)'s mother. We've never been close (I'm one of over 30 grandchildren), but the distance significantly increased after Roy abandoned my mother (Mum) and I when I was 13. Without going into too much detail, he abused Mum and I for years. Mum and I struggled financially after this. As a result, Val worked 4 jobs to keep us off the streets and I started working at 14 to help out where I can. We often had to go without food or heat. It was a struggle.   


I never had much contact with Jan during this time. She lived in a city almost 2 hours away and Mum didn't have a car at the time. I know I could have called or written her letters during this time, but I didn't. She didn't write or call or visit me either. We are equally to blame for this.   


What made things harder is Roy's youngest brother (Dave) lived with Jan. He tried to sexually assault me when I was five. Roy said he would ""handle it"" and refused to let my mother report the incident. It kind of got swept under the rug by the larger family as a whole after that. So even in my 20s, going to visit Jan meant seeing Dave as well.   


So here's where I need advice. I still maintain a good relationship with Roy's sister (Cindy) and another brother (Calvin). Both have asked I come to the funeral, but doing so means facing Dave and Roy again. I went NC with Roy when I was 23. I had three years of therapy to help with both incidents, just for context.  


I've always been a people pleaser and the familial obligation is weighting on me. How can I say no to Cindy when she's crying on the phone, begging me to come? Or when Calvin says ""I can't wait to see you. I don't know how I'd get through the funeral without you""?

Hi Reddit. This is a burner account cuz I’m too embarrassed about this whole situation to post on my main, but here it goes:

Been texting and FaceTiming this girl I met online for about a year now, and through some pretty suspicious activity, I discovered she has another boyfriend. 

Basically, she said that she deactivated her Instagram saying that other guys kept hitting her up, but I know now she really just blocked me. So, I then I log in through my friend’s account (whose a homie for trusting me) on instagram, look  at her profile, and see that her bio has been updated, with heart emojis next to another guy’s name, the same guy she told me THAT SAME DAY, that they were just friends. 

I looked at her Insta stories via a website that lets you look through stories of public profiles anonymously (since I don’t want to tip her off that I know the truth quite yet, and seeing some random account she doesn’t know viewing her stories would certainly do just that). Anyhow, I saw 6 stories of just her and this guy from last night at some casino (she was in Vegas) with his username tagged, and with some heart stickers too. 

So besides the fact that I now wanna curl up in a ball and die cuz I thought she was the one, I wanna confront her about this in a way that guarantees she feels my pain, and that I can have some kind of closure. Seething revenge is also an option, since I want her to know what true betrayal really feels like (but I know that’s not what this sub is for lol).

We had a Halloween party and I send him an evite with the info, then he texted me and said that he and his girlfriend can come. I said great.

Two days later he texted to ask if his girlfriends sister and the sisters boyfriend can come. I said, ok sure.

A day later he texts me and asked if their friend who is in town can come. I said well who is she? He told me and I was getting annoyed, but I said ok fine.

Then the night before the party he asks if we have room for two more to invite his friend from high school and the friends wife. I said no, we have a cap at 20 people and at this point he’s bringing 3 extra people and wants to bring 5 extra people, and that he cannot invite them. So he replies and said that’s fine.

A few hours later he texted and said his girlfriend and her friends/family are vegan, so it would be great if I could have organic, vegan, all natural alcohol. I said that he has to bring his own because I don’t know what that is and if he wants to accommodate her he should bring his own. 

The day of the party, he texted me and said he didn’t realize there was a cap on the party and his friend and his friends wife already got a babysitter for the night…which means he already invited them. At this point I was over it and said fine they could come.

Party was fine but I made a mental note not to let him do that again. It’s worth mentioning this is our brand new house and our first time hosting parties with fiends and family because our new house is big enough for us to do it.

Now for thanksgiving, I send him a text saying “this invite is for you, your kids, your girlfriend and her son. Let me know if you can make it and what food you’ll bring.”

He just texted me back with this: 
“Would you be down for my girlfriend, girlfriend’s son, her sister, the sisters boyfriend, my girlfriends mom, and my girlfriends dad to come to thanksgiving?” That’s him plus 8 (he has two kids)! 

I want to say no, he is already trying to take advantage of us and we have never met these strangers.

He doesn't even as me if I'm okay. It's really been weighing on me, especially since I hear my coworkers talk about how their spouses move heaven and earth when they're sick. I don't want much, just maybe an 'are you okay' or something. Today at work I sprained my wrist. I was unable to leave until 7 hours after the injury because I didn't think it was that serious. The more I worked the worse it got, so I went to urgent care after my shift. After 2 hours I find out it's sprained. I get forms and persuade my doctor to not make me unable to work for the next 7 days as he wanted, but modified duties because we need the money. I called my boyfriend and tell him. His response? Okay. Okay? Not are you okay? What happened? He was tired and uninterested. I had to pry him to even ask any of these. I then spent the first five minutes of my drive home crying because I was so frustrated. I bought us food and went home. I basically lost it. I'm not defending what I did at all because it was childish. As soon as I walked in the house I completely lost what little composure I had and blew up with him. After I was done I asked him to unzip my uniform because my wrist was injured and I couldn't get out of it. He refused, called me a bunch a names and told me to fuck off. I saw red. I kept asking him over again, and eventually just sat on him as he was laying down on the couch in frustration-- a move I'm not proud of. I kept asking, which lead into me telling him to sleep on the floor because I paid for everything in the apartment. I wasn't going to keep this threat, I just said it out of anger which is my fault. Finally I gave up after more name calling from him. I got his sandwich and threw it in his chest and told him to leave me alone and that j would miss work tomorrow because I couldn't wash my unform (I work in a industry where our uniforms have to be spotless otherwise we get sent home). After he ate he came in the room as I was typing this and unzipped my dress. I started crying and telling him I didn't feel like he cared about me, and it made me feel unappreciated and empty. He told me to fuck off which in my opinion he had every right to do. I don't know how to fix things, I've never been irrational after something so petty.

However, he is moving up to my exact area next month and has told me multiple times before he blocked me that he wants us to cross paths in the future, and likes the odds of us crossing paths. He also only blocked me because he ""continuously hurts me"" so he did it for me since I couldn't do it myself. He says it's difficult because he really misses me, but it just isn't working. I agreed and said we needed space, because we really wanted to fix it, and he says he has feelings for me. It has been a few days and it is still hard for me to not have him in my life. It's really difficult. I sent him a text this morning from my friends phone:

""I should've told you that day I wanted to see you. Now I can only hope we meet again in the future when we are both ready. I hope we meet again when we are the people we needed to be for each other, even if you have someone else I would like to see you again."" 

He sent a heart to the message, I didn't really understand what it meant but I am going along the lines that he would like that too. When we split before, he didn't block me, told me he'd check up on me, to text him or call if I was in trouble or needed anything, etc. Then, after we tried to fix it again this happened. He was willing to fix it, but we couldn't come up with answers to it. Every time he would block me I would have a severe panic attack, and I finally told him that it happened every time he would. He says he blocks me because it's easier for him, I understand. In the end, we cared about each other deeply. I would say I even loved him, even if he didn't feel as strong, but I don't think we knew how to love someone else again. 

We both only had one relationship prior, his and mine were very emotionally and mentally abusive, even physical sometimes. When we met I was in the middle of a very traumatic part of my life and he brought me out of it, so I guess I became co-dependent unconsciously. He didn't know how to open up emotionally and put someone he said he ""loved"" first and I couldn't trust anyone's words, or deal with distance.

So, what's the chance we will get back in contact. I mean we'd live only about max 15 minutes away from each other walking. He works a lot but on his off days he'd be going places I'd go as well. Would he unblock me and contact me? I can't because I'm blocked. Would we be able to love each other the way we both wanted from the start? Is there a good chance he'll come back?

My girlfriend said something unintentionally like ""good, you too"" and blushed (we're both a little socially awkward so stuff like this happens sometimes). As we were walking out, I teased her for this and we laughed about it. I said it like this, ""you know you blushed after you said that?"" I didn't think it was rude.

Today, this morning, we were happy. Rolling around in bed, kissing and giggling, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But after she got up to use the bathroom and came back to bed, she refused to talk to me. I tried and tried to get her to speak but she said it didn't involve me and she just didn't want to talk so I gave her some space. It was like one second we're perfect and the next she's devastated about something.

She left for her shift, and didn't message me on her lunch like she usually does. I was super worried because I suspected she got some bad news regarding her father's cancer since her mother has been calling her more often in regards to that, but no. When she came home, instead of saying hi to me she made a beeline for her bong in the garage. 

I asked her what was wrong and she got mad at me for bringing up her social awkwardness at the optometrist last month. I was really super confused because it had happened so long ago. She told me that it made her feel super insecure and it wasn't fair that I teased her for it. I apologized and asked what made her think of it today and she told me she didn't know, she just didn't like it when I did that. In turn I asked what I could be doing better/what I could do to make it up to her. She said there was nothing I could do, she was just upset. I reminded her we've already had a conversation about me teasing her and that I haven't at all since then. She acknowledged that, but then asked me ""do you really think I like feeling like this?"" Which shocked me because she's never spoken to me like that before. I asked her if there was something else that was bothering her and she said ""nothing, im just stressed I guess."" She told me she didn't know what she was stressed about. 

I have to admit, I was a little irked. I haven't teased her at all recently. Not that it took a lot of effort, but it was the fact that she continued to tease me while I was no longer allowed to. This made her ""rude"" comments much more noticeable. And not only that, but she was mad at me for something I did BEFORE we had a talk about it. She said she didn't want to talk to me before because she didn't want to start an argument-- but we've only argued once over the course of 2.5 years, and it was resolved as soon as it started, so it was hard for me to believe this. 

I'm out at a library right now to get some air. I don't know what to do next. It feels like such a small problem to me but to her it's not and I don't know what I can do to make it up to her.

TLDR; My gf and I used to tease each other. I teased her at the Dr.'s &amp; she laughed. She doesn't want to be teased anymore so I stop.

Me and ‘Kate’ have been friends since the 10th grade, when we were about 16 years old and our relationship throughout high school was great because we would see each other almost everyday at school, however we never saw each other outside of school because she didn’t want to. We used to be a friend group of 3 but the other friend got tired of Kate never wanting to hang out and found other friends, while I stayed friends with both people. When we started University, Kate and I were at the same school so we saw each other a fair amount, yet she never took any initiative to see me outside of school time. When I wasn’t seeing her at school I would go out with other friends or my boyfriend, which was fine for the time. I also want to mention that Kate was obsessed with social media and building this sort of illusion of what her life was like, when in reality she’d only agree to do things if she could get a photo op out of it to post for everyone to see and admire her. She was incredibly pretty and always had a lot of guys in her dms but she never had a relationship, only entertained the guys who messaged her. This past summer is when everything started going bad, and the end of the school year she mentioned to me that if I wanted to see her over the summer I should take summer school with her, otherwise I wouldn’t see her much. As the summer went on I didn’t see her just like she mentioned and I stopped making any effort to ask her to do something. We just kind of stopped talking all that much, mostly from my end. When the school year started again, I messaged her and said hey we didn’t talk much and I’m sorry from my side and she responded with this long message about how I’m a terrible friend and that she can’t believe I just come back after we haven’t talked. I said I’m sorry and explained how she told she wouldn’t see me and it just fizzled because she doesn’t make any effort to try and see me. We had a back and forth for a while and for some reason I ended up taking most of the blame but I was ready to put it behind us and work on being friends. We talked for a little bit and saw each other at school for some time but it just fizzled again because the relationship is just not the same anymore. We’re not talking at all anymore at the moment, but I don’t want to go back and say sorry again for the same things. 

I loved having her as a friend but I couldn’t handle the whole I don’t want to do anything  but see you at school. The social media obsession also got to me because of how she pretended to live this life that she didn’t actually have, and pretending to be friends with everyone even if she told me she didn’t like them. Can our relationship be salvaged or do you think we have too many problems to mend? I do think I was wrong in not talking to her over the summer, but she never took any blame for what she’s been doing. Do I deserve all the blame?

I constantly feel like I'm under the shadow of his ex girlfriend (they broke up like two years before we even talked to each other), he has some stories on Instagram that are really old mentioning her (like a couple years ago), and also has a Spotify playlist of her with a date (I assume is the date when they broke up bc it only has sad songs) the problem with this is that the songs were currently added in the few months we started to talk.

I'm not really sure about what should I feel about this, what should I say or do, or even what to think. 
I've been a insecure person all my life and I'm trying really hard to work on it bc is only damaging me and our relationship.
He has never made me feel insecure about anything, and the things that I used to worry up were discussed in a really mature way (We are both adults).
How in the world can I compete with the ex girlfriend (4 years together) and leave that feeling of being her shadow.

I (F18) was dating my now ex-boyfriend (M19) for about 2 weeks. We met on tinder and went out for drinks at a nearby cafe. It was awkward but we found that we had so many interests, we liked similar things like anime, traveling, cooking, legos etc. (Btw he had told me he would like to be friends) I enjoyed myself and I was fine with that. We started talking more on discord and we met up again a week later for another date at a bookstore. We bought our books and stuff and made our way to the bakery next door. We kept talking about out future plans, things we wanted to do in life, it was nice. We went outside and it started to rain. It felt like a movie scene, where the guy would stare at the lead actress and suddenly kiss her. For me, that did happen. When he kissed me fireworks were setting and I was on cloud 9. I finally had my romance begin, I was no longer the side character but the lead. He told me his feelings on liking me, and I did as well. Last week we went on another date, it was at it his place. It was nice, he was kind and welcoming. He me made me feel at home. We cuddled and watched anime, one thing led to another and we slept together. Even then, he was sweet and kind to me. No one had ever made me feel so loved before. I know now that was my first mistake. That leads to today, we were supposed to watch the new one piece movie, so I went over to his place again. As we were cuddling and said he had something he wanted to tell me but I had to guess, I guessed that he liked me. No, the it was something more than that. I said that you loved me? He said yes. My second mistake. I told that I loved him and we did it again. He got us dinner and I thought we were fine and happy but he seemed cold, distant like he made a mistake. Just as we’re about to leave for the movie, he had to tell me something. He sat with him, holding his hand. He told me he couldn’t do this anymore, that’s it’s a him problem. That it wasn’t my fault. And it broke me, I was hurt before. He knew and he didn’t care. He used me for my body, to feel better about himself. I asked him if he meant it. He didn’t respond, and when I looked at him. He wasn’t the same man I fell for. He was gone and empty. He said no. I left and for a moment I thought he would chase after me like in the movies. He didn’t.

My bf and I have been dating since 5 months and i'm so in love with him. I'm re-discovering myself everyday and we have a wonderful chemistry. 

The thing is, i broke with my ex in February after 7 years of life together. I used to think he was the man i'd spend my life with but I actually handled the breakup very well. I do not love him anymore and don't regret anything. We're still friends but almost don't talk to eachother just bc we don't feel the need to. He was a huge part of my life, i wont forget abt him but I don't see him more than a friend (and a friend I don't even need to talk to). 

And sometime, I think about how my boyfriend is so super awesome or I want to look at picture of us or just think about a day we spent together. But I really have trouble acknowledging i'm dating him ? It's a super weird feeling that does happen only when i don't get to see him in a while. I just feel like my brain doesn't accept i'm his girlfriend and calling him my bf sound lowkey weird ? It's kinda as if I barely know him and was staring at a complete stranger. But it's not the case and I share so much stuff with him. 

Sometimes it's just as if it was an habit ? Like i'd be saying ""Oh i'm seeing my boyfriend this week end"" but the word boyfriend feels wrong bc it's tied to my ex. That's a rly weird feeling and I don't know how to change this because well, it's bothering me ! I like my bf very much, I feel like we have a future together and want it.
But ig my brain sometimes plays this trick on me.

I also think it's because I used to think love would be the same feeling for every person i'd be dating. Except it's not. We have a thing, it's clearly love, but it's not the way I used to love my ex. It's not just that we don't share the same things, it's really that I feel like this love is completely different and i'd be unable to compare the 2 (bc sometimes ppl says their best relationship was with X person, but I cannot do that bc it's just two different things).

Disclaimer: English is not my first and not even a second language.

Basically, I am a 24M and there is this girl from my work 22F.

We've been talking with with her for half a year now. She is from a different office in a different city, so we mostly had small talks over text which changed around a month or two ago.

We were texting as usual, yada-yada, then it turned into flirting which turned into her visiting which turned into hanging out and having sex for a week. Boundaries seemed to be clearly set, as both of us stated we don't want to get into a relationship. (We both had break-ups recently, me around 7 months ago and her around 2)

It was great, but afterwards when she went back some issues began. The first conflict began with her stating that unless we will see each other frequently and I come visit her her at least twice a month (it's a 12 hour drive), she would like to reduce contact with me. For me it was honestly a bit of a shocker, but later she admitted having feelings, so we kinda settled on a fact that we can try a relationship, as I did like her as well. That lasted around a few days until when I was hanging out with friends, she started pressuring me on not texting her back right away. The attitude seemed really pushy in general with writing me non-stop and acting as if we were in our fifth year of a long-term relationship. That lead to another conflict, of course. 

I talked to her about taking a step back from the whole relationship idea as I felt really uncomfortable, which she understood. Later on, after a few more days, we had another conflict about me breaking a promise to talk to her in Skype (totally my fault). While I was at fault, her attitude with ""Don't make any more then, I am kinda tired of these promises"" (mind you, it was like only the first or second time I wasn't able to do that due to personal issues arising spontaneously) somehow really triggered me in combination with still pushy attitude, so I went to a rant that I am kinda sick of it and would really like her to understand my boundaries better, which I did in a frustrated way, as she somehow decided it's a good enough reason to start fully ignoring me. Mind you, my whole rant consisted of things like ""I would really like you to understand this and that, I am not feeling ok from this and that, please consider this and that, I don't have enough resource for any of this"". She only broke the silence to claim that I am a full-on psychopath and that's why she will ignore me fully. 

A few days passed and I kinda felt shitty about that whole rant, thinking I could've communicated it better, and breaking promises is also a bad thing to do, so I texted back just to issue a heartfelt apology just for the sake of it. It wasn't very well taken, I was once again accused of being a shitty toxic person, gaslighting, threatening  and scaring her (like, lmao, yeah, those scary ""I want you to respect my boundaries"" talks) and having hidden motives to stop communicating with her and using that situation to turn the blame on her to become a victim (which I obviously didn't have any plan to do). I almost called it quits, but she chilled out we were even able to reach the point of apologizing mutually. Already caught two lies at the time, that she didn't delete her photos for some reason when she started ignoring me and that she didn't tell her friend, who unsubbed from me like 30 minutes after our conflict started.

So we started talking again and it was actually going pretty ok this time, albeit still being pushy, as I am not entirely comfortable to talk for hours every single day and having a fuckton of romantic coating in the whole communication. Of course it lasted only a few days, where absolutely out of nowhere during a very enjoyable conversation she said that she misses me a little. I asked why only a little and she bursted out how she still didn't forgive me and whatnot, turning it into a blaming rant at first. For you to understand, few past days it was all ""I miss you so much"" and ""I really want to see you again, we should meet up very soon"", so it seemed like a joke at first. Apparently it wasn't, so it turned into another conflict where I actually managed to explain to her it wasn't really ok to hit me like that and those mixed signals and rollercoasters of emotions and attitudes, while also not telling me right away that she still holds some kind of grudge. So for the last few days, I cannot bring myself to not be cold to her, especially because after the conflict she still proceeded to act as usual.

To keep it short as possible, we both moved across the country post college from our state to 15 hours away from our families. We both wanted to get out of state and find a new state to live in, but she realized after signing our lease she wanted to stay in our home state. I had no job prospects with in 200 miles of our parents homes that utilized my degree. I applied to jobs so far away since this is where my work is high demand and really helps my starting career (East or West coast USA).

We make the move and she was really unsure about moving. I offered her to make our relationship long distance until she decides if she wants to come or not. She decided to follow through and I feel like she blames me for taking her away from her family. She says she made the decision to come with in the end, but her family constantly say I stole her away from them.

We have open communication with one another with discussion and have been dating for 6 years. We have plans for house, dog, family with in the next 3-4 years. However, I still have no job prospects back home unless I make a career change in something I got a Master's (and bachelors) for and have good experience setting me up to excel in this field. I understand missing family, but my career would need to be switched to something completely different or live in lower-income poverty type position where family, house, etc are not possible.

We still visit family for a week twice a year around Christmas &amp; summer vacation. Lately, she has seemed more distant and crying about her family having a get together they have once a month. She's really upset about not being able to be part of it and says she misses home a lot. She doesn't see our current residence as home, only temporary.

I told her I can look into other job careers or prospects, but I need more time to develop skills for a job switch. This learning is also being done while I'm currently learning and growing in my current position which I currently enjoy. I told her timeline would be 2-3 years at least before looking to move back home or elsewhere (closer to home). That would put us around the time to discuss living by family if we start a family. She said she understood this.

I'm worried one of these days she will wake up to tell me she is moving back now to either LDR or end it. We are having less intimate time, she seems more distant, and she won't be as open in her communication. She says it just makes her sad talking about it.

I'm not sure what to do and I don't have any other response to the current situation. Just been stressing me out cause I'd love for her to be happy.

My wife worked retail awhile too so it’s just an inherent dopamine kick to get something new. That’s fine.

My brother (27m) and his dog has been living with them as well since his previous breakup and also due to lack of income. He got laid-off from his previous job (gov contract \~1.5 yrs ago) and began private fitness and nutrition coaching. That being said, with the little amount of clients he has, and him working for a very small gym, doesn't bring home that much money. My parents have become his support system. 

I recently started a very high paying job and with my wife also working (nurse), our total comp comes to about 190k USD/yr so by no means are we struggling as well as not paying a mortgage and other home costs we're doing even better. With our new home, we just got the pre-approval done (new home is about 425k), so we're trying to be very careful with finances for the fact that our mortgage officer and underwriter will be seeing what's going in and out. 

Two days ago, my wife and I were sitting in the hot-tub outside when my dad walks out and says that my brothers dog lunged and latched onto my younger female dog. Initially we didn't see any blood or anything but my brother stated he had to really pry open his dogs jaws to get him to let go of ours. Our dog seemed fine so we went to bed thinking no big deal. 

Next morning we wake up and realize our dog actually has a decent size lump on it from the bite. Bite was right on her chest slightly above two front legs. Again, we think that it's probably just swollen and will be fine after some time. Later that day it happens again, this time on our dogs rib cage albeit nowhere near as bad as the first bite.

Again next morning, we wake up and now this swollen bite mark is now swollen and is the size of my whole hand. We start Googling what could be wrong and every site says its either an abscess or hematoma caused by an infection and you need to take your pet to the vet as soon as possible. 

We do finally get her seen at an urgent care clinic where the bill was a little over $1000 because the wound was definitely infected and vet even said if this was left untreated it could have been fatal. After we got the bill and waiting to leave the vet, I had a phone call with my parents basically saying, this isn't going to look good to the mortgage officer when they check our statements, is there anyway (my brother) can pay us back. Their response: ""He has no money, how do you expect him to pay anything?"" Keep in mind that when we realized initially that the bite was swollen there was some conversation from my brother that he would help out if we had to take our dog to the vet. My parents talked with us and said that they can front us $500 for the vet bill which they did. 

Problem I'm having now is: we should have paid $0 entirely for this. My brothers dog lunged at ours because of a food aggression. His dog thought that our dog was getting some table food from my dad and that's what provoked the attack. Our dogs have never been hostile to anything being a lab mix. Brothers dog is kind of all over, you can see some pit-bull features as well as other breeds.

Me (26f) and my bf (27m) have been dating over a year. 
A few days ago, we went out drinking about both got drunk. I drank more, and blacked out for a good part of the night. We had a pretty big fight (about drunken stupidness) but I barely remember any of it. 

The next morning I went to the bathroom and I was slightly sore “down there”. I asked him if he had sex, and he said we did. He said he was trying to go to bed after our fight when I walked in the room, announced I was in the mood and starting taking his clothing off. I don’t remember any of it.

He didn’t say anything more about it, not that he didn’t want to or anything. But I’m worried that in my drunkenness I may have pressured him or made him feel uncomfortable before sleeping with me. 

I’ve never done anything like this before, and I apologized for my part of the fight. He never mentioned the sex part again, and we’ve had sex since. 

Thoughts? Should I bring this up again and ask to make sure?

I told her that he was in my dms before and I had no interest and he was probably a player. She said there was an event yesterday in the city I am working in that he invited her to. They have been talking. She probably won't go though. She is back in the home city we live in. I said oh okay, let him know I am in town because I'm interested in events here. She said that was weird. I said she didn't have to. She ended up telling me it was a private birthday party (now I'm not sure how true that was given the following story). I told her I wasn't into that. I told her I would message him and ask. Because in my mind he has thrown events here before and I almost went, I knew him before her. I don't want anything to do with him on a romantic level whatsoever. I just want to know about events and he is in town. I have hit up DJs female and male about events in this town before. She doesn't say much more and we continue talking about other stuff.

At 3 pm, she messaged me out of no where and said ""Rebecca I think you are playing me"". I am dumbfounded. In no way I am playing her. She says something along the lines of ""you downplayed him and said he was a player while you ask me to tell him about you being in town and you dm him"" ""I talked to several people about this and they said you are playing me"". “There was another guy into me before and I feel like this is a pattern with you”. 

She is basically accusing me of trying to talk to and hang with this DJ instead of her. 

She feels this way because I was talking down on this person but I was still going to speak to this person and hang out with this person. Which is not true. I don’t want to hang out with him one on one.

Two things for me are true. I do have a belief that male DJs in general slide into a lot of dms of girls and are often players. I am not interested in them because of this but I still go to events and I’m cordial. 

I feel like she is being distrusting and she is not being straightforward.

I am at work at this point and this all makes me tremble and shake and get upset. It upsets me so much that someone accuses me of something I am not doing. I am definitely not interested in him in any way. She could have him for all I care. When he was in my dms I never responded to the flirtations. If he flirted with me again I would turn him down 100%. I just told her my honest thoughts and I wanted to know about events in the city. That was all.

I start getting upset and I need to calm down at work. I text her back and tell her all of this. I try calling her, she hangs up on me. I can't get through to her at all. She seems convinced already. She does say she would call later but she never did. Then I try calling friends to try to vent and get over it so I can get back to work because I am so upset. I can’t deal. I leave her alone for the most part but I was so hurt.

I keep being upset about this the whole day. My friends told me to leave it be but I am upset and message her more that night. I am angry. I go to bed. I take a mental health today, I am too exhausted to work. I end up messaging her again the next day trying to defend myself and argue against points she is making. Assumptions. She just screenshots and stone walls me. She doesn't want to have a conversation. I end up getting so upset I blocked her . She blocked me back. I know I acted rashly with that but again, I was so exhausted with it all and I feel like she was being inconsiderate. I told her to never text me something like that while I am at work (I work a stressful job) and call me directly with any issues instead.

So for background, we moved in with his mom at the start of the year (Jan 2). We live in a multi-family home (think apartment units, but in the shape of a house) and we live in the second floor and she lives on the first floor with her husband. We decided to move because she offered us the second floor with no rent and childcare was free since she also runs a daycare (we have a 2 year old son). 

This isn't the first time I've met her, so I always knew she was a bit... overbearing. I just didn't think it would affect me this bad. She brings him breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday without asking if he wants any and will just walk in whenever to bring him a plate. I cook as well, but nowadays I just cook for myself since he ends up eating his mom's food. If he eats my cooking, then awesome, but I don't plan around it anymore. 

Anyway, I decided to post this because it just happened and it really bothered me this time. My boyfriend has decided that he wanted to start meal planning to help reach his fitness goal which means he can't be eating his mom's food anymore since he'll be on a specific diet. She offered to help pay for his new groceries since she has a Costco membership and he agreed. Last night, I cooked his meals for today since I was already cooking for me anyway. But just a few moments ago, I guess his mom asked him if she wanted to cook his meals for him so he brought his groceries downstairs. This made me feel upset, but I also feel ridiculous about being upset. Like, I'M his girlfriend so I should be cooking for him. That sounds kind of ridiculous, but I do kinda feel that way. 

I recognize that my love language is Acts of Service, so I know that has a part in this. I don't want to always feel insecure, hurt, maybe even jealous of his freaking MOM so I wanna bring this up.

They were originally very supportive, and I was glad I opened up to them. However last Thursday, when we were all in the office, they took it upon themselves to look my therapist up online, and send a picture to me of his office. They did this in front of my other colleagues, who don't know about my Mental Health situation, and to be honest, I didn't want them to know, but they have probably overheard. 

My work friends even tried to look up his house on Google images, and when I went to their desk to discuss this, they were joking about 'calling him up for a consult', and 'prank calling him when they are drunk'. This is a very sensitive subject for me and although I was laughing (out of anxiety) I did explain that I do have anxiety, and these jokes aren't funny. I asked them both to assure me that they would never do this. One did so, but the other said 'I can't promise what I will or won't do when I've had a drink'. I have been worried about this as the last thing I want is someone ringing my therapist saying whatever when things didn't end well as it is....

I'm not too sure how to best approach this situation as it makes it more difficult the fact that we work together, and I am meant to be going away for the weekend with one of them next week. I feel that if I don't address this situation, it will sour the entire trip. 

I would appreciate any advice about how best to approach this situation, I know I shouldn't have said anything in the first place and I've definitely learnt my lesson

I know conversation goes both ways but even when I try to take an interest in what he's talking about (even if it's about his frat &gt;75% of the time), he doesn't seem to reciprocate the same interest. I don't know how to find a common ground about things to talk about unless we're doing them together.

I've talked to this about him before, initiated a breakup, and then ultimately begged for him to do better and stick with me so we can work it out. I feel like since then, I feel more alone around him.  I don't think I'm getting the same amount of attention or the attention that I deserve/want. I feel like part of me is jealous that his attention has to be divided, and I feel needy when I ask him to hang out or put more effort in.

I looked for like 2 seconds max when I noticed then looked back forward as tho there was no woman there to look at. 

Then 2-3 seconds after looking back forward I heard my advisor lightly giggle under her breath and say ‘you looking at her there’ (while looking at the computer and didn’t turn her head to look at me when saying it but glanced towards the one I was looking at direction) I juts about made out what she said it was low volume. 

I just didn’t say anything and she just carried on scrolling on the computer quietly

Since that date I have constantly been following up with him asking if they had a date, where etc. He would either ignore the question or say nothing is set in stone.

For example - he is always right, he never and I mean never says sorry unless I leave him, he tells me I’m too sensitive and crazy and brushes off my concerns. He’s called me horrible names since putting on weight in pregnancy saying I’m a fat bitch or a fat cow and will send me ugly pics he took of me while in bed and calls me lazy. When confronted he always turns it around to me. If he isn’t able to answer without acknowledging he is in the wrong he ends the conversation with yelling and swearing and demeaning words.

There has been physical fights where I have tried to get his attention when talking off the Xbox and he lashes out and pushes or shoved me, he has slapped me once in the face but validated it because I opened the door and it him behind it.
I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant and struggling, I took about 2.5 whole months of this year during my pregnancy due to health issues (HG, and anaemia). Whenever I approach him with an issue like “can you please not say shut up to me when I’m talking or walk off, or can we spend time together I noticed he turns it around saying things like “you always complain everyday” Or I’m always demanding and bossing him around yet I do nothing . He has a problem he plays his Xbox everyday, most Days  morning till the next morning.
He misses sleep and work a lot to play Xbox. I understand men work hard physical jobs so I always do my best to take care of things at home, ie the washing, cleaning, groceries, cooking, yard work making sure everything is stocked up and buying baby things and handling bills, always letting him know I appreciate his work 
I don’t earn as much as him and he seems to measures hard work in the money and physical labour.

So at least August of next year before being able to start ttc again because it wouldn’t be good for me or a potential baby.

Here’s the thing. It took me forever to get my husband on board with the thought of having kids. He’d always find some drawback, but eventually he WAS on board. Anyway, yesterday we were watching The Big Bang Theory and watched the episode where Penny tells Leonard that she doesn’t want kids. My husband and I got into a conversation in which he said he’s excited to start trying again because hopefully it’ll be easier to get pregnant after all the weight loss.

But… I’m starting to think I don’t want a baby anymore. And I have no clue how to bring that conversation up with my husband. It’s just, losing all this weight is hard work. And I don’t know that I want to get pregnant and potentially gain it back as vain as that sounds. And kids are expensive. And I’m starting to feel my age, I’m not a spring chicken. And a thousand other reasons to not have a child.

Not only that but due to malabsorption issues oral birth control isn’t really an option anymore. So likely I’d ask my husband to go get a vasectomy rather then me getting an implant or iud.
