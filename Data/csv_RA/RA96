Long story short, my father was in the hospital and it was touch and go. My brother lives in a different state. He knew about his condition. I told him it’s ok if he doesn’t have to come if he doesn’t want to. They have a strained relationship. But still out of respect our father had only been good to him.

I was taking care of the finances and trying to take care of the medical side for my father while being in my masters program and taking care of my sister. It was hell to see him go back and forth between the hospital and nursing home for eight months. My brother was aware of the situation but stayed in his state. He had the excuse of he was working in case we needed money. While I’m handling everything and working extra. I was so stressed it brings me to tears now. My bf (25) helped me immensely and his family. I couldn’t of gotten through this without them and a family friend. My bf helped to take care of my sister even though she can be a handful. Essentially she is a child in a 32 year old woman’s body. We have dated for a while and broke up before because of immaturity. But he stepped up and really helped me get through all of this. Now my brother is coming to visit and is pissed he is staying at my house. Mind you my bf has his own apartment he just chooses to stay here to help out with my sister. My brother views this as being a leech. I gave him a heads up to let him know he stays here and no response.

I feel like he has changed since the beginning of the relationship. I say this because whenever we would argue, we were able to talk things through and so today, I asked him a simple question while we were on the phone asking what he was doing and he said he was working and I’m like okay, I was not mad, and he said he feels like I’m accusing him of something and then said he doesn’t want to talk so I said ok bye and then 30 minutes later I texted him saying “so you don’t want to talk?” And he said “I’d rather not talk than argue.” It honestly made me feel really hurt because I wasn’t even mad when I asked him where he was. I haven’t spoken to him all day because he was working and then when we finally do talk and I ask him questions about where he has been he gets angry at me. I just feel like it’s extremely rude to just say that you don’t want to speak anymore just because of that. We’ve also come into issues in the past of him disregarding my feelings whenever I would bring something up so this has been accumulating on me where I just constantly feel like shit about the fact that I ask questions. He would think I’m accusing him when I’m not. Other times, he has been mean to me and makes the situation about him whenever I was upset about something.

We both seem(ed) to like each other a lot, and hit it off very quickly. We both are college students (although are studying in completely different majors), and share a multitude of other hobbies and interests. However, with some bad experiences with rejection in the past, it took me some time to work up the courage to ask her out. It worked out much better than my fears told me it would, and we started dating.

We had been texting almost non-stop daily during the week before I confessed, but I've been told that we moved extremely quickly. However, my feelings for her were, and still are, extremely strong so I was fine with whatever speed she wanted to move at (she was experienced). The day after I confessed, I stayed the night and slept with her (literally just sleeping, no sex), with some sexual intimacy occurring the day/morning after.

I had asked her out on Monday evening, had stayed over Tuesday/Wednesday. Today is Thursday, and after sensing some slight tension and hesitance from her last night, she finally told me that she wanted to break up because she wasn't mentally available. Something about her thinking she was ready when she said yes, but that she's going on new meds and isn't sure how they'll affect her mental state. She explained that she had talked it out with her therapist and that they'd both agreed that it wasn't fair for me, especially since it was my first relationship. So, in the end, I got dumped. 

When she was explaining everything, I just listened. I could tell it was already hard for her, and didn't want to make it harder. I just accepted that things were over and planned on trying to get out of her life so that we could both move on. However, hours later I still can't stop thinking about what I could've done differently.

Not to sound like a broken record, but I really like this girl. I've had crushes in the past, but this is so different. It feels so easy to talk with her and open up my heart. It seemed like we both just enjoyed being around each other, even if we were just doing work and studying. In fact, my motivation and work-ethic even increased when I was around her solely because I just wanted to spend more time with her. And now you're telling me that after all of that, the best fucking few days of my life, I just have to let it go and move on?

If I had tried to reason and fought for the relationship would it have gone better? Or even just asked if I could wait for her to get back on track. She's something I'm willing to wait and/or fight for. Even if she's not ""giving as much as I deserve,"" I'm happy just to be around her. I've dealt with mental health issues in relationships in the past (with my mom), so mood swings aren't anything new to me. I just don't know anymore.

I truly want the best for her. The logical part of my brain is telling me that this is for our own good, and that it's better off for both of us. She needs the time to heal and get used to her meds. I know that this is the best path for her. I guess I just wish that I was instead. I just can't imagine feeling this way or connecting with anyone else like this again. She's the person that I've been waiting for my whole life, and I just have to give up because it's the same bullshit of ""right person, wrong time.""

It just feels like every time things are looking up for me everything comes crashing back down. A part of me is glad that I got to spend that measly amount of time with her. But another part wishes that it never happened. Because now I'll just be yearning for a feeling that I might never find again. And that might be better than having ever felt it in the first place.

I've now been single for about a year after my first ex, and I had a bit of a glow up. However, now I'm just lonely and eyeing cashiers for fun. I've been on a few dates this year and none of them worked, they were either pervs, I wasn't their type, or they were not mine. 

Anywho, considering this loneliness, I sometimes go on omegle, snapchat, discord and find people to talk to... sometimes it goes alright, alright enough to keep talking, some are huge perverts but I continue talking even though I really don't have much of a sex drive at all towards them. A lot of them are quite older, sometimes in their 50s, but I must say I like that way more than men 18-25. 

The men who talk to me 95% of the time say I'm pretty, which makes me feel good.... It doesn't matter that much if they themselves are handsome, I'll always say they are so I can continue to talk to them. I flirt with them because they won't stay if I don't and it's rather fun. However, sometimes they end up actually liking me, seemingly without games, but most of the time I do not; it's an entertaining game to see if I can make them romantically interested in me but even if I ""win"", I fail in a sense. I can't bring myself to stop it when they actually like me, because I wouldn't like to hurt them, but I'm hurting them in the process of trying not to hurt them, and I also have the selfish want to just continue flirting and talking to them.

Long story short, because of me moving away for a job we were in a LDR and just couldn’t deal with the distance anymore.

I told my best friend of 10 years about it today and that I’m experiencing a lot of sadness and trying really hard to stay afloat and distracted. After that talk, for the rest of the day she would constantly bring up her boyfriend (of 10 months), what kind of dates they’re planning on, what she wants to wear to their dates, and even sent me an unsolicited picture of him cooking and talked about how he’s so cute. 

She usually talks about her relationship with her BF like that on a regular basis (more frequently than my other friends), and it never really bugged me too much, though i had to ask her in the past to tone it down on the details. But I thought she was being quite insensitive today, because she knew that I am having a pretty hard time right now. I don’t know whether she intended to or not, but it felt like she was really shoving it into my face to remind me even more of what I miss so much about being together with my ex.

This post is all over the place so I apologize upfront a little backstory into why he has these issues. 

Reason #1 

He’s an adopted kid, his adoptive parents ended up getting pregnant right after they took him in. Many years later this disowned him (I still don’t know the real reason why, just that they sent him a letter). 

Reason #2
He’s been married three times, 2 / 3 of those wives decided to up and leave him while he was at work. Came home and they were gone. Honestly I’m beginning to see why they did it. 

Tonight we got into an argument and I think I’ve just hit my limit and I said “I’m done” and started packing my things. He came in and told me I was manipulating the argument by “punishing him” by leaving. 

I will admit that I have my own issues and cannot stand confrontation. When an argument is happening and there’s no end…I just shut down and just need to walk away. 

The argument - 

Went and say Wakanda Forever today, I happened to love it. He kept saying one of the characters was an awful choice as she was attending Harvard but talked “ghetto”. (We are both white) He repeated this several times before I knew it I blew up and told him to stop, that what he’s saying was a offensive. I was rude AF and I’ll own that. 

I told him what he said is wrong and the way a person speaks doesn’t make them any more or less intelligent that’s a huge stereotype and it’s awful. but he wasn’t having it. He called me a judgmental f#ckface for judging him for his “opinion”.

I was already annoyed by his comments before that, but this is an ongoing issue. I don’t like name calling especially during an argument it’s childish af. (I don’t like the way it feels, not that I’m a conservative person.) so in return I get pissed off, and mention that we’ve talked about it before. 

He said “well I wouldn’t have said it, if you didn’t say what you said” 

This was followed up with “I’m the one upset right now, you’re manipulating the situation to fit what you want” 

“I was pissed off first, you should be making it right with me. Anything that came after that doesn’t count” TF?! 

We argued for 2 hours, i said I was sleeping on the couch, that’s “manipulating the situation just to make him shut up” I endured more then I said if the couch wasn’t an option I’d just leave. he just kept calling manipulative because I was “threaten to leave” when he’s upset. To me leaving is the best choice, I had already attempted to sincerely apologize for the way I came across but I wasn’t sorry for what I said. he’s impossible to talk to when he’s like that. No apology is good enough or sincere enough. 

(But have you ever tried to apologize when your still angry?)

I finally hit my breaking point, I said “I’m done.” tried to break up with him and pack my things to leave. This is just one thing in a list of problems. But I’ve just had it. 

He just kept asking “why is he so disposable? Why does everyone leave him?  A I took all power so he now can never be upset with me. Im blackmailing him for disagreeing with me” I tried explaining my side but it was too little too late, and he was crying. I’m really not trying to manipulate the situation. I can see why it comes out that way , but I literally don’t know what to do anymore. 

He decided to take a lot of prescribed anxiety meds to go to sleep. Whenever I upset him, he uses the pills as a form of escape. He kept saying “maybe you get lucky and I’ll die in my sleep, you’d be a relieved.” I told him he was wrong, but here I am writing this post while he is sleeping solidly.  WTF do I do?

We have been together for 4 years and married for 1. He has one daughter. I moved an hour away from my family to live with him in 2021. He has has been to 2 of my family events in 4 years. He has still never met my dad, which is mostly my dads fault. 

My husband works an odd schedule, which contributes to the issue. Even when he isn’t working and there is an event, he will often choose to stay home and watch football because he says he wants to relax after working all week. Ok, fair enough. Sometimes I want to skip things so I can decompress after a long week too, but, come on, after this long it’s becoming offensive to my family. I have been asked why he doesn’t come and I always make an excuse but I’m tired of making excuses for him. 

He is pretty introverted, I am too. Neither of us like big events with a lot of people. I totally get that it’s draining for him to spend a few hours with people that he doesn’t know well. I know how that feels because I do that for him. His family throws big events several times a year and I go with him. I go to dinners, recitals, weddings, baby showers, holidays etc. I know his father and aunts well. They now call me to organize around schedules instead of my husband. Just the other day he saw that his aunt was selling an MLM product on FB and is having a party. He said, “You are probably going to have to go to that.” No, I won’t. 

 It’s not just my family. He does this with other events, too. He wouldn’t attend a friend’s wedding with me last month. He has skipped birthday dinners with friends so he can stay home and eat fast food in front of the TV. People often ask me if we are still a couple because we are rarely together at dinners and events. I’m usually alone. 

The last two times he’s skipped something I’ve told him exactly how it makes me feel. He just says he will go next time, he’s just tired, there is a big game, he has something he has to get done that day, etc. I’m getting tired of it. We are talking about a few events a year. I’m not asking the man to sacrifice his time off every week. 

Tonight I asked him if he was going to Thanksgiving at my grandmother’s with me this year. He said he didn’t know, he isn’t sure what his family is doing yet. I became instantly pissed as soon as he said it. I have been to every holiday with his family for years. He can come to one damn Thanksgiving with me. I haven’t said anything yet because his daughter was with us tonight and I need a little time to formulate a calm approach when I do bring it up. 

I’m thinking that I will tell him (again) how he it makes me feel when he skips events that are important to me and let him know that I will no longer make excuses for him. If he is staying home to watch TV, that is what I will tell people when they ask where he is. This feels petty, but I also want to tell him that I’m going to stop spending so much time with his family. It just doesn’t feel fair that he gets the benefit of having an involve partner when he isn’t giving anything back in return.

My immediate coworkers knew what was going on and would share their support. One in particular though seemed more like a nosey person that wanted to know all the details regardless of the closeness of the relationship. The kind of person who asks you an upsetting question that is personal; ""How are you dealing since you lost your parent?"" is not morning conversation on a daily basis. After being nice and sharing too much at times, I've finally had to say I don't want to talk about those things while I'm at work, I want to be focused on my job.

Recently this same nosey coworker came to me in tears one day and confided in me that an extended family member who was like a sibling had passed. We commiserated in grief and while it wasn't something I particularly wanted to be doing on the job when I had already expressed that I didn't want to talk about this kind of stuff, I didn't want to talk about it at work, I didn't want to talk about it with her. But again, grief is powerful and sometimes you just have to let it out.

Something was bothering me, and over a few days I rethought over the interaction. It occurred to me that the family member's name wasn't mentioned once. None of the family members actual names were involved in the story, just titles like aunt brother grandma. I went through something extremely awful in regards to my parent's death and have been in active counseling weekly if not biweekly since we learned of the cancer diagnosis. To say that going back to work I am 'tender' is an understatement.

I looked through obituaries in the town the family member supposedly passed in, and no one matches even close to the description, even without knowing a name. Sure maybe the family member doesn't have an obituary, but I'm going to ask her tomorrow where the funeral is and what name to send flowers under, and see how long it takes to come up with something. If it's suspect, I feel like I should go to HR. This person is actively continuing to make me live through my trauma at work regardless of my expressed feelings about not wanting to talk about it. I thought about what if it was the anniversary of when they person passed but she was specific that he had passed in the last recent time period.

And no, I can't just not talk to her.

My Dad has clearly always had mental issues and I grew up watching it get worse over the years. My mother was a drunk and a physically, verbally, mentally abusive asshole. Not only to my brother and I, but especially to my dad. She's still an asshole, but now she just doesn't drink.

My Dad, ever since I can remember, had trouble keeping things clean. He turned the basement into filth, trash/garbage everywhere, I'm pretty sure there's mold, asbestos, (probably) unsafe chemicals from projects he'll do (he's a brainiac, dont ask me what he does, I dont know)and more its just too much to describe it all. If I could show you a picture, you'd be mortified. Today was the first time in a long time I've seen the basement. I always knew it was bad, but this time it made me saddened and concerned about my father. To me, it looks like a manifestation of his horrible mental state.

He stays in the basement an unhealthy amount. This mainly started with him going down to avoid fighting with my mother because it was overwhelming, abusive, draining and this was pretty much DAILY. Now it's mostly just been habitual more than getting away from mother dearest. 

Due to my dad's upbringing/my mothers abuse he's not very open emotionally, struggles to be vulnerable, he avoids talking about his emotions/depression. I want him to maybe start seeing a therapist, I want him to be in a better place. I dont want to worry about my dad having a mental breakdown or committing suicide. But I have no clue how to go about bringing this up, privately, without my mother's interruption or questioning. Or evev just how to get through to him.

During that time she got divorced and I stupidly took her back a few years later, she did admit to being in multiple relationships and talking to other guys since then. But I broke it off a year ago

We got close and had some nice moments but I kept noticing how open she is with other guys and how she'd claim that every other guy was interested in her, she kept pushing me for marriage and kept blaming me for moving too slow just because I didn't want to rush in to marriage. 

Everytime we'd argue about it, she would always say that it's my fault that things are moving slow and that she doesn't like being with someone who can't commit. She would always say how she wants someone who loves her more than she loves themselves, that's not normal right?? And She always used to say that she wanted me to open up to her and tell her how I feel and that I can talk to her about anything if I'm ever upset. 

So I did when I mentioned that I didn't like how open she is with other guys, she said that she didn't want to be with anyone that's insecure just like her ex husband was (even though she'd already cheated on her ex husband with me which was unknown to me at the time, so he had a reason to feel insecure). 

I don't get why she'd tell me to talk to her about anything then end up throwing it back in my face! I told her I'm not happy so we agreed to end it, I was confused at first cos she used to tell me that she misses me everyday and after that conversation she ended up blocking me off everything at the startwhich I thought was childish.   

After we broke up she messaged me on Christmas day saying: 'I just wanted to message you to say that I hope you’re okay and that I feel as though I’m ready to stay as friends with you if that’s what you wanted.. I didn’t think I would ever be able to say that we could stay as friends but I feel like I’m in a good place and I know everything has worked out for the best and I would be really happy to have you as a friend But if you don’t want to hear from me that’s okay too just let me know x' I did reply to her saying that I don't think it's a good idea and I wished her well. She just replied with a simple 'that's fine no worries x'. I'm trying to not think about her messaging me, but I feel like I was really getting in to the healing process and was really focused on other aspects of my life such as my career. 

I know I deserve better but I see her quite often as we live near one another and I can't help but still feel hurt and a part of me still misses her. We were quite sexually active together and i think thats whats making me miss her more. I know I won't probably move on straight away but I don't know why I'm still hurting over someone that is so toxic for me. 

I blocked her on social media a few months back but was debating to whether unblock her or not. I do feel like I have enough anger for the way she treated me to be able to ignore her. I do still feel angry over the situation, not sure if that's normal or not. 

I have my own auto detailing business which I run on the side of my career and on the weekend, I have a social media page for it and I have set it as a public profile because it is only for business content and I never out anything personal on it. A few days ago I put up a story on that page regarding a job I was working on and noticed she had viewed all of the stories that I posted, I found it weird that she did this because she unfollowed my business page when we broke up and hasn't paid attention to it in the last 11 months. 

I sometimes feel sad as I'm alone and haven't dated anyone since her, I often see her around and feel as though I miss her but I know those feelings are only from loneliness so I have every intention of staying away from her. I've tried keeping myself distracted by focusing on my career and business, she has tried messaging me a couple months back by sending some charity chain messages although they could be her way of breadcrumbing?

I always see her around as we live near one another, there were times where I used to try and get her attention because I missed her but now I just feel angry because I feel like I let her get away with a lot.

He is gorgeous, smart, and hard working. 
We totally clocked when we first met and after a week of meeting he asked me if I wanted to come to his place for drinks, and to hang out. I went over and we had drinks, talked a lot, and of course ended up having sex. 
Not much has changed from this. We see each other about once a week at my place mainly, we talk a lot and catch up on things, then have sex, talk more and then he goes home. I never reach put to initiate a conversation. I’m trying to maintain a distance for myself by not setting up any form of expectations. But he always says I can text him too if I want to see him or just to talk. 
We have a lot of similar interests and always great conversation. He says he is only seeing me and I have only been with him since we’ve met. We’ve had this conversation multiple times. 
A few months ago he told me he was moving out of state and it really upset me. He tried to call me but I didn’t want to talk because I was crying too much. He begged to talk to me and said he was still going to be coming back to our area once a month and still wanted to see me. On his stories through social media he seemed sad but was still living life and hanging out with friends and family. About a week after we mutually stopped talking to each other he muted me so he never saw my stories so I did the same for him as well. The only kind of filling he has on social media is a plethora of pretty girls and he mutually follows them as well. 
About a month of not hearing from him and he suddenly pops back up. He wants to see me so I let him come by… and now we are back in the same cycle we were in, except now we are talking more in between and have gone to a store together and I dropped him off at the airport recently. 
I’m pretty sure while he is away he is looking for a new place to live and where he plans to move his business. I really like this guy, and he says all the right things, but never wants to see me outside of either of our places and I’m pretty sure his friends don’t know about me. 
I’m too afraid to bring up anything because I’m worried about what he might say. 
But I’m so confused how a guy has spent his last year seeing me on a very frequent basis when somebody like him could get any girl he wants. This guy is a total package kind of guy, I’m just meh and feel constantly inferior to him. He even tells me I’m sexy and I just don’t buy it.  
I’m just struggling. I don’t get what he wants from me other than sex when, like I said, he can get it ANYWHERE else. 
I don’t know what the heck I’m doing anymore, but I’m upset that I’m secretly in love with somebody who doesn’t care about me. 
I should mention we are both in our early 30’s.

After a short time we both started to smoke again (like a sort of cheat month of you will) but recently we made our promise again to stop smoking the reason being is bc we both have a difficult time quitting and by making a promise to eachother we have something to uphold, at least in my eyes. Well today I went to her house to pick something up and wouldn’t you know it in her room was a bong with a half finished bowl, not going to lie it was funny to see especially bc it was just there on her couch, but moving on.

It genuinely hurts my feelings that she broke our promise especially bc I have held up my end of the deal despite cravings and temptations and now that she has done it twice I don’t really know what to do, I should break up with her for lying twice but for one, what kind of a man does that make me? A push over, spineless man. On the other end I don’t want to break up with her because I love her genuinely. It came to me that I should give her and ultimatum of Choosing between me and her continued smoking, although am aware that it maybe isn’t the correct way of handling the situation but when you have been lied too what else can you do?

A few weeks ago, they reached out after denying my proposal of being friends 2 months ago to try and be friends. Things had been going very well, they asked for some advice on a guy they were talking to and we hung out in person a good few times. Things seemed pretty smooth until yesterday. 

They came over to my house and were playing music and chatting, but they kept getting more and more physical in ways that didn’t feel so friendly. They kept getting up in my face, they bit my hand and then kissed it, and they kept grabbing my hand to push themselves off to spin in an office chair I have despite very much having feet to use to spin themselves. They also got less than an inch away from my face and just stayed there for like a full minute. Not exactly friend-y behavior imo but I was trying to keep my cool and not overthink it.

They then tried to get me to dance which was silly because I’m awful at it, and then they flopped over onto my bed after a few minutes of that. I sat beside them and asked if they were okay and they just didn’t respond, so I sat there for a bit and waited for them to react since I know they dissociate sometimes. They eventually reached out and seemingly wanted to hold my hand, which caught me off guard. I put my had within grabbing distance and they just held it. It caught me off guard honestly and I had no idea what to do. We stayed like that for a bit until they let go and started holding my face. Eventually they pulled me in and I ended up kissing them quickly on the lips, but they proceeded to passionately kiss me back. I pulled back several times but they would just kinda lean back in and go back to it, I pulled them up so they were sitting up and tried to ask why they were cool with that and they just kinda grabbed my face and kept kissing me. 

After that for a while they flat out asked if I would have sex with them, which i flat out denied because that’s just not how I am. Things went very sour after that, I asked if they were just kissing me to try to get that from me and they acted strangely. I cried a little and they half assedly comforted me before insisting they didn’t mean to do that.

They are the one who broke it off. I feel devastated and I don’t know what to do. They want to remain friends but I don’t know how to feel at all.

Long story short, yesterday I (20f) was having a discussion with a friend (Jack) about my bf, something completely unrelated. Eventually he said he needed to tell me something. 

He told me that 5 months ago, at the birthday party of a friend, while I was a little bit drunk and making a fool of myself eating a sausage at the table, my bf said to the group of people (him + 3 others), “yeah, I know she’s drunk, but you don’t need to take care of her. It doesn’t matter to me. When a better girl comes, I’ll take her instead.” I asked my friend if he had ever said anything like this about me after this one incident, and he said no. He said he didn’t say anything good, and he said he didn’t say anything bad. 

At first I was immediately ready to break it off with bf. Words cannot describe the hurt I felt from that, even if it was kinda a while ago. I talked to my bf and he denied all of it and went off on the person who told me,and told me to stop lying to me.

Next thing I know, a few hours later, I’m getting a call from Jack, plus another girl I don’t know too well called Hannah. She confirmed what he said at the party 5 months ago, but she wasn’t actually *at* this party. Just said she heard it from other people. She then went on to tell me that this wasn’t the only time bf had talked about me this way, and that a few months ago while we were at a get together, he said it multiple times in front of a table of a lot of people. 

My first question was: when did he say this? Was I away, or did he say it right in front of me? See, bf and his friends speak a different language with each other since I’m living in a foreign country and I don’t always catch everything. However, I DEFINITELY would have heard him say this, as at this point in time, I understood almost everything in the language. They confirmed he said it in front of me and was laughing about how I couldn’t understand him. 

When I told them I most definitely would have understood something like this, they changed the story and said that this was the party I left to call my friend, and he said it while I was away on the phone. However, in the beginning, they both were adamant that this party was held at a different mutual friend’s house who I haven’t mentioned. I knew this couldn’t be true though, because at that said party, I was sitting beside my bf the entire time. I clarified that the only party I ever walked away from to phone my friend was a party we had at Jack’s house a month or two ago. They then both switched the story and were like “oh yeah, sorry, it wasn’t at (mutual friend’s house), it was at Jack’s. 

So it goes from being at a mutual friend’s house while he says it right in front of me, to being at a completely different person’s house and saying it while I was away. The story did change a lot. I asked if I could ask anyone who was there for confirmation he said this, as they claimed everyone heard it, but they told me I could only ask a few specific people and gave me excuses as to why asking other people would be a bad idea (they were too drunk, they weren’t listening, etc.) 

What I also find weird, is when I asked Jack if anything else bad had ever been said about me by bf after that one incident at the party 5 months ago when I was drunk, he thought really hard and said no. So to call me up with hannah and tell me all this a few hours later is a bit strange imo. 

I already made up my mind that I will ask a couple people today, I think I know the right people to ask and I don’t see why they wouldn’t be honest with me.

I talked to bf again after this second call with hannah and Jack and needless to say, he was pissed. To give more context, bf recently did something stupid but completely unrelated that pissed hannah off, and he thinks it’s possible she could be telling me this as revenge to try and get me to break up with him. He claims none of what they claim he said is true, but that he doesnt deserve me for other reasons and that I should leave him. If he’s telling me to leave him anyway and saying he doesn’t deserve me, and let’s assume he actually did say these things, why wouldn’t he just tell me? Like if he genuinely thinks I should leave because he thinks he doesn’t deserve me, I don’t understand why he would lie about this.

I’m just heartbroken and I have no idea who to believe. I guess the best thing I can do is ask people who were present at the table when he supposedly said this. I’m just looking for some input from strangers who can be impartial about the situation.

She went away with her friends to visit her college for homecoming weekend and prior to her leaving we had gotten into a verbal argument when we were both drunk over nonsense but I thought we had moved past it when she left for the weekend.

On Saturday night I was alone and feeling really down and I was texting her just asking her to be there for me but she was at the bars and she told me to basically screw off and she’s not dealing with me and she’ll talk to me the next day. 

We have been on and off arguing over the smallest things for a while now and I had just about enough of it and I told her that we’re done. She doesn’t talk to me the next 2 days I didn’t text her either.

I just moved to the city and I bumped into a old coworker, me her and her friends go out for some drinks and we kissed and the kiss meant nothing. She kissed multiple guys that night I guess it’s her drunk thing to do but after this we still remained as friends.

Me and my ex meet I tell her about what had happened and she becomes super insecure, I deleted her socials but still kept her number and me and my ex decided to do a break instead of break up.

Our relationship I would say is quite chill, we don’t fight much, and we can be good friends. Recently, he mentioned that he will be on an out of town trip for work. To which I said ok, and always update me whatever he does there, because I didnt want to experience the same   the traumatic experience I had with my ex.  (the back story was that my ex also went to a work-related out of town and then broke up with me thru text when he got back. Only to find out he was already courting his co-worker). My boyfriend knew about this story, but he said in an irritated way that he will update me and will not be like my ex. I sensed his irritation so I asked why, and he said he felt insulted that I would assume that he wouldn’t update me, or that he would ghost me like my ex. He said it was unfair on his part because for the past 3 years he always updates me wherever he is and who he is with, which was part of trying to win my trust. In fairness to him, he has been consistent with his updates, sometimes sending me pictures even when I dont ask him to. Dont get me wrong, I dont ask for hourly texts, or check his phone,  or always nag him to go home when he is out, but it’s more like letting me know where he is and who he is with. Which has always been our dynamic and what I have been doing to him too.

But to me his irritated response felt like he was being defensive? I didnt expect him to react that way because I just wanted reassurance, and he could’ve said something like “ok I will update” but it snowballed to a huge argument. I know my boyfriend shouldnt be blamed for the trust issues I had in the past, and this is something I have been working on myself. But it hurts me more when i share my worries and he feels like it’s an attack on him, where he goes defensive right away. When we argue he also has the tendency to roll his eyes, which I don’t know if is involuntary because he also does it on occasion when he tells me about something that makes him mad (unrelated to me or our relationship). After our heated argument, he said sorry and he said I love you and I wont hurt you. I also said sorry for offending him. I was able to tell him that I didnt like his eye-rolling, or the way he makes me invalidated with my feelings. He acknowledged it, and on his part, he said that he didnt like that it seemed I dont trust him, because I dont have any reason to.

Compared to before, we have gotten better in expressing difficult emotions, because when our relationship was new we just swept things under the rug, sometimes not talk to each other. My boyfriend is an only child and we both grew up with very strict parents, and we had a similar upbringing where we cant express emotions. I am also his first serious relationship. But still, I dont know if we are consciously or unconsciously gaslighting each other, because it’s always been about how each of us feel, and we always want to be the “right” one in argument.

I was crushed. I really thought this could have been our chance again. He said he would still like to spend time with me before leaving and I thought about it and had agreed.

I don’t even know if this is the right place, apologies for any spelling or grammar issues, it’s not my relationship I need advice on.
We had been together for 8 years.
After our separation he started an emotional affair with a work colleague who is married with a child (from what he has told me its a fresh marriage with an IVF conceived child - I only mention this as it seems that they as a couple worked hard for their relationship and I don’t necessarily understand why she would risk it, as for my SO its simple - selfish lonely behaviour where he genuinely didn’t care for anything let alone anyone. He felt like he had “lost it all” already when I had asked him to leave)

We barely spoke in our time apart, never kept tabs. We managed to find ourselves conversing recently and the topic of reconciliation came up, this is where he spilled his guts as he has never been one to lie. Knowing what steps to take straight away He ended things with her immediately; it was all long distance as she works in a different state. and he claims it was purely about sex and complaining about work/their lives over the phone/texting, they never exchanged explicit photos just photos of random things (he didn’t know apple only pre-delete photos and videos, silly silly man) 

He pretty much ghosted her after ending it with her and has resigned from his job, its left the place in a god awful mess. I have a feeling everyone at work knows but doesn’t know. By ghosting I mean; she kept calling him trying to have a friendship but he flatly ignored her outside of work emails.

One year and a half with my boyfriend (30M) now. He doesn't like to have sex with me. Less and less.

He works at night, 8pm-2am (he only has to sleep there). He either sleeps at work or goes home if he manages to wake up while he's at work. It's been almost a month like this. We are always busy during the day and have no place of our own, so the chances to have sex are limited and he actively limits them even more.

The only night he's free we sleep together, usually, and I initiated the last couple of times. Last Monday I was busy until evening and he was out for dinner, supposed to come over to my place afterwards. He called me when he was already in his own bed, and didn't come over.

We chatted over the phone, said goodnight. After about five minutes I called him back because I couldn't sleep, I felt horrible, alone. I told him I miss him and that I feel I never get to see him. I told him I feel he's avoiding me. He didn't deny.

That's when I realized I was close to having my period because I spent the rest of the night and the morning after crying like a fountain and feeling like the lowest piece of garbage in the world.

Next day we meet, have a long car trip to go get somethings in a nearby town. We talk a lot. I tell him I feel neglected, unloved, unappreciated. He says he's sorry, and that I'm right. But he avoids me because he's not satisfied with the sex (an old issue of ours, but I thought I'd worked on it).

He says he feels that I don't like myself enough to feel free with him, to feel like I have something valuable to offer, and that turns him down. Also, I apparently can't interpret him while we do it, apparently never know when or when to do or not do what.

I don't feel like I'm that bad usually, but when he tells me I start to see how that might be true.

This single, huge problem seems to be at the root of our failing relationship. He claims there is nothing else, he likes everything else about me and wants to be with me.

I don't have the experience to compare with anything. I've had casual sex all my life, I've never looked for an emotional connection with anyone until this guy, I only ever had sex (often while drunk) to enjoy knowing someone I fancied fancied me back. I didn't care about my past sex enough to pay attention to whether I was feeling good or I was making the other person feeling good.

I never had sex twice with the same person until the guy I dated before this one.

He was younger than me and was ok with anything, but now that I'm being told all these things I'm starting to see how sex probably played a part in our downfall too.

So me and my boyfriend are completely stuck. After talking about my feelings I asked if he could come over the next night after work, just to cuddle. I thought it was obvious that I needed some company and I was in big trouble with my pre-cicle despair.

He said he could come, didn't, and called me the next day to explain that he'd fallen asleep, as usual.

I barely managed to answer the phone because I'd cried all night and would continue crying all morning.

Until last Sunday everything was pretty much ok except the sex. Since he first stood me up on Monday, it's been a downward spiral of despair and crying and every interaction I have with him makes me feel less and less cared for and important and I think we have reached rock bottom. Yesterday I talked about breaking up. He said he doesn't want to, but can tell that he's failing on the entire line and won't blame me for leaving him.

I love him so much. I want to believe that it's just a sex issue. We have had this issue for a long time but this time he managed to explain his feelings a little better and I think I understand more or less.
But I have troubles believing this could be such a huge issue. I'm afraid he just doesn't feel much for me anymore, and is convincing himself it's the sex.

We planned to have kids at some point, so we were just letting nature take its course. At some point we even had our fertility checked because it's been 2yrs and no positive pregnancy test.

However, when we actually finally did get pregnant, things went downhill. I wasn't getting the emotional and physical support I needed from him since my first trimester, while he was overwhelmed and pressured for this new responsibility and change. 

We ended up having an intense argument and we took a break. Then I found out he has been active on dating sites even before I became pregnant. I also had a woman messaged me saying my ""boyfriend"" hit on her before (half a year before I got pregnant) then messaged her again (during our break) to reconnect.

I was livid, but I chose to forgive him and told him to clean up. He promised not to put me through that again and he'll work on earning my trust back.

Then we went through months of him not being sure of whether he wants to stay together, or be there for the child. He also dodged any topic about the baby throughout my pregnancy. I found out he began talking to random girls on social media again during my second trimester. I told him to clean up not for our relationship, but because we'll be parents soon and we need to show up as better version of ourselves for the child whether we decide to be together or not.

I'm in my third trimester now and he is still unsure if he wants to be there for the baby's birth. He asked for a no contact break so we can better ourselves and see things at a less clouded perspective. I gave him space, and I found out he's been back to his unhealthy pattern of seeking external validation by talking to random girls on social media.

He reached out to me after 10days of no contact asking ne how I am. I kept my response short but cordial. The next day I was told by my ob/gyn that because of some complication, I need to do more ultrasounds than routine. I informed him about it and if he wants to come to any of them, he said he'll think about it.

I am just confused how I should go about things. If there was no child, I would be solely focused on healing and moving on. But we are now tethered by this little one so I'm trying to find a way that the child will have a stable life with present and intentional parents.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7516259,public,self,Complicated Marriage &amp; Pregnancy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ys3j5k/complicated_marriage_pregnancy/,all_ads,6,

I am particular about things being clean. My mind gets flustered when I’m around clutter. And frankly, I pay way too much $$ (CA) to live in a messy home. 

My partner however (male), is one of those guys that will drop his dirty clothes next to the hamper opposed to actually placing them in it. Or leave dishes on the sink or stove for hours and rush to clean them, usually doing a half assed job and I will have to re-clean. 

I’m the type that will see a mess and deal with it. Or if something needs to be re-stocked I will do it. With him I have to literally ask. I have to go around every night and double check locks because he’s forgotten in the past. Two times living here he left the front or back door unlocked. I have anxiety and it’s starting to piss me off that I have to do all of this on my own. 

Is this type of relationship sustainable? We get along great. I do love him. But I’m tired of picking up the messes. Today we had a fight because I made the bed and he came home to nap, so he pulled my side of the bed blanket over himself (all fine) but then later when he left for night shift, he just left the bed like that.

I am at cross roads and need the wisdom of the people.

Where I'm (M) from, arranged marriage is common and I was happy to receive a proposal (let's say from F1). I shared this news with a long time friend (F2) whom I knew had feelings for me. This broke her and I cannot stand being the reason for her sadness. I have already started talking to F1 and so far everything's going great. Leaving either of them won't be without repercussions. Here are some things I am considering when making a decsion:

1. F2 and I have been long time friends. There was a semblance of budding feelings at some time but it quickly died out because of what I perceived to be incompatibility and some discussions.
2. F2 hasn't been keeping well since I shared the news
3. I perceive great compatibility between F1 and myself
4. Although F1 and I are not that deep in, leaving her will definitely leave a scar, albeit not one as deep as F2's would be if the same happens
5. I'm unsure of what I want myself: the compatibility of F1 (which is mere supposition given I havent known here since too long) at the cost of losing F2 as a friend. Or securing the long time friendship with F2 (whom I know will stick but we might quarell often) and the cost  of injuring someone who has just entered the picture and who, in some sense, has not wronged me in any way

If I may resume the situation, I think I'm in a guilt vs resentment situation, I'm unsure of which poison to pick.

i think that because he partially knows how i feel, and because he loves me SOOOOOOO much, he doesnt want to push his luck and doesnt really mention it. when he saw the note he just said “well that sucks…” and exited the app. and when i told him about seeing my ex, he took a few minutes to be upset and then moved on. he tries so hard to make me happy man its so unfair of me.

Girlfriend wanted a break and now wants to know when I am free to talk

Me(20) and my girlfriend(19) have been together for almost one year.

3 months ago was the last time she said ""I love you"" and last month on 11 she asked for a break.

I saw her with some other guys as we go to the sane university. Today she messaged me ""Hello (my name)! When are you free to talk?""

I was thinking about saying ""Hello there, I'm free tomorrow at **:**""

What do you think she wants to tell me?

For some context you can read one of my previous posts

Thank you in advance for the advices!

Edit: I answered her message and told her that I am free today at 18:30 and she agreed with it, I will meet her in a few hours and I will make a ""bigger"" update in this post (10/11/22)

Edit: We met yesterday at 18:30 and for half an hour we talked about random things about our lives and then I asked her if she wanted to tell me something.
She said yes and asked me how I felt during this break and I answered with ""I tried to focus on myself to become better, doing things that I like and developing myself.

I asked her back and she said ""the first two weeks were harder but then I got kinda used to it""

She compared our relationship with the rrlstionship of two of our friends who thought we couldn't last more than three months while theirs lasted for 3 months, she said that our was true love while theirs wasn't

I told her that I don't want to remain friends after because it would be strange to remain friends with the person I wanted to be with my whole life.

She even said ""don't think that I do not appreciate everything you did for me, I really loved you"" and repeated it some times after.

I said ""I hope you will be good and will be able to achieve what you want in life"" and she said the same to me. I told her again ""good luck om your future"" right before going home.

Before our separation yesterday she asked for a final hug and I hugged her like I never did before.

20 seconds after our separation I started crying like a baby and continued for almost 2 hours, even now while I am writing this update some tears are still flowing.

I feel like I lost a part of myself, I feel like I lost the best girl I could find and it's awful. And in the end it's my fault for what happened.

Some of you asked me which where the mistakes that made her behave like this so I'll say if now.

We went on a one month vacation 3 almost 4 months ago and I went in Italy before she went to Germany, I asked one day if she was free to play something during that night to catch up on things and she said ""maybe"", the same night she played videogames with another guy and I felt like an option so for some time I acted distant, I know I shouldn't have but I didn't know better then. She felt like I didn't care about her and that she was carrying all the relationship. She basically felt so hurt by me that she lost attraction.

She wanted this break to see if she could behave like she did before, in an affectionate way, and yesterday she told me that even tho she tried her best she couldn't do it, so she didn't want to force herself and be fake, I appreciate that.

I feel like I lost all motivation to do anything, I barely slept today and all I can think about is her and regret all the mistakes I made.

What do you think about this?
Do you think that she will come back eventually?

About 6 months ago I started hormonal contraceptives (to aid my difficult periods, so not for the purpose of rubber-less sex) and since my sex drive has decreased quite a bit. Not to a point of worry but just a lot since before. We went from having sex every time we spent the night together to maybe every third or fourth. I am incredibly stressed about how this decrease may affect my relationship. It’s gotten to the point where I’m not really sure if I’m horny or just convincing myself that I am just to have sex, almost to fill a quota that I have made up in mind?

My boyfriend isn’t part of the problem at all. He reassures me all the time that he doesn’t feel anything lacking and is very content in our relationship. He also obviously only wants to have sex with me when I’m horny too. I know he can tell sometimes because he asks me multiple times if I’m sure I’m down to clown. The sex we have is also very fulfilling. I feel loved and satisfied so that’s not the issue.

My brain is the only villain here but I don’t know how to get out of this way of thinking. I don’t really want to talk to my boyfriend in depth of how I’m feeling.

Throughout that period of getting to know each other, I felt I had to juggle everything. I knew it that time but it felt nice getting to know someone after college so I took my chance.

It’s my first relationship.

Fast forward to today, I failed my board twice and I feel so lost with everything. I review at home and I've always had a dysfunctional family. There was a problem same time last year I met him that made me feel so alienated from other  family's healthy dynamic.

My boyfriend is just like how people are from a healthy family environment is raised. He's self reassured and he has a great support system. And during our relationship, he has successfully passed the board on the first take. My insecurities have resurfaced once again.

Why can't it work for me? I feel lost and the recent result of my exam was just a trigger of my grieving. I grieve for the type of person I am. I grieve for always blaming myself for not having enough self control and for always putting others first. I grieve for my people pleasing patterns. I blamed myself that despite all blood and sweat and tears juggling work and review, I still have not passed my exam because l'm not good enough. I grieve because even if he tells me he supports me, he can’t seem to understand. We met at a good time, I just had my promotion at work, I was taking care of myself, I was independent. And I saw how he admired me for it. And right now is just a dark place? And I don’t want him to see me like this? His life is fast paced and for the first time in my life as a goal-driven person, I wanted to slow down.

It’s been a very positive experience so far and I’ve learned a lot about my self including the fact that I’m a sex addict. 

I’ve always had a complicated relationship with sex but never suspected I was a sex addict. Once I found out it really made sense of a lot of things and made me really rethink my last few years. 

I’ve been dating my gf 20 since high school and she is my best friend but since we started dating, I’ve always had an issue with our sex life. It has never been satisfying for me, we rarely have sex, I always initiate, she doesn’t seem into it and all the attempts I’ve made to change things have been futile over the almost 4 years we’ve been together.  

It’s also caused me personal issues, I really felt like she wasn’t attracted to me so I stopped initiating sex for the most part so it really only happens once in a blue moon now. I also started really hating my self and have tried to improve my looks to be more attractive. I’ve gone down from 176-155 pounds and am still trying to lose weight, I bought new clothes to look better and even just tried to take better care of myself. None of this has really helped though. 

With that said I love my girlfriend and everything outside our sex life is great she is still my best friend and has always been there for me. However I don’t want to tell her about the addiction because I feel like she may start trying to have pity sex with me which I don’t want. I want her to actually want to have sex with me on her own not because she feels obligated to. When I originally told her about my childhood abuse I think she felt really sorry for me and I hated her treating me with so much sympathy for the time being. I know she will do it again if I have to explain this to her. 

But I feel like I owe it to myself to leave and be in a situation that makes me happy in all aspects because I feel like the sex issues will cause problems in the future.

My girlfriend works 2 jobs and is a full time IT project manager and sings part time. 

She’s been singing at night for 1 weekday and 1 weekend (Saturday night). She also takes random gigs on some nights. This effectively leaves us with Friday night to really spend time together and wind down at night .

But recently, she told me that she wants to sing both Friday and Saturday nights. Considering the fact that she works till 8pm for weekdays, I have expressed to her my concerns that we are not spending enough quality time together.

But she told me off and said that she is already sacrificing by only singing 2 days and not 5 days a week. She even said if she should look for someone as ‘busy’ as her so that she don’t always have to be spending time together with her other half. She kept insisting that she just wants to do what she wants and I should not be stopping her. 

I can be equally busy but I chose to free up my time as I believe in spending quality time with my loved ones.

All this goes on for about a year, and all this time I tried to find answers to why is she’s like that to me, I got to the point where I had a breakdown over this situation, after all this I don’t want to see her at all and go no contact, I hate even hearing someone mentioning her.

Now to the event, our parents are helping us paying for the wedding and we didn’t tell them yet we don’t want her there, we don’t even know how to start this conversation. I’m afraid they will throw a “if she’s not coming we’re not coming either” from them.
