Lately she has been inviting me to go hangout with her and this group of friends. I have gotten to know a lot of these friends since the start of our relationship and I consider them solid people who I enjoy being around. However, there are a few who I don’t think I should associate with. There are two guys she is friends with. One of them has a history of substance misuse, is a pathological liar, and has stolen money from one of our other friend’s mothers. He claims to be doing much better now, but seeing as he is still lying and going out drinking with us, I cant really trust him. The other friend has a history of heroin addiction and has also stolen from loved ones. The other day I was with him and this group of friends and he mentioned that he was in the middle of a manic episode and had been awake doing cocaine for 3 days. Again, someone I cant fully trust. I feel bad for both of these guys, as I know they need help. I also enjoy their company when I’m not thinking about the parts of them I don’t align with. I don’t believe my girlfriend is having the same dilemma as I am, but I think the mature decision in the best interest of myself is to no longer associate with these people. However, this will come with some challenges, because I do have fun around them, and because it will mean less time around my girlfriend. I typically only see her on weekends due to our busy schedules, and she often wants to meet up with these friends to party on the weekends. It will also be difficult because many of my friends who are my age are typically keeping to themselves and doing their own stuff with their girlfriends. So I worry I will be alone. I anticipate that she might accuse me of thinking I am better than these people. I also worry that me declining her invitations will start a lot of arguments. How might I communicate this dilemma with her? Or the decision to not hangout with some of her friends?

So I(21m) had been dating this girl(20f) for about 2 months and things were going pretty well. But throughout this she would always mention how 'we were going too fast' and how it was scaring her. I knew she had commitment issues due to past trauma so I asked what I could do to slow it down but she had no answer to that and just said that she was falling way too quick. Yesterday, she broke up with me saying that she wasn't ready for anything serious and wanted to focus on herself and take a step back from dating. I didn't try to change her mind even when she asked if I had anything to say.I know that she had feelings for me and she is hurting right now as she had to delete me off of socials even though we had a peaceful break-up.

I just wanted to ask you guys if I should try to convince her to change her mind because I don't want to regret not trying later.

For a couple of years there had been some tension between myself (F25) and a coworker (M30) and recently we finally hooked up. Things seemed great, we were going on a few dates, had great sex, and very engaging back and forth conversation over messages. It was fun and he seemed to be the casual type which I was fine with at the time.

This went on for about a month or two until it slowly faded on his end. When I asked him about seeing each other again he told me he was busy with things happening in his life at the moment but we could come back to things soon— and the conversation was left there.

But then about 3 weeks after telling me this, he started posting pictures with a new woman, and they’ve been going on vacations together and seeming pretty serious. 

Honestly it’s hit me like a truck. I wasn’t expecting to feel so heartbroken over someone I barely dated, but the pain runs deep. I wish I could be the person who could accept I’m too good for this guy that screwed me over and move on — Instead, I’m so caught up on wondering why he didn’t see relationship potential in me and how he so quickly got serious with someone new. I keep wondering about what ‘could have been’ and wishing I got to spend more time with him and I feel jealous of this new girl and the experiences she gets to have with him. I should know I have no chance now but part of me keeps downplaying his new relationship trying to give myself a glimmer of hope that I’ll get to pursue things with this guy again.

Has anyone else experienced short fling/ situationship heartbreak? How do you get over it , and accept the fact they’re with someone new? (I’m honestly finding this so difficult)

She does not work and doesn’t go out often, yet she’s still pretty social with friends online and usually doesn’t sound anything other than normal when she talks to most people.

For some context, two years ago (nov. 2020) she had her first psychosis episode. She was taking some antidepressants at the time. She suffers from PTSD and OCD and often this would result in nightmares that would ruin her sleep, causing her to be tired most of the day. The medicine helped, but around this time she became very unresponsive during our conversations and would sometimes talk about things that didn’t make sense (like there being a monster in her consciousness).

Eventually one day it progressed too far. I never had any experience with these symptoms so I didn’t see it coming, but one day she came downstairs while I was in the middle of a nap and told me she had been assaulted by her father (whom we were living with at the time.) It didn’t really make sense, the father denied it profusely and shortly after she became completely unresponsive, peed herself and laid on the floor for hours until we were able to take her to a mental hospital early that next morning. She sounded like… detached the whole time, until after a week she suddenly sounded better and they saw fit for her to go home.

Fast forward to now, she’s been given medication following that incident and has been largely fine over the next two years. We moved about four months ago, but she did not have enough medicine to last before they could get them transferred to a pharmacy near us, and we did not have a car to return to the pharmacy she was with already. About two weeks ago, we got a car so she started her meds again because she was having trouble sleeping and focusing on her recent work (from home, streaming so no strict schedule). She started talking about having multiple people living in her head a few days ago, her speech would be spotty (lots of pauses; forgetting the topic mid-sentence) and yesterday I took her to the hospital for these symptoms, to which her doctor admitted her into a psychiatric evaluation center.

Recently.. this has made me terrified of our future. She seemed like she was really back to normal for the most part, but with this relapse it has me worried about how often this kind of thing could occur. I really love her, we’ve been together for three years and this has only happened twice, but I don’t fully understand what kind of things her mental illness will put us through down the line in life. My mother suggested that I think carefully about continuing to date her, as it could cost me a lot of flexibility in my life due to having to take care of her.  I visited her yesterday but she was so convinced that she was going to prison that it was hard to hold a full conversation with her. A couple of times she would freeze, her eyes would go wide like she realized something, and then she’d say something that doesn’t make sense. When I first took her into the facility, she was also saying this stuff over and over again, unable to focus, shaking and convinced that the nurses were going to send her to jail and take me away from her forever. I tried multiple times to tell her she was fine and the nurses are only interested in helping her, but it was impossible to convince her. She was that convinced that she was going to prison.

I’m honestly scared. I love her but don’t know what to do. Is this condition going to be persistent throughout the remainder of her life? Will proper medication prevent a future episode? Does anybody have experience dating somebody with a similar situation? She is completely fine when not in this state, albeit besides some anxiety around social interactions, but for the last two years nothing like this. 

Sorry for the word vomit, I can’t really focus and I’m also typing this all up on my phone at work. Any and all answers appreciated greatly.

My partner and I are both early 20s and have a 7 month old baby together. We moved into my mum’s house again a month or two ago because the opportunity arose for us to live there paying less than half the rent we previously were. This was in the hope we would knuckle down and save a house deposit soon and have our own place by the time our daughter is in kinder at the latest. 

My mum has been more than generous, especially atm as she is recovering from a back injury and I’m sure wouldn’t hate having her own space but with all of us and a baby she helps watch while we work she doesn’t get much alone time. 

The problem is that my partner still somehow has no money to save and is spending it on frivolous things like fast food, drinks on the way to work and etc etc. I had a serious chat with him about this because I’m struggling, parenting all day, working nights and then also trying to study somehow because we needed that extra money to save so I got a job when we moved in with my mum. I asked him where his money is going and how we still don’t have any to save. After a short discussion he basically said he needed a break and didn’t want to save for this house. 

I am heartbroken because I feel so disappointed that this dream I had and I thought he shared isn’t going to happen. My partner knows how I have felt about buying a home and providing stability for my future family for longer than we have even been together as we were friends beforehand. He always has said he wants that too and now all of a sudden it has changed and he seems to just want to spend everything he makes now. 

He suggested we go to couples therapy when I asked if he wanted this future with me or not and I’m on board for that but just not sure if that will change anything. If our different is such a fundamental thing… owning a home and having that stability… idk how to move past this. 

I feel betrayed in a way because I had this whole dream and goal and it has just been shattered in a night after I have been working so hard for this. Idk what to do or how to go ahead. 

Has anyone had this happen and things have resolved?  Has anyone had couples therapy help?

I met him a few months ago at an event. One of my first encounters with him is us giving each other a high-five, which turned into us intertwining fingers. I did not know him that well, so I was very surprised. 

I thought that was it, it was just something that happened and I did not think much about it. But NO, of course not. We started talking more towards the end of the event, which did not give me enough insight. He treated me very well, was super attentive and made sure I was okay. I had some issues with my shoes and I couldn’t walk without stopping and fixing them. He was the only one who noticed that and he basically held my hand until we didn’t have to walk. 

With that being said, I slowly started having feelings for him, of which I were unsure until recently, when I saw him again at another event. We ended up spending time with each other (mostly just the 2 of us) until the end of it and then we said goodbye with a long hug. We talked about a lot stuff, nothing too deep though.

I really like plants, just not roses (mostly because they’re difficult to press and they hurt). I had a rant about that. There were some flowers you could buy and then he looks at me and says that I didn’t like them. What’s that supposed to mean? Does that mean that he would’ve got me one under different circumstances?

A lot of emotions came up and we agreed to talk more in person. Today I met her, and we had a very calm and productive conversation that lasted roughly 4 hours. She expressed her concerns that we've become too codependent: that she has a lesser capacity to listen and process my issues than I have to hers. This is a big source of guilt for her because she considers care her love language. This has been exacerbated lately because she pulls away when she works through stress and it makes me worry and reach out for support. I've made the explicit effort to see a therapist to give me the tools to only reach out for support when I really need it, though I haven't perfected it. Her ""step back"" was prompted by a business trip I was on where I ended up being sort of lonely and worried, and leaned on her more support than she could offer. Also, she's much more aware of the issue of codependency because she recently moved to where she lives now and has a very small support network.

Our conversation ended in me saying I still want to be together, and her telling me that for that to work, it would have to look a lot like when we first started dating: that we'd have to take it slow for awhile, spend fewer days together, and be cautious so that we don't become harmfully codependent. She told me she wants to process our conversation and will let me know in a few days if she thinks it could work.

Does it seem like we could reorganise our relationship into a healthy one? What are some reasonable concerns I should have here?

I say innocuous because he never actually asked me out but says we’re together. He told me when he gets out of bootcamp we will officially ask me out when he has money when I told him t doesn’t take money to do that. I sent him a break up letter after almost 2 months of no contact when he was already contacting his mom through phone calls. About two weeks after the break up letter was sent, I had a drunken one night stand because I was at my lowest mentally and personally thought bootcamp man didn’t see me as a priority. (Thought I’d never want to be with him again) I regret it now because that made me realize that I do in fact love this bootcamp man even though we have some major issues that can be worked on. He called me for the FIRST time today, Calling me baby and “my girlfriend” even though he said he read and “understood” my break up letter. So did I cheat since he apparently still thinks we’re together? I clarified with him that we are friends and he said he wants me at his graduation and to stay with him that weekend. 

For background, I had been in a toxic relationship prior that lasted 8 years. I ended it and then bootcamp man found me on fb not even a few days later. Since the very beginning he’s made it clear that “we are made for each other, I feel like I’ve known you in a past life, I feel like our souls are intertwined since the beginning of time every time I look at your picture” where I would of course be doubtful because I was very newly single and just don’t believe in stuff like that. Fast forward a few weeks later, we hangout and become intimate and inseparable. It wasn’t until I had to move back home to a different state and he had to ship out to Chicago for bootcamp that we began to have fights. Those fights made us both realize that there is a lot of trauma that needs to be addressed. So I try to end it because I just want to be single in general since I haven’t since I was 16 but he doesn’t allow it. (Addressed in the letter) So me attempting to break up with him failed by me agreeing with him to stay together because at the time I didn’t know how to put into words why I wanted to be single (he instantly thought that I wanted to do what I want and not feel guilty then said that the outcome of us not talking much will be the same so it doesn’t make sense that we split) 

Break up letter: 

Dear (27m),
As you may know, I have been actively working on myself in terms of my mind body and soul. Before you arrived at bootcamp, I tried breaking up with you and told you how I felt in terms of needing to be alone in order to fully process everything I’ve been through and to work on myself and my traumas. You told me that is doesn’t make sense to take a step back in our relationship since our outcome of the next few months would be the same as we would not be talking as much. Although I hesitated at first, I ended up agreeing with you because I didn’t know how to accurately put how I felt into words at the time.  It has now been almost 2 months of trying your way and I still feel the same as I did that day I tried breaking up with you. I am still not at peace even though I am actively trying to work on every aspect of my being. I believe that in order for me to give myself (and in return, our relationship) the best chance, I need to take a step back to fully process everything and think clearly. I know that you are my person, my forever, so I will say this since I feel that you deserve know my thought process. SO MUCH has changed in SO LITTLE time. Since the end of January, I moved 2,000 miles away from my home town alone, ended a toxic and red end 8 year relationship, lost the one and only, most important person in my life (my grandma), lost my “friends,” threw myself out there and made new ones, started 2 new stressful jobs, and tried dealing with the fact that my mental illnesses were at a all time high and constantly suffered from anxiety attacks and depression. Then, as I’m trying to process this snowball effect of change, I meet you and we quickly go head first into a “relationship” (I say this with air quotes because you know I don’t believe that it isn’t official until you officially ask me out and we change fb statuses which you have not done yet “because you want to do it right” even though you had multiple chances to). I had never met a man that I truly see and want as a husband and father of my future children. I’ve never even thought of the idea of marriage until I’ve met you. You reach my expectations and then excel far past them. I am truly blessed to have met you and I hope I can be blessed to grow old with you. With that said, I really don’t want to fuck this up. I feel so bad that we’ve upset each other in past fights and I am away now and apologize on my behalf. You’ve said it before that I am trauma filled and need serious help. I agree and have been working on that and realize trauma isn’t an excuse. I really think me rushing into this with you is not going to set your relationship up for success. I am still coming to terms with my past relationship with max and I feel that jumping straight into one with you will only tarnish our future. I strongly believe that we need to take a step back and that I be single. I think of it as this, you can’t paint a beautiful painting full of color if your paint brush is strained with black. In other words, you can’t build a beautiful future if you’re stuck with the baggage of your past. I love you and I don’t think I will ever stop loving you. I just need to take a step back and want to take it slow because this is our forever and I want to do this right. I want to still talk and write you letters. Hopefully you understand where I am coming from and will like to date me in the future. For now, I just need my space as an individual to properly begin to heal. I know our outcome of these 3 months will be the same and I don’t want you thinking that you not reaching out to me at all yet is impacting my decision because it’s not. Not hearing from you at all yet when you’ve talked to your family already does hurt me but that doesn’t influence this decision of mine as I’ve felt this way since the beginning. Doing this, I think will help me feel at peace which in truth will set us up for success in the future. I hope that everything I said is clear. I want to be there for you, for your graduation, and to continue to talk but I’d understand if you wouldn’t want me to.. I love you, I will continue to work on myself for us, for me, and for you.

He's kind, gentle, handsome, plays the piano, shows genuine interest in what I like, has never pressured me to do anything I didn't want to, he gets along great with my family, he's never lied to me about anything, and we share many of the same hobbies. If I had to find a complaint about him it's that he's extremely anti social, he never had any friends growing up which means he has very few social skills and he has an irrational fear of being in public. Still he always does his best to overcome that and take me out to nice places when he can

None of that's the problem, the problem is that he's smart. I know it sounds like a really weird complaint but it's started getting to me recently. He's not the super good at math kind of smart, he's just very intelligent. He's always reading some new book about bizarre concepts that I can't begin to wrap my head around, he frequently uses words I've never heard before, and just the way he talks is really smart. He loves to write short stories and listening to him talk about the themes he wants to include or what he was inspired by and all that feels like his brain is moving a million times faster than mine. He's just a very intelligent man

Now I want to make it clear he has never purposefully made me feel dumb, he never calls me dumb or gets angry with me for not being able to keep up, he's extremely patient. But I can tell that he feels a little frustrated sometimes, sometimes he'll be talking about some idea he's had or thing he's been thinking about and I just can't keep up. I try to have a conversation with him about it but I just can't, when he realizes I'm not really able to participate in the conversation he stops and apologizes for going off on a tangent. 

When I went to meet his family I felt so out of place. The way they all talk and the things they talk about I just have no knowledge of. Seeing him talk to other people on his level makes me upset because he gets so excited and I can't really give that to him. Watching him have debates about things makes me a little jealous because I just can't form my ideas like that

Another thing I want to make clear is this is all my observations. He's extremely humble and doesn't consider himself very smart, I've never heard him brag about anything, not once.

Ok so I live in the state of Oklahoma which is a pretty farmer friendly state.

Anyone who pays the OMMA 100$ can legally grow cannabis plants in their own home for personal consumption.

I grow about 1 2 plants (4 autos, and 8 photos) both indoors and outdoors.

Needless to say my entire grandmas house smells like fresh marijuana, even though the tents have filters it still smells.

My grandma smokes too, and loves that I know how to grow. But anyways I will go on with my story.

Recently my mom came over and brought my little sister (f1 4, f1 6). I dont know my siblings very well since I dont live with my mom or dad, but they are staying until new years.

Anyways I just went about my day like normal, I rolled up a backwood and sat on the porch and started smoking it.

All of a sudden my little sister comes out and says, ""OH MY GOD YOU SMOKE CIGARS?"", I told her what it was, and told her that second hand smoke was bad for her so she should go inside.

She listened to me but all of a sudden my mom called me, and said that I smoke weed, my mom was furious that I smoked ""in front of them"". When thats not even what I did, they invaded my home where I already smoke daily, and told me I cant smoke anymore while their here.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7620606,public,self,My mom (f50) says I (m19) cant smoke weed anymore because my little sisters are visiting my house until thanksgiving,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2j1il/my_mom_f50_says_i_m19_cant_smoke_weed_anymore/,all_ads,6,,,

This is both of our first relationships. We met the first week of college and started dating like 3-4 weeks later which is really soon.

It was going really well at first. We had so much in common - we literally live 5 mins away from each other back home. We loved being around each other and I was so happy. 

We started doing physical stuff early on but haven’t gone all the way. We both agreed that we don’t want that unless we’ll be long term. 

Recently things haven’t been as great. He takes his stress out on me and frequently gets annoyed with me. He feels distant and I understand being busy but when we’re together he doesn’t want me to touch him and he doesn’t wanna sit next to me he’s just like “I’ll sit on the chair”. He gets super affectionate when he’s drunk and will only talk about me and ask for me and that’s the only time it feels like he really wants to be with me. He says he wants to avoid doing physical stuff to get to know me properly, but it feels like he doesn’t like me as much and doesn’t wanna be around me.

I brought this up recently and he agreed that I like him more than he likes me, but it’s because it takes him longer to adjust. Then he said im not the person he thought I was and he’s basically trying to figure out how he feels about that (he’s super productive and loves working out and im lazy and like to spend most of the day in my room, but I’m not gonna change for him and this is such a small difference imo). I brought up the drunk thing, and he said he’s just affectionate when drunk it doesn’t mean anything, and he’s not gonna kiss me and say I love you bc he doesn’t yet. I know he can feel however he wants, but honestly I thought I was in love with him. After all of this im not so sure.

We FaceTimed after this convo and he was upset that I didn’t have much to add to a convo about global issues bc I honestly don’t research them much so I just don’t have anything to say and I guess that’s changing his perception of me (negatively). Then we started having general conversation and it was fine but it felt more like I was talking to a friend than my boyfriend. 

I don’t know if this is just a phase or if it’s ending or what. I want a relationship where I feel accepted for who I am and not guilty for literally nothing. Idk why everything changed so suddenly. I know it’s early for anything related to love but I feel like he’s losing/lost feelings.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7620606,public,self,Does my boyfriend still wanna be with me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2j1de/does_my_boyfriend_still_wanna_be_with_me/,all_ads,6,,,

Sorry if it's a little long.

I (23F) broke up with my Ex bf (23M) after he told me he wanted me to abort our unborn child. 

We had been together for about 6 months and the first few were amazing. As things got more comfortable he slowly started belittling me and controlling me. He would get mad if I talked about our relationship to outside people suck as close coworkers or other friends. I was slowly pulled more and more away from friends and family. He has played a cruel joke on me and didn't think it was a big issue and just brushed it off after I came home and completely broke down. I stuck around because I loved him... there has been many fights where I have been brought to tears and he has belittled me and made me out to be the problem. He would raise his voice at me and I would shutdown completely and start yelling at him because that is the trauma response I had. I truly thought I have been the problem for months now that my depression has been at an all time high. It only got worse from there.

He has a court case coming up and is currently unemployed, so I have been supporting him for the past 3 ish months. I know it was stupid to literally spend all my savings on him... as things have been getting closer to his court case things got worse and worse. He thought he is going to jail (that is still up in the air). One of our fights in particular was how he thinks I will be like his ex's and cheat on him. He said that if he ever found me cheating he would beat me and kill me as well as the man I was with. I have never given any reason to think that I would. He has complete access to my phone and everything. 

I found out I was pregnant a few weeks ago. Things have gotten a lot worse since then. He continued to tell me that if I cheat he would kill me and the guy I'm with and that if we ever broke up and I am with someone else who raises his kid that he would beat me. I just kept brushing it off because I didn't think anything like that would happen because I truly loved him.

One of our last fights was about a friend (M23) that I have. He went through my texts and started a fight because I had been pulling away from him. I told him he was a platonic friend that I haven't actually seen in like a year and only talked to twice the whole time I was with my ex. He got made that I made a comment about where I was at on the 4th of July when my friend had messaged me what my plans were. He got so mad at me for telling my friend I was with him and his grandmother. I literally just said I was spending time in this town with them and that was it. The main issue was because my friend reached out to me and we were talking about my friend's last relationship (this is all over text). I know my friend and I knew he needed a little pep talk. My ex said that he didn't seem all that upset to me. I told him I know my friend and there is nothing to worry about. I rarely talk to my friend and we really only talk on our shares birthday.

 I finally yelled at him and said he didn't trust me and why he was with me if he thought so little of me. I said even though I have complete access to his phone I have never violated that trust with him. He said he wouldn't have cared, but I said that I didn't need to because I trusted him and that he didn't even trust me the way I trusted him. He ended up coming back over to my house (bad idea). I was home from work and was just trying to stay out of his way because he got made about his order being messed up. It put him in a foul mood and to a point where even after I had said I could go back he said no multiple times. He got so upset and irate that he said he didn't even want our child and that if we broke up he wanted me to get rid of it. He also said that because of this court case he didn't want the child at all. I ended up leaving and went up to my parents house (I live in a trailer on their property) and started telling them what happened after breaking down for a half hour or so. It got to a point where he said he had all his stuff packed up and ready to go. I said then just leave and as he was saying we were pretty much over I solidified it because he wanted me to be the bad guy. My family helped me and called him a Lyft because I didn't feel safe in the car with him and after everything came to light neither did my parents. He ended up walking 8 hours home. I blocked him on everything.

We have been on contact because he is the father of my child and I still have feelings for him. It has been a few weeks and he says he has changed. I have seen some change and he is taking responsibility for the destruction of our relationship and a lot of me. I have only seen him in person once and we were ok, but there has been this nagging in the back of my head. I got to a point where I told him Sunday that I didn't want to talk today. He blew up my phone. I blocked him again because he obviously doesn't respect my wishes. I haven't talked to him since... I just don't know what I should do.

he told me before that they never been into each other and she’s never tried to romantic in anyway and if she was he’d never consider to be roommates bc that would be too uncomfortable and i believe him. 
i’ve just been getting increasingly jealous and frustrated and it’s even hard to sleep when i think of them living together bc i wish it was me. i don’t think he’s cheating on me but i also don’t rly know what i consider cheating. this one time he told me he had a rly long conversation with her about his life and his relationship w me and how he was trying to balance it all, and although he told me that conversation rly helped see things clearly i couldn’t help but be jealous someone else was there for him and i couldn’t. also the other day he told me his roommates sister was going to stay with them for awhile while she looks for a job for some reason this made me rly upset bc it’s another girl that gets to share a space w my bf but i also don’t know if she’s single or not so it could not be a problem. i’m probably just rly insecure and paranoid but if you read this far could you please give me advice on how to deal with these feelings or a proper why to communicate them with my bf

I know the obvious answer is to leave or talk about it, but I feel it's more complicated than that. 

For starters, I am far away from any family and I have no nearby friends. I moved across a few states to be with this guy. We've been together for almost a year now. When I moved here, I didn't have any plans to move in with him so soon. But my housing situation changed and it was him or my car.

He also manages all of our money, to the point where my paychecks are deposited in his account. Which wasn't a problem, he let's me use the money as I see fit as long as I tell him about it. I'm not a big spender so nbd. 

I want out because I just don't feel like he likes me anymore. My birthday was in October and he didn't even wish me happy birthday until I told him he never said it. He knew it was my birthday because we were at a family get together to celebrate the October birthdays, and I told many people ""Today is actually my birthday :)"" right next to him. 

We have an agreement that I take care of the cooking, cleaning, and shopping and contribute what I can with my part time job. While he pays for utilities and rent and holds a full time job. But he always fussed at me for not having a full time job. 

He also never ever wants to have sex. Or cuddle. Or do anything I want to do. I feel lonely with him. 

I have tried many different approaches to talking to him about these issues, but I just feel like I'm talking in circles.

At some point we made it official and we have had a really good relationship ever since. We get along incredibly well and I am so lucky to be dating my best friend. 

The only issue we've really ever had has been our age gap. It hasn't been anything major, it's just come up occasionally and we've worked around it. It took both of us a long time to tell our families out of fear of judgement. We eventually decided that it was time, considering we've been dating for quite a while. Our families were both very kind and accepting. I met his two favorite people, his uncle and brother, and I've met many of his friends. I was invited to Thanksgiving this year and I will now be meeting his parents for the first time.

How do I make a good impression? I am a graduate student in data science and I have a good job for my age/environment. I did well in my undergraduate and I think I am overall an interesting and mature person. How do I show this? How do I display myself in a way in which the age gap or the fact I am fairly young is the last thing they think about? I am just so nervous. 

Also, what do I bring? I don't think his mom/dad are drinkers, so wine might not be the best option. I can bake well. Flowers? 

This means so much to me especially considering his dad has late stage cancer. Thank you so much for advice!

My first post on Reddit refered to this guy. Eventually we engaged into a relationship through work. We spoke over a year before we started dating. He lives in a very unhealthy household. No AC, many family members doing drugs within the house and oftentimes drunk, several cats with no medical treatment that go in and out of the house, neglected dog, etc. I attempted to urge him to try to get out of the house more and do some fun activities. He is very depressed and we both somewhat bonded over that since we could relate to one another in that way, so I encouraged him to try and enthuse hobbies, get into a healthy sleep schedule ( he usually woke up around 1-3pm and stayed up until 2-3am). He always agreed to them yet never acted. Never made plans unless I offered but always insinuated that he doesn't want to, yet then reassures me each time that it's his fault and I'm too good for him, otherwise we would never do anything. He barely does anything with anyone else either. He only had 2 friends outside of myself (19F and I believe the other was 27M; they were in a relationship that was abusive themselves) It pained me seeing him in this way, but as I was told, I can't help someone who doesn't help themselves.

At one point I turned to fellow coworkers and friends for advice after he was fired from our workplace. They said that he was emotionally manipulative/abusive based on essays of information I provided them. His friend I mentioned (19F) told him he should break up with me because I pressured him. I relayed this to friends/coworkers and they were flabbergasted, saying I was too patient and only wanted the best for him for tryint to help him get into a better headspace. When he told me this face to face while we were hanging out one night at his place, I cried because I was so confused and hurt. I didn't know what else to do and that I've exhausted all options. He then said ""I don't care what she thinks. You're more important."" My mother sent me a text in all caps when I told her this to get my things and come home (I slept over at his place often since he only came to my house twice in the span of several months). He said that ""we are both adults. She can't make you do anything"" and I decided to stay and go to sleep. My mother said she was breaking us up for me.

Eventually, the next morning, he had said he wasn't going to speak with his friend anymore and was very angry with her. I left and went to work. I ended up seeing him come in the store (he never came into the store after he was fired besides 3 times) and bought a few things without saying a word, left, then came back in without his bag and got something else. He doesn't have a license so I knew he left his bag in his friends car. There was no other explanation.

I was right as I asked him over text after my shift and he confirmed that was the case. I've gotten into so many convos over the months of our relationship of me bringing up some topics I wanted to try and sort out and he always snapped back with an excuse for everything, deflecting anything I had to say. He added that his friend thought I was weird because my SA story didn't make any sense, which I was appalled and said that was not at all his business to tell people and trusted him with that information. He didn't acknowledge it and continued deflecting everything. At the end of the text convo I blocked him and felt a relief that I haven't experienced in ages. I felt like shackles we're off of my ankles.

Afterwards, I discovered on his Reddit account he fetishized transgender males. Just yesterday he posted again on another post for one in specific. Before he told me that people thought he had a thing for trans people since he dated some in the past and denied it, which I thought was weird but laughed it off anyhow. Knowing this after the relationship made me have a sour taste in my mouth knowing he hid that from me. I think about it often now even though originally I was completely positive about our relationship ending and now it's like it's tormenting me. I feel uncomfortable in stores he visited because of the chance he may see me. He was unemployed for months after he was fired and I'm worried that I'll walk in somewhere nearby and he'll be there working because I have no clue if he has obtained another job. I'm generally on edge throughout my day now. I don't know how to get over this like I did originally after the breakup.

Is there anything I can do at this point? Why is my consciousness so fixated on him sometimes throughout the day? Why can't I get over this?

As the title says, my bf's mom is fully financially dependent on him, and it's causing me stress about the future of our relationship.

My boyfriend has never had his own bank account. Since he was a teenager his mom has always had control of his account. I'm not sure when she became dependent on him fully, but she is essentially behaving as if she were his wife, and it makes me really uncomfortable. She has full access of his money, she calls him the man of the house, and she does not work herself to earn her own money.

He doesn't see any problem with this, as its all he's ever known. He backs it up as a cultural difference between our families - but I personally don't see it that way. I feel like she's taking advantage of him and putting him in a weird position where he's subconsciously is putting her first before thinking of what he wants out of his own life.

She recently went back to work for one day, and then immediately quit saying ""son I'm getting too old for this."" I witnessed part of their conversation and it was just really uncomfortable for me. I'm uncomfortable with how comfortable she is depending on her adult son like that.

I myself work and make my own money, I would love to move forward in my relationship with my boyfriend but I worry about a potential marriage where his mother is dependent and has access to accounts. I love him, and besides this everything else is perfect.

Family members of mine say I am overreacting, that this means he's a good man. Which I don't disagree - I just don't feel comfortable with the dynamic and I'm uncomfortable voicing my opinions.

How can I approach a conversation about this that would be productive?

Please help, I'm incredibly stressed about this and desperately need insight and guidance.

Some background: Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year now, and have known each other for 3 years. We're pretty serious and have met each other's families as well. Both the mothers have met too. We have plans to get married in a few years. 

However, over this one year, we have had some ups and downs with regard to his family's interaction with me and my family. And he and I have had a few problems as well. And when the mothers met up, his mother was a bit too demanding and told me her expectation of me for the future. (Such as me taking care of his sister, keeping him and his sister in touch, me not sharing personal stuff with my bf and him not sharing personal stuff about his family with me). All this was very bothersome for my mom to hear. I mentioned this to my bf and he decided to get them to meet up again to clear the misunderstandings. His mother has a domineering personality and he is a bit of a sheltered child. However, he is not focusing on his career and will be moving to another country soon. 

Recently, I have had my trust broken by him as well (he did not tell me he once had feelings for a female friend of his who was still in his life and would meet up with him. He never made me meet her either. When I confronted him, he told me everything and then cut her off). He has apologized over and over for this as well. He was in a very toxic relationship previously and some of his issues from that rs have carried onto this one. That is why he did not tell me about this female friend since he thought it would lead to a huge fight (even though we do not fight, we just have respectful disagreements/arguments). 

However, my mom and sister keep telling me to not invest too much into this rs and that he is not reliable or too much of a mama's boy. I get that they are trying to protect me but they want me to start emotionally distancing myself and let the future decide what happens between us. I have to hear a lot of talk from them about him being immature and his family causing problems for me in the future, his mom being too dominating. Our culture is very family oriented so cutting off the families or their opinions is not really possible. 

Now that he will be moving to another country, they are also telling me that he might get into the whole party scene and that they don't trust him now with his female friends (this is due to what happened with his female friend where he broke my trust). They're telling me to not call him every day. We see each other once a week only (he lives almost an hour away). And that when he leaves, I should start making up my mind about him not being the one for me. 

However, he's an amazing bf in a lot of ways. He always apologizes and fixes his mistakes by changing his behavior. Never gets defensive or angry with me. Never points fingers. Always respects my boundaries. Is not controlling or toxic or abusive in any way. 

I'm super close to my mom and sister and I do share this stuff with them. They especially ask me about him and our relationship as well. That is why they know whatever problems occur. It's getting really difficult now hearing them say this stuff about him and constantly being told to back off.

TL;DR: Mom and sis want me to stop investing in my rs because they don't think it will work out. They don't trust his family and not him completely either.

One of the worst things ex did to me was isolate me from my friends, especially my best friend, because ex was a very jealous and insecure person. She hated my best friend, hated anyone who took my attention, and hated it if anyone liked me more than her. Because of this, my best friends memories of that time are also very stressful because she had to watch me struggle while ignoring all her advice and refusing to end the relationship. It’s been two years now since break up, and I now feel comfortable talking about some of the stuff that happened to me if it’s relevant to the conversation and I’m with a trusted friend/friends. This has happened a few times now while I’m hanging out with best friend. It’s not every time we hang out, or multiple times in the same conversation, but when it happens she looks really uncomfortable and changed the subject immediately. This is frustrating because she will bring up ex/things that happened while we were dating and talk about it as long as she feels comfortable before changing the subject. I get that my relationship was very hard for her personally, not just as an onlooker, because my ex was often extremely mean to her and would make up lies about her. Having her best friend go along with that behaviour for years would have been really awful for her. I’ve apologised to her but I can still understand her not wanting to hear about the abusive things my ex did to me which she was begging me to leave. I just don’t understand why it’s okay for her to talk about those experiences including the ones that make her angry at me, while I can’t mention things that I went through in case it upsets her. 

should I talk to her about this? I dont want to cause more stress between after how badly my terrible decisions messed up our friendship. At the same time I want to be able to talk to my friends about this stuff. Sometimes I’ll remember something she did, like deliberately disrupting my sleep and slapping herself in the face if I didn’t pay enough attention to her, and I’ll think “how did I think that was normal?” I start running through all the excuses I made for her in my head and it just helps to have other people hear about it and look at me like what I just said was completely nuts, and not okay.

Our texts were all really flirtatious and he even called me really cute and many other compliments and would stay up late to talk to me. For example, he would say things like ""I am staying up this late because I want to talk to you"" or other flirty texts. After some weeks of texting, I asked him about why he was following so many instagram models or tiktok girls. Usually, I would not mind this too much although it did make me uncomfortable, but in my last relationship, the guy ended up ghosting me so I had slight trust issues about similar things. 

I ASKED him, not forced him, to unfollow the girls. And he did-but only unfollowed around 20 out of probably hundreds of girls he follows. We also started discussing about long term relationship, and he said he would say yes, but he was still unsure. I had said the same. But then, I saw how he is still liking all of these instagram girl's pictures (bikini pictures, provocative pictures, etc.) and I was starting to get icks from it, so I finally communicated that I wasn't comfortable with him doing that. 

And this is the part where he told me that he is starting to lose interest after I told him about all these things and that because we weren't official yet, he didn't think it was necessary to stop doing all those things. He said he lost interest because he felt there was no trust between us. But I did trust him, I just wanted him to stop doing the things that I felt were very iffy and disrespectful to me.

I (20F) have been friends with a guy (20M) on and off for 2 years. I’ve also liked T on and off for two years. Also, it’s important to add that over the course of the 2 years I’ve known T, I was in an on and off relationship for 2 years. It was an abusive and toxic relationship, and I’m extremely glad that I am out of it. Also, I do not agree with liking another person while you have a boyfriend. I’m not that type of person. I was just in an extremely bad relationship. 

Anyways, I know that T has liked me or at least been attracted to me for a good amount of time. T asked me on a date like 2 years ago, but I denied because I had a thing with my ex (F) at the time. A few months later, we stopped talking for a while because T got a gf who didn’t want him to have female friends. A few months later, we reconnected. 

T used to always try to flirt w me (T didn’t know I was still with F because he didn’t like me publicizing us and we never rlly talked about relationships), but I would always distance myself and avoid those conversations because I had a boyfriend. 

Over the summer F and I broke up for a week, and I decided to go hangout with T and we got a bit touchy. T knew I had broken up with F and was very sweet to me and understanding. 

F and I wound up getting back together, and F got mad about what I did (all I did was kiss T and cuddle with T) even thought F had sex with another girl. F made me block T, but refused to block the girl. 

F and I broke up over a month ago. A few weeks ago I was like okay I feel like I should just unblock T, so I did. I didn’t reach out to T or anything. The day after, T added me on SnapChat and asked me what happened. I told T what happened, and T said how he missed having me around. 

Since then T and I have hung out 3 times since we started talking again. However, we both have a very hard time not being touchy with one another. We have a habit of hanging out at like 2 am and having very in-depth convos about life. T will hug me a lot, play w my hair, fix my necklace, and give me compliments that you wouldn’t likely tell a friend (like how soft my skin is or how incredible my body looks). T always talks about how great of a friend I am and how happy he is to have me in his life because he can trust me and easily talk to me. 

T was confusing me so much that I called him out on it, and he denied liking me and said we are just friends. I brought the convo up again after we cuddled together one night. T admitted he’s attracted to me, and I told him that I like him. T said he is not ready for a relationship (he was cheated on several months ago and clearly it has been hard on him), and I’m likely not ready for one either because I just recently got out of my relationship. It’s hard though because I feel like there is something there between us. We talk all the time. We tried to set a boundary between one another of just acting like friends, and then the next time he came over we hugged like 10 times. 

I can tell we both feel some sort of way about each other and that something is there, but idk maybe I’m wrong. It’s hard because I know neither of us could probably do a relationship, and at least for me, it’s so hard to just be friends with him.

i just honestly don’t care.everytime i get into a “relationship” my mind goes immediately with who am i going to cheat with.talking and Hitting on single or taken girls is a pretty normal thing for me and getting them into my bed is one of the biggest thrills especially sleeping with someone else’s girlfriend.it just gives me a new type of feeling knowing that she has a man waiting for her at home or talking on the phone while i’m plowing here or my girlfriend calling me while i’m doing someone else.

When I asked her about it she denied it, then I brought up the fact that all the apps on my phone were still open in the background then she finally confessed. I recently found out also that she had told her friend that she had been staying with me when she hadn't and when I asked her about that also she said that she was staying with her friend (a girl) from work. when I asked her friend about it she stated that she hasn't been staying with her also. when I asked her a second time she told me that she was just at home the whole time. I asked her if there was something that I was doing in the relationship that made her feel uncomfortable about not telling me the truth and she told me that it wasn't me and I was doing everything perfectly. she has a tendency to tell a lot of white lies that don't matter as much but it still rubs me the wrong way sometimes.

Hey guys, so I see my girlfriend twice a week, she lives a 2 hour bus ride away from me. I wake up at 9 AM, take the first bus at 10 AM which is an hour long, and then at 11 AM I take the second bus which drops me at her place by 12 pm. Once I get to her house I call her and tell her I’m at the door and she opens it, this is what we ALWAYS do. Today, when I got to the second stop to take the 11 AM bus to her house it did not come, and the next bus was over an hour and a half later (12:40 PM) at a bus stop 20 minutes away from me. I wait an hour and then walk 20 minutes to the bus stop, take the bus and finally get to her house around 1:20 PM. While I was on the bus she also asked me what time I’m getting to her house and I told her 1:20, she also mentioned that she wouldnt have a lot of energy today and would be quiet since she felt a bit sick and hadn’t slept well and I told her thats no problem. 

Once I get to her house, as usual I call her. She doesn’t pick up. You may be wondering why I didn’t knock, I did not knock because she lives with roommates and I didn’t want to disturb anyone because they sleep in really late. (They also dont have a doorbell). By the way I live in Canada so its freezing outside. 20 minutes later she finally picks up my call, and I just say “can you open the door? i’ve been outside for 20 minutes” I was not angry, but I was sounded unhappy. She responds saying “bro I left my phone upstairs, I was downstairs doing some stuff why did u not knock” and she sounded annoyed, which honestly was strange to me, but I was like ok its fine just open the door. Once I went inside her house, we went to her room and I ask her annoyed but calmly “why would you leave your phone upstairs when you know I’m coming and I always call you when I’m at the door?” She gets mad and starts saying stuff like “ok bro I thought I’d hear you open the fence gate my bad like you’re acting like this happens all the time, do you want me to go back in time and change it? What do you want from me?” I told her that she’s being disrespectful and I will leave if she continues to talk to me like that and she says “yeah leave” and tells me that I’m being dramatic and I need to get over it. I felt myself getting angry and felt hurt and disrespected so I decided to leave.

I understood that it was a mistake and I understood that she had her own thought process, and this is not a reoccurring thing, mistakes happen and that’s fine.

I am currently in school and we have made plans about moving in together in the future. A few months before we got together, I had come to terms with the fact I am bi-curious (long journey, I was raised Mormon and had a deconstructing of faith). I decided that I liked my significant other more than my desire to explore that aspect. He said it would make him uncomfortable for me to explore that. (All this occurred during the talking stage and early months of the relationship). We agreed we were exclusive and have been monogamous since then. 

We have a very active sex life and I recently got COVID for 2 weeks and couldn’t see one another. He has had a very active sexual history that i was very comfortable with (we would talk about his past and I loved hearing about his experiences because I was raised Mormon and had not had the opportunity to explore sexually before our relationship). Before I got sick, we had been drinking one night and he had admitted that he had started talking to a girl before ending the relationship with someone he had been seeing exclusively. I was a bit confused because he said he had never cheated and that some of his previous partners had cheated on him. Over the past few weeks it had felt unsettling to me. Tonight when we were hanging out, he was being weird with his phone. He fell asleep while we watched a movie and I had the feeling to look at his phone. 

On his phone I found Grindr and several messages about potentially meeting up with people and how he was into sex with men, claiming he was a verse. I am so confused on what to do. We have had multiple conversations about monogamy and sexuality. I speak up when he makes homophobic comments and talk about how sexuality is fluid. We’ve even tried bottom stuff before and he said he didn’t like it. I am not sure how to approach the situation. I feel bad that I need to have a conversation which him and I don’t want him to feel outed. At the same time, I believed we were in an exclusive relationship and feel like my trust was breached. How can I approach this situation with love and understanding? I understand personally how hard it is to question your sexuality and how excepting it can destroy your perception and path of life. I’m not opposed to trying an open relationship where we both can explore sexually. I enjoy spending time together, I just think that sexually he isn’t satisfied.  But I’m also not sure how long he’s been entertaining over partners or if he wants that openness.

We met online so all our interactions are via text or video call, and we’ve met in person once.   
Everything was good, or so I thought, until I started going through a very difficult time. Although she wanted to be there for me, I told her what I really needed was some alone time. She said she understood, but a few days later she said something like, I’m not blaming you but I got really depressed because we haven’t talked in so long… she never bothered to take into account what I was going through at the time. 

A couple months passed and I started feeling like she was demanding more and more time from me. As an introvert, I hate texting people every single day, no matter how much I love them, but I made an effort for her, we texted several times a day almost daily, even if it was way outside my comfort zone. She was texting me several times a day from 3 different platforms, which was really overwhelming for me, it started draining me to the point that I didn’t want to text or talk to anyone anymore. 

I realised this would end badly if I didn’t start setting some boundaries, so I started with asking her, again, to stop asking how I’m doing or how my day is going every single day, but instead of just accepting it and moving on she went on a rant about how important it is to ask those things and how she wants to know every single detail of my life. It was very overwhelming having to explain over and over again why I’m not comfortable with that at all.

I just have a feeling that she’s not really interested in what I have to say, I’m not sure how to explain it, it feels like she just asks me a few random questions so she can change the subject back to her. She never asks about the things I care about the most.   
Lately I just don’t have the energy to talk to her and I can’t shake this uncomfortable feeling off, so I’ve been ignoring her texts for about a week (I just came back from a trip) and she seems to have taken offence about it since she’s posting indirect stories about how she’s making all the effort and I’m not.

As a context, he left our current location to his home country because of work and never came back here and broke up with me over the phone. 
Now, he’s been back in the same country as me since October and just found a place where to live. During the first weeks of the break up he agreed to let me keep all the furniture but to give him half the money when I decide to move out (bear in mind that it is all IKEA: bed, marrasses, couch, dinning table, chairs, tv stand —&gt; literally all we have!). Which I thought was a good deal. He also sent me money (which I wasn’t even aware) to book a flight ticket for my mother to come and stay with me until I feel better.

After 6 months, we finally saw each other and he was flattering himself by saying what a nice person he was after the breakup for paying for my mums flight and keeping paying rent (we signed up the contract together for a year!!!). All his personal stuff were kept in the flat during all this time. 

Anyway, now that he has found a place, he keeps contacting me to get stuff from my flat. He wants to take my tv and kitchen stuff (which he can take, I don’t care), but the tv no. 
He didn’t try to have a conversation along the lines of « hey, let’s find a fair solution for the furniture and electronics so that it is fair for both of us », instead he was just saying « I’m taking the tv and the kitchen stuff » without even consulting me. 

During our message exchange, he kept insulting me, saying that I was trying to steal from me (during our relationship everything was 50-50 because I would refuse to have someone telling me that I am thief, and there we are today…), that I was acting like an a…h… and that I was a grade a pr… . I did not insult him at all but was very cold over text because last time I saw him he said that we are only in touch because we needed to sort this out.
I packed what he wanted (appart from the tv) and left it at reception. I didn’t want to see him and then having to go through an emotional roller coaster again after everytime I see him. He just thinks that I am power playing which is not the case. 

In October he stayed in my flat for a week while I was away. I offered him to stay so that he doesn’t spend his money in a hotel as he just arrived here and never asked for anything in exchange because it was my pleasure helping him. He also had my car that he could use.

What would you guys do? Would you just give that tv away? Would you give him the money for the furniture now? Please note that I earn about 3000gbp and he’s on 7500gbp. Am I being a brat by not giving him the tv (~300gbp)?

When I was 18 I was dating a chick who was 19. I brought her home to meet the folks and she was dating my brother by the end of the week. She didn't even bother calling me to break up, just stopped talking to me. They are now happily married with 2 kids. 

About 21 I was dating a college chick who was also 21. I took her with me to meet my dealer and we were smoking with him and a few other people. He started flirting with her and she would just giggle. Half way through the night All of a sudden she just got up and started cleaning because she said she couldn't handle the mess. He handed me 3 blunts and told me he was keeping her. Last I saw her that day she was in his closet organizing. Yeah, they got married 6 months later, he owns a tire shop now and is pregnant with their 3rd. He acts like she hung the moon. 

Took another chick to a family reunion, she met my cousin, they are married now. 

Another is married to one of my closest friends. 

I seem to be really good at finding other people's future spouses and bringing them to them. 

I am currently dating someone I really like and she keeps asking why I haven't brought her around anyone. This is why. I really like her and I'm scared I will just bring her to her future if I let her meet anyone but I know that sounds insane so I haven't really told her why.

My wife gets bothered when I try to step in and try to tell him anything. I want to get him in trouble but my wife doesn't believe in that, I guess. 

He was doing coke, tagging, criminal activities so the wife took away his phone for a week. We had him admitted into a medical facility because he was saying he was suicidal when he was caught. 

After, he was out he went back to the same. No coke, just weed everyday, I would find the weed but my wife didn't do much about it. I also told her that he was still active in the gang and that I saw him throwing gang signs in front of the mirror. She did not believe me and became upset at me.

He recently was caught doing an armed robbery, so my wife sent him up north to get help. It was a Christian center where he was supposed to get help there. He was supposed to be there for a couple months. I was hopeful that maybe he would see the light and this is what he needs.

Wife feels sorry for him and wants to take him out after one week. I became upset, and we had a big fight. She is asking for a divorce, I am fine if that's what she really wants.

I have been thinking about the little ones before she asked for a divorce. I don't know how safe they are around him. We have 5,6, and a 3 month old. 

He's been taking pics with guns, he says that armed robbery was done with a fake gun, but does it even matter? There's drugs always in his room. In a shoe box, under his bed, in his shirt, reachable places.

I am thinking about taking them from my wife to keep the safe. Do I have a shot here? I have pics and videos of him doing all that stuff.

He starts sitting up in the middle of nowhere and actually went to the other side of the bed. I hear him texting and laughing quietly on his phone nonstop for about 20 minutes.. around this time I’m getting super mad because wellllll now I can’t sleep and I’m like who is he texting lol. So I get up and I’m like what is that noise… who is that? And he says “a friend” and I look at the name and I have seen this girl before.

Some backstory, me and my boyfriend own a Photobooth business together, and we are both in tons of Facebook Groups. We both like to post &amp; ask for advice on there time to time and listen to other peoples experiences. 

I recently saw on a Facebook post where they were kinda commenting back and forth with each other and they were saying how they were both the same age, and she was like “I will send you a friend request!” And ever since then they have been friends and from time to time they will chat in the Facebook comment section.

So I see that it is same girl is the one he is texting back and forth with. I’m like kinda getting angry &amp; jealous and we start to argue. I ask him what they were talking about and and he says “it’s about business.” And I am like “we are in this together, why can’t you just talk to me about it?why do you have to go text another girl?” &amp; he angrily says “I’m talking to her because it’s something you wouldn’t understand”. I instantly got hurt because I feel like I am always supposed to be the woman that is there for you, to listen, no matter if I understand or not. It’s like… I would never rant to another man about something he wouldn’t understand. And it’s so crazy because if I was up late at night texting another man nonstop &amp; laughing (even about business), he would be mad.

 He shows me some of their messages and I see they are sending emojis back and forth, and he had texted her first. He had texted her saying “Is it just me or do I hate calling people on the phone?”… &amp; honestly, he does do the talking on the phone but for every phone call I am right there next to him for support. 

He keeps saying I am jealous and “I just feel like there is some type of competition” &amp; that is why I am so mad. I will admit, I do feel jealous! But it’s just the fact that he is texting her nonstop at midnight &amp; he doesn’t even see where I am coming from. 

Out of respect, I would never do that to him. I would never text a man nonstop about something I could simply talk to him about. Maybe I would ask a quick question, get the answer &amp; get out of there, but I would never text him constantly in the middle of the night. Because that is what my man is for. 
I may not understand talking to customers on the phone but I am always right there next to him, helping him, I mean what exactly is there for me to not understand? 

I will admit, I am jealous. Guys, would you feel weird if your girlfriend was up in the middle of the night texting a man nonstop, about something that she wouldn’t wanna talk to you about because  “you wouldn’t understand” ?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7620403,public,self,Me and my boyfriend got into an argument…,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2i876/me_and_my_boyfriend_got_into_an_argument/,all_ads,6,,,

Later, i had found out that they started talking again (as friends) and then had found out from someone else that he considers her his “main” and me “a side” (lol we are GROWN BTW) (literally 21). even though we both agreed before there were no strings attached, i still felt really,,, dare i say,,, used?? but i’ve been fighting this feeling with myself since AUGUST because i never told him that i knew everything. it’s been 4 months and nothing between them two happened, and me and him only grew apart. a part of me still gets a heartache everytime i see him because he was someone i trusted and our friendship meant a lot to me. i know he cared about me too because he always used to run up and ask me what was wrong everytime we ever argued, and he was always quick to apologize. but when we got into that lil argument i didn’t apologize for 2 weeks. anyway we’re good now, but it’s not the same at all. i still miss him and sometimes i think i am a little obsessive because he wasn’t anyone special, he only was a friend. recently we have been talking a little and basically, what i want to ask is, is it degrading (for me)if i were to hook up with him again after everything that has happened? i still sense the tension between us but i don’t want to make a fool out of myself.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7620401,public,self,would it be degrading if i hook up with him after i said i wouldn’t?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2i80e/would_it_be_degrading_if_i_hook_up_with_him_after/,all_ads,6,,,
