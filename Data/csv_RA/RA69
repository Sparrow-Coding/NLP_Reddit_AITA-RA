I'm totally positive to say l was very much depressed after that happened so much so , I was living life on autopilot. Around 6 months after her death,a guy took interest in me and it was first exciting/new thing that had happened in my life after my mum's death.  Few things I would like to add for context is that I was still deeply grieving my mum when he made his move and I think that allowed me to shift my mental focus. When I say he took interest in me I mean it more as in sexual way than romantic.He was most popular guy in school and I was school's outcast. So I guess it just felt good that he would take interest in me in sexual way. Describing him more , he is what I would call wannabe Christian Grey from 50 shades of grey movie. 
 Back then from what I would remember he would coerce me into doing stuff which I wasn't comfortable with and most of the time my needs wouldn't be met . I would let him push me around simply because i liked his attention. Yes , today I do realise that the guy has fucked me up in more ways than I can count. 
We were on and off fwb for next three years with same dynamic. Inbetween this I have confided in him regarding my family problems and he was good listener to me or so I atleast feel.  
 After 3 years we were done with highschool and I finally thought I could move on from him. We weren't in contact for next year or so in which I realised that I'm no longer sexually attracted to him and I came to terms with how shitty he treated me.  However we saw   each other while I was walking down the street ( we live in same town ) and we were back to being Fwb only this time I had some boundaries and I wasn't letting him push me around anymore. But it still wasn't healthy situation either. We weren't friends. I would have to beg him to treat me like a human being. And on other hand I couldn't understand why I wanted to have sexual relationship with him even though I know i don't find him attractive anymore nor do i have crush on him . 
 Eventually COVID happened and we did not see each other for 2 years after that we bumped into eachother once more and made out once. This time I was sure I did it only because i wanted sexual action with him even though I don't find him that attractive.  But later he had to leave for college and then he got girlfriend. It's just recently he has contacted me again , and what i did realise is that him contacting me gives me anxiety. And honestly I'm done with his behaviour at this point. He is still wannabe Christian Grey with no regard to me. I honestly want to close this chapter but what bothers me is from last 8 years or so he has been in my head. I can't seem to move on from him . Part of me thinks i have trauma bonded to him and another one thinks he has just became so familiar to me. 
 I genuinely don't like the power he has over me. Or how he treats me. I can no more let myself be with someone who has no regard for me.

So, the following lunch we express mutual interest in dating and decide to take it to the next level. Two days later, I'm texting her about when she is free so I can plan for a date and she replies let's just remain as friends. 

Now, on one hand I do like her. She's great company, we have great chemistry and it's nice to have made a new friend especially since we are both new transfer students here. 

On the other, I was at that point intent on dating her since we both shared having feelings for each other. I would be dishonest in agreeing to just stay as friends because it would be difficult for me to suddenly backpedal and return to our friendship without any romantic feelings. 

So, what do I do here? Would you in my shoes stay as friends or do you believe it would be best if we parted ways? I do respect her choice by the way, I'm not entitled to dating her but her change was sudden and she plans to explain why on our next lunch soon.

I’m dating this guy and it’s been about a month now. I genuinely like him and I can tell he likes me too… I mean when we are together in person it’s crazy magic. And the first couple weeks he was texting me about how insane he felt and how he’s so happy to had met me (we met on bumble)

fast forward to this week… he’s texting and talking to me differently. He still messages me everyday and checks in but he’s distant. I even asked him what was going on and if I said/did something and his response was:

“Everything is okay! I guess I’m in a little hesitation stage where I’m starting to feel like something is going too well and I’m being apprehensive. But nothing you said or have done has made me feel like that. I don’t know why I guess I too can be cautious. But seriously everything is okay! You have done nothing wrong at all!”

Alright… that’s fair but why act distant suddenly? I get we are getting to know each other but he was acting completely different the first two weeks compared to now. He’s just texting less… not saying sweet things or being excited about us meeting up compared to before. It’s just a l weird “switch”

We used to be great together, but this year (2022) he has broken up with me 3 times because he misses his ex wife. They’ve been divorced for 5 years and yet her contact in his phone is still his nickname for her and a cuddly picture of the two of them. He still talks to and sees her regularly, even though I have expressed how uncomfortable and disrespected it makes me feel.

In our last argument about this, he basically told me he’d rather lose this relationship with me than lose his friendship with her. Apparently asking him to focus more on his future with me, if he really is serious about me, was just me asking for “too much attention”.

After this, I deleted his contact from my phone. When he texts me now it’s just an unnamed number. I’ve been doing less for him, telling him “I love you” less, or at least with less enthusiasm. I’ve been thinking about getting my own place and trying to move on. 

I just feel like he has such a hold on me. I love him, but he makes me feel like I don’t matter. Like no matter what I do it’s never going to be good enough to make him think I’m worth marrying one day. 
He tells me he loves me and he wants to buy a house next year, and he wants to stay together but he is unwilling to let go of his ex wife to do that. I asked him if he ever wanted to marry me, if he actually saw us being together 5 years down the road and he literally stood silent and refused to answer.

I know I need to move on. That’s not the question. But my financial situation right now prevents me from just walking out and leaving, so what do I do in the meantime to detach myself but not be an immature bitch to him? Not ask for too much attention? I just want to be loved the way I love him, is that a lot to ask someone?

She is in residency and her reason for no longer working out has been ""I don't have time.""

I have done my best to aid her, and find ways to convince her to exercise.

   * I have a gym membership that allows me to bring guests with me. We went together for about a month then she stopped going. She said she prefers ""working out from home.""

      * I bought her a peloton for her birthday, and after about 1 month she stopped using it. This was back in February
   * **Her coworker gave her a bike for free**
      * Her coworker got her a bike back in the summer, and she has used all for 3 days after her car broke down
      * Before her car broke down, and I was using my car to ride into work, she was using Lyft and Uber everyday. We live 1.5 mile away from work

   * **She never cooks** 
      * If I don't cook, she does takeout or she snacks all day. If I don't pack a lunch for her, she will eat chick-fil-a or do Panera.

She doesn't try to take care of herself.

I have heard the **residency is hard** story before. She tells me this **all the time.** The problem I have is, she is no longer trying. Before we made our relationship official, I thought of her as the most gorgeous woman I have ever dated. A doctor, a dancer, and someone who is healthy checks off the necessary boxes for me.

**Please do not suggest seeing a counselor -** as a part of our relationship, we have been seeing a couples counselor since 2020. She has no interest in seeing a counselor herself, she mentioned this to me on several different occasions.

Me (26f) and my bf (27m) have been together about a year. 

A few days ago we got into a massive fight after a night of drinking. Worst part is that I barely remember any of it. I only know because my bf told me the next day. I rarely drink, and when I do I’m usually a lot of fun. We were both drinking that night but I was drinking more and had some weed as well - I think that’s what pushed me over the edge.

The fight was about absolutely nothing other than drunken stubbornness. He told me I pushed him at one point, and was swearing. This is totally unlike me. I would have never thought I would ever be physically aggressive towards him. And I have vowed to never drink in excess ever again, because I hate that I behaved this way. I apologized to him and he accepted it, he said he knows I’m not that kind of person and that he has done stupid shit he cant explain while being blackout drunk. 

Now, the next morning I noticed I was feeling sore “down there”, so I asked him if we we had sex. He said we did. He said he was trying to go to bed, when I walked into the room after our argument and announced I was in the mood and started taking his clothes off. I’m so afraid that I pressured him to have sex with me. He never mentioned it was part of the issue that night, when he initially told me what happened, he only said something after I felt we must of had sex because I don’t remember.

I feel fucking awful. We agreed to move on from this as I have learned my lesson, but I wonder if I should bring it up again and ask if he felt pressured.

Any I'm 27f and my ex is now 31m. Anyway me and him met in 2017, for me it was love at first sight, I thought he was way too attractive to be interested in me, so I thought it would be a one night stand, but turned into a relationship, which lasted 3 and a half years. So I had suspicions of him cheating, never had evidence, and he always had reasonable explanations. I wish I trusted my gut as the first time was 4 months in. Long story short, a girl messaged me dms between them, and turns out they kissed on his birthday night out, he didn't seem the kind to cheat, he always told me he loved me, I was his queen, his future wife. So I tried to forgive him as I thought it was a one off kiss, but we broke up. And I found out he had been cheating the whole time, icing on the cake he gave me herpes type 1 genitally, orally and anally. It took me over a year to get over him. I'm now engaged to someone and I do love him, but I seen on Facebook my ex is engaged to the girl he got with not long after me, and he's very public about their relationship on there, so maybe people can change, but the thing is why did I deserve to be treated so badly ( he also became abusive as he had alcohol and coke problem) I just hate how he ruined me, as I love my fiancé but I don't feel I could love someone as much as my ex, he was the love of my life basically. I still haven't thrown out things he gave me, and I used to keep my train tickets, cinema, boarding passes etc for the memories. I don't want to get back together with him. Just why is he living the good life, only good thing in my life is my dog and my fiancé. I have bad health and suffer chronic pain, and seeing my ex writing on Facebook that his fiancée ""deserves nothing but the best"" whereas I got called an ugly c*nt, was told I was boring, and that his family didn't like me either. Once I became disabled he completely lost interest in me. I wish his ex had told me about him as he's done this with every other woman before me. I was going to warn her, but my friend network said it was none of my business. I have noone I can really talk to about this, I'm happy to be engaged and have someone caring, but again it's not unconditional love he's already told me he'll leave me if I get fat. I'm not upset in a want him back way, more why was I treated like crap, gave me a permanent std and serious trust issues.

I (18F) recently met a guy (19M) at a party. We seemed to have a good conversation during it but I didn't feel myself being romantically attracted to him.
 
A week ago he asked me to go on a date with him to which I said yes. It was never explicitly called a date; he just invited me to get food with him. I had a good time but I was treating it more as a friendly outing and the guy didn't try to make any advances on me like holding hands and stuff.
 
It is important to mention that he did pay for the food. I had a back and forth with him before the bill came out and insisted I pay for myself. He shrugged me off and said something along the lines of I worked for all of last year. I can afford this. The waiter gave the bill directly to him and I didn't have a chance to even ask to split the bill. After we left I asked him for his bank details to pay him back but he kept refusing (asked 3 times) so I eventually stopped trying.
 
My 2 best friends then asked me how it went and I told them it was quite nice. However I told them that I did treat it as a friendly outing as I am not interested in him in that way.
 
Friend 1 said that I don't have to tell him because 1 'date' isn't really a relationship.
 
Friend 2 said that I should tell him and has been pestering me basically every day to tell him.
 
I feel like I should say something but I would rather do it in person rather than over text. However I would mostly just want to avoid any potential confrontation and hope he gets the message that I want to remain friends.
 
I have not made any romantic advances or said anything romantic to him. The one time he tried to kiss me at a party when slightly drunk I pushed him away. I feel like that should be enough of a sign especially bearing in mind that we only met up once.
 
Also this might be important, with my ex I had a very difficult breakup where I had to tell him this. We were literally best friends before I had this conversation with him and he never spoke to me again. I'm scared that the same thing will happen again.

If he asks me out on another date I will definitely tell him no and express my feelings but friend 2 is insistent that I tell him asap so as not to lead him on (I don't think I am doing this).",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7548922,public,self,Should I tell him that I'm not interested in him Romantically,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvbn3o/should_i_tell_him_that_im_not_interested_in_him/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

About 2 years ago I(25 M) joined an online gaming group and made some pretty good friends. Through this group I ended up meeting her (26MtF).

After that we started to talk more often and I started to slowly started to get feelings for her. 

At the start I wasn't sure what to make of my feelings as I've only talked to her and the rest of my friends over voice chat. But one day another one of our friends decided that we would all goje on face cam for the session and then when I saw her she was really the only person I was able to look at and my feelings really started to grow. And over then next little bit when she was describing her style or showing me what her hair looked like she sent ne a few selfies and I definitely thought she was super cute and pretty. 

Now I'm at a point where I have a massive crush on her and want to confess my feelings to her, but my dilemma comes from I am pretty dense when it comes to picking up on the feelings of other, I typically won't notice unless someone else tells me what their feeling or it's very obvious.

This issue with my (37f) boyfriend (37m) began when I noticed that if I brought to his attention something he did it said that hurt me or bothered me, he became annoyed and angry and would explain to me not only that I was wrong but then provide me with a list of things I had been doing that irritated him but never said anything about in order to invalidate my hurt feelings and validate his response. I know it isn't right to say that someone ""always"" or ""never"" but I am not exaggerating when I say that there has never been an instance where I confronted him about hurtful behavior and this was not the outcome. I think the reason it wasn't a much bigger issue until now is that it happened infrequently. 
Anyway, the other issue in our relationship revolves around my being ADHD and the ways those things manifest in our relationship. My boyfriend is very clean. Just yesterday he said the amount of cleaning he currently does (which I find overwhelming and excessive) is nothing, that he normally deep cleans his bathroom twice a week but doesn't have time currently. He calls me ""messy"" and when he recently moved into his new house, spent the first month pointing out all the ways I wasn't clean enough. He wants his bed made every morning, I've never been a bed maker but I do make his if I'm last out of bed. He called me into the bathroom and pointed to the toilet saying ""you think that looks ok?"" Regarding one of my hairs that had somehow landed on the back of the toilet (the actual toilet bowl  in the little space between the toilet seat and the tank, where you might notice it if you stood up to pee). We were watching a movie and I grabbed a bag of these pretzel thin things and some hummus, he said ""get a bowl to eat over so there are no crumbs"" as if 1. I don't understand how eating and crumbs work and 2. crumbs couldn't simply be swept up should there be any. He has two bedrooms on his main floor, one is his bedroom the other one is his luxury closet. When I am there, my things are in a giant bag (he recently gave me two small drawers meant for socks abd undies), I do my makeup in the bathroom and return my toiletries to my bag etc. Sometimes instead of putting clothing back in the bag, Iay it on top so as not to further wrinkle it. He considers this to be clutter and is always asking ""what's going on with this shirt is it dirty or why is it just laying out on top of the bag?"". I hate socks, have never worn them due to sensory issues so I am barefoot in the house. when I come inside, I remove my shoes and walk around barefoot. Sometimes, I've noticed that after walking around on his floors,my feet are a bit dirty, he says ""omg go wash your feet, no wonder my floors are always dirty"" as if MY feet are just inherently dirty and causing his floors to be dirty. Meanwhile, he has a really gross dog (HUGE 120lb American bulldog) who is confined to a back room in his house but sheds excessively, shakes his head launching drool literally into other rooms of the house, constantly stinks etEverytime I sweep the floors and clean them, the mop head is covered in dog hair. Lastly he will make comments like ""hey I wouldn't be mad if you did the dishes once in a while"" mainly while doing a sink full of dishes he created because if I've used dishes, I do whatever dishes are in the sink. If I haven't used a dish, I don't think to go check the sink for dirty dishes. 
I do my best to maintain his standards and I think I do fairly well but when I say that to him, he says ""the reason you feel that way is because I've just stopped saying anything when you leave a mess"". It feels condescending and belittling to have this looming over me constantly and as a result, I've become defensive. Even getting to the point where I've explained that it can be difficult for those with ADHD to be as organized as neurotypicals and that forgetfulness is also a symptom that may be playing a role. This just irritates him further saying "" I feel like all the things you claim are ADHD, I have too. Like, I forget things. I don't like having to do the extra work of being organized but I don't let that stop me from actually being organized"". He has gone as far as to say he thinks ADHD is just a trendy excuse for laziness abd that those who take medicine for it are just drug seekers looking for legal speed. 
As I mentioned earlier, I am also on the spectrum. I chose not to tell my boyfriend this after I saw the way he reacted about ADHD because I knew I would not be able to deal with comments about the validity of my diagnosis and of autism itself. Last night, we were watching love on the spectrum and after watching a segment about Kaelynn, he said ""she seems so normal, it makes me wonder if I could date someone like that"" at which point I kind of lost it internally. I stated that he couldn't even handle my ADHD related quirks.. to which he replied by getting up on his high horse abd shaming me for comparing my ""disorder"" to something as real and serious as autism. I told him I was done with being invalidated by him, got my purse and keys abd went to my car to leave. At that time I chose to send him a screenshot of my ASD diagnosis from the online portal at my drs office. He called me immediately and begged me to come inside. He was crying and apologized for making me feel like I couldn't tell him about it and for not taking ADHD seriously. I said, that's ok, my concern though Is that you don't seem to recognize the ways you invalidate my feelings on a regular basis outside of this. He swore he did. Then proceeded to tell me ""my issue is that you do the same thing. When do I get to have my reality respected? I like a clean house and when I point out the things you leave around you get upset and use your ""sickness"" as an excuse for why you forgot you left hair all over the bathroom or simply didn't see it. That's invalidating me""

I feel like I am at a point on my life where I am growing and becoming more myself than ever, but my partner is not growing at all. He stays in the same dead end job and lets everyone walk all over him. We haven’t been able to successfully have sex in about 6 months. I’ve tried talking to him about our relationship, how he is feeling, how I’m feeling, and nothing ever really changes. 

Being with him makes me unhappy at this point, but I know we were once happy and maybe could go back to that point?

We were in the same friend group for about 6 years but last year we hanged out more than usual and became as what she would call 'besties'. Later on i found that this whole time she was talking shit about me like how im annoying, how i think im superior than others etc FOR NO REASON. By the summer holiday, we stopped talking entirely (she would insult me time to time but other than that nothing).

Fast forward to September. We had only 3 conversations together. First she asked me if im still going to prep school on Friday (last year we went together and apparently this year too). Second was when we were talking in the bus with another classmate (we live near each other so we have to get the same bus). After that classmate left, she stared at me and walked away from me to the other side of the bus. And third was at prep school where she was acting nice towards me and again when we were alone she would give me a bad look and walk away.

This was in September. Now in October she got much worse. Usually in class i would turn to my friends who sit behind me and talk and laugh w/ them. When i do this, i also notice her STARING SO INTENSE AT US. At first i thought she is just zoning out but its not. Sometimes when we laugh, she also laughs, even tho she isnt part of the conversation and most likely didnt hear the joke. I think this is very creepy. i dont feel ok when im around her because i know her ugly ass big eyes are looking at me. Its also very obvious that she is staring. She doesnt care if i notice her. Sometimes i dont think she understands whats going on. I cant understand how the other classmates dont see how weird she is.

Now another time skip to November. I was wearing a black knitted sweater. A week later she was also wearing a quite similar black knitted sweater. When i stopped wearing it, she also stopped. I didnt really care / noticed this. Last week i wore my ugg boots. And guess what. She also wears ugg boots now.

I keep fuckin up…..I hadn’t realized how stupid I was until now……
I want to tell him I’m really sorry for failing, I really wanted this to work out but I am truly, seriously…..retarded…
No matter how many times he repeats stuff to me….I keep forgetting
Things I should know how to do by now….I still can’t
I don’t how how I became so fuckin useless….. he got really mad this time and told me to fuck off…..
I completely understand him….I’m a fuck up….
I need advice as to what to say……
“I’m sorry, I tried”….don’t quite cut it
he is having none of it….and I feel like he is entitled to bein angry…..I can’t make one single thing right…..
He realizes this too….he told me to fuck off and that he can’t believe I can’t do any single thing right…..and he is correct….
How do I even begin to heal this relationship….? I am ashamed of how stupid I am…..I can’t really call him out, I really am kinda retarded…..
Anyone, what can I do?
I really appreciate this friend….and it hurts me how much I’ve failed him…….

We get along great together and I can honestly see us going the distance because of how well we communicate and how open we are. I have one thing that drives me kinda nuts about him though, and it’s that he won’t let me pay for things! 

For some context, I have a full-time job and I make a decent amount of money. I’ve been living with my parents for the past 2 years because they have a house that’s 5 minutes from my office and it’s also been a great way to save up money. They’re great and are encouraging me to stay with them for as long as possible so that I can save more. Tbh I’ll probably move out the beginning of next year though. Anyways, my boyfriend knows all this and that I’m living with my parents so that I can save up money. Meanwhile, he’s in med-school and all of his money is literally studentloan money.

It feels entirely wrong to let him pay for things when we go out on dates since this isn’t *really* his money, but he *insists*. I know he’s just trying to be sweet, but I feel so guilty about it. He likes to take me out to nice restaurants sometimes, and I’ll have every intention of paying, but he sneaks them him card while I’m in the bathroom or something. I’ve tried negotiating with him to at least let me pay for my half of the meal, but he doesn’t like that either. Recently, I’ve started using an app to send my half of the bill to him afterwards, but he’s said it makes him feel uncomfortable so I’ve stopped.

I’ve tried to convince him to let me pay, but I think for him it’s this thing where he just wants feel like he can provide for me. I feel like I’m taking advantage of him though. I’ve had this conversation with him several times, but we can’t reach a conclusion on what to do since we’re both so stubborn on our own points of view. He jokes about how he’ll finally let me start to pay for things in a few years as motivation for me to stay with him longer. Or another joke is that in a few years when he gets his “big doctor salary” then this will be no big deal for him and I just need to stop worrying about it.

We work together. He was charming and lovebombing at first. He told me he had taken photos of me without me looking, cause he adored me and wished we could be together. I gave him a chance but asked to take it slow as I had just come out of a relation. First, he was okay but then the disrespect started. He left me alone sitting and waiting for him, went to sit by his friends, didnt bother inviting me over and when I left slamming the door he said I made it a big deal and none of his friends like me. It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he d say sorry and start with the love words. Then, he cancelled a date after promising for a match with guys, last minute and said sorry when I got mad. He then proceeded staying with another girl at work, she was new, and more of his type as Im quite introverted. I felt not enough, he would treat her similar as me, doing same actions, even being there for her at the middle of the night helping her with car issues, while he d tell me he would be there for me , but words and actions didnt match. Lastly, I asked him for some time away as it wasnt working, so he basically questioned me about my friends, and asked for photos of a guy friend I have. I told him thats possesive and he stopped talking for a whole month until I accepted I made a mistake offending him and I was sorry. Even that , he said he was angry at me and I had to wait for his forgiveness.

He charms almost anyone and I look like the bad person, although I think I did nothing wrong. He was saying he was always used by women and blamed me for withdrawing my love. I was just scared and wanted him to make things right. I told him twice I did love him , but wouldnt mention it often. We then texted in the middle of the night and I told him I had always loved him, but his actions made me back off, he treated me like crap, gave the silent treatment for a month and was punishing me , in order to beg. I cried that night and in the morning he hadnt bothered to send any text of apology , so blocked him but then after 2 months unblocked to phone him and say I miss him. He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late. Lastly, he flirted with another woman in front of me, avoids me, and pretends to be really happy at work as if I dont exist. I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye. He told me I blocked and unblocked him and he never did it to me (I was hurt and broken) and that I would tell him not to text me at work or kiss me at my office (it was because i wanted to be professional and not gossiped) and he would not take no for an answer.

He leaves every office Im at, but checks all my stories, stares at me. I finally reached out and asked to meet to have a talk in person and not text and he said he d be out of town at weekend, so I told him I would only take 30'min but he said ""another day"". What does he want from me? Has he ever loved me? Or is it my fault because I wasted his time? I took him back several times as he would bring gifts, say he couldnt help losing me, now barely looks at me and is avoidant. We only text regarding work and he replies , but doesnt initiate.

This has been the most fulfilling relationship Ive ever had and I do feel loved. However, in the last 6 months we have been less intimate and having pretty serious arguments once every two weeks. T

&amp;#x200B;

This situation all started on Saturday night when she came home from work. She came back in the evening a bit drunk (for context she works in a bar so this is not that unusual). We ended up having an argument because she was complaining that she doesn't have enough money to pay bills and so I suggested she cut back on her spending.  She got very defensive about this, and I can understand why, I don't deny it was an insensitive suggestions. I tried to diffuse the situation and apologised for suggesting it. However, the argument quickly turned nasty. She started yelling and told me she hated me and  started bringing up a lot of previous arguments that I thought we had moved past. We have never been physical with each other in an argument before but this felt very close to it.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning she left for work without saying anything. In the afternoon she sent a text saying she felt 'awkward' about the fight and was dreading coming home. She said she was sorry if she had said anything offensive or rude (which I think is putting it lightly and a poor apology), and went on to say that she just wanted to just say that before she came home. I responded saying that I felt a bit off too  and that I regretted the situation and what I was said. She had said earlier in the week that her  shift at work finished in the afternoon so I was expecting her to be coming home shortly, and it was implied in the text that she would be home soon.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets to 1 am and she hasn't come back or sent a message. I send a text asking her to just let me know if she's coming home or if she's staying somewhere else tonight. She doesn't respond until 11am the next morning where she says she went back to a male coworkers house for 'dinner and drinks' and fell asleep on the sofa. She said she meant to respond but didn't realise she hadn't.  I didn't respond to this until 4pm that same day where I just messaged to ask if she was coming home soon, and then again she does not reply and has not since.

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later I phone her and a girl mistakenly picks up her phone thinking it was her own phone (lets call her Sarah). When this happened my heart just dropped and I immediately assume the worst. I ask  Sarah if she knows my where my partner is and Sarah says my partner is sleeping right now. I ask Sarah if she works with partner and she said no she doesn't. It sounded like Sarah had just woken up her self and was a bit out of it, but i think after I had asked her a few questions she started to realise the situation and said she had to go and hung up the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Its now the evening again and I still haven't heard anything from my partner. Since she left for work on Saturday morning Ive only had that one text from her. Im really struggling to gage how serious this is. For a bit more context I tend to have trust issues and abandonment issues that im aware of so I know that this is the type of situation I would over react to. Secondly, my partner works in a bar so she does come home late often but I have communicated to her that it is important to me that she doesn't just disappear like this because I find it very stressful. All that I asked when we spoke about this before is that if she isn't coming back at the time she had previously has said, to just drop me a message to let me know. Generally she does do this, theres been only a few times when she hasn't but this is the first time she had not come home the following morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Im posting this because I want to gage how common this is in relationships and if im overreacting. My initial reaction was that she was probably lying about her where she was and is actually sleeping with Sarah. But thinking about it more it might just have been a group of people having drinks and dinner at this male coworkers place.

I'm a 23 year old female and this weekend I hung out with a group of guy friends from college (I wouldn't say we're extremely close, but we do hang out consistently!). I also brought along my boyfriend of 2.5 years. One of my friends brought his girlfriend along for the first time to meet everyone, and she seems like a very agreeable and bubbly person. The problem is that she was only bubbly to everyone \*except for me\*?

We were the only girls in the group the whole time, so I tried to ask her questions and include her in the conversation but she wouldn't really respond to me (she'd nod her head politely but wouldn't return conversation). She would consistently ask questions to literally everyone in the room, including my boyfriend, but went the entire night without initiating talk with me. Even though she hasn't met any of my guy friends before, she kept giggling and being super bubbly to them. At one point it was just me and my boyfriend + her and her boyfriend in the room, and she still only made conversation with my boyfriend and her boyfriend? I think she asked my boyfriend something like 5 personal questions in a row and I was literally just sitting there so awkwardly because I couldn't contribute anything to the conversation. It was so bad that even my boyfriend also noticed she was excluding me.

I'm really confused because I don't think I did anything to make her not like me? I literally talk to her boyfriend the least out of all the friends, and she knows that my boyfriend and I have been dating for a long time. 

Why would she do something like this? Has anyone ever experienced something similar and have any advice for this kind of situation?

Everyone knows Tinder is an app for something casual, so I wasn't expecting to foot the bill for any dates. But I did foot the bill for our first dinner just to be nice, and then she was really cute so I asked her to meet again. I didn't say it was a date nor mention I was taking her out the second time, just asked her to meet and it was HER idea to go to a restaurant.

This time, when the bill came, she smiled casually and said, ""You wanna get that?"" I looked her in the eye and said no. ""Equality"".

She then suddenly looked uncomfortable and literally burst into tears. It was nuts. She said it made her feel like she was worthless and that this has never happened to her before and that she hates cheap guys. She then said she spent a lot of time and effort getting ready and that I made her feel unattractive/unappreciated.

I was not going to be manipulated, so instead of sitting there listening to her rant/cry, I threatened to get up and leave. I also reminded her that I had lots of other girls who were interested in me. She panicked and pleaded with me to stay and put her card in.

I put in my card too to pretend I was splitting it, but it was HER turn to pay so I secretly locked my card to ensure I wouldn't have to.

Then when her card got charged the whole thing, her sadness changed to anger and she looked at me, then huffed out of the restaurant and seemed extremely furious.

I again told her she NEVER communicated she expected me to pay the second time. Her reply was that ""no answer is an answer"" as she had originally ignored me when I first asked her out/asked her if she expected guys to pay and only agreed to the first date once I offered to pay. I then said I always split the bills on second dates and she said ""that's why you don't have a GF"", which I thought was ridiculous.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I how do I handle my best friend’s fiancé sister. 

So we are planning my best friend’s bachelorette party  and she made me her maid of honor since me and her have been friends for 15+ years. My best friend made me, her fiancé sister, and another bridesmaid plan it together. 

As we were planning out flight tickets, the cheapest flight would be $400+ for Delta airline tickets and 6 girls would have to split the cost for the bride so $66 per person that all 6 girls would have to split. I wanted to book airline tickets soon because we are going during spring break week so it can either be sold out or the prices are going to be high. The grooms sister started to bitch at me and say that “we shouldn’t book our tickets early and wait 3 weeks before our flight to book, and no one pays that much for vegas. and basically started bitching at me etc” 

I literally explained to the grooms sister that the time we are going is spring break weekend and ticket prices are going to be high, etc. She started saying how tickets to vegas should only be $60 in general for a roundtrip but when I looked it was $400+ from where we are flying and when I told her that she started doing “😂😂😂😂” which honestly made me more mad. But when the other girl in the group booked her ticket for $600, she didn’t say anything about her buying her ticket but when I did, she started being rude and bitching. 

I told my best friend what happened and she didn’t like the her fiancé sister talked to me and treated me like. My best friend even said that the sister treats her like shit so maybe she’s treating me like this because im the maid of honor and she’s not?

I'm writing this on a backup account because I think my husband might know my other one.

Here's my situation... My husband makes A LOT of money. It's not super consistent and changes, but it usually ranges from 6k-12k a month. We live in Europe, and for our country, this is A LOT of €€€. To put it in perspective... Doctors make around 4-5k and are considered very very very upper middle class. My husband is bringing in twice a doctor's salary some months. 

I make €750 a month and work part time. This is about half a ""normal"" to low salary, since it's part time. My husbands job requires him to leave for weeks or days at a time and we share one car. Luckily my job is super flexible and I can work any day i want as long as I get in 20 hours, it's also next to our apartment. This means that I can revolve my schedule around his and when he needs the car (to drop baby off at childcare so I can work).

Here's the issue: We still split the mortgage 50/50 which means that my money leftover is €250... Which i use for groceries since I'm the one paying for food. He pays for all other expenses (gas, childcare, copropriété fees, water, gas, etc). Honestly he's a really great father and a loving husband but he has some sort of paranoia when it comes to protecting and keeping his money. I think it's unfair because sometimes he's gone for days, weeks, or weekends and it's me doing everything. He has a really fun and creative job that he LOVES and I'm taking care of his child so he can achieve his dreams but I have 0 spending money.

I never ask for money, but lately my neck has been hunting from my €10 pillow so i asked him to buy me a nice pillow (50-€100).. he said no, he's not my sugar daddy, and if i need money to pay for it I should get another job on top of mine (look into English teaching, etc). This really hurt my feelings a lot... But I'm not sure I want to end things over a pillow.

He told me when he's drunk once that he's saving up to buy us a house of my dreams (we live in a really shit apartment)... So maybe he's just doing this to save for our future. I'm not sure, but I'm getting VERY resentful towards him and anytime i address it he feels attacked. He does help a lot and does 50/50 childcare when he's not working, so it's not like he's useless.

Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile. 

I (20f) and my boyfriend, Sam(21m), have been together for two years. We had been long distance for about eight months of our relationship in th beginning. In case anyone thinks it's important, I have PTSD, BPD, and major depression and he has OCD, anxiety, paranoia, and major depression. He is in therapy, I am on a wait list. 

We've been living together for a year. We met in college, he dropped out and moved back home, he moved in with me and my roommates but that didn't work out so we moved back in with his folks. We've finally had our own place since August. I also have to note that I moved 6 hours away from home to be with him.

I love him so much, and he is such a big part of my life. Lately, he's been a short fuse. Since getting our own place, he developed some sort of rare esophagus issue that led to him being fired for missing too much work. He has to work with me and work less hours than me now, making almost half of what he made before. He hates the job, I know he does, he's made it clear. I've been trying to help him find a new job while also filling out applications as well. I ended up being offered a position he really wanted without applying, meanwhile he did apply and they never got back to him. Also, recently he discovered he is poly, but told me nothing will change because I want to have a monogamous relationship.

I listed everything above because recently he's told me he's unsure about our relationship. He loves me and everything, but doesn't know if he wants to be with me. He struggles with communication and explaining his emotions, so I have no idea what he is actually feeling. It could be a) he resents me for not only working more and making more but being offered jobs so quickly, he says he loves it for me but I've seen him cry because of it to b) he is self sabotaging our relationship because he doesn't feel good enough/is afraid of hurting me, the two male figures in his life are verbally abusive so he is constantly afraid of hurting my feelings and becoming them or c) our relationship has settled into a routine and has grown tiresome and he wants to be with someone who can give him a polygamous relationship.

I've tried to get information out of him, but all I get is ""I don't know"" followed by him being self depreciating. I offered that he stay with his mom for a weekend, so he could think about it while away from me, but that sent him spiraling. I've tried using the I statements and tried to see things through his perspective, but I don't know how to get him to talk to me. Nothing I've been told or read online has worked.

Right now I'm at work, but I feel like sobbing. I'm doing everything I can to keep our relationship afloat, but he doesn't know if there is a relationship left to keep afloat. I know I'm not perfect but I'm trying so hard to make him happy and do what I can to listen and work on us, but I don't know how when he won't open up to me.

He never opens up, and I constantly have to pry, but this time we're getting absolutely nowhere. How do I work on a relationship with someone who doesn't know what's wrong? How can I get him to talk to me?

This time, when the bill came, she smiled casually and said, ""You wanna get that?"" I looked her in the eye and said no. ""Equality"".

She then suddenly looked uncomfortable and literally burst into tears. It was nuts. She said it made her feel like she was worthless and that this has never happened to her before and that she hates cheap guys. She then said she spent a lot of time and effort getting ready and that I made her feel unattractive/unappreciated.

I was not going to be manipulated, so instead of sitting there listening to her rant/cry, I threatened to get up and leave. I also reminded her that I had lots of other girls who were interested in me. She panicked and pleaded with me to stay and put her card in.

I put in my card too to pretend I was splitting it, but it was HER turn to pay so I secretly locked my card to ensure I wouldn't have to.

Then when her card got charged the whole thing, her sadness changed to anger and she looked at me, then huffed out of the restaurant and seemed extremely furious.

I again told her she NEVER communicated she expected me to pay the second time. Her reply was that ""no answer is an answer"" as she had originally ignored me when I first asked her out/asked her if she expected guys to pay and only agreed to the first date once I offered to pay. I then said I always split the bills on second dates and she said ""that's why you don't have a GF"", which I thought was ridiculous.

We met on Instagram and talked around 2 month on phone. We had a harmonious relationship and conversation, and I can say “deep emotional connect”. We like each other of all aspects - appearance, outlook, and personality. After two months of our telephone conversation at a distance, he flew to my city. My city is not quite good and popular in Kazakhstan, but nevertheless we have always been together and enjoyed each other's company. Even when he sleeps, he always kisses and says how much he loves me, and somehow even said ""I would give everything in the world to lie so in a hug with you forever."" He's a guy who is well versed in psychology and we always mentored each other where we didn't know something. Our characters coincided very much, and sex was perfect, but there was one minus - his strong reaction to my problems, according to him. He didn't understand, then when he flew back - we still talked, but on the third day she noticed something wrong, and decided to talk to him - he admitted that he loved me very much and wanted to be with me, but also wanted to have sex with other girls. He was embarrassed to tell me this, and thought I would have problems with trust. I was very calm, and said that whatever happens, we must discuss and solve everything together, and so came to such a conclusion as 1. We talked for 2 months at a distance, so maybe after trying a physical touch, we want it. 2. He does himself self-sabotage, as he was in a toxic relationship before. And the day after the session with a psychologist, we broke up, as he realized that we have a ""game relationship and a carpman triangle"" where he is a lifeguard and rapist, and I am a victim. And the fact that he allegedly projected his childhood on me, and said that giving love to me, he gave love to himself, as he had not quite good relations with his parents. And when he took off the projection of himself from me, he saw only an injured person, and he replied to himself that his psyche did not want a relationship with me, but his heart says the opposite. But even at this time of our separation, we communicated with the word ""zhanym"" which means a loved one who is spoken only by couples. Then I asked if he loved me as a woman, he told me that he couldn't answer sincerely. And before that, he said that relationships are eternal work and progress, and nothing works out the first time. I repeated his words to him (I did not beg, keep in mind, I discussed everything with him very collected), and then he replied that he still adheres to his word, but not in this case, since we love each other at the level of our psychological awareness. We understood that there was no completely healthy person, but if we say it was 10 people, we were 3 out of 10. And we love each other level 3 in terms of emotional awareness. Yes, I also had childhood injuries, but this did not reflect any impact on my behavior. And the fact that I got into some trouble is my negligence and my strong kindness - it's so inherent in women, so my psychologist explained to me, and that I'm healthy, but I went to ""check"" after our separation. But let's go back to that topic, then I offered such an option as taking a break in a relationship. And I specifically asked what a pause in a relationship is for him, to which he replied - to part, but the opportunity to come together, the main thing is that I feel. When I offered to go through everything together and work, he replied that he did not want to hurt me and himself, and did not want a toxic relationship, as he is too worried about me and is stressful because of it, for example, if I do not pick up the phone, he thinks: ""whether something happened to me, and not that maybe I'm and he answered that he was not ready because this treatment would not require a month, but even a year, but during this time he does not want to hurt me and himself. And we agreed to the ""pause"" option, where we will meet or call in six months, and see how everything goes.

None of these lasted more than 2 months.

my bf is a good guy. but he rubs off on me in ways that make me upset.

it sucks, and i know for a fact i haven’t just *generally* formed these bad habits in my day to day life, it’s only around him.

when i’m by myself for even just a day it’s like i come back into my own body. suddenly i have the energy for exercising again (and do it), suddenly i want to eat well again. my passion for making music and art is back. i’m listening to music and feeling it again. i’m my normal excited &amp; happy self.

and then when we see each other again i can retain that persona for the day-of, but as soon as i wake up the next morning and i’m still in his presence it’s gone.

suddenly i have no motivation to workout because it feels like i’m doing him a disservice. suddenly eating well isn’t even floating through my head anymore. i don’t feel like making music or art, and listening to it does nothing for me so is don’t even bother. suddenly things feel a lot- slower. it’s like my brain slows down and relaxes and thoughts are no longer fueled by passion, suddenly they just feel like they come in much slower.

it’s not like he’s controlling or narcissistic.
between the two of us i’m def the narcissist or controlling one. he’s not a bad person at all.

it just sucks cause sometimes i can’t tell if i’m in the wrong or if my feelings are valid.

sometimes i wonder “maybe this is how you’re supposed to be, maybe he’s showing you the real you” but i don’t feel like or at least don’t want to believe it is. i think the real me is the me i feel when i’m alone with my thoughts. idk tho. i want to believe the “real me” is who i am alone, who i want to be, and not who i sometimes uncomfortably become (someone lacking passion).

i’ve been wanting us to work so so badly but recently i’ve started to lose faith. for the longest time i’ve tried integrating both “personas” into my life but they feel mutually exclusive. i’m starting to wonder if i’m gonna have to choose between us and myself. i want to be the best version of myself for him, the one that makes ME happy, and makes him happy.
