Tl;dr at the bottom 

I 33f lost my best friend 34f of 20+ years to a new relationship. 

Margret 34f met Ivan 30m on Tinder 4months ago, since then they've not had one date, just indoor activities. I expressed my concerns.

Background - Margret has been single for 10+ years and has a teenage son that she has 50/50 care of.

Ivan was raised in a cult, think Amish but not. No tv, no entertainment, no drinking, no sex before marriage, no dating, no Christmas although they are Christian based. 

Well Ivan has been shunned from the cult as he does not follow their ways, however is still very much a part of the family as he works for the cult's family business and while he lives on his own, his mother does all his cleaning and cooking for him.

So their indoor activities... Sex. 
They're unable to go on actual dates in the outside world as Ivan can't be seen out as he might be seen by his cult peers and shunned further.

Nevermind that he is able to go out and get drunk with his friends and even attend brothels. But no, taking Margret out on a date is too much to ask for. 

From what Margret has explained about Ivan, who has never been in a relationship before, he has a sex addiction, along with a gambling addiction and is just an overall not a person you would encourage your friend to be with. 

The first time Margret visited Ivan's house, they had to both search the floors for her hair before she left so his mum would not find any trace of her while cleaning - Margret has black hair while Ivan does not.

In the short 4 months they've been together, Ivan has given Margret a multitude of.. diseases. STD (twice), covid (this is not confirmed that it came from Ivan) &amp; conjunctivitis. 

This all came to a head about a month ago when Margret &amp; I had a night in together, being the people we are, we decided to do a pros and cons list of things that were going on in our lives. 

Now Ivan's red flags list that Margret wrote down :
Family - they won't accept Margret, she's Asian, never married with a teenage son
Friends - Margret doesn't like that they encouraged him to attend a brothel
Secrets - they have to keep the relationship a secret from everyone &amp; can't be seen together 
Money - he has none from all the gambling &amp; he is tied to the family business 

The next day, Margret tells me she &amp; Ivan are working it out &amp; tells Tass (34f) that they are now in an exclusive relationship with Ivan. Tass &amp; I let Margret know we didn't think it was a good idea and did she think about the red flags she wrote down. Oh was that a big mistake on our part, Margret went nuclear on the both of us going on about how we don't understand, her feelings are hurt that we're not supporting her and brought up our past failed relationships, swearing and yelling at me - ouch. At the time I was devastated &amp; unsure what to do.

Margret &amp; I did try to have a dinner together to mend the friendship. I apologised for what I said &amp; how things went down. Margret apologised after saying she wasn't sure why she got so angry. Basically at dinner I sat with a fake smile plastered on my face to keep the peace while Margret went on and on about Ivan (who had conjunctivitis at the time). Texting him pictures of our dinner &amp; drinks while we were out and then taking him our leftovers. I did slip in a cheeky comment about why don't you ask Ivan to bring you here so he can try the food... Silence.

In the next couple of days, Margret let me know she had covid &amp; while she doesn't think she had it at our dinner, I should get tested. Oh and now she also has the conjunctivitis too.

Thankfully I did not get sick. Fast forward a week later, we had previously organised a week off work to help Tass move 7hrs away. Tass &amp; Margret had not spoken since Margret went off on her a few weeks back although Tass's last message was saying she loved &amp; supported Margret. Margret left her on read.

I reached out to Margret on the first day of our leave to see how she was feeling - still unwell &amp; recovering. Here's where I could have asked her to come anyway (this is what she said)... But one, why would I risk being in a car for 7hrs with a sick person who I'm unsure if she's going to scream at me again, leave me on the side of the road somewhere, hasn't even tried to mend her friendship with Tass and two, there are no moving plans... so I didn't say anything.

A few hours later Tass &amp; I both get the same message saying how hurt Margret is about not including her on the moving plans.

Here's the thing.. there are no moving plans. Zero. Everything had been up in the air the week before Tass's move date and was cancelled last minute due to flooding. 

This turns into a whole new argument about how Margret doesn't need friends like us in her life if we're going to keep accusing her of being a bad friend and attacking her especially after how she helped us so much. Margret did very much help me when I needed her the most, I stayed with her for two weeks after I left my ex husband &amp; she helped me move into a new apartment. Neither of us attacked her or accused her of anything, we did say the relationship was not a good idea and that it is bigger than her.

Margret's final message to me was saying she doesn't need me in her life, that I failed her once (for questioning her) &amp; now I'm doing it again (for uninviting her from non existent plans).

After a few days after I had cooled off, I sent Margret a message saying we all could have handled ourselves better &amp; a break from the friendship is probably for the best.

Now it's been a few days &amp; I really don't think we'll ever be the same again.

Months ago Margret &amp; I booked an overseas holiday for the two of us.. at this point I'm not comfortable being with her in a car let alone travelling overseas, but the trip is 3months away. 

Any advice? Thanks in advance x

I am hoping someone could help me with a dilemma right now. I (M24) have been seeing a guy (23) for over a month now (six dates) and I am enjoying the experience so far and really see it progressing into a serious relationship soon. He is just my type and I feel so comfortable with him; he is so sweet. However, he mentioned today on a date that he applied for a job across the country at a very, very prestigious lab. He is also applying to other places in the area we are currently in. I do not fault him for doing this. It would be a great opportunity and he, of course, does not owe me anything after only six dates. 

My issue is that I do not want to get attached to someone who is not committed to the area; I just can’t do that to myself especially since I am looking for a long term relationship. I am not sure I can just “live in the moment” when I have my eyes on the future and something serious. I know I have no right to do so, but I can’t help but feel a bit annoyed considering the work I have put into this so far. I kinda took “commitment to the general area” as a given before I started seeing him. He is also very hard to pin down since I am the first person he has ever dated and he is shy. 

Anyway, should broach this with him? And how? I want to keep seeing him to maybe make the prospect of staying here a bit better. I know I would regret it if I didn’t. On the other hand, I don’t want to dig a hole for myself where I will get hurt later.

I don't know why. Nothing has really changed. I just don't get turned on by him anymore. It's no lack of effort on his part. It just seems like I never want to have sex or do anything sexual. Like I have to psych myself up *so* much just to be remotely in the mood, and I have no idea why. Nothing has really changed with me, either in terms of hormones, stress, etc. I still love him, the romance is still there. I have no problem with him as a person. I still think he's incredibly handsome. I don't know why I rarely feel any sexual desire at all anymore. For him, the sexual desire is the same as it's always been.

I can sense that it hurts him a bit how much more space there is between sex, but if I force myself to have sex it really is not enjoyable for me and it can even hurt because I'm just not turned on or even wet, and then the discomfort makes me even more sex-averse. And it's not just him - not even thinking about a ""celebrity crush"" or something turns me on. Like I just do not have a sex drive when I used to. And to be entirely honest, I don't really miss it, and that makes me feel bad. There are literally a million things I'd rather do, and rather do *together* even, than have sex.

Well I come to find out that my dad has fallen back into his heroin addiction. This led me into a huge depression as he has been lying to me for 4 years. He’s lied to me straight to my face multiple times since I’ve found out and have yet to confront him. 

My spouse also has addiction in the past so we’ve tried to come to the conclusion that we were arguing so much because we were in a very dangerous and toxic environment. I don’t blame her for leaving for that reason but it has been a week and we still haven’t talked about when I’ll be able to have my girlfriend and son back. 

It’s made me very mad the last couple of days because I’ve begged her to try and meet in the middle and she just insist on thinking her dad won’t let me stay with them. Maybe I express to him that I miss my family and also want to be out of this environment. 

I’ve had problems sticking with a job since I’ve been with her and she tells me she will come back to me when we have an apartment to live in. But why do I have to do it by myself. You don’t have to be raising our son by yourself but you’re forcing it. 

Being away has taught me to stay focused on the important stuff first and I’m sure that’s what she wants from me. But I just can’t bare to go to work everyday and have to go back to this household without my family to even see.

My boyfriend was in the marines and i know he owns guns (were in a relatively gun friendly city), I’ve shot his AR10 many times, he was a scout sniper when he served in Afghanistan.

When we started living together I kept waking up earlier and earlier…5..then 4…then 3…and no matter what I can’t fall back asleep. Doctor says I am fine (mind you he didn’t do any tests). 

Years went by and my sleep continues to get worse. I have tried all natural remedies for insomnia. 

Now I’m at the point where I have no trouble falling asleep, but the second I am woken up I CANNOT fall back asleep. Anytime my fiancé or dog move, sneeze, cough, snore they wake me up and I can’t fall back asleep. Some nights I would wake up just 1-2 hours after falling asleep and be up the rest of the night. There were weeks when I got 10 hours sleep total. It impacted every area of my life. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago…my fiance passed out on the couch 2 nights in a row and I got a full 6-7 hours sleep for the first time in years. 

I told him this (he is very aware of my sleep troubles and has been amazing working with me over the years to find solutions) and now we have been doing a trial of sleeping in separate beds &amp; rooms for the past week…I feel bad that I have been sleeping better than I have over our entire relationship.

I’m really need some motivation from this community to see things more clearly, and also to get some tips on things you’ve done to help you on your journey.

For context, I came from an abusive home. So I guess whenever I feel love, I have a really hard time to let go.

I’ve been in this relationship, on and off, for two years and a half. The issue is, my ex had broken up with this ex-wife, 8 months before the relationship started. And the ex-wife took some 5 months to leave the house, so my ex was pretty traumatized.

Still we fell in love, and insisted on this relationship, but let’s say this only increased his depression and anxiety. The more he wanted to stay on it, the more he was feeling like shit.

So he started having panic attacks, using weed, until we broke up. The thing is, we can never stay away. 

I eventually went back to my city (different country), and it did me well. Two months working on myself did wonders, but once I got back, and it got ruined again and we kept seeing each other and I went back to “fully in love and full of hope”.

I ruined all the work I’ve done… The issue is, no matter how much we love each other, we cannot stay together.

His mental health won (which is good, but he is not doing much to fix things) and I need to understand he decided to let go of us.

So I came here for advice, motivation, tips, to see reality, more than hope.

This took me completely by surprise and now I don’t know what to do.

Background: The other day I was putting some things away in our small laundry room when I turned quickly and accidentally knocked the iron off the counter. It fell and broke. I was annoyed as I have said to partner numerous of times not to put there but I shrugged it off, figured it’s broken now so I tried to fix it. I  couldn’t so messaged partner to tell him what happened. We laughed about it and he told me it didn’t matter and we could buy a new one if this one can’t be fixed.

Now today, as we are driving to the shops to buy a new one he changes his mind and turns the car around. Says he’ll just try fix the iron instead. He starts stressing about how inconvenient this is, how he needs his work shirts ironed, how he doesn’t have time during the week and I could tell was getting more and more worked up about it. He has an interview on Wednesday (three days away) and started saying how he feels really stressed that he won’t have a shirt by then. My partner tends to go 0-88, never up to 100 but definitely up there so I say to him “don’t stress, it’s an easy fix. Either we fix the broken one or I’m happy to go to the shops to buy a new one before Wednesday” (I work from home so always offer to help out with tasks he can’t do during the week, he tends to take me up on my offer but he does go back and forth, lots of “don’t worry I’ll just do it on the weekend” “I’ll just deal with it later” kind of responses before he finally agrees to let me do it) 

He turns to me says “this is why I never talk to you about things that stress me out. You’re really condescending”

This threw me. I absolutely did not intend to be condescending and I don’t think I ever am but he continued to say that I always blow off his stresses, make him feel worse and never actually help him. I explained I don’t intend to come across that way, that I was just trying to lighten the situation and of course, I don’t like seeing him stressed so I was trying to be helpful. I know that he can be pretty sensitive and like I mentioned tends to go from chill to panicking over quite simple things - I mean the things you’d think warrant a stressful reaction he’s super easy with but really minor stuff he gets so worked up over. I know what he’s like but I don’t call him on it, I know that would make it worse but I’m now confused and I’m not sure what to do. I don’t think I’m condescending but maybe I am without realising it!

Maybe it’s because we didn’t have a good date but I much preferred hanging out with him around others. We are both quiet individuals but I can be much more energetic and chaotic if I’m with those I’m comfortable with but when I was alone with him I felt like I had to act proper and couldn’t really do much.

Over the summer we didn’t talk or hang much but I got a message from an unknown number basically saying it was the guy I was talking to and he got a new phone, asked me about my summer and apologized. I honestly didn’t know what I felt for him so I asked one of my friends and kept writing and deleting messages and before I knew it, I responded two months later. I made up an excuse that wouldn’t allow me to use my phone for two months but I know it wasn’t believable and I’m not sure how he reacted because he didn’t reply.

We’ve recently seen each other more, making awkward eye contact while walking with others, going to events or parties together. I’ve realized how much I absolutely love him for how kind he is, how sweet and innocent he is, how precious and amazing he is but before I’d realized this I started dating my best friend.

She confessed over the summer and I accepted because me and the guy had not talked nor ever said we were dating. I still love her but definitely not as much as the other dude and we’ve started to grow apart as we don’t have any reasons to talk or interact. I’m not sure if he even likes me or cares about me because we’re both shy and never take action, the only reason I confessed was because my friend forced me and helped us get together over the span of 3+ months. But I am with my best friend, she’s so fun to hang out with, we connect so much and she’s such an amazing person but she’s become more moody and rude towards me. Honestly, if I had the guts and some support I may very well break up with her even if I do love her but she’s one of my only friends. She’s introduced me to so many of the people I talk to, I also don’t want to lose her as a friend. If we broke up some of my friends may not want to talk to me or she might not want to be friends. She’s always been a very over dramatic reactive person so I’m scared for what she’ll do and what I’ll do after we break up.

I (22M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (23F) for 5 years now. She was in the hospital before due to mental health issues. She got way better and says it's thanks to me, even though I feel like the only thing I did was push her a little and reassure her, she did all the efforts.

It's sometimes hard to reassure her when I myself am sad or not feeling well, but so far it's been a happy relationship.

For context, days are getting shorter and I'm really tired currently, so my mood is not the best, and I sometimes have dark thoughts. I know it sounds bad, but I don't think it is since I'm not seriously considering it, it's just thoughts (really).

She goes to therapy, I pushed her to. Her therapist said it was self sabotage, and this idea really has stayed in her mind.

Today, she was feeling really down and I tried to comfort her again. She was in bed, did not want to move or look up from her phone. She says she does this to hurt herself, she's trying to make me mad so I leave her and she'll get hurt (her words). 
I asked her if she would rather hurt herself or stay with me, and she said she'd rather hurt herself. I asked her again, and told her to think carefully. Same answer.

I left the room and am now writing this. I love her, but I don't know if I can keep going like this.

She asked if we’re okay, she said I don’t seem as passionate anymore and that I haven’t been giving her the same attention as I was before. I reassured her as much as I could, told her that maybe I’ve been playing too much games since MW2 came out and that I want to give her more attention.

Yes, having depression isn’t her fault, but it was a difficult time after the breakup, of course I was sad, especially considering I was certain we wouldn’t get back together.

Obligatory I'm on mobile, tl;dr at the end, also this is a throwaway account. Also I posted this earlier today but I guess it got buried, so I'm hoping someone sees this..

Ok. So my husband has battled depression for an incredibly long time, but has never seemed out treatment &amp; preferred to self- medicate (I know... not very smart but you do what you can when you have no health insurance). I thought we were doing well, we were happy, going on vacations together, very positive, loving, and supportive relationship. We rarely fought, &amp; when we did it was usually over something silly &amp; minor &amp; we always ended up laughing about it in the end. So, it came as a major shock when, last month, he tells me he wants to file for divorce, &amp; that he's not happy &amp; hasn't been for a while, &amp; that as soon as everything is finalized, he's planning on ending his life. He has planned everything out, down to the smallest details (he's planning on burning/destroying any &amp; everything that can identify him, so that if anyone finds him, they won't be able to identify him).

I have BEGGED him to seek treatment, as we have insurance now, but he told me know, that he's tired &amp; just doesn't want to be here anymore. And the truth is, I understand, I really do, as I have also been washing my own war against depression for the better part of 30 years.

So. What I plan on doing is researching what needs to be done to... essentially force him into treatment, for lack of a better way of explaining... I can't lose him. I can't. He means so much to me, &amp; he is worth so much more than he believes. So my question is this: is there anyone on this app who was forced into treatment? I need to know I'm doing the right thing, &amp; I'm terrified of losing him... &amp; as much as it would hurt if he ended up hating me for this, it would be so much less than if he was wiped from existence. 

I can't lose him. It would absolutely destroy me, &amp; I don't know if I'd be able to come back from that edge.

He lived with me and my dog in my house, and we were the perfect little family. I loved him to the bones. 

In September he downloaded tinder and began messaging girls with flirty messages, following their instagrams, and DMing them through snapchat. He purchased tinder gold while we were going through a tough financial time and this behaviour continued for about three or four weeks. I found out, was very upset, but he seemed remorseful and I stayed with him. I was gutted, my world throughly rocked, and I felt sharing how I was feeling with him would hurt him as he seemed so ashamed of what he had done. I didn't tell my friends because I didn't want them to think poorly of him and so I kept the pain to myself. He told me he felt insecure. His father beat his wives and cheated on them. He told me he felt like he had characteristics of his dad and he didn't want that, and that he sought others approval because it made him feel better and he selfishly wanted the ego boost. 

Things were okay after the dust settled, he didn't have a car and he worked a forty minute drive away from mine so I would wake up two hours early to drive him to his work with enough time for me to get back and start my job. We were both tired and stressed with this arrangement so he decided to move back in with his parents as he worked with his step dad who could drive him to work in the mornings instead of me. During this time we discussed him moving jobs as my job provided our house. He insisted he wasn't good enough at his trade to change sites but I pushed him to believe of course he was good enough. He is qualified and often does private jobs for his own clients. He disagreed so he stayed at his parents house and came to mine Friday night through till Monday morning. 

His birthday rolled around in October and we visited my aunties as she had arranged a family lunch for him. My family adored him. He was protective over me, he was gentle, and kind, and sweet - both behind closed doors and with people around. On the drive home he drove my car and we crashed. He drifted onto the wrong side of the road and hit an oncoming car and we span 180. My car was destroyed. I wasn't looking at the road and he claims to have passed out. He has been interviewed by police as they tried to charge him with careless driving, I have my interview to give my perspective later this month. My car was a write off, my insurance company have to pay out for the damages to the other vehicle involved, he said he would pay this. He is currently being investigated by medical teams as they believe a heart condition may have caused this. 

I think at this point it would be worth noting that I suffer from depression and anxiety and he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression. I am on medication, he is too but often times forgets to take his tablets. 

At the beginning of this week I saw a job listing on a site ten minutes away from my house for workers in his trade. The job paid more than his current one and he could've moved back into mine. I sent him the ad, he called them and left a voicemail. I began to get excited and started suggesting how he could take the bus to work and home and meet me at the house before I had finished work as I worked later than him. I suggested things he could do on his days off, places in the town he could visit, he loved to work in the garden so I invited him to do whatever he wanted to in the yard. He told me he didn't want to talk about it anymore. Defeated, I said ""whatever"". 

He exploded, told me he didn't want I talk to me for the rest of the evening and that he needed space. I spoke to him briefly that evening to apologise for pushing and to say goodnight. 

The next day he told me we needed to go on a break. I am sure during that discussion I said "" and a break means not talking to other people right"" and he said yes. And so I gave him space. He claims I asked if he was currently speaking to other people, and he said no. At this point he has pushed so much that I am wrong I'm starting to doubt it myself but I am certain I said what I thought I did. 

That evening I had a feeling something was wrong. He was online and active throughout the entire day, and that isn't usual for him. He wasn't talking to me, so who was he talking to? His Snapchat was logged in on my phone and so I had a look. 

Five girls. An ex fling, a conversation of graphic sexting, and three other girls he never speaks to full of general chatter with flirtatious remarks. 

I broke down. I called him and screamed at him "" how could you do this to me"" I sobbed and cried and dragged myself into my house and I had a panic attack on the phone. He told me to stay where he was and that he was coming. He dropped everything and came straight over. He picked me up off the floor and held me and let me cry. He stayed the night. He spooned me, told me he loved me, and that things would be okay. 

The next day I wake up - too late to take him to work he decides to stay at mine for the day. I say don't do anymore - don't ruin this further - I'll talk to you about things when I get home from work. 

I'm at work. He's active again all day. I call him and cry and tell him to stop talking to those girls and he insists he isn't. I come home, we talk, he says things aren't going to work - that in his head things have gotten toxic, that he's stressed I don't trust him because of what happened before, that he's convinced I don't want him to move back in with me because I want him, I only want it because I am lonely. I tell him how wrong he is, that I don't want anybody else. I say have you spoken to those girls today, he says no, and he tells me we need to break up. He goes downstairs to let the dog out, he leaves his phone, I check. There's a new girl this time, and they have talked and flirted all day. 

I cry again, he comes back, knows what I've done and tells me I shouldn't have looked. He's right - I violated his privacy but in my mind he lied to me and I was owed the truth for my own sake. We talk some more, then a film started on the telly and we sat and watched it. Again he spoons me, tells me he loves me, comforts me during the sad parts of the film and kisses my forehead. The film ends, he asks for a lift home and I take him. 

Then today. I tell everyone what has happened, I tell my family and my friends everything. And they get angry, and then I get angry. And I tell him how he's hurt me, how he's violated my trust and he's confused me. He kept saying maybe he just needed time to work things out in his head and then he'll be back. He cried when he told me we needed to break up, my head feels fried, I don't know if he loves me or hates me. 

We've arranged for him to pick his stuff up tomorrow. We planned for me to pick him up from my town and drive him back to mine. I don't know how he's planning on getting home but I assume I will have to take him. I don't know how to act, how to feel, or what to believe. The entirety of our relationship aside from these few days has been so loving and I have felt protected and safe. I never felt like he would hurt me but he has, repeatedly. I know today he is still talking to those girls, and I know he's speaking to them more and more because they're befriending him on more and more of his socials. 

He says he finds comfort in speaking to people. I believe he does but I believe the same comfort can be found in friends, not women he finds on tinder and flirts with. 

I love him, I know he struggles mentally, he hides a lot of trauma and he is stressed. But I don't want to lose him. I don't know what to say when I see him tomorrow, I don't know if I should throw his stuff at him or try to help. I'm so angry, and I feel so betrayed, but at the same time I'm hurting and I miss him. He was my best friend, but he's acting like a complete stranger.

My dad left, and everything to bad.  We had such severe money problems, we'd have to go weeks without food, without water, or without electricity.  My mom got into abusive relationships that were really bad.  She relied on me a lot to help her, I had to basically give her everything I had.  Teachers at school told me that her problems were not my problems, but they didn't understand that living at home with her this wasn't realistic.

Here's the deal.

I'm now 28, still in my home town.  I'm proud of where I am considering where I came from.  I am looking at moving abroad, then moving back to another part of the country, hopefully a large city where there is more of a gay scene.

My mom (62) has always had a really hard time.  Since I was little, she would be open with me about all of her issues.  They would overwhelm me because I couldn't do anything as a kid.  She has so much trouble.  She's been to therapists and on medications.  She doesn't make enough money to pay her bills every month, and she has this unemployed loser living with her for years now who she supports but won't kick out - yet she cries to me on the phone about how much she hates her life.  She just won't get her shit together.

I feel responsible for my mom.  I wish I could take her away from her problems and take care of her.  I think I was conditioned to think this way because she always made her needs first in my life from a young age.

I have a hard time letting people do things for me.  I have a hard time communicating what I want.  I don't put my own needs first, and it feels like I just live for other people.  I want to do what makes me happy but I have no idea what that is - but I'm going to find out.

I just don't feel good unless I know my mom is okay.  Thing is, she's a perpetual mess and I feel so so bad.  I want to save her, I've considered moving home and paying her $1000 USD per month for rent to help fix things.  But if I do that, though it'll be nice to be home and see her happy, I won't have done anything I wanted to do.  I don't want to be stuck because my mom needs my money.  At the same time I feel immense guilt if I consider what I want to do, or what I want to buy.

How can I break this?  

I love my mom.  I want so badly to save her.  But her own choices perpetuate her problems.  I've never considered what I want from my life, and thinking about this makes me feel guilty.

At 28 I'm not old, but I'm not getting any younger, and I want to have fun and live my life for what I want.  This feels so radical tbh.

I don’t want to get into details because I don’t even know if I can trust that he is telling the truth at this point. 

Basically I’ve been with my husband since we were 16. We got engaged very young, 19 years old. 

Recently it came out that my husband was inappropriate with a work collage at his first job. (I’d didn’t even know this female existed, he never mentioned her) It was an emotional affair, I don’t know it was physical I just have to take his word for it. It’s a whole new side to him that I didn’t know so even if he claims it’s the truth I don’t think I’ll believe him anyway. This happened so long ago, they stopped contact in 2016 when he left the job and she’s been in a committed relationship for 4 years now. So it’s not like she’s bothering him or they have any contact at all. That I’m sure of.

He hid a lot. He has a porn addiction which I had no idea. The porn could be accepted but it crossed the line from him using pictures of women we knew in real life including friends and family members of mine!

It’s like my whole world is dark. I really thought I knew my husband. It makes my stomach sink that I never knew him at all and he was so good at hiding all of this stuff.

He treated and treats me like a queen. But he has an obsession with searching up every woman he meets or sees. 

I just don’t understand.

We have a-lot together. Financially a home and a business.

It happened quite quickly in our relationship and I took the time to explore where it came from (long story but essentially a toxic childhood), he he's been very receptive to understanding gaslighting, considering why/how/when he does this and has on occasion stopped himself half way through and corrected himself. I'm really proud for the work he has done and continues to put in, and I know it's a journey and once he's done it he's not always going to correct himself as there will be times he slips and that's OK. I'm just wondering, how long is long enough, how many more times do I forgive him? I'm worried about the balanced between understanding/accepting he's not a perfect person and recognising when firm boundaries around gaslighting needs to me put in place, so he knows I will not be tolerating it. 

Another incident of gaslighting happened again tonight and I find myself thinking - lets see of he can take responsibility for his actions and turn it around like I know he can do and I'm so fucking done with this, it'll never change.

I am also acutely aware of my part in this, that I could handle things differently, instead of getting frustrated and saying I feel like you're gas light me and I really hate this behaviour etc... I could have definitely handled it very differently more calmly, and that will be my learning point from it. 

I'm guess I'm just desperately hoping that he will acknowledge the gaslighting and his not so great behaviours tonight, but even if he does, I'm worried this will just keep happened, and I just don't know what the best way forward is.

About 6 years ago I met someone else (f34 - I will call her my crush though it’s not the right word) with whom I formed a strong friendship and I must admit a strong attraction, though I did nothing to act on this mostly thinking it a fairly immature infatuation and impractical and unreciprocated.
I’m already ridiculously older than my partner (f35) but have such a good relationship generally that I don’t think much about the age gaps.  

I’ve been sober for about 6 years, and sadly I have found in the last 6 years without the aid of alcohol I’m too body self conscious for sex. Furthermore I’ve not been sexually attracted to my partner (f35) for sometime. Which I feel very bad about. 

My crush…(f34) lives in a whole other continent to me. I’ve been able to hang out with her IRL several times visiting various places and having amazing adventures and talks. Purely on a platonic level. I’ve never acted on my feelings and am unsure exactly how my crush (f34) feels about me as a potential mate. This last week gone I’ve been able to spend 5 days in my crush’s company, again having amazing adventures. We are not sleeping together or anything, again I have not acted on my feeling and we even talk about how amazing our platonic friendship is. 

Two days ago my crush (f34) and I sat and talked for several hours. She told me of her wish to have a family and how hard this is (she is fairly recently single from a poor 1 year relationship which ended with a miscarriage, terrible for her). 

My partner (f35) does not want children, it is a firm belief for her. She has a bad relationship with her mother and can not stand the idea of having the same with a child. 

I would dearly love to have a family. I am nearly 50. Time is running out for all of us. 

I do not want everyone to get hurt. I feel my partner deserves to know about my feelings for my crush. I didn’t think I believed in romantic love but i Iove the person I am when I am with my crush, I love her. The way she moves through life her compassion and intelligence. We seem very compatible and I need to tell her how i feel. I am not worried about rejection, just the thought of destroying two important friendships. Respecting both women and being truthful is important to me. I do not wish to play a sort of Pascal’s wager and hide things from my partner (f35) simply because it makes life easier for me. 

Additional info that feels relevant but doesn’t fit. I felt on out most recent meeting that maybe my crush feels a little more for me than just friendship, but I really don’t know. I know how I feel. I’ve also been able to get super fit in the last year or so following the lockdowns and for maybe the first time in my life feel body confident. Happy to take advise especially from women.

I dated my first ex for 3 years before I had to break up because of her depression (I tried getting her help for a long time). After a year, I then found another girl who is sweet. We dated for 5 months before my ex somehow found out (despite me blocking her) and then she harassed her by saying I'm still in love with her.

I reassured my then girlfriend that she is lying and that while I still hope she gets help, I'm not in love with her. Still, after 3 more months of my ex harassing her, she then finally broke up saying she felt targeted. I pleaded with her to stay but quite understandably, she didn't want to be involved.

I then told my first ex to never come near me or talk to me ever again. I also called her parents to check on her. To my horror, they called back and told me she stabbed herself 5 times. She did survive but I feel guilt over yelling at someone who is depressed.

It started off when I invited my friend over to my girls for the weekend. Wanted him to come down so we could have a good time and enjoy ourselves. The weekend went great until me and my girl got into argument a pretty bad one. We were both at fault, we mad each other pretty upset and hurting feelings in the process. In my part I even accidentally knocked over her tv causing it to break but offer and (later on) did pay for a new one. The results of the heated argument led to her offering my best friend (at the time) a ride to campus which was an hour away. He asked me if he was coo w him leaving and her taking him back ( I thought that was weird that he asked that) I said “if you want bruh go ahead” trying to test him and see what he would do. Well couple of min later he was in the car and him and my girl where on the way back to my campus. Her and him leaving me both. Idk I might be trippin but if I’m yo homie, idc if we in Africa, I’m not going no where if you ain’t goin no where. We in this shit Together, idk that’s just me. And for my girl (at this point it was a year 1/2 -2 year relationship) it mad me upset that she left me knowing I have no other ride back to my dorm at the time. To me it’s messed up because if I care about you idc what happens I’m not gonna leave you stranded. Imma take you home and never deal w you again if it’s something deep, but I’m not gonna leave someone stranded. That’s the first incident 


The second incident, my girl posted on her private story ( me and  my ex bestfriend are on there). She was drunk and decided to post her self shaking her ass in the pool. With a shirt on but no panties. He slid up on the story commenting on her ass and how it’s nice but later calls her and tells her to take it down because he knew I’d be upset. She told me about him sliding up but never mentioned the comment he made until a half a year later after a argument was brought up about him because she always like to make comments like” why won’t you ivt him over” “ let’s bring him with us” “idk why you don’t like him he’s your coolest friend (at this point we not really coo and she’s know this ) knowing the previous situation of him and her leaving me and how I felt. At this point I feel like she’s just trying to get under my skin and when she sees I’m upset she makes comments also like “ why are you jealous of him” but idk I might just b me trippin. I feel like there was something to hide if she had to hide this from mefor a year and a half. That’s the second situation.

The third situation, me and her went to a bond fire with one of her friends. We were drinking having a good time until later that night when I was away, her friend asked if I had any friends she can hook her up with. A typical question, but what made me upset was that the first person she tried to hook her up with was guess who? Yea that one person she knew I didn’t like and had actual reason to not like in my opinion . She tried to lie until her friend actually told her that yes that’s who she tried hook her up with. She could’ve chose anybody else in the world. I didn’t care if it was a friend, someone I didn’t know, but she had to choose someone I don’t like and she knew I didn’t like him because the whole reason I found out was because that night her friend came and told me “yea your girl tried to hook me up with someone you don’t like.” And there is only one person she knows I don’t like.

19F here, and am living at an apartment with one other roommate while we are both in university, let's call her Emily.

So we just moved into an apartment together this year after we both were living in dorms last year. We both were barely at the dorm since we had boyfriends who had apartments, so conflict never arose. Anyways, today I get a text saying the following:

Emily: ""bro lmfao have you not seen the trash I put it there all tied up so you don't have to pull it out. But can you please take it out when you can I didn't think I had to ask sorry not trying to be mean but like...only thought you should take it out since I did it a few times in a row idk just trynna be fair.""

The problem I had with this message is that she never told me she wanted to take the trash out, she just left it in the pantry room. I don't pick up on these indirect cues and didn't understand why she couldn't just text or say ""hey can you take out the trash?""

Me: ""sorry I thought I had taken it out the last time, just tell me to take it out don't just sit it there, communicate with me please. I don't like indirect communication like this.""

Emily: ""Bro I put it there to help you lmaoo, not to be petty.""

Me: ""its okay but it is petty if you just sit it there and say nothing. I thought I had taken it out last time, I apologize.""

Then she goes onto say that we can sit down and have a chat about what we can both do to contribute. She apologized for the potential of being petty. I told her I was down to make a plan but I thought I had taken it out a regular amount and that we were alternating between me, her and her boyfriend who is there 24/7. I told her I might have lost track (I dont keep track I just do it when I assume its my turn). On my end, I probably wasn't paying enough attention but I felt like I was.

The thing is is that I do things to contribute. I did the dishes last night, I mopped and cleaned the living room when she asked me to, whenever she asks me to do anything I do it immediately, no hesitation or arguments. Even the little things like ringing out the sponge when I'm done using it or cleaning out the fridge or just random little things.

Emily: ""I know but it's just kinda unfair for u for me to like always remind u cuz that's annoying and another responsibility only my part to constantly have to text and remind you.""

Me: ""this isn't intentional I try to contribute and do things like do the dishes and other stuff so nobody gets mad at me.""

She then goes onto say that its okay and she wasn't trying to come at me and that we both have different preferences for keeping the house clean. She said that she is more of a constant cleaner than I am and that's why our apartment stays clean.

Keep in mind I am not messy, I do not leave dishes in the sink EVER (but her and her boyfriend do). I do not cook because I use the meal plan, the most I will do is make noodles. I rarely EVER eat in the living room. I barely even sit down in there im always in my room. So the place would be clean if it was just me but its her and her boyfriends friend that comes down every weekend that makes a mess in the living room. Plus I don't care if there are a few crumbs under the kitchen counter it doesn't bother me.

Me: ""yeah I dont think I mind as much as you about he house being spotless, and I also don't see the things you do to clean (vice versa you don't always see the things I do).

Emily: ""yes and u do contribute I really appreciate it as both of us have a part in it. My point is that is having to remind you more than I feel like I should because I feel like we're old enough to keep track of our own responsibilities. I mean that genuinely (my name) im not tryna be rude just explaining.

This is where I got mad because she used the phrase ""I feel like we're old enough"" implying that I'm I have not aged as much as her mentally and that there is a difference intellectually. I felt that this phrase was demeaning.

Me: ""never my intention to annoy someone, be irresponsible or uncleanly. I felt like I was keeping track of my responsibilities but it doesn't seem like that is the case since we are having this conversation, soI would say the solution here is to make a plan so we don't have any more miscommunication""

Me: ""I apologize once again but you also shouldn't get mad at me for having to remind me of your preferences, I cannot read your mind"" (she disliked this message with an emoji)

I said this because she texts me over things like the microwave being ""dirty"" when I don't even think its dirty. I don't understand why she is upset that she has to remind me of her preferences when I personally don't care. When she texted me about the microwave I immediately went home and cleaned it. If you're so bothered about something I think that you should just do it yourself and not put your very specific preferences onto someone else.

Anyways I apologized again and I think that message sent her over the edge because she texted me the longest paragraph I've ever been sent in my life, getting on me for random things like walking to my room with my shoes on (my room isn't the one near the door and sometimes I forget to take off my shoes when in a rush). She got on me for the microwave thing, and not mopping the living room, etc when we didn't even have a specific plan for it. She got upset that I wasn't doing these things on my own without being asked.

She asked me to mop and vacuum the living room over the weekend and again, I did it right away. She made a schedule for us to alternate each week with that which I was perfectly happy with doing. Everything she's ever asked me to do I've done right away even if it was inconvenient for me.

She said she was upset about ""constantly remind me"" but she's only texted me about a couple things one time. I am perfectly willing to do anything she asks and actively take steps when she's not observing in order to not get these passive aggressive texts from her. The situation is really stressing me out and upsets me because I feel like I'm constantly bending over backwards to make people happy and it never works.

But I'm just confused by all this. Her boyfriend and her constantly leave dishes piled up in the kitchen but it doesn't bother me, but I know for a fact If I were to do that I would get a paragraph long text about it. I just feel like its unfair that she expects me to know all these little things she wants done (like making sure the sponge is dry after using) without every communciating about it with me. I am a very clean person, but this is taking it to a whole new level. I felt like I was being baited with the whole trash thing.

During that time he was still looking at my insta stories.   I sent one follow up check in a couple days ago.  Still didn’t reach out, but today he messaged apologizing with his excuse being he’s been so busy it’s been difficult for him to keep track of his messages.  

I thanked him for the apology and said I thought I may have said something wrong and that I tend to overthink about these things as I’ve had bad experiences with meetup apps.  I said I don’t want to make assumptions, but that it wasn’t cool for me to wait for him to see if still available or if worth looking for other plans.  He didn’t reply.

Had a feeling he was BSing, because he didn’t even answer my question if he would still want to do the alternative meetup plan I suggested.  And it wasn’t the first time he flaked.

When we first started dating, she had just sold her home, (post Covid), and was living with her mother (trying to find a good price on homes, terrible timing). We were dating, and seeing eachother on weekends. After about 6 months,  It started getting more serious, and she put an offer in on a condo. At this point, I was thinking it was a bad idea, as we were becoming more serious, and was hoping we would buy a house together. (Earlier than I wanted). She ended up backing out, and wanting to stay at my house a few days a week to simulate living together. (We live about 45 minutes away). We tried it BARELY, and her mental health seemed to decline due to living with her parents (seemed to not have any confidence even though she had so much money saved). Eventually, I became her number one fan on buying a place. Her happines matters to me most. She prefers condos (I want a house), but I realized it was the best thing for her emotionally, and we would figure out the logistics later. Fast forward.

partner (25m) spends the weekends without me (25f) and doesn't plan dates. I've tried previously but he would rather spend money. Now we live together he has spending many weekends in a row in different cities/ out with his friends leaving me in the flat alone.


So myself and my boyfriend live together. We have been together for nearly two years and met in college. For a year we went long distance as he had a job in a new city  of which we would spend most weekends together, either I would travel to his city or vice versa, whilst I was finishing college in the same city we met. I always wanted to move out of the city I was in and we made plans to rent an apartment together towards the end of our rental contracts at the end of the year whilst I look for employment after my degree.

Fast forward, he is loving his job, has settled into the city and has made friends from work that he does things with outside of work. I have been invited a couple of times but have always felt like a bit of an 'add on'. I have a job in the city though its not the best, not on the same league as his job especially with how competitive everything is. I'm really happy for him but I also feel limited because we live outside of the city centre by around 40 minutes, neither of us have a car and any work in the centre is kinda boxed off from me as the public transport in this city is notoriously bad! I had some appreciation of this before I moved but after spending a week working a job in the centre and spending 3+ hours commuting/ waiting around for buses everyday whilst my boyfriend was able to leave and get back from work before myself I quickly realised my options were limited.

So now we both work close to our flat. I am a talkative person and I do speak to people at work but this is a new job (less than 1 month) so I do not have a concrete friendship group in the city yet. My old city where my friends are  is approx 3 hours away whereas my mom lives 4 hours in the opposite direction. Meanwhile my boyfriends friends and family live between 20 minutes and 2 hours away now.

I enjoy living with him and he is very loving  but I feel like our routine is just: come back from work, cuddle only the sofa (maybe) , clean the house, prepare food, have a shower, go to bed. He isn't the best at making plans and I know he doesn't like to spend much money. I know this because last year when we were long distance he did not want to go out with me much buy preferred to stay in. I wouldn't mind, however, for the past four weeks he has agreed to plans with his friends where he is going to London, on big nights out ect which are not cheap and I am not invited to. He doesn't plan dates with me on the weekdays either, and ones that do happen seem to be a bit of an afterthought when nothing else is planned because he is happy to sit on the sofa and watch TV with me whilst I want to get out into the city, go to bars ect. I have had friends from my old city down here occasionally and I am trying to build my network here but I feel that his knowledge of his  already burgeoning social network, financial stability and proximity to friends and family compared to mine at the moment is really obvious. 

The past few weeks I have just been really lonely sitting in the flat. I have had a friend come visit from my old city once and I do try and make an effort and go to my old city, but I find it hard when my job is so inflexible and struggle to find somewhere to stay, meanwhile, he can stay at his family's place whilst also see his friends and he has a very very flexible and stable job.  

Sorry this is long, I do not want to be unreasonable but I'm not sure if I am. I just do not know if this is for me anymore. I want to be with someone who wants to plan exciting dates with me and explore the city together on the weekend where I have time to dress up, not rushed on a weeknight when he is out with his buddies on most weekends recently. Also I have tried to plan fun dates before but he never wanted to spend money (last year) so I was content to stay in at the time as a student with little money (whilst he was at a good job starting his career).

When I had sex with him I was faking orgasms to please his ego and a lot of other stuff.

Now in my current relationship, I learnt what making love is. But sometimes I faked orgasms because I was used to do it to please my bf. It’s not that I was in pain and faked it, I liked it but didn’t had an actual orgasm. 
My bf knows my past because he helped me a lot to face my traumas.

My question is, should I tell him that I faked it sometimes and explain him why? Or no?
I don’t know
I really feel the need to, because now I relearn myself, my needs in sex, learning to love my body after the abuse and how to receive pleasure and I don’t want to ever fake an orgasm again to pleasure someone else.

So I started university a few months ago, and made some great new friends. The girl in question (we’ll call her X) is a friend of aforementioned friends, so we have interacted and gotten along quite well. However, I never really sensed any sort of romantic vibes from her or anything - I felt a friendship developing if anything. 

Alas, two weeks ago, as university students do, we went clubbing. I ended up dancing with X for a bit - again platonically, didn’t make any moves, nothing - and after we had finished and found our way back to our friends, X came up to me, leant up, and gave me a kiss. Not on the cheek though, on the lips, which is what is sending me for a loop. 

As I am sure you can understand, I am rather confused:

It’s not as if X charged at me, mouth agape and tongue flapping, all but exclaiming her desperate desire to have at me - as some people my age do. 

It’s not as if she gave me an innocent peck on the cheek - a simple platonic gesture.

I did not see X for the rest of the week after we walked back from the club that night, and this week we had a break to go home, I don’t have socials or number so we haven’t spoken since that night two weeks ago.

Of course, there is the tricky dynamic of X being good friends with my new friends, though my friends seemed to be encouraging it, they were, however, quite drunk.

So I turn to you, Reddit! Is this merely me overthinking a simple peck? Or, perhaps, is a new romance waiting in the wings?!

Give me your advice friends, and I shall implement it!

I feel guilty even typing this, I love her but i worry for her and stuff.

We have been dating for like 2 years, and she has lots of issues with anxiety and focusing and stuff like that. I also deal with anxiety but not nearly to her extent.

But she doesnt really have anything going on. She has never had a job, never lived away from her parents, doesnt have a drivers license, is only taking 1 online class over a semester, and im pretty sure im the only person she talks to outside of her family.

And she has lots of trouble just dealing with normal stuff everyone has to go through. Like the last time she went to the dentist just for a routine appointment she ended up leaving because she got so scared and was crying.

Ive tried to help her and push her a little bit to do some stuff, but it doesnt really work.

She is very kind and loving, but i dont really know what to do to help her or if i can. She has a therapist and stuff.

But in May i will graduate from college and will probably end up somewhere else in the state. And i dont know if i can really keep things going so easily. 

I feel like i kind of need something else, but jesus christ, i feel like i am one of her biggest supports. I would feel like a monster if I had to leave her to just keep having her day to day laying in bed, living with her family who she has problems with, and not really engaging at all with the outside world.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7531740,public,self,I (22m) worry about my gf(21f) since she doesnt do much day to day,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytmykz/i_22m_worry_about_my_gf21f_since_she_doesnt_do/,all_ads,6,,

Could he stick to therapy? Could he change? I just remember how happy he made me when he wasn't having an outburst and I really miss that. Also I feel like I'm the one hurting him and I love him very much, it hurts to see him like this.

I have it set up so that they are directly handed off to the mail carrier on route, which is usually the guy (M3?) in question. (We can call him J.) So we've had face to face interactions 2-3 times a week for the last year. We're on a first name basis, and we sometimes chat about our weekends and other simple stuff. 

Recently I realized that I have a stupid, butterflies in the stomach type of crush on him. This is significant because I don't really get crushes like this often. I'm not really sure if he's also feeling it, but I suspect he might? When we first met, he seemed kind of quiet and shy, but over time things warmed up and now it feels like we both spend our entire interactions smiling. But it is possible I'm just optimistically reading into things. 

If this was out in the wild I would've asked him out directly by now, so courage isn't an issue. The issue is that it is *so* not cool to ask someone out when they're working, because of the additional pressure to be 'nice' to customers. It could make things uncomfortable for him, which is the last thing I want.

A potential 'minimal pressure"" approach I've thought of: every year for the holidays I give all the mail carriers gift cards as a thank you. I was thinking I could put in an extra paper note in his card envelope that says something like: *Hey J, I know this is strange but I didn't want to put you on the spot when you're at work. I wanted to ask you if you would want  to get drinks with me sometime. If you're interested, my number is _____. If you're not, you could 100% pretend you never saw this and I'll totally play along.* But again, I'm not sure if that would be an issue. 

Basically, I'm asking for advice on this: would it be appropriate to ""shoot my shot"", given the circumstances? If yes, is there any insight on how to tactfully approach this situation? Or is this a boundary that I straight up shouldn't touch?
