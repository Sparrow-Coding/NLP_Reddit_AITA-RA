He was in a 4 year relationship in high school and they broke up a year into college after she cheated on him. He was very sad but I would say that made us really close. Since there was no girl, he would spend a lot of time with the guys and me as well. I would go to his job often (he works as a tow truck driver) and he would go to my job (I work in my building as security), and all was fine. I think we really started getting closer when the pandemic hit because she broke up with him at the end of 2019.

Anyways, for 2 years now, he's been single and it's just been vibes, him coming over to my work having a good time watching sports games ordering food and I'm with him at his job helping him tow cars. But he recently became friends and are now dating with his middle school friend. And I'm happy for him. It's a long distance relationship (she lives in Houston and he lives in nyc) but him and her make it work and I'm glad that they do.

Only problem is this has created a massive drift in our friendship where I would say 96 97% of his time is now all on her. And it's kind of annoying to me: not the girl cause I get it, I had a girlfriend before that I used to spend a lot of time with, but I wouldn't just ignore people.

Now, I barely hear from him, it's like one or two texts everyday. Dudes always on FaceTime so not like he doesn't see the message. He stopped showing up to my work, and he's stopped inviting me to his tow truck jobs even when they  are close.

There was this one time where there was a tow to NJ I think and I was on the way and he asked me and I said yes; and literally when he was like 3 blocks away from my home, he was like never mind, me and her have a FaceTime date eating churros. And I'm like bruh, I got ready and even went downstairs excited to see him and dude bails on me. That really pissed me off and this dude rarely even apologizes.

What annoys me too, is that everytime there's a problem between him and his girl, I would be getting multiple voice notes explaining the situation, and here I am helping him. But dude rarely has a convo with me cause he never responds whenever I text something interesting . And it's gotten to the point where I don't really enjoy telling him stuff cause it's like he's hypnotized. 

There's this other friend who lives in Washington state that I've gotten pretty close to, ironically introduced by my friend and he are going on trips together and just good vibes.

3 months ago I found out she was talking and sharing pictures with one of my own best friends. We broke up and I hadn’t seen her in two months. I’d finally started to entertain the idea of getting over her until one day she texts me. She told me how much she loved me and cared about me and how horrible she felt. She told me she wanted to move in together and one day get married and have kids and grow old and die together. 

Fast forward to this last week. She started acting strange and distant. I asked her friend about what was going on with her and that’s when her friend showed me a post on my ex’s instagram of her and the very friend she cheated with the first time from not even two days ago, they were holding hands in the picture.

I’m a 30 year old female, he’s 28.. for those who want to know that bit of information.
Our first year together he was very attentive, reassuring, and just overall put forth that effort a partner does.. over the last two years it has gradually gotten to a point where I find myself daydreaming about what it’s like to have one of those partners that tells you they miss you when you’re away, plans dates, shows eagerness in wanting to do things, and actually shows genuine forms of support or care.. if that makes sense..
It’s not that he’s just cold and rude and treats me like shit. 
We watch movies together, get take out, and just typically sit around. Which is a form of intimacy, and for some people that’s really the only way they’ve ever known to express it..

It would just be nice for once to be told “I miss you”, or have my hand held randomly, maybe even a hug, a stare into my eyes, a reassurance, anything.. 

I don’t think he knows how to do those things. I honestly don’t even know, bc he is a very shut off person.. 
trying to talk to him usually ends up in him shutting down completely and not talking to me for hours or even days at a time. 
Currently I haven’t talked to him since Friday morning. The last time he did this it lasted a week and mentally fucked with me so much to the point I drove myself crazy crying and just being flat out depressed. This time, I’m just more pissed that someone could do that to their partner.. but that’s emotional immaturity for you. 

I just feel like at this point, maybe if someone isn’t on your love language wave length then it’s best to move on bc if not, you’ll constantly feel something is missing.

I’ll start with some context. I’m sorry if it’s  a rather inappropriate topic.

I met my girlfriend online just over a year ago and we have been together long distance ever since, we have not met up in person yet but really plan to. We video call every night and almost every day. I absolutely adore and love her, but recently some things have been digging at me. It feels like her sex drive has completely shut off.

We are very, very open about our kinks and going back to the start of us meeting we had great sexual calls, almost every week or few times a week we would have a great time through the phone. We eventually were so comfy with each other that we did it with the camera on, but now that’s all gone. It’s now reduced to what feels like a one sided game where I am constantly horny for her but she doesn’t feel the same. 

For those who are gonna ask, yes I have spoke to her multiple times about how I feel. I’m straight up honest with her and tell her when I’m feeling horny, but it’s usually brushed off or it seems to put her in a foul mood, and I just feel ashamed bringing it up to her after. Her reasoning is that she doesn’t enjoy touching herself anymore and that it feels gross and she’d rather do it for real, but yet I know she has multiple sex toys even one she bought relatively recently like months ago. She doesn’t let me do it by myself either and I don’t enjoy doing it alone anyways so I feel really stuck. My worst fear is that she is no longer attracted to me but she still compliments me time to time, but no where near how it was at the start. It hasn’t completely disappeared, we still talk about naughty stuff and I guess she still shows some interest but it literally never leads to anything.

I understand completely if she feels like she wants to do it in person only, and feels dirty doing it because I feel the same way sometimes, but it’s been so long that I just want to please her. At a certain point I think it’s worth it and it doesn’t really feel gross. 

I just find it scary that I am struggling really bad with this but she seems relatively unbothered that we don’t do anything. I have also have this horrible gut feeling that she could be cheating on me because of the lack of interest, and recent splurging of clothes but I know that’s just my self esteem making me think the worst. She has never shown any real signs of cheating and lying to me outside of my own paranoid thoughts. When I did bring up one night if she’d ever lie to me, she called me a hypocrite for saying that I didn’t want her to lie and I was balling my eyes out. She called me a hypocrite because I have lied about minor stuff in the beginning of our relationship but I owned up to all of it.

I thought I’d mention that we do have our arguments sometimes and we have had some really bad ones relating to this topic. So everything is definitely not picture perfect between us but we still get along and do good with each others company.

So, I’ve come here for some outside input and general advice. I love this girl with all my heart and I wish to marry her, we’ve talked about spending the rest of our lives together and starting a family. I trust that she still loves me and still wants our relationship to prosper, but my own head won’t keep me away from all these negative thoughts.

the parents of his teenage gf dont know, and my gf has been mentally and emotionally drained since she found out. ironically we knew that he had been seeing someone since we found some disturbing things poorly hidden in his bedroom (condoms, lube, things of that nature). we did not know that she was thirty years his junior. we would not have made so many jokes if we did lol.

Dating for 4 months. How do I tell him? Is this possible to overcome?)

Met my bf during an internship. I was very insecure about being an intern from the start as it took me an extra year to get my degree and my internship started after I had graduated (some other interns had also graduated but most were sophomores/juniors in college). Some other interns even made fun of those who had graduated, so it didn’t help my anxiety/embarrassment. 

I have severe anxiety, which in large part is why it took me so long to get my degree. I’m normally not good at making friends or talking to people, and I’m so scared to ask for letters of recommendation/references that it’s hard for me to get a real job. I know I have a problem. I have tried and am trying so hard to fix it, and I hate that it’s led me to this point, but here we are. 

Basically, he is 20m and I am 24f. He knew I had just recently graduated, but assumed it was this May instead of last august (I had also sort of dodged the question every time it had come up with others, but I did tell people I was a bit older.  I said I was 23 (had just turned 24 and honestly just felt weird). That was obviously wrong but I figured I’d only see these people for x amount of time for the internship and then never again so who cares what they think. To clarify, my boss knows when I graduated and such, it’s just some of my coworkers who thought I was a year younger.

This guy has pursued me very hard from the start. I’ve never experienced anything like that and was a bit overwhelmed by it. I liked him a lot and told him I didn’t know if I wanted to pursue anything for a variety of reasons, one being the short amount of time together and the other the age difference. He said as long as I don’t feel weird about it it’s not weird and he doesn’t care. We never talked about age so I thought he thought I was 23 since our mutual work friends thought that/it really didn’t matter. I also didn’t think it was that serious/going to last so I didn’t know if humiliating myself by admitting my mistake was even worth it. 

I meant to clarify things before I met his family, but he rushed me into meeting them and I didn’t end up doing it. Then he told my family I was 22, without ever even asking my age.  I don’t know what to do. Our relationship was unsteady for a while and I didn’t know if I wanted to continue it. Now we have and I feel like it’s been far too long for him referring to me as 22/me not saying anything for it to even be forgivable. We have been dating for 4 months and his entire family thinks I’m 22, he said he loves me and wants me to move in with him (which I couldn’t possibly do until he knows the truth). And honestly we haven’t had sex in part because I can’t bring myself to do it without him knowing my real age. I don’t want him to think I’m taking advantage or anything either. 

And honestly I do love him. I feel absolutely terrible about this and it’s eating away at me. I don’t want to hurt him or break up but I feel like both are inevitable because I fucked up. And his family loves me but are prob gonna hate me now.

She knew i really wanted to go to.

Things have been pretty well the last month though, we've moving forward and we've both been pretty happy.

We spoke about the trip and she said it would be for the best if I didn't go as her housemates supported her through our breakup and she didn't want the trip to be weird as her friends are apparently not too fond of me right now due to her hearing her side of the story. I said I was a little upset because it was meant to be something that she invited me to and that we were going together but she still wanted to go without me. We've both been avoiding talking about the trip but it will be in a few days and she still hasn't said anything.

Even though I said to her it was fine for her to go, I'm still really upset that I'm not allowed to go and she plans to go without me. I just feel like I can't really be bothered anymore. I feel like she said I couldn't go and stuck to her guns even though it would've been fine if I went as her friends (before the breakup) really liked me. If it were me, after knowing things were going well I would have smoothed it over with my friends.

I just don't know what to do and haven't been able to organize my thoughts.

So, I (20F) am paralyzed chest down completely, so I don't feel anything below my chest. And, I have been seeing my bf (28M) for a few months, and we have been having sex for awhile now.

I usually don't really like the ""doggystyle"" because I don't really get stimulated during it unless he touches my breasts or something. I learned that I like sex for the mood, kissing, and all even without much stimulation there, so I prefer missionary. But, my bf told me that the doggystyle is his favorite because of the view and all. So, we've been starting with missionary and ending with the doggysyle.

Usually he wrap things up before he puts back on my back and cuddle. But this time, I just wanted to cuddle so I kind of pulled him close, and I noticed that he didn't have any condoms on. So I kind of freaked out and asked him where it was, and he said he took it off quickly after. I was still suspicious, so I asked to see it, and he refused, and when he finally showed it, it was empty. I freaked out because I was sure he came. I wanted to be angry at him for doing that, but I wanted to deal with the situation first, so I asked him to go get the plan B.

But then a bit later, he said that there is no need, and he didn't come inside me. I kept insisting because I was sure he did, then he admitted that he was doing it in my butt and he said ""I'm sorry. I usually finish outside."" So, apparently, he had been having anal sex with me without asking me.

I was so shocked and got angry, so I asked him how could he do that without asking me and all. And, he said it didn't occur to him to ask because I wouldn't feel it anyway and it wouldn't hurt me like other girls. And, he keeps saying he didn't think it was a big deal, and I should've told him if that was off limit in advance. 

He promised that he wouldn't do it again, and he's sorry and all. But, I really don't know what to do now. I haven't told him yet, but I'm thinking about even breaking up with him. But, he keeps being like ""I don't get why it's a big deal when it literally makes no difference. I wish you told me that it was off limit if it was becahse I would've avoided it if I knew. But, I'm sorry if you feel that way, and I won't do it without asking."" I haven't slept with him again since then, and he even asked to let him keep doing it because we've done it like that already during our arguments. But, now I'm thinking about what he could have done without telling me and maybe he hasn't gotten caught yet.

Was *not* looking for a husband but I fell in love with him and here we are, in our 30s with jobs and a mortgage and even a kid [6F].

I had some things happen all at once.  I was hit on by a partner at a law firm excessively, I had a second trimester miscarriage, and my dad left my beloved stepmom for someone my age all in the same year.  2 years earlier I lost my mom to PTSD.  Since then, I've dealt with mental health issues including suicidal ideation and alcohol abuse.   I have never denied that any alcohol abuse is my fault.

My grandmother, who was basically a mother to me, had a stroke.  My dad and I don't speak (as well as what he did to my stepmom, he was very abusive).  My grandmother was my protector.  My safe place.  After her stroke, I lost my mind.  I drank myself almost to death over the course of two weeks.  I was in detox in the hospital.  Because of Covid (this was a tear ago)  I could not have any visitors.  Detox was physically and emotionally painful and not seeing my husband and child was... too much.  I had nightmares always.  So when a psychiatrist asked me how I was, I said I was okay but I needed to get home to my family.  I'm his opinion I seemed sad (no shit) so he committed me to the psych ward.  No one told me of my statutory rights to object.  I was there 10 days (by law I SHOULD have had a hearing after 3 days but was not given one)  listening to stories of people who had attempted suicide, who were addicted to heroin and crack.  I put in a persona of who I knew they wanted to see.  I heard and saw a lot of traumatic shit.  I wanted to just read in my room but that would show that I was ""depressed"" and disengaged from the world.  So I played the game and got out as soon as possible. This was the longest I'd ever gone without seeing my husband and without seeing my daughter.

When I got out, I was different.  I had to turn my emotions off and be a robot.  I had to survive.  It took me time after getting out to feel anything again.  Part of me even missed my horrible surroundings.  It's been a year and I thought I was back to normal.  But my husband says I'm not.  He says I'm not affectionate.  He thinks I'm cold.  He thinks I feel nothing.  He's hurt and upset.

I am in therapy and we are discussing couples therapy.  But I think I've realized I like being a little colder, because the pain doesn't hurt as much that way.  I also think what the state did to me was traumatizing.  I have nightmares I'm back in the psych ward.  I have moments in life where I think I'm back there.  I've considered moving to another state where there is less ""help"" for mental health.  I'm scared to express any emotion because being sad that I couldn't see my husband got me locked up for 10 days with no due process.

My therapist is trying to help but part of me thinks being vulnerable is a weakness that can be exploited.  I was not in the psych ward long, relatively, but it hardened me.  Is it possible to go back to being a normal person?

Has anyone experienced this?

She knew i really wanted to go to. About a month later, we went through a pretty rough patch, and ended up breaking up for a few days &amp; pretty rocky for a few weeks, in which we both said some pretty mean things to each other that were both still trying to make up for. Things have been pretty well the last month though, we've moving forward and we've both been pretty happy.

We spoke about the trip and she said it would be for the best if I didn't go as her housemates supported her through our breakup and she didn't want the trip to be weird as her friends are apparently not too fond of me right now due to her hearing her side of the story. I said I was a little upset because it was meant to be something that she invited me to and that we were going together but she still wanted to go without me. We've both been avoiding talking about the trip but it will be in a few days and she still hasn't said anything.

Even though I said to her it was fine for her to go, I'm still really upset that I'm not allowed to go and she plans to go without me. I just feel like I can't really be bothered anymore. I feel like she said I couldn't go and stuck to her guns even though it would've been fine if I went as her friends (before the breakup) really liked me. If it were me, after knowing things were going well I would have smoothed it over with my friends. She was meant to be coming round tonight but I think I'm going to make an excuse to not see her as I want some space and time to myself. Not sure what to do or how to feel here.

But there’s this one issue that just won’t stop bothering me… 

His ex-friends with benefits (who he’d been sleeping with for about 1 year in 2015) is living at his father’s house and in my boyfriend’s old room. She’s employed, financially stable, and doesn’t need to mooch off my boyfriend’s dad. Years after he broke off their “situationship” (which he ended because he found her terribly irritating and selfish) she’s still in love with him. Oh, and she claims to be friends with my boyfriend’s dad…

Even before she moved into his dad’s house she constantly invited herself over, for holidays and even Father’s Day. It’s my understanding that she has a good relationship with her parents and family… so why does she continue to insert herself into my boyfriend’s extended family circle?! 

My boyfriend’s dad has a difficult time making friends his own age. He’s retired, unmarried, not dating, and doesn’t have many friends to begin with so I think he doesn’t say “no” to her because he wants the companionship. 

It shouldn’t bother me, but it does because my boyfriend’s close with his dad. I also understand it’s not my house so I don’t have much say on who lives there, but the entire arrangement makes me pretty uncomfortable. I feel like she’s just waiting around for him to leave me with the hopes he’ll pick her.

I’ve expressed my discomfort to my boyfriend and he’s explained this to his dad. His dad refuses to see the validity in my feelings and will not take me seriously. He thinks I should “just get over it.” 

I’ve shared this with friends, family, and my therapist. Everyone agrees the whole thing is messed up and that a lot of boundaries have, and continue to be crossed. 

I’m madly in love with him, so I get why she wants to be with him. But I can’t imagine waiting this long, being this desperate, and living in the kid bedroom in the father’s house of a man who doesn’t want me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7552666,public,self,Previous Situationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvnigp/previous_situationship/,all_ads,6,,,

I’ll use girl 1 for the aggressor and girl 2 for her gf.

I’m semi friends with them and I don’t really know the full story, this is just my perspective from what I’ve witnessed living with them for almost half a year.

They’ll have weeks where they’re really cute together and everyone is happy. To me girl 1 has always been extremely nice and courteous. Sometimes girl 1 seems to just snap and becomes totally different. She seems to not really have anything to be mad at the other one for, rather, it’s more like she wants to argue and is looking for something to argue about.

I overhear their arguments (not because I want to but because our apartment literally has zero soundproofing). Girl 1’s arguments don’t seem coherent, she just becomes like viscous and starts attacking her poor girlfriend personally. I’ve heard some really degrading shit being said to her.

I feel really bad because girl 2 is honestly one of the sweetest and kindest girls I’ve ever met, she’s really intelligent and I’ve never heard her raise her voice. Meanwhile girl 1 is just shouting and swearing at her saying really nasty things and she just remains calm trying to defend herself but she struggles because the arguments being thrown at her are just so aggressive. She’ll try to respond to an argument but she’ll get overwhelmed because girl 1 will just move on to something.

I just ran into girl 2 in the kitchen after they were arguing for a few hours (girl 1 went to her room). Her eyes looked like she was crying and she was exhausted. She apologized to me for how loud the argument was and her voice was quiet and almost shaky. My heart broke for her.

I feel like this relationship will fall apart on it’s own and I know it’s not my place/responsibility but idk I just feel so bad for girl 2. Maybe I’m missing something major, maybe girl 2 did something to start it but so far I haven’t witnessed that. 

I’ve witnessed verbal abuse in my family and this definitely checks out.

I’m thinking of speaking to girl 2 privately but at the same time I don’t want to risk girl 1 finding out and start shit with her.

We met as friends at work and of course I’ve already put down boundaries to make sure I’m not letting anything slide. 


My (28m) partner(25f) and I have been together on and off for a year. It’s been turbulent at times because she’s put me on two breaks and broke up with me for 2 months to “find herself” (aka go on tinder, sleep with another guy, flirt with a bunch of people) then she comes back to me and we’re together now. 

The thing is, I met someone new and we’ve been talking for a couple weeks. As it seems right now, we’re extremely similar, and the way we talk is emotionally much more fulfilling. I have felt much more fulfilled in that regard and I have been able to focus on work much easier because I’m not constantly focusing on the fact that my partner does not emotionally fulfill me in any way besides occasionally calling me cute or that she loves me. I feel that I may have forced the relationship to begin with, and now that I’m at this point I almost feel as if the things she did in our break up are things I can’t get past, if I’m being honest. 

I don’t know, maybe this new person is just a sign that there are better people who will emotionally fulfill me in that respect. I just feel that even after begging my gf to give me more emotional fulfillment, I am not getting what I need. And it sucks because I do love her, but i just think that we’re too different in regards to our love, and she says that she “cant change” how much she does because it’s just who she is. Which is stupid because all I need is her to be more encouraging and complimentary to me, nothing huge. But it’s TOO much for her, and the fact that I have to tell her to get her to say anything just kills me. 

And before you say what do I do for her? Besides flowers, massages, dates, gifts, emotionally fulfillment because I listen to her love languages, surprising her, giving her whatever she needs and being dutiful in things she wants me to do for her. She doesn’t do the same for me, and I think I’m realizing that I need the same energy if I’m gonna be fulfilled in a relationship at all. 

So my question is, how do I handle this? Do I talk with my gf and tell her how I’m almost at my end with her if she doesn’t get her shit together, or do I just call it quits? I think I want to discuss it with her but I don’t know.

One the group members posted about making music and since I make music as well we had a discussion about such. We ended following each other on IG. No big deal. Just acquaintances. 

She also began posting her food business in the group as well. The food looks great. I decided today to hit her up about getting a plate. We exchange messages about the order and what time it’ll be delivered. It was at this time that she revealed that her husband would be dropping off the food. Again, no problem because we’ve been nothing but plutonic. I found it a little odd she never mentioned him but whatever.

Fast forward to this evening I tell her how great the food was and how she and her husband should start a food truck. She asks for a review on her page and I gladly oblige. Again all friendly and professional.

He was not very satisfied with the answer and said that it’s maybe a generational thing and that his generation values friendship more than the older generations.

He moved to go college 2 hours away from our hometown where we met and started dating and i moved to a city about 2 hours away from our hometown the opposite direction. He is about to graduate college and is looking for/accepting full time real life jobs in his college town area which is currently 3.5 hours from me. I have a full time job myself and it’s really hard to spend time together considering he’s in school and working 40 hours a week and i work 40 hours a week. When he started applying for jobs to take as soon as he graduated i was kind of expecting him to also apply to some in my city considering he’s the one that’s about to move on to his next chapter and i already have an established position and life here and am not actively seeking a step forward if that makes sense. Like he’s the one about the graduate and take a new stop forward so i figured that would mean having the choice to relocate to me to make our relationship more practical like we’ve talked about for years. But now that the time is coming (he’s accepting a position up there THIS week) i feel like he never even thought about our future. I understand doing what’s best for you and putting yourself first sometimes but it’s also not really practical when you’re in a long distance relationship and have talked about continuing having the relationship.

But i feel like it’s valid for me to want to have that conversation! It just feels like it’s never the right time. I really don’t know what to do from here.

We love each other a lot and we have truly seen each other at our worst. 

I knew from the beginning that he had quite conservative views - as my parents would say he’s an “old soul” which I honestly agree with. I didn’t really see it as an issue because it was never an issue within our relationship and frankly I can’t honestly say what my “political” beliefs are since I just don’t really care for politics but I do share some conservative and liberal opinions (the perks of growing up in a very conservative household in the 21st century! lol). 

Things started to “change” for me about a year ago due to his continuous stupid comments/remarks from time to time. For instance whenever he gets road-rage he will almost always make a racial or homophobic slur, or just judge women (sometimes men) for what they wear. I will always tell him to not say those things and that its immature but he will always just laugh it off and tell me its just a joke. For the most part, I know it is a joke and he genuinely wouldn’t hurt a fly, and unfortunately I am quite conditioned to that type of behaviour growing up with a dad that acts the same way. Plus my bf works in the trades and I know the “trade culture” can be a bit ruthless at times when it comes to this sort of thing, so i’ve aways brushed it off because he does so much for my family and I. He is the type of guy that would give the shirt off his back for someone and always has a smile on his face. 

However the one thing that really bothered me was that my (super left-wing-hippy-lesbian) sister got a haircut which was super short (wolf haircut if you know what that is), and I thought it looked so good with her curly hair because it truly suits her. However, when it was just my bf and I alone together he said “im going to be honest, your sisters hair is so fucking ugly”. And in that moment for some reason it just finally clicked, we just do not look at things the same way. Its like he just doesn’t fucking get it sometimes. 

His stupid slurs are one thing - just immature and a turnoff, but sometimes he just can’t SEE the bigger picture. The deeper meanings. The beauty in anything!! Sometimes it honestly feels like we are living in two different worlds but its hard because with all things said we actually have a good and healthy relationship, and I know it is possible to be with someone who has different views. It doesn’t make it any better that the thought of breaking up with him sends me into a spiral either… 

On one hand he has such admirable great qualities and truly makes it known that he loves me, but on the other hand he can be so immature and utterly toxic-male.

Justin and I have always had problems in our relationship. Even when we were kids it was very apparent he only cared about fulfilling his own needs.

He often pressured me into doing thing that made me uncomfortable (underaged drinking, smoking weed, dumb dangerous decisions, ect) and would either guilt trip me, make fun of me, or get aggressive with me until I ultimately gave in. Literally nobody that knew him back in school liked him (not even his own family sometimes) - he always tried to play the ""nobody likes me because I'm so different/smart/superior"", but it couldn't be more obvious that his life is sad. He's an adult now, can't keep a job for longer than 6 months (he's been fired for skipping work, stealing, being drunk on the job, ect), has never had a serious relationship, and he spends his entire paycheck on weed. His life is basically nothing but smoking weed and longboarding like we did when we were in high school. He also still lives with his parents. 

The thing is - I decided years ago that I didn't want to be Justin's friend anymore. It was becoming obvious that he was resentful of the fact that I was growing up, setting boundaries, and that my life was going place but his wasn't. In the past he tried to talk me into dropping out of college, ending literally every relationship ive ever been in even though they were healthy, and drinking again even though he knows I quit completely. I've tried to create distance and limit contact, hoping that he would move on with his life and that we could avoid conflict. Keep in mind, I've tried many many times to set boundaries and talk about our issues - all he does is get more mad, more resentful, more agressive, and treats me worse. 

Last week he texted me out of the blue after us not talking for 6+ months. He told me his brother had run away and nobody knew what happened. I decided not to respond, because I felt like me getting involved was just going to make separating even harder on both of us. After a week of me not responding, he texted me cussing me out. He told me I was a terrible friend and that he never wanted to see me again. In alot of ways I'm relieved that our relationship is hopefully finally over (I have my own things to focus on, and the truth is that he was extremely abusive to me. He was violent at times, always bumming money and never paying it back, never respecting my boundaries, putting my personal safety in danger, sabotaging my happiness, and so much more.) But part of me feels bad, because I know he's going through a lot with his brother. He's always been someone that I believe used mental illness as a crutch - he threatens to heurt himself/unalive himself over literally everything, even if it's just a small inconvenience. I guess years of going through this has made me feel responsible for his well-being, and I can't stop worrying that what I've done is going to drive him over the edge. But no matter what happens, I think it's better that out relationship doesn't continue. He's consistently shown me he has no intention to change - if anything, he's just getting worse as time goes on.

So what does everyone think? Am I a bad friend for not helping Justin during this rough time in his life - or should I stick by my boundary and continue cutting contact?

This was a summer job, but I still saw/heard about him every once in a while as he still works with my mom and she was kind of a mentor to him and friend. Fast forward 6 years I am now working with him part-time (in May full-time) as I am graduating with my masters and he would like me to join his team to lead a finance department. He is now married 4 years with 3 kids and I am currently living with my serious boyfriend. My boyfriend has brought to my attention that he doesn't really like the idea of us going to lunch together and paying (just us 2) as it doesn't give a good image and can be disrespectful. We've talked it out and moved on but I wanted to share this situation to reflect and hear other's opinions. One, I told him Mark and I go back quite a bit and I honestly consider him a family friend (considering the relationship with my mother) he not just a random guy, two we do get along quite well because we are around the same age (22 and 26), three if we ever eat alone, it because the project we were working on was just, for example whenever we finish a work meeting/project he usually always invites everyone to lunch and pays, but in some cases it is just us who had a meeting. I do not believe I get any different or special treatment from him and I have never felt any inappropriate or uncomfortable actions from him either. Is my point valid, because I understand where my bf is coming from but I am also trying to show him it is a bit of a unique situation? Also please feel free to share things I could do to be better about this situation.

Edit: He also is my ""boss"" because he is the owner of the company and pays me but really we work like colleagues.

I was very insecure about being an intern from the start as it took me an extra year to get my degree and my internship started after I had graduated (some other interns had also graduated but most were sophomores/juniors in college). Some other interns even made fun of those who had graduated, so it didn’t help my anxiety/embarrassment. 

I have severe anxiety, which in large part is why it took me so long to get my degree. I’m normally not good at making friends or talking to people, and I’m so scared to ask for letters of recommendation/references that it’s hard for me to get a real job. I know I have a problem. I have tried and am trying so hard to fix it, and I hate that it’s led me to this point, but here we are. 

Basically, he is 20m and I am 24f. He knew I had just recently graduated, but assumed it was this May instead of last august (I had also sort of dodged the question every time it had come up with others, but I did tell people I was a bit older.  I said I was 23 (had just turned 24 and honestly just felt weird). That was obviously wrong but I figured I’d only see these people for x amount of time for the internship and then never again so who cares what they think. To clarify, my boss knows when I graduated and such, it’s just some of my coworkers who thought I was a year younger.

This guy has pursued me very hard from the start. I’ve never experienced anything like that and was a bit overwhelmed by it. I liked him a lot and told him I didn’t know if I wanted to pursue anything for a variety of reasons, one being the short amount of time together and the other the age difference. He said as long as I don’t feel weird about it it’s not weird and he doesn’t care. We never talked about age so I thought he thought I was 23 since our mutual work friends thought that/it really didn’t matter. I also didn’t think it was that serious/going to last so I didn’t know if humiliating myself by admitting my mistake was even worth it. 

I meant to clarify things before I met his family, but he rushed me into meeting them and I didn’t end up doing it. Then he told my family I was 22, without ever even asking my age.  I don’t know what to do. Our relationship was unsteady for a while and I didn’t know if I wanted to continue it. Now we have and I feel like it’s been far too long for him referring to me as 22/me not saying anything for it to even be forgivable. We have been dating for 4 months and his entire family thinks I’m 22, he said he loves me and wants me to move in with him (which I couldn’t possibly do until he knows the truth). And honestly we haven’t had sex in part because I can’t bring myself to do it without him knowing my real age. I don’t want him to think I’m taking advantage or anything either. 

And honestly I do love him. I feel absolutely terrible about this and it’s eating away at me. I don’t want to hurt him or break up but I feel like both are inevitable because I fucked up. And his family loves me but are prob gonna hate me now.

Context: After a dentist appt I decided to surprise my bf with some lunch and flowers + small note for his lunch break. I wrote a note saying to have a good day and some cheesy sentiments.

 Later that night I asked if anyone (coworkers) said anything about it. He said that they asked where it came from and they asked for him to read the note. He then said that he read the note to his coworkers (which that made me a little hurt because I didn't think he'd read that out loud). I got a little butt hurt but then asked how they responded, He said they laughed and faked dry heaved. 

Now, in the moment I felt as though they were laughing at me. I felt hurt because I've been really pushing myself to be more vulnerable and do things like this for him( I just didn't think he'd share it aloud.

I was surprised when my bf said he was annoyed that I got my feelings hurt when his coworkers were laughing at him and making fun of a gushy sentiment. He says that he doesn't know if he should tell me things like this anymore if im just gonna get hurt. He also says that its scary if I can't even show my love like that in public without it being a problem.

But I did this multiple times in a month. This followed many pregnancy like symptoms and a, at the time, late period. I was starting to panic, and be stressed about the possibility for a while.

I assumed if I was already pregnant, it wouldn’t matter if I had sex, and if I wasn’t, we’ll I had been taking my birth control and it was my period week.

I'm a director. Don't speculate - You don't know us. You don't even know our country. 

We've been together for seven years and have become parents recently. That meant less work for her, so I've been making most of the money lately, which I think goes without saying. It really bothers her, though. We live in a country with a complicated system in place for TV and film production, it's all very centralised and tied to state institutions. She hasn't had her big break yet, since she doesn't fit the very narrow type of women that usually gets cast on our television shows (meaning: she's an immigrant). She has been constantly working for thirteen years now, though. 

She's one of the best actresses I've ever worked with. Probably THE best. I've cast her in a project many years ago, which is actually how we got together. We do many projects together, with her in different positions behind the camera as well as occasionally in front of it. I completely depend on me and her being a team, artistically. We've managed, over the years, to carve out our own independent niche apart from the national industry. 

Never having gotten a lot of validation from the official apparatus has always been grating on her, though. Now, I've directed a program for a state-funded station and I've asked her to play a lead role. I got her past the station heads, who approved of her based on many samples of her varied work. 

The project was difficult for her, because it was linguistically challenging and she's not a native speaker (which most people don't realise when they hear her speak) but she did a beautiful job. Now, the station heads seem to be unhappy with her performance. I didn't talk to them yet, but that's what I was told. 

We don't have secrets, so I, an asshole, told her about what I'd heard. 

She's devastated. She feels humiliated - Having been cast by a director she's in a relationship with, now (to her) seeming like she only got the job because of that (which isn't true - The decision was up to people who don't even know her, I simply suggested looking at her). She also thinks that now for the first time she heard why big roles in state productions don't come her way - Because she's too bad. She says she'll give up acting. 

Having gained weight during her pregnancy, having been home a lot since the birth and a couple of casting rejections have made her be down anyway, lately, but now it's completely out of hand. 

I can't stand the thought of her giving up on a dream she has been fighting for for thirteen years now, collecting impressive credits on the most highly respected stages and TV shows along the way. She's brilliant at her craft, very thoughtful, giving layered, textured performances that I've admired long before getting involved with her personally. But my word doesn't count anymore. The random TV person's, whose name she doesn't even know, does. She's looking at university courses to change jobs. 

I've been telling her how great I think she acted on that show thousands of times. I've edited together clips for her to hear for herself. I'm out of ideas. 

How do you help someone regain their dignity after being humiliated? How do I give her back her confidence? I can't loose her as a creative partner. That would break my heart and destroy everything we've worked so hard for.

I met my best friends Nate and Sam when we were 8 and we have been best friends since. Growing up I developed a crush on Nate but never said anything to anyone. In fifth grade when I was 10 I met Jack and he was more friends with Sam than with me. The next few years we all remained friends and I started to develop a crush on Jack and he did the same for me. My feelings for Nate were still there but he was my best friend and I didn’t want to ruin that. I liked Jack but I loved Nate. Before freshman year started me and Nate kissed and we were each others first kiss. We told eachother how we felt and it was mutual but we knew it wouldn’t work out so we remained friends and I went for Jack. Me and Jack dated for the entirety of high school and broke up after senior year due to him wanting to see other people and I wasn’t good enough. (Bullshit btw he was crying about it for the next year) During this whole time with Jack I still had extreme feelings for Nate and vice-versa. I did cheat on Jack quite a few times with Nate; almost the whole relationship but not for the last year of it.  Me and Nate always said that one day we would be with eachother but now wasn’t the time. We had too much history and friendship to lose. No one ever knew about the cheating, not even Sam. 

When I was 19 me and Jack had reconnected. I had told Nate that now was the time to be with me if he wanted but he was caught up in the new world of women and partying and declined my proposal. I decided to give Jack another chance and we were in a relationship for the next 4 years. This time the relationship was different, we were adults, we communicated better, and we wanted to be a family. We have an adoptive son and built a life together. During this whole time me, Nate, Sam, and Jack were all friends. I suffer from depression and I have my whole life and when I was 21 I had a bad depressive episode that made me have to go back on medication that killed my sex drive. Me and Jack didn’t haven’t sex for six months Bc I just had zero interest. 6 months ago I found out from a neighbors security camera footage that Jack had brought several woman into our home and was seen touching them provocatively. I confronted him about it and he admitted to cheating on me. From the time he had cheated to the time I found out had been 5 months. So he was hiding this from me for 5 months. I had been drinking, I was extremely upset and hurt and I broke up with him and said I would never forgive him. I know I cheated in the past but when we got back together I never once made any advances at Nate or anyone and remained faithful to my relationship. We had a life together we were basically married and have a kid. Him cheating was something I couldn’t ever get over especially that it was random women in my bed while I was trying not to kill myself. 

It’s been 6 months since we broke up and recently all I can think about is Nate. We haven’t talked about our feelings since we were 19 and now we’re more grown and things have changed. He told me the other day that he has always been in love with me and it will never change and we almost kissed but I stopped it and left. I do want to be with him. It feels so right now and mentally I’m doing amazing. But we’ve been best friends for 15 years, and I fear if I mess this relationship up it will ruin our friendship forever.

So we get back together and she's saying that it was all her mom and she couldn't control her and she was fighting her about it. And she even said in text that I never hit her. But eventually I hear her out and want to give her another chance when she comes back. 

Fast forward to now. We're in this situationship where I can't bring her back home because my parents don't want anything to do with her after the accusations. And I dont want anything to do with her mom. So we agree to not tell our families and keep it between ourselves and give our love another chance. Well I find out a few weeks ago that her mom has known the entire time. Which is terrifying itself. But the worst part about it is that when we split she tried to contact my sister to reach out to me. To get back ofc. And during this conversation (trying to get back with me mind you) my sister says she accused me of rape. Well I confront her about this like what you accused me of rape to my sister?? And she confirms in text I never raped her we always consented. She said that my sister must have misinterpretated her (sound familiar?) and that she never used the word rape or forced.

I get back to my sister on this. Sister gives details saying that she said on Halloween (like a year ago) I had raped her in my room. Which did not happen, I had the boys over with her and entire family for Halloween/football game. We were never alone in my room that day, always around people. The only time we were alone together was on a car ride home from another gathering, never alone in my room. I also KNOW my sister is not lying to me....because she is an ACTUAL rape victim. She has no beef with her and doesn't even know Im seeing her still. It just came up randomly and she never told me or anyone of this call from my ex. So ik my sister has 0 hidden motives and is telling the truth here. 

So here we are, I wish my sister told me this info sooner because now I want to run away from this girl.

I haven't even said this out loud to anyone so this feels super scary but I'm so conflicted... here goes!

For context, my best friend of ten years visited me for a few days and crashed at my apartment. We've never had any romantic chemistry and are extremely platonic, but we're super close and supported each other through adolescence and university. He's the closest friend I have. 

One night, we were tipsy and having a deep conversation about friendships - nothing out of the blue. We fall asleep on the bed, and a few hours later, I'm woken up because he's suddenly spooning me with his arms around me. I can tell he's still asleep because he's slightly snoring and murmuring. Then his hands started to inch up, and I swear in that moment my blood ran cold. I never knew the feeling firsthand, but I remember being completely frozen. He was pretty much groping my chest and after a few seconds, I unfroze and slowly crossed my arms firmly and pushed his hands down, careful not to wake him. 

However, his hands started going down to my shorts and I immediately curled up into a ball, frozen again. He did all this while humping against me a few times... as it finally stopped, I inched out of the bed and went to sleep on the couch. In the morning, he acted normal and I was too scared to mention it. I'm guessing he just had a wet dream... and wasn't awake or aware of any of it. 

At the time, I was going through a super rough patch with my now ex-boyfriend. A tiny part of me can't help but think that if my friend was awake, maybe his subconscious took advantage of my vulnerable position. But at the same time, I've known him for a decade and he's the nicest person I know... with no history of anything remotely close to this. I couldn't bring myself to tell my ex-boyfriend because he would be heartbroken, and we were ending the relationship that week anyways. I didn't want to drag him into my mess. 

After my friend left, the situation started processing fully in my mind and I don't feel like the same person anymore. I've been more withdrawn in our interactions, citing my breakup as the reason that I'm shutting out everyone, and feel so guilty about not saying anything because I know it would destroy our friendship. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar before, and how did you move forward? Thank you so much for reading. I already feel a lot less alone just by writing this out.

Going straight to the point: I dislike my wife’s general attitude, way of dealing with problems. I don’t have a good memories to keep all our small fights but heres the last one:

she closed the curtains to prevent the sun from waking her up in the morning. I opened the curtains 5 cm to avoid condensation on the windows. I explained to here that during the winter, the curtains cause more condensation on the windows and it must be avoided by letting some air get between the window and the curtains (window wear, mold, etc.)
results; She hasn't spoken to me for 3 days and she's in a zombie mood. whenever I ask her what's wrong or any other question, she responds coldly to end the conversation.
I don't understand how one can love a person and avoid communication with the person?
every little quibble, it's the same thing, 3 to 7 days turn off. 
We already talked about that and she knows that she has a lot of pride and her communication skills are not good. But i m tired of trying to fix it! I feel like I am the only sunlight in our relationship and the affection dies as soon as i dont give affection!

This post will also be sort of long, so please read all of it.

Information: I am 24M, friend is 20F and I think her husband is 22. I'll call her Amanda and her husband will be called James(not their real names). Amanda and James have been together since high-school. I've known her for about 3 years, and her husband for about 1. I met her through a mutual friend that we played video games with and just kinda built a friendship over time.

Disclaimer: I will be cutting some information out that is relevant to their relationship for privacy reasons and to just avoid potentially exposing them. It isnt central to the actual reason I am posting this so I will keep it under the umbrella of ""relationship issues"" and ""career"" that is just a catch all for anonymity for them and to keep it simple. And no, it's nothing creepy or sexual, it's just that I feel that they have a right to privacy plus the main focus of the post is on mine and Amanda's friendship so yeah.


On to the main part:

Out of the three years I've known Amanda/A, we have gotten along pretty well. It only really ""developed"" into a true friendship over the past couple years.

When we first became friends I would routinely ask her to join a discord call or some voice chat just to catch up and stuff just because she was telling me that she was going through a rough patch with family and that her and James/J were really close to getting into a position to further their career. So, any time I saw her online I wanted to catch up just to make sure Amanda was okay and everything was going okay.

Sortta about a year after we became friends, both Amanda and James were taking the necessary steps to further their career so when she got on again after about 9-ish months, both myself and our mutual friend were excited to catch up cause we had missed both Amanda and James. So, we hopped on a call with her and she was happy to hear from us, needless to say the feeling was mutual so we were hyped for them. We learned they were getting married so all was good.

Skip-forward to earlier this year, it has just been off and on calls over that period and this is when we all started playing together again. And this is when Amanda and I specifically started playing together a lot without our friend or without James. No particular reason other than both of us were enjoying games that they weren't so most of the time we would include them in our calls/parties and they'd just play their games and her and I would play together until we all decided on a game we all enjoyed.

So, this happened for a few months. Just recently she got into a game I particularly enjoyed so I told her I'd play with her and since our friend loved it as well, we said fuck it and the three if us could just have a blast. Now, mind you our friend works opposite hours than we typically do so Amanda and I would play a lot and our 3rd would join us when he could(we can call him Tim).

When Tim wasn't with us, it was just Amanda and I so I assume this kind of formed some kind of bond? Especially since I was the one who was essentially teaching her the game and helping her grow in skill. Mind you, we were already pretty decent friends at the time so it wasn't really anything wierd.

Just over the past I'd say two months specifically it's gotten to be a bit strange for me personally. I do cherish our friendship because I feel as if her being a consistent friend over the three years despite being gone for a few months at a time for her job...it kind of warrants showing that she cares as well.

Well, she starts opening up to me about her relationship issues with James. Mind you, pretty big ones. And every time it was just me listening and doing my best to provide my perspective on it *if* she asked for it. They seem happy all things considered but due to her being as open, it has caused me to feel the need to do the same so I trauma dumped. Yes, feeling heard and listened to did cause me to kind of form a ""crush"" on her simply because she was accepting of it and was willing to activly help me if I needed it. No, I would never jeopardize a friendship let alone someone's marriage in that way so rest assured I put that ""crush"" to rest. If that ever happened I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

The reason I am asking how to handle this is because I feel as if she has formed some form of similar crush and or emotional attachment because of me trauma dumping. The past few months it feels as if she has wanted to spend more time with me than James. Which I can only say worries me because they seem to be happily married despite their relationship issues. She been telling me that she is thinking about leaving him if said issues don't change for the better. I have always told her to talk to him about it but what I get back is that he just shuts down and barely responds when these conversations happen. Which, I understand - I use to do the same thing when someone confronted be about stuff; the issue is she has sent me one or two audio recordings of their talks and she isnt being aggressive or irrational in those ones. Given her personality and temperament I dont think she has ever even considered being aggressive or irrational. She is very level headed and just speaks up when she feels hurt. James just shuts down I guess?

There are other small things that cause me to think this way as well. I know she has bad eating habits but loves to cook. So, she was telling me what she had made and said she wasn't going to eat. I sort of gave her flak for not eating and within a few minutes she came back and said ""Totally didn't eat because of what you said"" but in a tone that was semi-flirtacious, but it could have just been how she said it and wasn't meant to be a flirt. It's also her asking my opinion on outfits she should buy. She doesn't send pictures if her in it, but rather will send me a pic of like a top and a skirt or pants to go with it either from online or laying on a table instore. She has offered to bake me sweets and send them to me. She has offered to buy me things in games that we play. Just to name a few.

Some of these alone I could see any friend doing simply because I buy my friends shit online or ask Tim if he thinks a shirt looks good all the time. But when Tim and I are hanging out without her, I ask if she has said/sent/does the same thing to him and he says no.

How do I proceed with keeping this friendship? As I said I value her as a friend but I feel as if she is beginning to lean on me emotionally. Am I crazy for thinking this? Do I try to take a few steps backwards and if so how do I do it without hurting Amanda and I's friendship? Is it best for me to just cut ties?

Sorry if this seems jumbled and nonsensical, its hard to go super in depth and provide quality details without exposing too much.

I don’t care that she still talks to him but I was curious about what he had told her about our divorce. She told me that he admitted to her that he knows he is a narcissist with a god-complex which yeah, I already knew, but he would never admit it to me. Whatever, no news to me. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

But then he told her something that really stung… Even from the very beginning, like before he married me, he felt like he was settling. 

I guess my question(s) is, if he felt this way then why the hell did he:

1. Ask me to marry him in the first place?

2. Go through with it?

3. Have a kid with me (to lock it in is my guess, cause it’s a lot harder to leave with a kid)?

4. Guilt trip me every time I tried to leave (I mean, if he didn’t really want me anyway, why did he care. Again my thought is it was about control)?

5. Put me through hell when I finally decided I’d had enough, after a decade and a half of not ever feeling good enough?

On the one hand, I actually feel freer knowing this newfound information because it means that no matter what I would have done to try and make it work (I tried everything, marriage counseling, spiritual counseling, prescription pills (for depression and anxiety, imagine that!), agreeing to open the marriage, etc.) or how munch I changed myself (which I did a lot, too much, unfortunately) nothing I could ever have done would have been good enough, because he always felt like he settled. That is such a f*$#%ing relief because it means that it wasn’t really me, it was him. And maybe on some level he knows that (but I doubt it) but at least now I know it. 

On the other hand, it aggravates the hell out of me because WHAT WAS THE DAMN POINT?! Like why would he even put that on me, knowing I would never be good enough in his eyes? Why would anyone do that to anybody? Why settle if you know you’re settling? I it’s don’t get it. It seems dumb on his part, cause dude, don’t you want to be happy? But it seems cruel too. Like he knew I’d never measure up to him (in his opinion, I know I’m awesome) but  goaded me into marrying him anyways. Was it always just a game to him?

My guess is it’s simply because as a narcissist, it made him feel powerful and/or in control to know that he could have me, even though he didn’t want me? It seems rather counterproductive and pretty sad, like why not want to or try to actually be happy?

Don’t get me wrong, I have happily moved on and I’m with an amazing, respectful, kind, fun, awesome human being now, who loves me for exactly who I am, and I love him to death! I asked him if it bothered him that this was bugging me so much and he said no, but he doesn’t understand why I care.

TL;DR : my (20F) ex-best friend gabbie (23F) asked our mutual friend kate (23F) if i was interested in being her friend again. gabbie ditched me at my lowest point after i helped her out of her lowest point. ***i need advice on whether i should talk to gabbie again or not, or if i should just leave it alone.***

i (20F) and my former best friend, gabbie (23F) had been friends since early 2019. gabbie and her husband, mark (23M), had been friends with my boyfriend, zach (21M) since freshman year of high school (circa 2016). before zach and i got together in 2020, i got to meet the aforementioned couple. it's important to the story later on, but they were friends with mark's sister, jade (21F), and her husband, chris (22M).

so to recap and avoid confusion:  
i (20F) and zach (21F) have been dating since 2020.  
gabbie (23F) and mark (23M) are married; zach has been friends with them since 2016, and i since 2019.  
jade (21F) and chris (22M) are married; jade is mark's sister, gabbie's sister-in-law.

now, my boyfriend zach left for basic in sept. 2020 and mark was deployed the same month. gabbie and i became very close during this time. gabbie and i were hanging out almost every day. i helped gabbie through a lot of depression and overall just tried to help her. i'd clean her house while she was at work, did her laundry, and other chores she was too depressed to do. we would throw parties / get-togethers at gabbie's house and would invite a lot of our friends. zach came home for a very brief period of time in december 2020, and me, gabbie, and zach spent some time together for christmas. however, gabbie threw zach a ""going away again"" christmas party that i wasn't invited to. i called gabbie and she said, ""it's because jade doesn't like you and i don't want her to leave."" 

zach leaves again. gabbie and i hang out a lot, more parties / get-togethers, with jade and chris being at these parties. april of 2021, zach comes home for good. gabbie suggests we should go to the beach in july to celebrate. however, while we're on vacay, gabbie gets mad at me for ""being lovey dovey with my boyfriend while her husband is deployed."" i mark this as the downfall of our friendship. things got really awkward after that point, and we started hanging out less and less. gabbie was still throwing parties that i wasn't invited to. when zach noticed the trend of me not being invited, he stopped going, stating ""if op isn't invited, then i'm not coming."" this is when i started getting invited again. it was at this time that jade started becoming really good friends with me. however, it always seemed like gabbie wanted me to leave stating ""oh it's getting late,"" ""you should start heading back to college,"" etc other excuses.

fast forward again to october of 2021. jade and zach start going to the gym together. i didn't mind as i have no interest in going to the gym, and i thought it would be good for zach to have a gym buddy. zach and i started hanging out with jade and chris more as time progressed, even spending the night at jade and chris's house for new years. however, in january of 2022, i got covid and had to be quarantined in my apartment. my boyfriend came over a lot since he also got covid. fast forward a few days later, i see chris in walmart. i say hi to him, and he looks like he's seen a ghost. he says ""i have covid."" and walks away in a hurry. i didn't think much of it, until i got a text from him stating that ""we need to talk."" i mentioned it to my boyfriend, to which he stated that he knew the reason why. it turns out that jade had been making advances on zach, and unfortunately he caved and cheated on me. i told him i appreciated his honesty and that, if he was committed to making our relationship work, i would be willing to give it a try. i do not regret this decision at all. he's changed dramatically, and i really appreciate his efforts. (this post isn't about this, we've already worked things out so don't even comment on this PLEASE.)

so, gabbie reaches out to me just two days after i find out and asks if we wanted to go out to eat together. i said sure, so me, zach, gabbie, and mark head out to dinner. before we walked into the restaurant, zach told me that ""they know about what happened."" i asked them how long they knew, and he said ""the day it happened."" so, not only did zach wait to tell me, not only did chris wait to tell me, but both gabbie and mark knew and didn't tell me. i was the literal last to know. we had the dinner, and it went as well as you would think: super awkward. 

fast forward a few months, gabbie randomly blocks zach. they had still been friends after what happened but all of a sudden weren't. i proceeded to block gabbie. after two years of friendship, it all went down the drain. if she didn't want to talk to zach, then i didn't want to talk to her. i can't help but feel like gabbie helped jade get to my boyfriend. gabbie didn't invite me to events that jade and zach were invited to. gabbie didn't tell me even after she knew. i feel like friends should tell others about their partners cheating. i would have done it for her, so why didn't she do it for me? her excuse was ""she didn't feel like it was her place to tell me,"" which i understand to a degree. i would have rather heard it come from my boyfriend, zach, rather than anyone else. we stopped talking in about may or june of this year 2022. she blocked me on everything (facebook, instagram) after i blocked her on snapchat.

august of this year. i was catching up with a mutual friend of mine and gabbie's, kate (23F). she was asking me how zach and i were, basic life questions, etc. she asked me a specific question that tipped me off. i asked her, ""do you know?"" and she said ""unfortunately yes. gabbie told me everything."" i was instantly pissed. if it ""wasn't her place"" to tell me my boyfriend cheated on me, why does she think it's her place to tell people who weren't even involved? i told kate that i was mad at gabbie for doing that, and explained everything that gabbie had done to me. i helped gabbie while she was depressed and when i was at my lowest, it was ""oh i'm sorry, but it's not my place to tell you."" i told kate i felt betrayed. kate asked if i would ever be friends with gabbie again. i told her, ""probably not."" to which kate replied, ""well you're both invited to my wedding. but you promise you won't make a scene?"" and i told her that i would never make a scene at her wedding. if gabbie was to approach me, i was simply going to turn the other way.

fast forward one more time to tonight. i got another text from kate saying that gabbie was at the hospital having her baby. i told her that i wished gabbie and mark the best. kate said ""i wish we were all still friends so you could be close to (baby name) when he gets here."" i told kate that, although i wasn't interested in being gabbie's friend, if gabbie wanted to talk, her phone number was unblocked. kate then said that gabbie talks about me quite a bit, stating that she wished she hadn't ruined our friendship and wondered if we could be friends again. i told kate that i couldn't make any promises, but i was willing to talk to gabbie. gabbie had been sending me invitations to her animal crossing island for a few months now, but i've ignored every single one (we're still friends on our animal crossing town, which i forgot to remove after everything).

i don't know what to do. i have such mixed feelings about all of this. on one hand, i miss the friendship gabbie and i had. on the other hand, gabbie was toxic and continues to be friends with jade (though it's probably because they are sisters-in-law). she essentially ditched me when i was at my lowest point even though i pulled her out of her deepest depression. i'm sure there were times where i wasn't the greatest friend and i recognize that. i just can't help but feel betrayed by gabbie but also miss our friendship. ***i need advice on whether i should talk to gabbie again or not, or if i should just leave it alone.***",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7552417,public,self,my (20F) ex-best friend (23F) wants to rekindle our friendship.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvmuc7/my_20f_exbest_friend_23f_wants_to_rekindle_our/,all_ads,6,,,
