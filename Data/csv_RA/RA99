Also, thank you for reading in advance. 

Almost 2 years ago, I was constantly trying to make foreign friends to improve my English. I met on one of these sites. Hours passed for both of us and she said she liked my curly hair. I asked for her number and we started a normal friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

I had more than normal friendships with her. We watched movies, played games together, we bought each other gifts, in summary we spent time together (There was a distance between us but I never felt it)

&amp;#x200B;

After a while we liked each other. Since I wanted to spend time with her the most at that time, I also reduced talking to my other foreign friends and it was all over. My English level has improved enough to speak and understand from nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

She came to a famous resort area in my country with her family. From there, she stayed for 1 day with her family to see me in my city.

&amp;#x200B;

I showed her and her family places to visit for 2 days and we had a very good bond. We promised each other that we would meet again, kissed and we both cried as we parted.

I have the numbers of her father and mother. I talk to them from time to time. They saw me and we met, we walked around.

This year, I came to another country for university education. 1.5 months after meeting her. I told her about it too. That I want to invite her here as soon as possible.

She's done this before, but I didn't care that much.(Because we didn't met and not a official couple yet) I no longer use the platform where I met her. At least I wasn't using it. One day something ate my inside and I remembered my account information again and opened my account. I saw her online. There is a 6 hour difference between us and she told me she was going to sleep. Of her time zone, it was 3 o'clock.

She told me she had exams and started writing less and acting colder. I asked this to my friend who is another girl and she said this is normal, sometimes this can happen.

I asked her why she didn't write to me(i asked her if i did something wrong), that I am not as valuable as third parties. She told me that I was someone who needed special attention and time, that she apologized and would try to fix it. I specifically told her that I was new to this country, that their language and culture were different, and that I was really all alone.

During this time, she told me that she needed space and that my long messages were tiring her and life. That's why I'm texting her with long messages.

By the way, since I opened the site, I've written here to men who speak the language of this place.

But what I saw today was even more interesting. When I wanted to call, the girl who didn't send me a photo (even if I sent it) changed her profile photo to a wonderful one on that site.

I can't understand. She has an exam tomorrow, I don't want to disturb her, even if I write a message, I get an answer after hours, but she is always active on the site to write to others. Department of language. Therefore, meeting new people is of course beneficial.

I don't know what to do now. I love her so much, I trust her. But this one breaks my heart.

Back when my girlfriend and I started dating she would always spend more time with her male friend, for now lets call him (n). My girlfriend and I were separated into different classes so we couldn’t spend all class time together but I was fine with that, but whenever I saw her whether it was after school or at lunch she was always talking to (n), I wanted to step it up and try and be more affectionate towards my girlfriend. I would try to hug her more often and kiss her, but she started talking to (n) more and more then it came to the point where I told her I didn’t feel comfortable with them hanging around each other because I was jealous. At first she was fine with it and said “okay” and she said she would block him. I came to figure out a week later she had unblocked him and started talking to him again, mind that this is only at the beginning of our relationship. Then I was really getting upset I started getting jealous and I’m realizing that doing that made her upset, so I reached my breaking point and told her to stop talking to him because I’m jealous, I would see them calling, texting, even hanging out one on one without me. I made her upset one day and she changed our matching profile picture and matched with (n). I know it may seem childish but that made me super upset. Fast forward to Freshman year we hung out and would go skating we were back to normal, then she started talking to (n) again but not a lot, she posted on her instagram story of them together alone hanging out. It felt like they were looking down on me. (n) would even go to her house so she can give her food. Then rumours started spreading and my friend whom was hanging out with them at the time saw (n) blowing smoke into my girlfriends mouth and apparently kissed her. I didn’t know how to respond to this so i asked my girlfriend about it and she started telling me that I didn’t trust her. I would constantly overthink about it. Then she stopped talking to him, but here comes another guy let’s call him (D).

Recently, I (25f) have started to have thoughts about leaving my boyfriend of 5 years. 
He’s aggressive in the way he speaks to me and often spins things to say “you always twist things to make me out to be the bad guy or the horrible person” when I ask him to watch how he speaks to me or I address something that’s making me unhappy. 
Recently a a few things have happened that made me start thinking about breaking up with him.

1. I run a small local business (resin &amp; hand made things) and run a social media page. A long time male friend liked a post before he did, when he noticed this he told me that he was going to do him some damage if he did it again. When I calmed him down he said it was just banter.

2.He brought up a conversation he and his friends had had. Is it cheating to message a friend of the opposite gender and not tell your partner? I don’t agree with that statement. I have a friend from senior school &amp; we message each other like every couple of months or so to check but that’s that’s. He told me that that was cheating on him &amp; that I can’t talk to him anymore. He also said that a girl doesn’t have male friends. A week or so after, he told me that he had had a chat with his ex girlfriend for a few days. When I was upset by this he told be that it was different to me talking to my friend. 

3. I asked about his works annual party. I thought he had did to me that they were going to crazy golf. He went along with until the end of the conversation where he said that it wasn’t him that was going to crazy golf to who the fuck was. (It was my sister btw) I said to him I felt that he had been sneaky and tried to catch me out even though there is nothing to catch me out on.

4. I feel like he gets upset with me for wanting to see my family and not wanting to live with him.

 I was in a relationship when we first met but now I’ve been single for two months, she gave me hints she was interested in me until when once I invited her after work for a drink and we ended up at my house where she asked me what I felt for her and I told her I liked her so we started kissing and having sex. 

We meet everyday at work still and we meet casually for sex. We work well together, she keeps saying she’s confused but then kind of act like she’s my girlfriend next minute she changes her mind. 

We always talked to go on a trip to London together (we live in Europe two hours away from London), yesterday we booked tickets and we will be going to London but then today we kind of talked and she said she’s not interested in a relationship with anyone atm that she wants to keep things casual.

Should I cut her off? My concern is that we have a trip booked and fully paid together and we see everyday at work.

I need advice.  I am a male (25) who has been in a relationship with a female (26) for nearly six years. 

I currently work in an industry where I meet a variety of different co-workers every few months. (I work in media and the turnover can be a little strange). Regardless, a few months back we had a new employee join our team. At first I didn't think anything of her; as work progressed however I seemingly found myself more and more attracted to her personality. It wasn't until  I found out what type of movies, music, and hobbies she was interested in where I started feeling attracted to her beyond being acquaintances. 

Unfortunately, despite the prolonged amount of time I had spent with my current girlfriend, I had noticed that we don't really share enough of the same interests. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I feel like oftentimes we make compromises, if not sacrifices, while in the company of each other. Additionally, I found myself losing interest in my girlfriend because she is constantly glued to her phone and doesn't seem to find it a problem. There is a dependency on the usage and it seems I can't even be in the same room with her or hold her attention for longer than five minutes before I'm interrupted by  a Tiktok...

As for the woman I'm interested in now, that is before her shift changed, I found myself nearly madly in love with her. The conversations we would have felt like they had meaning and it felt like I was truly making a connection. This feeling was rather temporary with my current girlfriend, maybe even partially nonexistent... I started feeling signs of mutual attraction too (with my coworker). The way she would hold my gaze, and play with her hair, and laugh at my stupid jokes. About a month ago, we had a large gathering of coworkers, Drinks were involved, and she had said some suggestive things (mainly about sizes of, well you know...). Then she just held my gaze and winked. It was more than I could handle. I told her to stop, but I think we both knew we liked it. (To be clear, this was merely a conversation).

Worst part is, she (my coworker), has a boyfriend too. As of this week, I don't see her anymore at work so that has helped a bit and I believe it will alleviate some of my obsessive thoughts. Maybe all of this is just my  assumptions anyways. However, I feel deep down in my gut that there **IS** a spark there.

I was at work and missed my parters call. I called back 5 minutes later and she hung up on me while I was talking. I was telling her I hope she feels better she hung up on me mid sentence. 

She called me back later and apologized for her being rude. Then after she started talking about just random things. I was a little disengaged from the conversation because I was kinda still bothered.

After I noticed this I told her I was going to go back to work and texted her I needed my alone time because I was kinda bothered by what happened. 

I was going to give myself 30 minutes and I would have been over it. I just needed space. 

So she texts me she does not appreciate me waiting till the conversation was over for me to mention anything because it came off as I was ignoring her. From what I understood from the conversation was she did not appreciate being felt like I was ignoring her and not listening.

I voiced to her about wanting time to myself. The conversation just continued to escalate and escalate. There was points in the conversation I wanted to remove myself from the conversation and I told her but it didn’t happened. I told her a few times.

She is upset and me hung up on me again mid conversation and told me she doesn’t want to see me tomorrow. 

I personally felt like the situation was blown out of proportion and escalated to an unnecessary point. 

I don’t know what to do because I feel like an ass hole because in her mind she sees it as me not listening to her feelings and ignoring her when in reality I just needed my space which I expressed to her.

Ok so i (18 m) always was a man looking for relationships throughout his whole life as I though that these relationships will make me satisfied and happy in life. 

I always searched for the perfect girl but i never found her, so before two years I accepted that it’s gonna take a while till i find the perfect girl and i started dating literally any girl i see. 

Last year i was talking to five different girls and most of them i would take on dates and even sleep with them (that’s forbidden in my country) and before you judge I never told any girl that it was a real relationship it was something like friends with benefits. 

Last year my father’s friend settled down in my country as he was living in a far country this man was my father’s friend since high school. They are partners in their business (they own several restaurants and several malls) and so when he settled down he bought the house next to us. My father’s friend had this beautiful daughter (i knew her all of my life but never really had any relationship from any kind) she was like my sister. 

Once they settled down i tried to reach this girl (f 18) let’s call her Mary, one time after we got closer together i told her that i had a crush on her but in my mind i had this plan that if she said no i would say that it’s a prank.

After i told her she told me that she is sorry but she is taken so i told her that it was a prank and we kept on being friends.

We became really close friends and she started tilling me about her personal life, I already accepted that she doesn’t want me and i respected it as i never opened that again with her.

After i finished high school (although we are the same age she went to school early so when i got into uni she already finished her first year) my family made a small party in a farm far away from where we live and we invited my father’s friend. 

It was a normal party nothing special but i noticed that Mary was looking at me all the time specially when i was taking a sunbath she even sent me a message asking me if im mad at her for any reason. I told her that i would never be mad at her. In the pool she only played with me and after we got out the pool she would sit beside me in every chance she get.

After we got back to home it was around 12 am and it was also my birthday so i got out with bunch of my friends to celebrate with some girls i knew. As messages of birthday wishes started coming to me Mary also sent me a message on snapchat so i opened it and i was shocked. The message was “ happy birthday to my favorite person in the world i love you so much i hope to be together always”  as i said i never talked to her about my emotions after my prank that message left me shocked.

I told my friends that i needed to go home as i don’t feel well and doesn’t want to party. After i got home i was looking at the message then replied “thanks you’re my favorite person as well “ .

In that moment i knew there was something special so we started talking more often and one night she at 1 am she asked me if i can talk, i told her sure and we kept talking till 9 am.

She told me about he ex and how he treated her badly and how she caught him cheating on her with 3 girls and in the same night we confessed our love to each other. 

We officially started dating and for three months everything was perfect till we started university we didn’t talk as much as we used to but i understood because we were studying and we were talking only on weekends. 

But now whenever i try to call her even on weekends she doesn’t answer or if she does she stay for couple of minutes then tells me she wants to sleep and now she doesn’t even talk to me on text unless i ask her something like how’s your day.

She never send me anything first unlike when we started dating, i talked to her about that and she told me she is very busy rn but at the same time she goes out everyday with her friends.

I feel like she dated me because of her last relationship or in other words used me to get herself away from her toxic relationship and now after she moved on she isn’t interested in dating me.

What really hurt is that I’m a man who loves to be in relationships I don’t know if that’s sickness or anything i feel like I’m a romantic person and when i thought that i found the perfect girl she ghosted me like i was nothing.

Please i need someone to tell me what to do I really love this girl but at the same time i feel like I’m wasting my time and energy in this relationship as she literally became cold as ice towards me.

I (f) and my bf (m) have been together for almost an entire year. (Not giving out exact ages, but we are all above 15)
He had this friend named ""Amy""(f) who I've been becoming increasingly uncomfortable with, and I'm not sure how to proceed.


She is always pinching him when they are at school, and she touches his ass and chest/nipples, and he does not like it. At all. He asks her to stop but she never does. I'm considering asking her to stop as well, as it makes me uncomfortable.

During this summer, she messaged him out of nowhere on fb saying she was going to k*ll herself, no prior conversation, out of completely nowhere, and this stressed my bf out. I got a bit pissed at this because she dropped it on him out of nowhere, and I find this extremely energy-draining and attention-seeking behavior, correct me if im wrong.
The situation called down, and that was that (though she did send him a message with a kissy emoji ""to add pizzazz"" in her own words when questioned about this)

Recently-ish
She was tying my bfs hoodie strings together after saying ""I did this with my ex boyfriend."" Which I find odd, because you clearly said you did said thing with your ex boyfriend, then do it to mine? Then proceeded to call him handsome. Me and my partner talked about this, and he said he genuinely thought it was a friend thing, but he will be more aware in the future. He asked if I would like for him to distance himself from Amy, but im not sure if I'd be rude gf for doing so. Advice on how to go forward please?

My one question: when searching for an app on ur IPhone Home Screen (dragging down and searching on iOS 15), can Siri suggest apps you have never downloaded before?


The optional BackStory: 

my boyfriend and I of 6 months were FaceTiming on iPhones (with IOS15) and he shares his screen to show me something on GroupMe. As he was searching up the app in the Home Screen, Grindr appears. Now We’re both guys but we lasted used the app over 8 months ago wen we met. Furthermore, at that time, he created a throwaway Apple ID to download Grindr, so it shouldn’t be stored in his current Apple ID

Wen Grindr popped up in suggestions, I asked him about it, and he said he truly didn’t know why it popped up. He clicks on the app to show me, and were transferred to Grindr on the App Store. Here on the side, instead of “get” or “buy now”, the little icloud button with an arrow is shown. I asked “doesn’t that mean youve downloaded it before on this Apple ID?”

Him: “no for some reason all apps I don’t have show the iCloud button”

To prove it to me, he goes back to the Home Screen and searches some random word, I forgot exactly wat word, but out pops this random children’s game he claims he’s never downloaded before, he clicks on it and it once again brings him to the App Store, with the same iCloud arrow to download. “See my phone just suggests apps to me that I’ve never downloaded”. At that moment I trusted him to be telling the truth.

Last night he brought it up again and told me, Because he was searching up different forms of sexual activities for us to try (which at that time was true, we were both virgins), the data that from those searches were recorded into his phone, and that’s likely why siri suggested Grindr. He also said it could be because his phone previously did have Grindr on it it showed up, although it was a different Apple ID. I asked him to search the app up at the home page again, but this time it didn’t pop up. He said “I think it’s cause IOS 16 removed this suggestion feature”

I’ve scoured the Internet to see if siri could suggest apps you’ve never Downloaded before, but I cannot find a definite answer. So I come to you all for a last resort

This has been eating away at me for so long. I just wanna know, can Siri suggest apps you’ve never downloaded before? Specifically wen searching for apps on the Home Screen.

So, are the following things stuff that women commonly accept without question?

Whenever I ask on here they tell me ""who cares"" and ""get over it"" and that I should be happy to just find the needle in the haystack and be done with it.

So...

Is o ral s ex is much more performed on women than it is on men and is this commonly believed and accepted? And this has nothing to do with men being selfish since g ay men are male and commonly give oral to other men? And that this means p enises are more appreciated than v aginas?

Is it widely accepted and believed that men commonly f etishize and s exualise women who have p enises and that type of p orn and s ex work and that they commonly use l adyboy s exual tourism, but that women and gay men have no interest in the men with v aginas equivalents? And that this shows p enises are more liked than v aginas?

Is it widely believed that men prefer younger women, rich men prefer younger women, that men in affairs mostly leave their wives for younger women, that beauty is mostly about how much younger you look and women are concerned with their ageing. Whereas women are thought to like a wider age range of men?

Is it widely believed that misogny is far more common than misandry across the world and throughout history? And therefore that women like men as a gender far more than men like women as a gender and that women like and are attracted to men in a more well rounded way?

Is it widely believed that in gender segregated and s exually repressed countries (like Muslim countries) and places men commonly have s ex with men but women do not anywhere near as commonly have s ex with women? And that this shows s traight male s exuality depends almost solely on the s exual availability of women whereas s traight female s exuality does not depend almost solely on the s exual availability of men and they replace them far less.

Is it widely true that men are attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. And that natural body hair on a woman, fatness, non feminine traits are more g ross to them than a feminine woman with a p enis. But that women and g ay men love a ndrogynous men and many popular hearthrobs for them are feminine or wear makeup and women's clothes or have long hair...like Harry Styles, Adam Ant, rockers, etc. And they'd rather them than a masculine woman or man with a v agina?

Is it widely true that in general women support, praise and celebrate g ay men and men doing typically female hobbies more than men support l esbians and women doing typically male hobbies. For example d rag queens and g ay male makeup artists are loved by women, popular &amp; mainstream and praised for the bare minimum vs d rag kings and female footballers or women doing male things are not loved by men and instead need to prove themselves a lot more. And that g ay men are more mainstream, have more poistive stereotypes and romcoms involving them are more mainstream and successful than ones involving l esbians?

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as automatically s ubmissive while p enises are seen as automatically d ominant? And so f emdom and d ominant women have to wear s trap ons and use p egging to be seen as d ominant/face s itting is not enough. P egging is named ""extreme f emdom"" vs anything to do with just the v agina is deemed ""gentle f emdom."" The s trap ons are also seen as similar to real p enises so l esbians who use them are asked why, men who are into that also like t ransgender women and see them as d ominant and t ransgender men as s ubmissive. And also that there is no v agina type as i dealised or searched for in p ornography as large p enises and B B C are. Also c uck f etish is all about the other man having a bigger p enis, not about the other man's o ral skills or anything to do with w orshipping v agina.

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as more g ross, t aboo and have more s tigma than p enises do and that g ay men are more openly d isgusted by v aginas than l esbians are by p enises. And that l esbians are more open to t ransgender women than g ay men are to t ransgender men, because p enis is more important to women and g ay men than v agina is important to l esbians and men.

Men are obsessed with a nal because they bore of v aginas and look for alternatives. V aginas are seen as replaceable h oles. Meanwhile women do not b ore of p enises nor look for alternatives. L esbian sex has it's validity questioned with ""you just haven't found the right p enis."" Or people asking how they even have s ex without a p enis. G ay sex is not invalidated, because p enis and p enetration is seen to be what s ex is all about. Men who are into a nal are open to women who have p enises.

Can you tell me how right or wrong I am? Most on here tell me I am right and ask why it bothers me when most women accept it and stay attracted to men.

Would men be as accepting on mass if the opposite equivalents applied to them, not complain or complain and stay attracted to women and not lose attraction nor be bitter or hateful?

Whereas women are thought to like a wider age range of men?

Is it widely believed that misogny is far more common than misandry across the world and throughout history? And therefore that women like men as a gender far more than men like women as a gender and that women like and are attracted to men in a more well rounded way?

Is it widely believed that in gender segregated and s exually repressed countries (like Muslim countries) and places men commonly have s ex with men but women do not anywhere near as commonly have s ex with women? And that this shows s traight male s exuality depends almost solely on the s exual availability of women whereas s traight female s exuality does not depend almost solely on the s exual availability of men and they replace them far less.

Is it widely true that men are attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. And that natural body hair on a woman, fatness, non feminine traits are more g ross to them than a feminine woman with a p enis. But that women and g ay men love a ndrogynous men and many popular hearthrobs for them are feminine or wear makeup and women's clothes or have long hair...like Harry Styles, Adam Ant, rockers, etc. And they'd rather them than a masculine woman or man with a v agina?

Is it widely true that in general women support, praise and celebrate g ay men and men doing typically female hobbies more than men support l esbians and women doing typically male hobbies. For example d rag queens and g ay male makeup artists are loved by women, popular &amp; mainstream and praised for the bare minimum vs d rag kings and female footballers or women doing male things are not loved by men and instead need to prove themselves a lot more. And that g ay men are more mainstream, have more poistive stereotypes and romcoms involving them are more mainstream and successful than ones involving l esbians?

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as automatically s ubmissive while p enises are seen as automatically d ominant? And so f emdom and d ominant women have to wear s trap ons and use p egging to be seen as d ominant/face s itting is not enough. P egging is named ""extreme f emdom"" vs anything to do with just the v agina is deemed ""gentle f emdom."" The s trap ons are also seen as similar to real p enises so l esbians who use them are asked why, men who are into that also like t ransgender women and see them as d ominant and t ransgender men as s ubmissive. And also that there is no v agina type as i dealised or searched for in p ornography as large p enises and B B C are. Also c uck f etish is all about the other man having a bigger p enis, not about the other man's o ral skills or anything to do with w orshipping v agina.

Is it widely true that v aginas are seen as more g ross, t aboo and have more s tigma than p enises do and that g ay men are more openly d isgusted by v aginas than l esbians are by p enises. And that l esbians are more open to t ransgender women than g ay men are to t ransgender men, because p enis is more important to women and g ay men than v agina is important to l esbians and men.

Men are obsessed with a nal because they bore of v aginas and look for alternatives. V aginas are seen as replaceable h oles. Meanwhile women do not b ore of p enises nor look for alternatives. L esbian sex has it's validity questioned with ""you just haven't found the right p enis."" Or people asking how they even have s ex without a p enis. G ay sex is not invalidated, because p enis and p enetration is seen to be what s ex is all about. Men who are into a nal are open to women who have p enises.

My girlfriend and I are long distance (She's in Chicago for grade school-2 years and I'm in Boston). We were together for 6 months before she moved out there and now it's been just under a year. A couple months ago, I brought up the idea of moving to Chicago just as something to entertain/think about. She seemed a skittish/hesitant about that idea and said she would feel bad if we broke up and I'd be out there and not have anyone else. She also said she has a fear of commitment. I sort of dropped it, smoothed things over and moved on. We've told each other we love each other and generally see each other every 3 weeks but she does have a bit of an avoidant attachment style. Fast forward and all of the sudden I'm faced with a career decision.

I'm currently an English Teacher looking to switch fields into Marketing and Communications which is going to be a challenge to get in unto itself. I'd like to work for a non-profit in a writing heavy role. I mentioned to her that I'm mostly applying in Boston but was entertaining applying to jobs in New York, DC, or Chicago if I felt the role was a really good fit. There are just more opportunities in those cities. She didn't seem to mind or be taken aback by it.

As I've been applying, I did decide to apply to a few roles in the other cities. I now all of the sudden have a third interview tomorrow with a non-profit in Chicago for a Marketing Coordinator role at a company that works on issues that I'm passionate about in a role that feels right in my wheelhouse. I also have a first interview for a company in Boston on Monday (shockingly for a manager position) for another nonprofit that's education related that I could make a real difference in. The timing is just off because I might get offered this Chicago job first and if I don't take it, I might not get the Boston one either.

If I got this Chicago job-I can't decide whether or not to take it because it could very well ruin my relationship and she did say that she was going to move back to the east coast after grad school so it could complicate things a year and a half from now. She's not the best with commitment or communication but I do love her-sue me. If I did this-I feel like there's a chance she'd be upset by it.

I was clearly upset that he wasn’t there but I didn’t want to bring it up because I knew this would further upset him. He could tell something was wrong and I tried my best to calmly tell him that I was upset he didn’t get back sooner. He immediately lashed out at me after that, without allowing me to explain the context of how my day had been. A lot of bottled up emotions were unleashed on me and it was honestly a lot to take in. We had a plan to move in together in Jan because he was going to switch jobs and had accepted and offer that matched his currently salary. He then started to claim that he no longer wanted to switch jobs. When I told him that doing long distance wasn’t something I wanted because of the impact it would have on my mental health he gaslighted me by stating how much he has done. I dislike that he did this because I have been doing a lot to show I care. I have been financially supporting gas money for him to drive to me. I have been buying him food when he comes down and clothes. I just got him a very personalized gift etc. I told him last week that the financial dependency is getting to me because I am a student working two part time jobs and he has a full time job as an engineer. All of this really got to me and I ended up breaking my clean streak by hurting myself, which I haven’t done in multiple years.

She recently moved in this past September because her lease expired and she has been having issues with family preventing her from taking a spare room there. I wasn't quite ready to live together, but she was quite insistent about it, saying the lack of distance would help our relationship as we developed a new ""together"" lifestyle. 

However we keep having issues since she moved in. Most of this revolves around her expectations, around her physical lifestyle and what she expects out of our relationship. She is very particular about *her* items, but many of *my* things have been thrown out, donated, or broken. She stresses when she needs *her* space, but I can't go 20 minutes in *my* space without her interrupting me, particularly when I work from home 2 days per week.

I suggested we need to work on our boundaries, saying living together as a couple is a lot like living alone; we need to be independent in our home but find purposeful moments to spend together. Importantly, I suggested we do a weekly date or activity—something we could look forward to at the end of a long week, make a memorable evening.

She said she often spends months not wanting to leave the house for any type of activity or event. She said trying to plan something like that would be more stressful for her and she prefers to stay inside most nights.

Although it's nice to mozy around the house, it makes it difficult to look back and find stand-out moments that are special to me, and unfortunately easy to remember the fights we had.

This will be long - but to keep it short. My partner and I moved in together just over 3 years ago (while he was cheating on me with his sons mother). He couldn’t work during the shut downs in our province and did nothing around the house. Eventually he started working again - full time in a low paying job and refused to do anything else. When he would get frustrated at work he would call in “sick”. He was fired 3 times in 6 months because of this. He blew through his unemployment and went on welfare to pay his child support. As I have ensured that HIS child support comes before us. During his unemployment - I had to go into debt to pay our costs of basic living by borrowing large amounts of money from my parents. 

For the last year he acts out when he doesn’t sex when he wants it - and quite frankly this attitude doesn’t make him attractive in my eyes - and I have zero desire for him. I’ve asked him to leave on multiple occasions and he begs to stay as he has no where else to go.

Huuuuuge essay, maybe one for insomniacs with nothing better to do to read!

We've been together a year and a half, me F33 him M34, and we live in different towns an hour and a bit apart door to door (we want to live together now but thanks to some truly wonderful UK politicians that'll take a while, the housing market is fucked...). So our relationship takes place Friday after work to Sunday evening, at either of our homes, plus at least one long weekend away together each month e.g. in UK countryside or Europe.

This is nice; our weekends are special and largely dedicated to each other (he games with friends in the week and snowboards in an indoor slope, I am quite actively social with my friends in the week). He's a thoughtful, self-reflective, gentle, kind, giving, considerate and communicative person when we're together. Also very affectionate, physically and verbally, great at compromise, and we by-and-large match each others (significant) libidos. Things are good - when we're together.

He's said from the start - May 2021 - that he ""hates his phone"" and I know this to be true because this mates complain that he's crap at communicating with them too, they barely hear from him until they see him. I know it isn't personal. But he'll happily go Monday-Fri evening with no contact with me, and I was saying for over a year (gave up a few months back) that it really means a lot to me to have a little check in, e.g. just a quick text exchange every other day (not even every day). Just so we're in the habit of being there for each other's mundane day-to-day lives, not just the fun weekends. The odd check-in translates to me as care, and as un-care when I receive nothing from him or am outright ignored for days straight. And I'm not just a ""mate"", I'm his partner and want to give and receive support including when we aren't together. I've raised it many times and he very earnestly says he will make an effort to be in touch, then I don't hear from him for days and am ignored... 

The final straw was when I started my new job in June. I was stressed because the job was a step up, a slightly different sort of role, and a new company/industry; I had huge imposter syndrome and was nervous, which I discussed with him when we were together beforehand. Started on Monday morning, didn't hear from him for 3 days, not so much as a ""good luck"" or ""how'd it go?"" which strikes me as so odd for someone who can be so kind and engaged. I don't understand what loving couple can't expect just a little support at significant or transitional times like that. Should point out that he was suffering with an acute MH issue at the time - I do think he was in a really rough place. But the last thing he'd ever do is reach out to me when he's feeling low or ill; it's actually always his reason to not do so (e.g. tough/busy/stressful week at work, poor sleep, etc.) I was pretty understanding for a while, and backed down as soon as he explained this, until it became every single week of not hearing from him and being ignored, at which point I became irate that my communication needs were consistently deprioritised in favour of his need for none. Fyi I didn't even know I \*had\* communication needs until having a great partner (otherwise) who gives me very little! I tried everything I can think of; spelling it out clearly and directly, sending a looong email detailing basic needs such as a quick check-in every other day and especially during important times such as starting a new scary job, and I've been outright angry about being ignored for a week. He'll try for a few days then drop off again.

So since then, I've just cut out communicating in the week completely. I feel sad, disconnected, uncared for, totally disengaged from each other's day-to-day, and when I have a shit day or some bad news I don't reach out to him - but it is easier than trying to and being ignored. At least I have a degree of control over it. He says he hates this but know's he's ""made his bed so will lay in it"". I try not to suspect he likes it and is relieved but... putting it in writing, it seems likely haha. 

I can't think of a better way to deal though; it's clear that he won't make this change for me. I'm gutted that all I needed was 20 seconds of texting on alternate days and that was too much to ask even though he is so wonderful and giving when we're physically together. So I'll just continue being sad periodically but not trying not to dwell, and getting used to no-contact weeks.

Me (35f) and my husband (40m) have been together for 12 years, married 5. For background, we live in the country where my husband is from and all of my family and friends live very far away. When I decided to move to be with my husband, I had just finished uni but my University degree was worthless in another country so I had to find a new career. This was during the GFC, so my job prospects at home would have been bad even if I stayed, and I am thankful that I was able to find a new career for myself and have made some wonderful friendships here. 
My husband has some amazing qualities which I love - he can be kind (think pulling over to help change a tire or seeing a dog roaming the streets and stopping to catch it and find it’s home), he is funny and charismatic and has a gift for being able to banter with anyone, he is responsible and reliable-especially with our finances, he is organised and follows through with things (for instance he runs his own business and everything from administration to the workmanship on his jobs is meticulous). I could go on but the point is he is a good man and generally just a good human being.
That said, from the start my husband and I did not share the same interest in sex. My love language (if you know those categories) is definitely physical touch and I would say my husband’s is more like words of affirmation. He and I have always struggled with the notion of intimacy and connection. He’s a “man’s man” and doesn’t ever show emotion and sometimes I wonder if I am who he settled for because he was nearing 30 and he wanted to lock someone in that he could have as a warm body in the room while he watches tv and eats dinner. It feels like we are good friends and roommates.

When we were dating there would be times I would try to initiate (sometimes very blatantly) but he would say no for reasons like he was tired, he didn’t want our roommate to hear or he wanted to watch the game. At first, I was so hurt and angry that my husband didn’t want me physically. Even when I moved out into my own apartment or when we moved into our own house, the sex never happened. It’s been over 5 years since we last had sex, on our honeymoon, and before that it was our wedding night six months before. Before that, maybe once or twice a year. I went through stages of grief and self loathing thinking it was me being too disgusting to be desired. Then after a few years I became bitter and resentful- and mean. Yes, I admit there were times when my husband would try to show affection, but all the negative emotions of having all my earlier advances rejected surfaced and I would either ignore him or get angry that now all the sudden he was being affectionate. When we got married I remember telling myself in the mirror when getting ready that I knew what I was in for, that the pro’s outweighed con’s. 

Over the years we have tried many versions of counselling, and I have gone individually, but nothing really seems to make a dent in what now feels like an impenetrable wall that’s gone up between us. I mentioned separating a few years ago, hoping it would give him a wake up call and give me space to stop being so angry but his reaction was it’s a divorce or nothing. So after a very difficult few months of coming to terms with being forced to make a decision and mulling over the finality of it, I told him that I couldn’t keep living without intimacy and if I had to choose, then I chose a divorce. He said he didn’t expect me to choose that and had changed his mind on the decision having to be “black and white” and he would need to take time to think about his response. He never did, and we just got back into the same cycle of being nice for a few weeks then a small argument happens which triggers a massive fight about the real issue of not addressing our intimacy problem. This was probably around a year ago.

I went back to school in 2019 to get a masters which 1- helped me take my mind off of the no intimacy thing and 2- gave me something to look forward to since it was a degree in something that could lead to jobs all around the world. I love to travel, volunteer and it’s always been a dream to be a live all over the world, experiencing new cultures and learning and growing myself through the process. I guess I live abroad now but I’ve been here 12 years and want to try somewhere new. My husband and I agreed years ago when he started his business that he could have 5 years to try it out then I could get my 5 years pursuing what I wanted. My side of the bargain always included being closer to my family, especially my parents who are getting older.
The pandemic put a pause on the start of my 5 years but I’ve managed to get an opportunity in a role that would let me live all over the world with a company that provides benefits for both me and my husband and I could be closer to my family.
While my husband was on board originally, the deteriorating state of our relationship coupled with the fact that his business is successful and has created the lifestyle he enjoys (short working days, no boss to answer to, he sets his schedule) meant when I finally got the conditional offer, he wasn’t ready to say yes to coming with me.

Recently I have been asking my husband to make up his mind and to let me know, one way or the other, if he’s going to come on this journey with me. We do communicate quite openly so I told him that the kindest thing he could do would be not to string me along and if he knew he didn’t want to come to let me know, let me go, and let me start grieving the end of our relationship and quite possibly the end of my time in this country and with all the friends I have made because I wouldn’t come back here if we weren’t married. This was last week.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday and he tells me that he’s made up his mind and he doesn’t want to come and it’s not what he wants for his life and should we separate households now so we can get used to living apart before I have to leave for this new job (he bought an apartment in 2021 after the first discussions of separation happened but it remained I’m empty) Now I’ve obviously contemplated this decision and with all the ultimatums of separation and divorce it shouldn’t have been that shocking (which is what he was expecting) but I broke down and told him I appreciated him telling me but that I’d need a day to come to terms with it and be ready to talk about the next steps. Looking back now he was oddly surprised by my reaction and was eager to get out of the house. The weekend before he had started talking about moving some stuff to the apartment - which in my head was not a red flag because if he was going with me for this job, we’d need to store or sell most of our stuff (which isn’t much)so I thought he was just moving what we’d want to keep over to the empty apartment because that’s the most logical place for us to store our stuff.
Anyway, he leaves to take some stuff to the apartment which was fine because it gave me time alone to process which essentially was me bawling my eyes out thinking how did I get here, how did we get here, and why have I spent so many years pushing him away when all I want is for him to pull me closer. He rings a few times from the apartment to check on me and says he’s pretty surprised by my reaction and thought that this is what I wanted and that it’s taken him a while but he thinks it’s the best thing for us. He eventually gets home and I cry a bit more before realising it’s late and as we are washing up, I go to plug my phone in and I see his phone. Now, ordinarily I’ll never go through his phone. Not once in our 12 years have I ever not trusted him or had any reason to snoop. Of course I have snooped once or twice and we joke about my social media stalking but never have I been looking to find evidence, it’s more curiosity about his ex’s and who he follows on Insta. Back to the point, all weekend I felt something was off with him and his phone. For days he would sit on a chair far away from me and was glued to his texts. He typically falls asleep and his phone is just buzzing away next to him with random texts from friends but the past few days it’s like he was so protective and wouldn’t let himself fall asleep with me there. I opened his phone and looked at the recent texts and one immediately jumped out. I can’t remember what exactly but the last message was something way too casual to be about work and it was not from a number of his friends. Long story short, after his shock at me finding it and me convincing him I was not going to sleep until he showed me the full thread, I read all the messages between him and a much younger girl that he met through his work. It started on the Thursday the week before, which my intuition was all over. There was obviously flirting on both sides, she sent some pics and voice messages which he played along with and there were a few FaceTime calls as well. I don’t remember all of the details because I was honestly in shock reading it, half paying attention to what they were flirting about and half trying to stop all of the intrusive thoughts about the previous times in my life this exact scenario played out with previous boyfriends who I later found out cheated on me. He had been texting her constantly- even before, during and after he had just told me he made his mind up about separating.

He was immediately apologetic and regretful and admitted it was about him seeking some attention and it made him feel good that someone wanted him. To be clear, it never got physical- it was just exchanges of hurtful but fairly innocent flirting. He did work on her unit and she initiated the interest, which doesn’t excuse his actions but, given the context of our relationship, I understand why he engaged.

I am rational enough to understand his need for attention, something he was lacking from me, and I completely understand I played a part in him getting to the stage where he would go against his character to indulge in something that felt good- despite him knowing it was wrong.  I stayed in the barely furnished apartment that night and he has said the texts and girl meant nothing and what he was searching for in affection he wants from me, however he’s still not convinced on this job abroad and likes his life here and wishes I could just be happy living a simple life and offered that I spend time every year volunteering abroad instead. I also accepted my part in being cold and distant and apologised for hurting him by initiating talk of separating when I was really using it as a threat in the hopes of getting him to do something about our intimacy issues. We agreed to take some time not to talk about everything because honestly I’m still processing the whirlwind situation I just experienced. 

There are a few things from his messaging that I do recall that really hurt me. The main one is he told the girl (who is a young, single mom) that he thought by 40
he would have kids of his own.  Now when we had discussions about kids before we were married he was never really sure if he wanted them. I also have a disabled family member and have previously expressed my own fears about my ability to handle a child with disabilities and how it’s a massive strain physically, emotionally and financially. I have also had issues down there for over 20 years and essentially, I don’t know if I can conceive or hold a full grown baby and am always waiting for the day when my body finally turns on me and I get cervical cancer. For years I thought I’d rather just have a hysterectomy than live with the constant fear of one day getting sick. Because of this, even before I met my husband, I had always told  myself that adoption was best for me. There are so many children in the world who need love and it’s never once bothered me that I might not be able to birth my own child because that certainly does not prevent me from being a mother. My husband has reacted negatively to adoption when I would bring it up and he had never met anyone who had or even knew a child with disabilities so I think this scared him. add to this the fact that we barely had sex to begin with and even when we did, he always wanted to use a condom because he said he didn’t want to risk it- even the times after we were married. I just resigned myself to a life with no kids and here he is texting someone that he saw himself as a father! I am now making myself go crazy with the idea that I could have wasted my most fertile years, if I even am, believing that kids weren’t an option. And even worse, that I might have been holding my husband back from something he wants from someone who could give him a baby.
There are so many other things from their text exchange that has had me up all night and crying randomly as I walk the dog. he was essentially talking like we were over and done with - I know that some of that was just him flirting but my mind is taking me to very dark places and I’m more confused than ever about what to do.
If I had a magic wand I would go back to the start and tackle this intimacy thing on the head. I would take back the years of being angry and bitter and cold. I would try to fight harder for us to be better but then doubt pops up into my mind as to whether my husband would put in the same effort. Despite all the kind words he’s said about wanting me to be the one he spends the rest of his life with and me to be the one to show him affection, I can’t help but think this was a knee jerk reaction to getting caught doing a silly thing and, if we took out all of the things said to try and save my feelings, that the ultimately he was ready to leave.

If I decide to work on things, it feels like it’s going to take me giving up on my job abroad for us to even have a
Chance at trying again. And if that’s the reality, I’m grappling with the chance the I might lose my marriage anyway if we can’t change, but I’ll have also lost the opportunity I had to go abroad and be closer
to family (which has been 2 years in the making). 

I honestly don’t know what to think or do at this stage. I can’t really go to my friends because I don’t want them to know about his text exchanges- he made a mistake, one that I understand, and I wouldn’t want them to think less of him. I’m wondering if anyone else has been through something similar. What did you do? How do you work though this? Can it be worked through?

TLDR: my husband (40m) and I (35f) have been together for 12 years and our ongoing intimacy issues have caused a lot of strain. I have become cold and bitter towards a him.

So I’ve decided to post and make it an open discussion. 

My boyfriend is one of the best parts of my life and I really I do love him. He and his direct family, his parents, make me feel safe and welcome in their home. My own home and family can be chaotic and suffocating most of the time, so spending my weekends with them is so relaxing and refreshing. 

So, here’s the thing. I don’t love his family. The extended part. I get along well with his grandparents, as well as his aunts and uncles. The people who I have trouble with are his cousins and second cousins. 

To put it simply, they are annoying at best, and downright rude + intruding my personal space at worst. 
They are in their early to late teens, so the age isn’t to blame. They should know better. 

The older one is generally fine, but has several annoying habits that get on my nerves because of the way he repeats them multiple times in the short few-hour time span that we’re with him. Things like blaming me for things, as “a joke” in his words. But really, he’s not as bad as his brother. 

The younger one is the worst. He’s constantly bothering me and does not know how to talk to me without demeaning me or getting in my personal space. I want to clarify, my personal space is not just the direct air around me, it’s my body. And he doesn’t know how not to touch me or get really close when he’s interacting with me. 

This kid. My gosh. And really, it feels like he’s just a kid sometimes when he’s doing these things. But he’s not a small person, like 5’10  and heavy-set already. At 13. And his size and actions really intimidate me. 

If he’s not physically touching me, throwing stuff at me, or breathing in my face, he’s talking down to me. Or being obnoxious. But I prefer the last one to the other things when I have to interact with him. 

I don’t want to blame his parents for not teaching him how to respect others, but at this point I don’t have any other explanations. 

One of the worst parts of this is the fact that my boyfriends home, where they come over, is very small and since both these boys are large and it’ll be 8+ people in the house, it’s a tight squeeze and I don’t have anywhere to get away from them when they’re bothering me. 

And yeah. I don’t want to go into any more details than necessary because I’m a bit afraid that my boyfriend will 
come across this post before I find a good way to express my feelings about this to him.  

I also am nervous to tell him because I’ve mentioned my discomfort before and he reacted with concern that I didn’t like spending time with the older cousin. But then agreed that I was right to be uncomfortable when it came to the younger one. And I thought things were getting better, with us only seeing them outside the house for shorter periods of time. But now we’re back to to the start I guess. 

I’ve just been thinking about it because in a few days I have to potentially see them again. 

Sorry if any of this is unclear. I typed it out because I was feeling very frustrated and a little trapped. So in the end it feels more like a rant than anything cohesive. But oh well.

I had known him since I was 12-13 because my sister began to bring over to our house. I did have a crush on him because he would always talk to me or play with me. He had known that I was previously sexually abused by my cousin when I was 7/8. It began when I had slept over him and my sister’s place for the first time. That day he kept touching me inappropriately like rubbing my legs in the hot tub while my brother was there, rubbing his feet next to me, and finally tugging at my pillow in the middle of the night. I began to cry and my sister saw me and took me to the restroom and I explained what happened and filed a police report, my parents took me back home. He then began to talk to me on Facebook, when I was in high school, he had began to message me on there frequently wanting to talk to me. He would often compliment me and tell me he wanted to be with me instead of my sister. I didn’t know what to think at that age, I think I did like the attention even though I shouldn’t have. After him constantly messaging me, I felt guilty and blocked him, i was about 16 when I told my sister about the messages but she still stayed with that man. He would then make fake profiles to message me and I would always know it was him. When he would do that I would tell her that it was him but each time nothing would happen. There was one instance when he touched my butt in front of my family and no one knew because he covered it well. I felt as though I wouldn’t be able to see my nephew if I said something because he had said that he only came to see me. I did tell my parents about this incident and they banned him from ever coming to my house again. He messaged me again, I was 17 when it happened, he has told me he loved me and wanted to be with me and this time I reciprocated by sending him photos of myself. I had believed him that he cared about me but I was wrong. Eventually when I told my sister that it happened again, she was going to end the relationship and then he saved those photos and showed her. She came home and told me I ruined her family and how I could do that her. I was sobbing and apologizing for ever reciprocating, my world felt like it was crashing down. That night I got on my knees and prayed to god to forgive me and help me through this difficult time. She didn’t talk to me for about 2/3 years and never referred to me as her sister.

He later on gaslighted her, kicked a trashcan out of anger, and she bid him farewell and got angry with him too.
She told him she liked him and cared for him and he denied having feelings and even said hes never stared at her. All lies and then blamed her for feeling bad by his behaviour when he insulted her in front of us.

I am also willing to explain why, and I am the type of person who can fully explain everything I state.  she was of the opinion that if something bad happens to someone, it is a sign they did something to deserve it.  trigger warning:  &gt;!my first attempt to disprove this was bringing up the kids at sandy hook.  obviously 26 people did not all deserve to die.!&lt;  this did not work but it set a foundation.  another time, I brought up an accident that occurred with her son.  this got through to her.  she actually thanked me for unraveling this in her head.  so long story short, I am very level headed and practical and I think I compliment her erratic thought process.  and I am very stationary and complacent sometimes and she is that kick in the butt to get me to try new things or take a risk or even just clean my house.  additionally, we have excellent sexual chemistry and we are both complementarily eccentric in a number of ways which include enjoying the spotlight in social settings and over-sharing.

I have one concern in this relationship.  she was not trusting at all at the beginning of the relationship.  I was being interrogated all the time despite not doing a single thing to indicate I was messing around.  I would make a statement, it would go in one ear and out the other, and she would ask me if the opposite was true, essentially like I hadn’t just said something contradictory 30 seconds prior.  I figured this would go away as I proved I was trustworthy to her.  it did not.  it got worse.  she has my location on her phone at all times and has my password and permission to go through my phone at any time.  I also spend 95% of the time I am not working either with her or in communication with her.  from a common sense standpoint, I would have to be extremely desirable and extremely good at time management to even pull off cheating.  I am neither of those things.

I understand her personality disorder causes states of mania which result in some of this behavior.  I am just wondering if anyone has advice on how I cope with this or any general advice for dating someone with bpd.  very few things cause me to get noticeably upset in life.  I have been robbed at gunpoint, had family members die, have been scammed out of thousands, and have been jumped with little emotional reaction.  as it turns out, being called a blatant liar 5x a day does actually elicit a reaction from me.

I know this may not be a big deal for some, however, I consider it cheating. 

A little background: We met in Sept 2021 at a neighbours house party. I was not ready ready for a relationship as I had just moved cities and left an abusive relationship. We began hanging out and I could tell he liked me. We were practically dating the entire time except I ended things twice and became just friends (but it never lasted long) and I never met his family and would not go over to his house. Fast forward, I asked him out in May after thinking about it for a month and we’ve been dating ever since. Immediately after asking him out, I initiated the conversation about what we considered cheating. He knew long before dating me that porn was cheating and when we started dating he agreed to not consume it . I set my boundary and if he didn’t like it he didn’t have to date me. I had explicitly told him that if I ever caught him I would break up with him. 

I went over to his house yesterday to cook his family dinner. After dinner, we went up to his room and into his bed. He was on his phone and when I turned over and could see his phone it seemed like he quickly exited out of what he was on. I was sus and asked to see his phone. I honestly thought he was looking at flights. He gave me his phone and I began looking at stuff on his google chrome before he took his phone back and said “ I don’t wanna do this”. I asked why and said if there’s nothing to hide then I should be able to see everything on his phone and that if he didn’t let me look I would be going home bc I’m not gonna be able to stop feeling like he’s hiding something. He gave me his phone back and I looked through his search history. Ta daaa!!! I found a porn hub video. His immediate reaction was it was just one video and he kept claiming this. I started sobbing and went to call my sister and locked myself in the bathroom. When I came out I asked him why he would do that. His response was he wanted to jerk off. I asked him if he watches it every time he jerks off. He said no and when I asked sometimes. He said yes. I packed my stuff and went home.

I don’t know what to do now. I feel like everything he was saying was super un genuine and he was saying he’s sorry but I think he’s only sorry about being caught. He lies so much and he knows I hate liars. He lied about how often. He’s lied about his drug and nicotine use. He lied about going to a festival one time.

During that time she got divorced and I stupidly took her back a few years later, she did admit to being in multiple relationships and talking to other guys since then. But I broke it off a year ago

We got close and had some nice moments but I kept noticing how open she is with other guys and how she'd claim that every other guy was interested in her, she kept pushing me for marriage and kept blaming me for moving too slow just because I didn't want to rush in to marriage. 

Everytime we'd argue about it, she would always say that it's my fault that things are moving slow and that she doesn't like being with someone who can't commit. She would always say how she wants someone who loves her more than she loves themselves, that's not normal right?? And She always used to say that she wanted me to open up to her and tell her how I feel and that I can talk to her about anything if I'm ever upset. 

So I did when I mentioned that I didn't like how open she is with other guys, she said that she didn't want to be with anyone that's insecure just like her ex husband was (even though she'd already cheated on her ex husband with me which was unknown to me at the time, so he had a reason to feel insecure). 

I don't get why she'd tell me to talk to her about anything then end up throwing it back in my face! I told her I'm not happy so we agreed to end it, I was confused at first cos she used to tell me that she misses me everyday and after that conversation she ended up blocking me off everything at the startwhich I thought was childish.   

After we broke up she messaged me on Christmas day saying: 'I just wanted to message you to say that I hope you’re okay and that I feel as though I’m ready to stay as friends with you if that’s what you wanted.. I didn’t think I would ever be able to say that we could stay as friends but I feel like I’m in a good place and I know everything has worked out for the best and I would be really happy to have you as a friend But if you don’t want to hear from me that’s okay too just let me know x' I did reply to her saying that I don't think it's a good idea and I wished her well. She just replied with a simple 'that's fine no worries x'. I'm trying to not think about her messaging me, but I feel like I was really getting in to the healing process and was really focused on other aspects of my life such as my career. 

I know I deserve better but I see her quite often as we live near one another and I can't help but still feel hurt and a part of me still misses her. We were quite sexually active together and i think thats whats making me miss her more. I know I won't probably move on straight away but I don't know why I'm still hurting over someone that is so toxic for me. 

I blocked her on social media a few months back but was debating to whether unblock her or not. I do feel like I have enough anger for the way she treated me to be able to ignore her. I do still feel angry over the situation, not sure if that's normal or not. 

I have my own auto detailing business which I run on the side of my career and on the weekend, I have a social media page for it and I have set it as a public profile because it is only for business content and I never out anything personal on it. A few days ago I put up a story on that page regarding a job I was working on and noticed she had viewed all of the stories that I posted, I found it weird that she did this because she unfollowed my business page when we broke up and hasn't paid attention to it in the last 11 months. 

I sometimes feel sad as I'm alone and haven't dated anyone since her, I often see her around and feel as though I miss her but I know those feelings are only from loneliness so I have every intention of staying away from her. I've tried keeping myself distracted by focusing on my career and business, she has tried messaging me a couple months back by sending some charity chain messages although they could be her way of breadcrumbing?

I always see her around as we live near one another, there were times where I used to try and get her attention because I missed her but now I just feel angry because I feel like I let her get away with a lot. 

I saw her a few days ago and she saw me too and she messaged straight after saying 'hope your good', i don't understand why would she do that

I keep seeing her around and I know deep down I know I shouldn't let her get away with treating me do badly even though I miss her, will she ever regret acting the way she did?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7512643,public,self,I miss her but do I deserve better?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yrsscy/i_miss_her_but_do_i_deserve_better/,all_ads,6,,

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I have very bad ocd and it all revolves around SA . This all started in 2017 ( no history of ever being raped or anything) my ocd latched on to this and tried to convince me that consensual times were actually not consensual.

Basically what happened was me and my boyfriend (current boyfriend of 8 years and this happened 4 years ago) we’re laying in bed I don’t even remember the details bc my ocd is made me obsess over this for so long- but he asked if I wanted to have sex I didn’t really mind if we did or not but my ocd was like say no so I said to him maybe later! And then a lil later he said can I just put it in and not have sex and I was like yes sure! (enthusiastic there was no coresion or anything if I had said no he wouldn’t care as he has never pressured me to do anything ) Then after that we were just laying there(he did NOT just randomly start haveing sex w me we were just laying there pretty sure he was falling asleep)  and I asked him are we gonna have sex? And he was like mmm and started moving bc I asked if we were gonna have sex and my ocd in my mind was like u must ask him again if u want to have sex and get a yes or no answer and r u even allowed to have sex bc u said maybe later earlier and I didnt even care that’s why I asked if he wanted to have sex in the first place bc my ocd was like u need a yes or no answer and I was having all these intrusive thoughts  so I asked him again and turned so I stopped the sex basically and said r we having sex yes or no??? And he said yea it feels good so I said okay. (Bc my ocd was saying I needed him to say yes or no in order to continue having sex) And then we had sex and like normal whatever. My ocd is telling me somehow this is bad and putting in details that never happened bc I have my ruminating about it and get so triggered bc my ocd is so bad telling me something really bad actually happened even tho I’m pretty sure nothing bad happened at all I was just having all these crazy intrusive thoughts - I was trying to ignore them and just have sex like a normal person. I even had a whole conversation with my boyfriend about this (he is very supportive and understands my ocd at the time during this  event I didn’t tell him I was having ocd about all this stuff bc I hadn’t been diagnosed yet and I honestly thought I was going crazy with all these Intrusive thoughts  ) and he confirmed that I asked him if we were gonna have sex and that is what initiated it and then I asked him again and said okay cool bc my ocd made me ask again. and my mind keeps twisting it and turning it to make it seem like something else happened.

BUT I WANTED IF going 50/50 in asian, Indian, Hispanic, PACIFIC ISLANDERS, MIDDLE EASTERN communities or is the man less than a man if he asks for this dynamic regardless of how the world is not same anymore. 

The sad part is that this world is not the same anymore given inflation, war, wages, cost of goods, which is why we cannot continue to function on the same line of thinking regarding who shares financial problems and transactions in the relationship.

M pays for the car insurances, petrol, and electricity and gas. 
I have ‘lent’ him money several times throughout this year. 

I have no problems with the costs being 75% (me) and 25% M, but I just don’t know where his money disappears off to. When I was not contributing I was saving and he could see my account. But he is rather secretive about his own accounts. 
I know he lent some of his friends some money, and has been trying to get into crypto (with no success). 
He also has a drinking problem but that never affected his finances before.

Ldr bf gave me some attitude about a conversation of schooling and made me feel super judged and insecure. 
I want to have more open conversations about our academic struggles but I can't help but feel sensitive and scared of the potential judgement/dissapointment and it's made me feel more withdrawn from our relationship. 

My bf (25M) and I (25M) were having a conversation about how tough school was. He's in 1st year law and I'm in my last year in forestry. We were talking about how challenging school was, I asked him mindlessly, are your readings difficult and he gave me a bit of attitude with his response. He said ""these readings are dense and difficult and it's 80pages long for 1 lecture, I'm not like you who struggles to write 500 words"". 

Admittedly, he has helped edited my papers and school isn't my strong suit. I suppose if I were hand in a paper, I'd get 75% on my own vs when he has helped edit, it's gotten to 80%. He used to be in communications and frequently would have to turn in papers, while I probably have turn in 1-3 papers the entire term. I haven't been ungrateful about him helping me out during those times and I would treat him to a meal or somewhere nice afterwards. But it did sting, because it felt like what I'm studying now felt like it was nothing compared to his courses. 

This conversation happened over a month ago, but it's really hindered our conversations about school. I know we don't have talk about it all the time, but it's what we're doing most of the time. I still try to ask how's he's doing and always acknowledge how tough his program is, but when he asks about me about school I sort of calm up now. I haven't been the best student and I definitely am embarrassed/anxious talking about it, so I usually don't like to share how I'm doing. I'm not the best student academically and through experience alone I've had people pity me or made me feel pathetic about my grades. The handful of times I've opened up to my bf about it, it's mostly been discern, and after our conversation last month, it's made me feel extremely pathetic about school. I think he views it as if I'm not trying in school (ex.not studying enough), which isn't true, I study every chance I get (on my commute, between my work breaks, scarificing sleep). I can't help but feel judged about how well I'm performing academically and I know some of it is just my own insecurities too. 

I don't want to paint him completely as terrible, because I have unknowingly given off condescending comments about his university experience in the first month when he was meeting new people. I compared a lot of new experiences to when I was freshmen at my university. I wasn't aware that there wasn't a lot of campus activities at his old university so it came off as elitist. I have shut that down since then because it wasn't my intention. I was trying find commonality but it came off as dismissive. So I fully acknowledge I was an asshole for that. 

Throughout our relationship I've always offered positive encouragement about his academics, (ex.acknowledging how tough it could be, words of encouragement, helping him plan, giving him space to study, canceling our meetups so he can focus on school). I even helped edit his application that got him into law school. 
I want to open up to him about what's going on or just talk about it more casually but I just can't anymore? The potential judgment or disappointment scares the fuck out of me and I end up calming up. 

Am I just overreacting to the entire conversation? I know I'm stuck on it since I can't seem to dismiss it even though a month has gone by. I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be but I can't help but be sour sometimes and it's making me even more sad because I don't want to give him attitude back either.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7512574,public,self,bf's comment making me feel withdrawn,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yrski0/bfs_comment_making_me_feel_withdrawn/,all_ads,6,,

When we signed the lease and moved in around August, one of my roommates was the only one with a car. Let’s call them “B”. B’s car is a slightly older model, and the car that I just bought is a little bit on the newer side. Think 2007 Toyota car vs 2015 Lexus car. I actually bought a car because they were being difficult when letting me borrow their car. 

I want to bring my car, but B has been using the parking pass since we moved in.

There is zone street parking where you can pay $25 for a permit parking pass for the year. I called the city and they said that there are two permit parking passes left that’s allocated for our building. I was thinking of buying one for my car and one for theirs (I’d fully cover all costs).  

Is there any way I could approach them to see if we can work out a parking arrangement? 

Maybe one where we switch every month on who gets to park inside the garage and on the street. Is that too unreasonable of a request? I’m not really sure what the norm is for these types of situations. 

My primary concern was that I saw a brand new BMW get hit on the street near my apartment a few weeks ago (I live in a college town), and that’s made a little worried of any potential hit and runs. Since I’m still in college, I’m not sure how much I’d be able to afford if I needed to repair my car with a hit and run. I’m not worried really about convenience of parking in the garage vs outside—it’s more just for safety. 

I’d normally straight up ask B if they’d be willing to work out an arrangement, but I recently found out that B had been talking shit about me to our other roommates, so it’s a bit of a delicate situation. I’m just not sure how to approach them, and any advice would be appreciated!

My (22f) Boyfriend (35m) of over a year is currently being sued by my old ex best friend Seren (21f). 
My boyfriend and I known each other for over a decade and he asked me out last year which made me feel so special. 

Seren ended our friendship in April after I was incredibly nasty to her, our mutual friends sided with her and dumped me too. I didn't tell my BF why our friendship fell apart but I said we grew apart. I still had other friends so he didn't really question it. 
We were at a pumpkin party last month and so were my former friends with Seren. 

They constantly looked at us like we are scum and laughed ( seren didnt do that, she just spend time with a guy at the bar) when they saw us Dance. My BF hated that so he drank 3 times more then usual so he can ignore it. 
He was a bully victim and has severe depression so he doesn't react well when people insult him.

The party ended after he got into a argument with Seren. BF accused Seren that she spread bad rumors about us and Seren defended herself saying it was my fault. 
He punched her in the face with a stone and in self defense she broke his nose. 


My boyfriend is NOT violent. He doesn't even like swearing and it was 1000% the alcohol and his anti depression meds. I confessed that I lied to him and said the actual reason. He is pissed and said if he knew he wouldn't have drank like an idiot. 

His parents refuse to help him and Seren is talking to lawyers to sue BF. We live in a small town and Seren her family is incredibly rich, her uncle is the owner of the company my BF works at and he js scared of losing his job. 

My BF blames me for this and said that if I don't convince Seren to drop the charges it is over. 

I saw her today and tried to talk to her at a bakery but she started shaking. The wound my BF gave her gives me the shivers and not going to lie. I am even doubting our relationship if he is capable of hurting someone this bad. 
She has a huge bandaid over her eye and she is could have gone blind. I can't even blame her thats the worst part. I want to tell myself it wasn't that bad but it is. It is that bad. 

I want to say it isn't his fault but it is.
For some reason my heart still loves him though.


I don't know what to do. My old mutuals insult me and tell me to suffer the consequences, other friends tell me to run and some say to give him a chance. Seren still has me blocked since April. She apparently told the others to drop it and they did. I still have one friend who is in contact with seren and she is apparently in incredible pain and can't sleep. My heart hurts more for her then my BF and I don't know if that is good or bad. 


 I know I was a bad friend I don't need people to tell me that but what do I do with my BF?? 
We don't live together but I can't seem to go a day without talking to him. He makes me feel special.

I only started catching feelings later on in the year and asked him to MD (S.A version of prom for seniors) which he accepted and thats when we exchanged phone numbers. He was unresponsive most of the time which made me doubt him ever having feelings for me.
During the MD i confessed and he said he felt the same, which came as a shock to me and the day after (like 2am at his friends afterparty) we made it official on the 2nd october. (Its his first relationship )

Here's where the confusion comes in:
After that day I thought he'd communicate with me more online but nope it was still the same level of unresponsiveness as before. I addressed the matter which he gave reasons to and apologized and said he would try to communicate with me more, he did get better as the days went on. 
We saw each other on many occasions with friends over the month of october which made me forget about it until we started writing our finals (Biggest exams for seniors around this time) where he became unresponsive again - understandable - 

Yess I 100% understand that he is busy studying ,I am too 
but even before the exams began I've always had to text first or we wouldnt text for days, We never called, he either leaves me on read or doesnt read it at all but replies to group chats, no goodnight or goodmorning texts, no pet names, i do all the checking up and all of this brings me to tears everytime i think about because i feel as if he isn't trying.
I keep telling myself to wait until the exams are done to see if he'll get better or how he is better in person and how he is probably still not fully eased in on having a relationship.

-He is very affectionate in person and the sweetest person i know and there is a HUGE difference between him online and in person-

My problem lies with the fact that we wont be seeing each as much like we did in school next year because of uni and etc, so that means we'll have to interact online more.

Hi, everyone. My friend (23F) told me a few months ago that she is in an abusive relationship. Both my roommate and I are abusive survivors so I spoke with her and we offered for her to move in with us. Before my friend could make her decision, her gf (22F) kicked her out thinking she had nowhere to go and would come back, but now she lives with me (24F). A few weeks ago she decided to get back with her but she has no intentions of moving back in. I realized before she got back together with her gf that I was going to develop feelings for her but repressed those once they got back together. Supporting her and helping her become independent is more important than whatever I might feel. 

The other night, she told me for about the hundredth time that her gf is jealous of me and thinks I have a crush on her. I told her that I'm not allowing myself to feel romantically for her and that I would never pursue her while she's in a relationship or while she is dependent on me for housing, food, etc. but that I would 100% want to be with her if the circumstances were different. I was shocked to find out that she feels the same: she said that if she weren't with her gf she would want to be with me and that it upsets her when her gf brings it up bc she thinks about me more. I don't know how to react to this information bc I was not expecting any reciprocation and only addressed it bc I wanted to be honest. She said if we developed feelings for each other then it would be complicated and really hard for all of us involved, but I think it already is now that she told me this information, especially bc it's obvious we're both repressing how we feel rather than not having feelings at all. I'm not sure why she told me honestly and she's been at her gf's the last few days. They had plans for her to stay over before we had this conversation.

Before I wasn't thinking of it this way, I didn't have feelings for her when everything first happened and she moved in, but I want her to leave her for me and I understand even less why she's still working on this relationship. It feels like she has one foot in her new life and one in her old life and its so saddening to have gotten her out only for her to get back in the relationship and be exposed to more manipulation and abuse. I understand it bc I've also loved abusers, but I'm at that point in my healing where I judge people on how they've shown they are capable of treating me and don't leave room for chances. If they change, they can healthily love someone else, but their chance is gone with me. 

I don't know exactly what advice I'm looking for bc I don't think there's much I can do and I don't want to exert any control over the situation, I respect her autonomy and her relationship no matter how much I disapprove of it. I think it might help to gain some perspective from others. Even if she did leave her for me, I would want to wait months for her to heal and become more independent before engaging in anything romantic with her. I genuinely care about her, I'd even say love her, and I just want what's best for her and to handle this situation in the healthiest, most ethical way possible.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7512532,public,self,My best friend/roommate told me she has feelings for me and is in a relationship with someone else.

We have a long distance relationship across countries and see each other four times a year. In the past one year and one month conversations about how we will meet to end the long distance relationship has not been possible because we have no plans to move to the same country and be together. Personally, I live in a foreign country on a study visa with the option to being a permanent resident being that I finish my studies, secure a job and work in the said country for 31 months before getting a permanent residency that allows me continuous stay without worries of being deported. I told my girlfriend this situation will not allow us move our relationship to the next stage as we still live different countries and have no plans to move together to same country. We mutually agreed to break up as a result of this. However five days later she called to say we should get back together and figure each step as it comes. I disagreed and told her we need to make a decision and start working towards it. We have a big problem of moving countries for each other because she doesn't speak the language in the country I live in and I don't speak the language in the country she lives in. It's one month now and I cannot think of anything than to be with her even if we have to keep being in a long distance and make the compromise of moving countries for each other. 

The reason for the first break up was that at the moment of being in the relationship I was not ready to be in a relationship as I was going through a rough patch in my life.

This is very much a boundary for me. I tried very hard to not let their past behaviour dictate how they are now. But I think I'm struggling with the fact that we clearly are of very different mindsets. I would never engage in drugs because I personally just cannot condone it but they said they basically did enjoy it and were planning on never taking them again...for me. (which I know should makes me feel good and respected but instead is only making me feel like we are more different than I thought)  
I only had two rules for my self: 1. don't compromise on your values. 2. don't tolerate abuse.   
I feel That by not being honest with this person and being upfront about the fact that I'm struggling to get past this revelation of theirs I'm violating Rule no. 1. 

I know everyone has stuff in their past they are not proud of. But usually that stuff isn't highly illegal substances and usually they're not 'okay' with it. 

Also I'm trying to rationalise and not rush into anything. I feel sad and wonder if anyone else has gone through this before? What was your experience? 

My gut is telling me to call it off and not settle for something that is clearly making me uncomfortable. On the other hand...will I ever find 'the one'.  I already feel old and sort of undesirable.

My Dad left when I was 4 years old (Still remember the day he left). We kept in contact via phone from time to time, and he visited once or twice, and I visited him once (I live in MA and he lives in FL). I wouldn't say we are close, though he does try to make a connection with me, probably more than I do the other way (perhaps I hold a grudge, perhaps I'm simply not as interested...I'm not certain).  Here are a couple pieces of information on my Dad, and about me, that are helpful for context.

1. He emigrated from Jamaica to live with my Mom (he then subsequently left and moved to Florida)

2. He was in a car accident and badly hurt his leg, rendering him to a cane (which he still carries). He receives disability payments from the government as a result.

3. He fathered 3 other children besides me, of which, none he raised himself.

4. My mom is a strong woman, an attorney, and had her own business so she was able to provide pretty well for me, without any child support payments from him.

5. My mom’s side of the family is pretty well off. My grandmother had 6 kids (my mom’s the oldest), and she was able to help (not pay for the majority, but still monetarily help) all of her 7 grandchildren with college…of which I was one of those grandchildren

I am now 34 years old living on my own, trying to progress in my life and focus on building a relationship with my girlfriend and saving money goes into that. I am relatively financially savvy, and make a pretty good salary (right around $100k). My Mom and Dad talk on the phone sometimes, and I think he 'caught wind' that I am doing well at my job. He asked me for money when he went on a trip to Africa. I felt compelled to help out…it was a once in a lifetime trip for him. I gave him $300.00

A couple phone calls back and forth over the months (I sent him a card for Father’s Day) and he says ‘don’t send me a card with no money in it’). It really rubbed me the wrong way – growing up with an absentee Father…he never sent me cards with money in them when I was a KID. Why should I now have to send money to HIM in a card?? A grown ass adult.

I suppose in his point of view, I grew up the easy way…he didn’t have it easy and grew up without a father himself, in a much poorer environment. The fact that he sired me I think he feels entitled to (a portion) of my money. I can’t say for certain but that is an inkling I have.

He recently asked me for ‘pocket money’ for a trip he’s taking back to Jamaica. One of my cousins is getting married and he’ll be staying for a month. He says ‘I’m not going to tell you how much – I don’t do that’. Very irritating to me….like it’s something I’m obligated/expected to do. 

He also asked about some land that my mom owns in Jamaica…that she bought when she lived down there when she met my Dad. I fear he is angling to get a portion of that down the line. Perhaps I’m wrong, but the way he brought it up like it was for my own good that I should inquire with my Mom on it..just didn’t sit right

My questions for you are:

1. Am I callous for feeling VERY reluctant to continue sending him money

2. Do I need to see things more from his perspective? Or is my view that you should ‘lay in the bed you made’ justified

3. What morally do I have an obligation to do with him in this instance, and down the line. I have a feeling he is just going to be a ‘hanger-on’ down the line . He doesn’t have contact with my other 2 half sisters, and my half brother has 2 kids of his own. What do I need to be cognizant of as my life progresses with him.

4. Do I need to communicate with him more about these things? He is old school and though he is wise (man of God) he is uneducated…I think some of his ideas and thinking is old fashioned (I.E. he hates gays)  so I don’t know how he will react.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7512506,public,self,Should I (34M) give money to my (impoverished) Dad (63M) for a trip he's taking back to his home country,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yrsbkf/should_i_34m_give_money_to_my_impoverished_dad/,all_ads,6,,

So I have this issue that some might think is a ”typical man vs wife” problem. I’m very emotionally open and need lots of listening and emotional support if I’m feeling down. My husband on the other hand is the type to want solid solutions and then stop wallowing about it. Usually that’s fine and he is also able to support me in his own way emotionally too, but recently it’s not been enough. 

So at the moment I am unusually stressed. I’m slammed with school work and also have money issues that require me to get a part time job and that’s been weighing heavy on me since I’m so busy already. My husband already pays for most things since I’m not able to and am still studying, but has helped me out when he can in my personal finance problems. I have some debt I’m paying off that is my most crushing stressor at the minute and we don’t make enough money to just pay it off right away. 

Well today I came home after a particularly busy day and I had just calculated my finances for next month, which was super depressing. I went straight to him to vent and was sort of listing off my sorrows. He listened and offered concrete solutions like he typically does. I thanked him and told him I’m not actually too worried about the solutions since I know what I need to do, I’m more needing emotional support, because the stress of it felt crushing. He tried, but he can’t really get past his attitude of ”let’s not wallow in negative feelings if we know what to do about it”. To me it felt dismissive, though I know it’s not his intention. I felt like my partner can’t meet my needs in a situation like this and it sucked. He just doesn’t want to hear the cloud of negativity just for the sake of going over it and not to give solutions. 

I want to know from others, do you think it’s too much to expect to get the type of emotional support from a man where he just listens to me vent and tells me encouragements and and reassurances? Should I look for that stuff in my other relationships like friends or family? I find that it’s typically easier to get that from another woman, but at the same time I’d love for that need to be met by my husband. He says though that he feels like he isn’t able to give me what I want in those moments and it ends up with me critisizing him on not being any help.

Her best friend suddenly said that she doesn't do tame things like dancing, she directly kisses people. My girlfriend and her other friends didn't believe her.

Its not like I got mad over it or yelled at my girlfriend about it or anything. I just feel very uncomfortable with it and I expressed this fact to her. I told her I was unsure how to react. The thing is, she feels so bad about this and that makes me feel bad for her.

I don't know what to do, I really feel like I'm overreacting. 
I know for sure that there is nothing between them and it was an in the moment and all but I can't help but feel uncomfortable.

I would also like to add that my girlfriend does not see any problem with this. She says even if I was kissing other guys, while she would be weirded out, she would be okay with it. I however am not like that.

Only a couple months into our relationship, my boyfriend became very in love with me and actually asked if I wanted to get married.  I believe that he thought I was the one for him for a long time.  We have a great time together and I feel that we are compatible and we love each other very much.  

We had one rough patch over the summer where he broke up with me because I was acting cold towards him and he stopped thinking we had a future together.  But, we've since built our relationship back up and we both agree that its stronger than its ever been.  He told me recently that his love has grown stronger for me, and that he loves me more than anyone he's ever loved before.  

However, last night we were discussing our relationship and he asked where I thought our relationship was going.  I responded that I saw us being together for a long time.  I returned the question, and he just replied ""I don't know.""  This upset me because it made me think that he ultimately doesn't see us working out in the future for some reason.  This morning he called from work and I told him I was confused/upset about his answer, and that at this point, after a year of dating, he should know where our relationship is going.  His response was ""you're absolutely right."" And that was the end of the conversation.  So, since then, I've been thinking about how to handle this.  Is it time to break things off?

Sure, most men do it - no big deal. But I just checked again randomly today, and his following count has gone up to over 1500.. over half of them being nearly naked women. Most of them are around my age, I am in my early 20s and my dad is 60. I found this to be very creepy.

I doubt my mom knows since she isn’t tech savvy and most likely does not know that you can even view someone’s following list. Ever since I checked earlier, I’ve felt a bit awkward around him and honestly a bit creeped out. I don’t know whether or not to mention this to either him or my mother, or just leave it alone altogether. 

If anyone else has been through something similar, advice/opinions would be greatly appreciated.

I am looking on advice on whether I should stay or go?

We been together for several years on and off, this time I put a ring on it cause I was madly in love with her but I'm not happy anymore as we live together and I take on most of the bills even one or two of hers. Financially we are barely making it. (She can't work currently due to health issues). We get heated over the simple stuff like house chores even though I'm tired from my job as its hours vary.

This year has been a tough one as a family member lost their life to a battle with an illness and I haven't been able to deal with it properly as I had to go work due to the financial problem but this has cause some mental issues and work has caught on that my abilities aren't as they were. (I booked more time off but scared I can't afford too)

Another issue is my spare time she asks me to do mostly what she wants as shes bored at home all day and I most of the time will do it as we enjoy similar stuff when it comes to what i want to do she doesn't seem interested or make it sound pointless sometimes.

We are intimate still a lot but not as when we first got back together... but I want something she can't give due to her bad experiences in the past so I stopped giving her the full treatment.

I've done a lot for this person they only appreciate some of what I do for them.
