When I dated other girls, they were always into talking every day all day long and I also see people around me in a relationship doing the same. My girlfriend does not mind not talking for a day or 2. Yet when I ask her how her day was at the end she replies saying she didn't do much and I suspect this is because she had a rough past which resulted in her doing therapy sessions, not being able to go to school / work and feel tired after multiple days of activities. She is slowly preparing to work again.

I asked her if she was okay with the way we do things in terms of seeing each other and if she wanted to meet more or less. She replied saying she definitely doesn't want to meet less and that space is important. I can rest knowing she is okay with the way we do things but at the same time it doesn't make me feel very ""wanted"" either which I don't really consider an issue, especially because we are intimate when we are with each other.

In July we moved to Texas for his job. This boy is the sweetest most caring man I thought I had ever met. I had such high hopes for him because he is nothing like anyone I’ve ever met. Well yesterday I found this app on my bfs phone that was one of those photo vaults you keep pictures in. When I asked him about it he freaked out and grabbed his phone and couldn’t say anything. I started crying asking him to show me and he just kept apologizing and had this stupid ass look of fear on his face. I asked him why he would do this to me. He opened it and I see a bunch of his exs nudes on there. I of course freak out delete them all and leave our apartment. When I come back (I was in a super toxic relationship before so if I wanna know the answer to something I always get it) I take his phone and go to his email to see when it was downloaded and he has had the app since June this year. So right before we moved to Texas together. (We had already been living together and the particular day he downloaded it was while he was in tx I was still back home, I moved about 3 weeks after he did bc of work) well I see also in his email that he paid for it even though it was a free app. After I put two and two together I realize he paid to get those pictures back.  So this means he paid 12.99 to see naked pictures of his ex. I feel so hurt and heartbroken. I honestly felt that this was so out of character for him and couldn’t believe he had done this.  I asked him why he would pay for that shit and he gives me a different answer each time and keeps saying he honestly doesn’t understand it himself. They were together for four years 8th grade till 11th and it was his first gf. He said when he saw the pictures he felt so guilty and didn’t want to go back and look at them. Then he tells me he bought them because in that moment he wanted to see if he still had feelings for her?? We had already been together for a year at that point. He said he didn’t feel any feelings for her when he seen them only guilt.  I asked why he kept them and he gave me multiple different answers also: idk, I kept them incase I ever had a doubt again that I might have feelings so I could look back and prove I dont, I was too guilty to go back and delete them… those are the ones that stuck out to me can’t remember what else he said.  
He tells me it’s nothing I did and he never doubted his love for me he just needed to be fair to me and tell me if he still had feelings for her (he claims he did/does not). 
He’s trying to tell me he would never do anything to hurt me again and wants a second chance. I’m so hurt and I either just don’t say anything or tell him to get away or drill him asking him why he did this. Like I said I thought he was the perfect boyfriend before this and our relationship was healthy or so I thought it was. I’ve never had that before so part of me wants to hold on but I am so hurt.

I couldn’t cope and kept asking for ways to get over it, as there was a lot of lying involved and I’m still not sure if I was given them full story, and they had stayed with partners who had cheated on them before. This led to a larger argument, lots of harsh things were said and we almost ended things. Since then we’ve been trying to work to move past it. I have days where it affects me, and I get sad for awhile. I recently started new antidepressants and am on track to start therapy, and they’ve been helping. I’ve stopped bringing it up as much, and I thought things were going to start improving. However, my partner has still be distant. They seem to have a death grip on their phone since the whole situation happened, and they’ve been avoiding serious conversations (talks on feelings or plans of the future past holidays with family), and not committing to plans. There have also been a few weird occurrences in regards to intimacy:

1) A few weeks ago we had sex before we were planning to go somewhere. And it was really intense and passionate. I needed a minute to recoup and wanted to cuddle for a second after, but while I was cleaning up in the bathroom they had gotten dressed and were like, “are you ready to go?”. This was within 10 minutes of finishing, and the rest of the night seemed really distant and awkward. 
2) We went on our first date in months last week and they seemed completely disconnected and fidgety, and we didn’t really talk for the rest of the night following. We didn’t argue and I tried to still have a good time, but afterwards just really caught me off-guard. 
3) They had been trying to do something at home, together as a couple. But our schedules kept getting in the way. Last night we actually had time to do it after I finished dinner, but instead they spent the whole night doing something else and never brought it up again. 
4) As I said, this week I started new anti-depressants. And I’ve notice if I get up and have a snack during the night, I wake up completely disoriented. Today was no different. I woke up as they were getting ready for work, and didn’t say much while they were getting things together and got extremely irritated with me. They thought I was mad for some reason, and told me they didn’t have time for this and were going to be late. They continued to seem like they were mad at me. I texted them to let them know that wasn’t the case and that I was sorry and they just still seem mad.

Many Reddit users asked for an update.  A summary, my mother invited my mother-in-law to Thanksgiving dinner with the family (we live with my parents) after asking my husband if it was OK.  He said OK but has since changed his mind.  My mother-in-law left her family for a coworker when my husband was 10.  It really hurt him badly.  I also hate cheaters with a passion because of how my first real relationship ended.  My mother-in-law’s sister, his aunt, really was my husband’s substitute mother.

My husband and I read the comments. Many were helpful, but some surprisingly nasty.  We decided to follow some of the advice.

My husband and I agreed that we should un-invite his mother.  We called her Sunday evening.  My husband has never called his mother before and she was surprised.  He told her that he didn’t want her to come because she wasn’t really family.  My MIL broke down and cried.  She admitted everything.  She was an adulterer who sinned in the eyes of God and betrayed her family, especially her son.  She abandoned them for another man who ended up turning her out when he got tired of her.  She took total fault for her actions.  She said her ex-husband was a kind man without blame.  Her both asked for forgiveness and said she didn’t deserve to be forgiven.  She tried to reconnect with my husband’s FIL several times but she had done far too much damage.

My husband offered to see her with out the kids, at least for now.  She has a standing offer from her sister, who lives a little over an hour from us, to stay for Thanksgiving.  We told her we could visit and talk over Thanksgiving weekend to work on things.  She thanked Jesus for the opportunity to try to make up with her son and seek forgiveness. She sounded very sincere and pensive. 

My husband and I will meet with her at my husband’s aunt.  Forgiveness is at the center of our Christian beliefs, Jesus was clear in John 8, let who is without sin cast the first stone at the adulteress. We also understand that her husband just died after a long with cancer this last January.  

BUT, my MIL is the same woman who hurt my husband deeply.  My own experience with cheaters tells me not to trust them.  Just because we are told by the Gospels to forgive, which my husband may do, it doesn’t mean we have to give the person who betrayed my husband the same chance with my two sons.

( I apologize for the long post. Dealing with lots of emotions here. TL;DR at the bottom)

  
I'm seeking some input and potential advice/support from those that have been through something similar. I have been married for 11 years to a beautiful, driven, and amazing woman. We have had a lot of ups and downs, but all in all, I've considered myself very lucky to have her. The issues within our marriage start about 5 years ago, and have increased in varying amounts over the years.

In the beginning of our relationship, I took up working at a local production plant to make enough money to put my wife through school. Once she completed school, we agreed that I become a stay at home father for our 3 children so that she could continue to pursue her dream of opening her own business, starting by renting space at a local business, and finally opening her own store front 5 years ago. At this same time 5 years ago, I also began working as a substance abuse counselor for a local Mental Health agency, as our children were all in school and I was no longer needed to stay home. 

I became worried around the time that we purchased her current building, as she became immediately overwhelmed by the work that was required to complete the remodel on this space. Additionally, she did not want to hire an outside contractor to do the work, which meant the work fell on myself and her father. I would work 10 hour shifts through out the week, and then turn around and wake up at 6:00am Sat/Sun to work another 10-12 hours on the remodel. While the remodel itself was very challenging and time consuming, I knew the work would eventually end, with the finished product being a space my wife could be proud of. This remodel created MASSIVE conflict between us: I admit that at times I was very burned out and struggled to find the energy to commit to the remodel after a full week of work, which lead to moments where she would accuse me of not being supportive (bare in mind: I am also the primary caretaker in the house. I make the meals, do the dishes, and generally tend to spend time with the children while she works on her business stuff). My wife has always had very intense emotional reactions, and since this period of time, my wife has been resentful towards me for my apparent unwillingness to assist in the remodel since this time....despite the fact that I was there every weekend, regardless of how rundown I felt. I know I needed to work on my willingness to be there at times, and I did the best that I could while trying to balance all that I have on my plate. She's never let go of this idea that I never supported her and didn't ever want her to open her business. This is blatantly false: Her drive to chase her dreams is part of what attracted me to her. 

Fast forward to 2022, and I hardly feel as tho I have a wife anymore. Since the doors opened on her business, it has been one year to next of watching her get seemingly further and further away from me and our children. She is very successful in this business, but it has lead to an overwhelming amount of stress for her, that is then passed on to us: Multiple nights of her isolating in her bed room listening to podcasts on how to maximize revenue, how to be a better entrepreneur. Multiple weekends of trips we've taken as a family, only to have her spend the vast majority of her time on phone creating posts for social media to bring in more clients. When we go on dates, she is typically on her phone working, only putting it down when I ask if she can focus on us for a minute. When she gets off work, she typically comes home, enjoys the meal I made, and goes right back to work in our bedroom, often falling asleep in the middle of a project, only to wake up a 3:00am and continue working where she left off. She's snapped on me numerous times, often accusing me of holding her back or being ""too much"" when i ask for some of her attention ( i'm not a needy guy, but I dont think asking for an hour of her time here and there to watch a documentary or go on a walk with me is a big ask). She treats her employees and clients like gold, showering them with gifts, adoration, even trying to assist in lining them out with mental health support when needed, not to mention trips out of town for team building while myself and the kids get the left overs of her time at the end of the day....and we are lucky if there is any of her left for us at all. 

I've been told numerous times that she is working on being home more....but typically I only ever feel like she is home less. She listens to these podcasts that talk about ""manifesting"" and ""if you just work this hard, in XYZ months you could be set for life if you implement this one thing"" only to end up needing to work HARDER while giving our money to these coaches that brag about this lifestyle they live, but I don't ever see them spending time with their families either. I feel like our kids and myself are at the bottom of her list of priorities and I am so torn between being a good husband and supporting my wife to chase her dreams, while also being a man that desires affection and to feel desired....I feel I support her, I tell her daily how amazing I think she is, and how proud I am of her for what she's achieved....but I do not feel desired, or even wanted by her anymore. I feel like I am a footnote in her life, that I was a means to and end she no longer needs. 

What do I do? I miss her so much, even tho she's passed out next to me every  night....I feel a thousand miles away from her. She was my hiking partner, my best friend, my documentary buddy, so many things....that all stopped once she started this business. I know its hard work, i know it takes time, but I have to believe somewhere in there is supposed to be room for fer family too? i don't even know what to feel anymore. Any input/advice would be greatly appreciated. I do not want to divorce her, but I also cannot keep a marriage afloat alone. What advice do you redditors have?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My wife opened a successful business 5 years ago, and since thing has become increasingly distant and detached from our marriage. She went from my best friend to someone that seems so distant that she's hundreds of miles away even when she's right next to me.

This might be when he perceives me to have done something wrong or when something else (not relationships-related) may have gone wrong in his life. Most recently I put something in the 'wrong place' and he subsequently hurt himself. He wanted me to instantly apologise but I felt he was overreacting and that it was just an accident. I disputed what the proper place for the item was. 

He then gave me the silent treatment for a whole day and cancelled our plans. He has a lot of rules and wants me to do things in a certain way, it seems like there is always a gripe he has with my way of doing things in the house and when that problem gets solved he finds something else to complain about. I apologise A LOT to keep the peace and do a lot in the house - I felt like this was an overreaction and quite frankly I'm just fed up of apologising for things that are not a big deal. 

We've been together for 3 years and the silent treatment has become his go-to. i've communicated in the past that I can't bear this and it makes me anxious that something I say or do is going to piss him off and then the whole day will be ruined because of it, like our plans today. I said it was a dealbreaker and he understood and said he would work on that, which he has done but now I feel him slipping into his old ways. 

I feel it is manipulative behaviour but he says it's me that being manipulative by forcing him to talk to me when he doesn't want to. I'm very much a person who says if something is upsetting me and I'd prefer to talk it through rather than let it fester. The pattern usually goes him getting annoyed with me, going silent, me asking what the problem is, either me apologising or not and then him cancelling plans or choosing to sit in another room for hours playing video games which makes me feel very ostracised. 

My go to is to try and talk it out but he refuses to engage. I've learnt to walk away in most cases and ride it out but sometimes I can't bear it (esp when he holds plans to ransom) and then things escalate. It always ends with voices raised and him inevitably saying I'm crazy or a psycho because I won't leave him alone etc. Today he raised his voice so loudly to purposely make sure our neighbours heard him say that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living here for a little over a year and started hooking up with this guy two months ago. He's not my usual type (personality-wise) but we had nice conversations and I was physically really attracted to him. Then we started spending more time together, even just hanging out without having sex. He's respectful, kind, and romantic and really brings out a sweeter side in me that I don't see that often. We started having emotionally intimate moments and they've continued to get more intense over time. 

The massive problem, though, is that I'm moving back to my home country in 8 months for graduate school (so for at least 4-6 years). I usually would just allow the relationship to progress naturally but my leaving gives us an expiration date that we can't avoid. 

At first, this was a good thing because I was able to explore a connection with someone I never would have been interested in otherwise. I'm quite logical and he's quite emotional. I'm in the STEM world and he's pursuing music. I'm a homebody and he's a social butterfly. I'm starting a graduate program soon and he just started at university. To be honest, I'm a stoner and he's a drinker (which I think is pretty fitting lol). Basically, knowing I'm leaving allowed me to look beyond our deeper differences and enjoy something casual.

Now that we've really (and surprisingly) found a connection with each other, my head and my heart are at war with each other. My heart tells me he's exciting, and that his emotional vulnerability and his vastly different background will help me get in touch with a more sentimental side of myself. My head tells me to keep my emotional walls up because I'm leaving permanently and our differences are too extreme.

Three months into our relationship, I brought him home to meet my parents for the first time. While my dad had a good impression of him, my mom disliked him a lot.

This lasted until earlier this year after we had the biggest fight ever. After our last fight, she stopped bringing up the topic of breaking up with my bf, and I never mentioned him again too.

The first 5 months were fantastic, we were so happy and nothing could make our happiness go away. We had 2 months of vacation where in we did not see eachother that much as we were normal. I think during the 2 months vacation we saw eachother about 5 times. So in september new schoolyear, we did not see eachother for 2 weeks, first day at school, she is realy insecure about herself and did not know if she had still feelings. Her head was going from here to there because school fucks her up(she wants more challenge at school bcs she is gifted, and our school would not give her the necessary challenges, but would support the people who could not follow, but not the people who could follow easily, this started in the mid of April/22). She has this feeling for many years now but it fully broke her down a few months ago bcs she was bullied a long time and that finnally finished. So now school became to easy and it when again downhill with her mental health. Tis was last year, and she came in September to school with the toughts like yeah it is going to be the same(in fairness the school fixed nothing, whilst her parents raised the alarm that something needded to change) and so the first schoolday with the toughts that she did not want to go to school, were there and never went away, it ate all of her confidence. She needs rest and the vacation did not gave that to her bcs she was always thinking that school would suck. So from begin september up to this day she still goes to school everyday with the motivation that its boring and she is always so unhappy and down, that speaking in a normal manner to her is difficult because her answers are always so depressive if there are any. This puts stress on our relationship bcs she would has frustrations about school and would break down and that day after day. She comes home not wanting to study, making everything last minute and in that way she blocks every moment we could meat each other outside off school. I think we met about 10 times outside school since begin September. Before the summerbreak we saw eachother each weekend. We had a tradition off giving eachother a hug and a kiss every morning at school. But that is now gone, bcs many mornings she could not give it (many reasons)  we try to do it again but its hard because a lot of evenings it ends with her feeling gilty bcs I am always there for here and she can never do something back for me.  The morning after she feels gilty and can't hug me for that reason. I am scared of losing her because when she the moments she is happy she is such a nice person to be around and I am still proud of her, but she is always angry at herself for taking me on this path when I chose it myself to follow this path. We both love eachother deeply, but it is only going down and down. I think she has several charachteristics of depression. We were such a great couple, and now we are a shadow of what we used to be.  What can I maybe do to support her, give her tips,....? After 3 months of seeing my girlfriend cry I am getting lost, I dont know how other people do it. Nothing helps.

Because of this everyone who does customer service has to do a split shift. Half the people work the morning and off afternoon other half do morning off and work afternoon.(8-12 or 12-4:00)

My team consisted of 4 people. We agreed we'd switch off holidays so you'd work morning one holiday and the next you'd have morning off. I kind of assumed we were continuing that even though we lost 1 person and gained 2. 

My boss sends out a mass email to everyone in my department and said we needed to figure out what we were working. One of my co-workers always wants either a day off or to work the morning. Last holiday she worked the morning and I worked late. She also requested the week of Christmas off in July.  She sent around an email asking everyone's preferences. Within 15 minutes the table was totally filled out. She and 2 others on my team are working the morning(she put ""if possible"" next to her afternoon off) and me and my co-worker J are working the afternoon. J immediately responds saying he's sorry but he actually has that Tuesday and Wednesday off. She sends a revised table out and put him as off and removes the ""if possible"" that was beside afternoon off. Meaning I'm covering 4 people's desk not including my own for the afternoon. Granted it'll probably be pretty slow, but it's still a lot for just me to cover.

When someone is off your covering your part of their desk(ie, emails, orders, order software ect.) which we preassigned. When it's split shift you cover everything your supposed to and if the person is working afternoon you just assign their stuff. So I'll be covering 100% of 4 peoples stuff.

On top of it, my fiancé asked about Thanksgiving and I told him I thought I had afternoon off since last holiday I worked the afternoon(thinking we were still doing the every other holiday) and he was going to leave work early(something he never does) so we could make the 3 hour trek home at a reasonable time.

During that time she got divorced and I stupidly took her back a few years later, she did admit to being in multiple relationships and talking to other guys since then. But I broke it off a year ago

We got close and had some nice moments but I kept noticing how open she is with other guys and how she'd claim that every other guy was interested in her, she kept pushing me for marriage and kept blaming me for moving too slow just because I didn't want to rush in to marriage. 

Everytime we'd argue about it, she would always say that it's my fault that things are moving slow and that she doesn't like being with someone who can't commit. She would always say how she wants someone who loves her more than she loves themselves, that's not normal right?? And She always used to say that she wanted me to open up to her and tell her how I feel and that I can talk to her about anything if I'm ever upset. 

So I did when I mentioned that I didn't like how open she is with other guys, she said that she didn't want to be with anyone that's insecure just like her ex husband was (even though she'd already cheated on her ex husband with me which was unknown to me at the time, so he had a reason to feel insecure). 

I don't get why she'd tell me to talk to her about anything then end up throwing it back in my face! I told her I'm not happy so we agreed to end it, I was confused at first cos she used to tell me that she misses me everyday and after that conversation she ended up blocking me off everything at the startwhich I thought was childish.   

After we broke up she messaged me on Christmas day saying: 'I just wanted to message you to say that I hope you’re okay and that I feel as though I’m ready to stay as friends with you if that’s what you wanted.. I didn’t think I would ever be able to say that we could stay as friends but I feel like I’m in a good place and I know everything has worked out for the best and I would be really happy to have you as a friend But if you don’t want to hear from me that’s okay too just let me know x' I did reply to her saying that I don't think it's a good idea and I wished her well. She just replied with a simple 'that's fine no worries x'. I'm trying to not think about her messaging me, but I feel like I was really getting in to the healing process and was really focused on other aspects of my life such as my career. 

I know I deserve better but I see her quite often as we live near one another and I can't help but still feel hurt and a part of me still misses her. We were quite sexually active together and i think thats whats making me miss her more. I know I won't probably move on straight away but I don't know why I'm still hurting over someone that is so toxic for me. 

I blocked her on social media a few months back but was debating to whether unblock her or not. I do feel like I have enough anger for the way she treated me to be able to ignore her. I do still feel angry over the situation, not sure if that's normal or not. 

I have my own auto detailing business which I run on the side of my career and on the weekend, I have a social media page for it and I have set it as a public profile because it is only for business content and I never out anything personal on it. A few days ago I put up a story on that page regarding a job I was working on and noticed she had viewed all of the stories that I posted, I found it weird that she did this because she unfollowed my business page when we broke up and hasn't paid attention to it in the last 11 months. 

I sometimes feel sad as I'm alone and haven't dated anyone since her, I often see her around and feel as though I miss her but I know those feelings are only from loneliness so I have every intention of staying away from her. I've tried keeping myself distracted by focusing on my career and business, she has tried messaging me a couple months back by sending some charity chain messages although they could be her way of breadcrumbing?

I always see her around as we live near one another, there were times where I used to try and get her attention because I missed her but now I just feel angry because I feel like I let her get away with a lot. 

I saw her a few days ago and she saw me too and she messaged straight after saying 'hope your good', i don't understand why would she do that

I didn’t back down. He then turned the whole situation around on me and has had the audacity to tell me that I was in the wrong for acting angry and saying some of the things I said in anger. 

He has now given ME an ultimatum despite me telling him that I didn’t want to be with him either. He told me I must “Change” or remain separated. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

I told my psychologist that I don't want anything to do with men s exually because they don't appreciate the female s exual organ.

I gave examples and she told me I was wrong about all of them.

I said b lowjobs are more common than c unninglus. She said this is not true and that it's 50/50 between the genders, in hookups and all.

I said women who have male s exual organs are s exualised and popular in p ornography with h etero men while men who have female s exual organs are not popular with h etero women nor g ay men. She said the vast majority of men have no interest in the male s exual organ, t ransgender women p re op nor p ost op, l adyboys nor women who have male s exual organs.

I told her t ransgender was ranked number 10 most popular category on p ornhub's annual review for 2021 and that most would interpet that as being  h etero identifying men watching t ransgender women. She said the majority would not interpret it that way and that she still stands by what she said in the paragraph above.

I said the female s exual organ has s  tigma and is seen as more g  ross and t  aboo, and she said ""never."" I said m enstruation is also part of the reason why, she said no it's not seen as t  aboo and just as a private matter.

I said the female s exual organ is not appreciated as much as b reasts, b utts and the male s exual organ is and she said it is appreciated as much and that the others are talked about more due to varying more in size so having preferences based on that. And that the female s exual organ is seen as more intimate and special so isn't so talked about due to this too.

A few nights ago he accidentally dislocated my knee. He was picking up my dog (60lbs) and playfully slamming her into the bed like he does a lot. However, this time when his body came down onto the bed, I guess it hit my patella just right and dislocated it. It didn’t hurt too bad until I looked down and saw my kneecap on the side of my leg. I don’t have health insurance, so we were both freaking out about how I can’t go to the hospital on top of that. It snapped back into place (thankfully) but the pain hit a little stronger then, and I was a mess screaming and crying for the rest of the night.

I’m feeling a little wary about my husband’s behavior towards this situation. He’s a lot bigger than me (230 lbs vs. 115 lbs) and he can hurt me a lot without knowing. However I’ve always had trouble with drawing boundaries with this, because whenever I tell him to stop I think he ignores it and keeps doing what he’s doing. He picks the dogs up a lot and slams them, wraps them in blankets so they can’t escape, and crawls and growls at them until they’re cowering in the corner, and they usually hide behind me if he’s in one of those weird moods and they hear him stomping throughout the house. He picks me up a lot and slams me too, grabs and spanks me in the shower until I’m red, lays on top of me to a point where I can barely breathe and whispers “claustrophobia” because he knows it’s a fear of mine. I genuinely don’t think he’s abusive, I just think he doesn’t realize how much this stuff can hurt and bother me.

Whenever I confront him about it he says that this is how he gets his affection out and because I’m so “cold” he has to pry physical affection out of me. I will admit sometimes I’m not in the mood for cuddling, but I don’t think the solution is to be aggressively physical with me or the dogs. It’s to a point where I’m worried that if we have kids he will accidentally hurt them.

And back to the knee thing, the last few days he felt really off and distant. He complained about me being in bed watching TV all day and I’m like ??? I’m not going to be skipping and tossing flowers as my knee is still hurting. Right after the incident happened he apologized, but has been blaming my dog a LOT like it was her fault he picked her up and slammed her into the bed and my knee. He promised to switch out ice for me but has forgotten to do that most of the time. He also lost his wedding ring during the whole ordeal, and I’m pretty sure he’s been more distraught about that than the fact that he hurt me. He brought up that he’s going to do a physical activity with a friend today and he’s confused that I would get mad at him for suggesting I go. It seems like he’s downplaying my injury because he’s guilty he hurt me? Better to pretend it didn’t happen? Am I just overreacting to harmless behavior gone wrong?

I've been working hard to save up for the tickets but SIL gave birth before I could save up enough.

Anyway, last sunday, they held a welcome baby shower which I still couldn't attend for the very same reasons. My SIL was quiet for a moment when I broke the news but said she understood my dilemma. 

On the other hand, my brother completely blew up. He said that if I really wanted to, I could have come but since it's not a priority on my list, I'm not making the effort to come. He said that when my sister gave birth, I didn't say that I was ""busy"" and came over in a heart beat but when it was his wife's turn, I suddenly became ""busy"".

For context, I graduated college when I was 18 and now I work for the military Monday-Friday. My bf is a mamas boy &amp; she’s super obsessed with him. I don’t have a great relationship with my mom so I find their relationship excessive but I don’t know what normal is. We started dating about 5 months ago right before he started university (he took a gap year). His parents are using RESP money to put him through school and they got him a double dorm room so that he could “make friends” (it’s like a shoe box and he has a weird roommate).
ANYWAYS, since school started he’s been sleeping at my place almost every night. He goes to all his classes and he’s doing super well, but he just doesn’t want to stay the night in his dorm (it’s seriously a shit hole). His parents started to get super pissed at him about him not staying at his dorm , and I completely understand that because they’re paying for it, and also giving him hell for spending too much time with me. They’ve been threatening to stop paying his tuition unless he starts sleeping at his dorm Monday-Friday without me being there, and they’ll be doing random check-ins on him. It’s also become personal as well. I think she’s jealous that I see him more than her, it feels like she’s always trying to compete with me. She has told him that i’m weirdly clingy and manipulating him. She tries to exclude me from his plans and tells him that he’s pissing away his “university experience” on me, and that we won’t last long anyways. He’s never stood up to his mom before until recently, and she’s really not having it. 
I guess I’m just trying to figure out if we’re really spending way too much time together?  We’re not codependent or anything, we just enjoy seeing each other and it’s easier for both of us to just spend the nights together.

I’ve met him and they are very comfortable around each other, but they both insist there is nothing more, and I believe them. I’ve been with her for nearly 3 years, and we are immensely close. She doesn’t have many friends at all (he’s essentially her only close friend), and they are very good for each other. Lately however they have been spending time together, as they usually would, but she has become a lot slower with responding to my texts or calls, and sometimes vanishes for hours unannounced. 

Now, I trust her entirely, she is a lovely person, however I can’t pretend that this doesn’t worry me a little. I’m a person who struggles with depression, and it’s very easy for me to overthink in situations like this. There have been times where he has slept at hers, or the reciprocal (in different beds of course), but it’s still a little strange for me and makes me a bit anxious.

We have talked about this a lot, and the reason for them getting along so well is because essentially the only close friend each of them has is each other, so they usually have tonnes to talk and share about, making it very easy for time to escape them. She is very apologetic whenever this happens, but lately it has been getting really hard for me to rationalise the situation and stop overthinking. I’m very stressed as it is with university, and this uncertainty coming from when they are together is making it really really hard for me. 

I’ve told her this already, but not to its full extent. I’m thinking of letting her know how much it affects me, and maybe suggesting that she keeps closer contact with me, or spends less time with him as a whole. I tend to be quite an insecure person as it is, which I’m working on, but this is really setting me back quite a lot. Am I being overly clingy in this situation? Is this completely normal? Am I just overthinking again?

This situation is making me really really unhappy, and this last few days is the only time I’ve ever considered wanting to break up with her. That will be fucking horrible on the both of us, but if there’s no other way out of this then I’m not sure if that’s what’s gonna happen.

Here’s the situation:
I (29) have been with my bf (34m) for a little over 4 years. He’s very successful but he’s in a dying field and the end is in sight for his current career— he’s built a new company to transition into, but for very complicated reasons he would have to move to a different state to get it off the ground.
I can’t move- I’m in grad school with 2 years left of a 6 year program. 
The thing is that this state he’d have to move to is a state that we both really want to live in, when I’m done with school. In his mind, this is the only opportunity that he will get to be able to move to this state and eventually have flexibility about where he will live, setting us up to be there when I’m done in 2 years. But it’s too soon. Him moving means long distance for 2 years- I’ve been in LDRs before and I cannot fathom doing it again at this stage in my life. Living separate lives when all I want is the relationship to move ahead. I’m also dealing with a lot right now bc my mom has cancer, and the idea of being alone all the time is excruciating. 
I’m devastated and this move has come out the blue. When I’m upset he says he will stay and turn this offer down- but I know logically that is a bad idea for his career and I don’t want to stand between him and his dreams, I know he would resent me if he didn’t do this. But selfishly, I really don’t want to lose him. I love him so much and I want life with him. But he’s miserable in his current job and has been depressed for a really long time.

After the fight, a few things in my husband's office were broken the next day. Well, two things. His lap-top and this statuette kind of thing his grandfather had given him. When confronted 13 year old son ""Bob"" blamed his little brother, ""Joe"" (m8). 

My husband is angrier about this than anything I've ever seen. He is a very calm man and when he is angry he mostly just gets very quiet. He shouted at our son which I have never seen. It is mostly about the statuette that obviously cannot ever be replaced. My husband was raised by his grandfather, who died when he was 19 and was literally his entire family. 

My husband knows a man who is a private detective or something like that and can apparently finger print the items. Neither of our son's finger prints should be on them.

He is not speaking to me much because he is so upset and I said it seemed a bit dramatic. He's offended that I am not taking his feelings seriously. He cried and I've only ever seen him cry happy tears when our sons were born and on our wedding day. 

HE wants to ""severely punish"" whoever's finger prints are on the items. It is pretty obviously Bob, who is understandably scared. I can't believe he would do that. But he must have. His father is already posting some of the things we had already got him for Christmas to give away, like the Nintendo.

My husband intends to cancel Christmas for whoever is responsible and not stop there. He said that this is an indication of some kind of ""personality disorder"". He got mad and referred to our son as a sneaky liar. He doesn't ever say such things. I tried to say that's your own son and he said I was being naïve and we needed to recognize this and that our son needs therapy.

My parents are harsh, and agree with my husband that whoever broke his stuff needs ""severe punishment""

I don't know what to do and the thought of my children being finger printed by their father seems so over the top. MY husband is angry with me for not immediately taking his side and says that I am blind to our son's ""behavioral and personality traits""

Im (24M) a student in a university in Europe. I'm currently close to finishing right now. 

Recently, I just got word from another friend that my counsellor has been telling people I stalk her! I was floored, I asked what happened. 

Basically when I found out that my counsellor was my neighbor (adjacent building) I always pass by her place and sometimes see her on the streets and say Hi. We also do that in the university as well.

There was a time when she called all the students to have a meeting and discuss the course calendar, and I confided in her that I'm having difficulties with my studies and undergoing depression because of private matters. She scoffed and told me that it's ""none of my business"" and that ""everyone else is suffering"" I mean, I get it, this is a difficult program, but it's not like it wasn't something. I trusted her because she was my counsellor, but she just brushed me off.

I admit there is one thing that might make her creeped out. I was passing by her place and realized that she got her terrace decors out, I asked whether or not she moved out and told her I noticed her stuff were not there and the lights were off. She said she moved, but apparently my friend told me that ?6 counsellor was spooked that ""how did he know where I lived?"" Even though we saw each other daily and we knew where our apartments are. 

Now she's been telling people, including my research partner that I was her stalker. Now my research partner is contemplating of kicking me out of the research group. I've told my friend that I would apologize to my research partner and clear up the misunderstanding. But I can't stand my counsellor for doing this, I am so repulsed that she was gossiping about me so much. 

The thing is, she's no longer my counsellor for this academic year because she got accepted in a research group in another country. She's moving soon, and I'm considering of having a conversation, but my friend told me that it'd be a bad idea and I should just ignore it.

In the preceding year or two, my dad had moved a few states away for a new job, with the intention to get his feet under him while my mom prepared to sell the house and move our family over later. In that time, my mom started spending a lot of time with a friend, ""Bill"". She'd leave me in charge of my younger siblings to go hang out at ""Bill's"" house some evenings, and told me that if my dad called, I should tell him she was over at some other friend's house. I was young, but I figured out what was going on pretty soon, and I felt guilty about having to keep this secret for her.

A few years later, my mom remarried a man who was 20 years older than she was. They were happy for a while, but - _quelle suprise_ - a man who was old enough to be her father is now in ""failing"" health now that he's almost into his 80s. From my perspective, as someone who only spends a rare few hours with the man, I can tell he's starting to lose his memory- he loses stuff a lot, he forgets things that he's already said in conversation, he's a bit doddering, but he's not like, demented or anything. But he _does_ continue to drink like a middle-aged alcoholic, and I can see the quiet anger and frustration in my mom's face when he does, since he often ends up hurting himself. According to her, their relationship has gotten pretty strained, with him being critical and testy with her ""whenever [she] opens her mouth"" and there's been a sense of tired resignation I've picked up on from her.

That being said, in the last few months she's been talking about how she and her husband have been spending time over at her _friend_ ""Bill's"" house. ""Bill"" is apparently really good with her husband, keeping him social and getting him out of the house to keep him occupied. When I finally asked her point blank if they were together, she denied it, though she later softened and said that they're _not_ together _yet_. Not while her husband is still alive. But they do have a bond with each other that is romantic in nature, and with his wife being dead and her husband elderly, they may be able to get together in the future.

Now, I resent that my mom made me an accomplice to her cheating on my dad, and I find it reflects poorly on her that she didn't leave him sooner if she was so unhappy, but I get it. My dad is kind of a huge dick, I couldn't imagine being married to him. And I understand that the relationship she has between herself and her husband has changed from a romantic one to a caretaking relationship in his old age, and that she would still want to feel loved and attractive from someone as she stays with her husband to the end. But that doesn't mean that I have to _like_ her flaunting ""Bill"" around. I don't like that she's doing this _again_ with a second husband. Especially if this is the same ""Bill"" that she was having an affair with when I was a kid. But every time I talk to her now, she's _begging_ me to come visit so I can hang out with ""Bill"" and his family. It's like a package deal now, every request to visit is bundled with having to meet him too.

I told her that I can _eventually_ get to the point where I could meet him and be friendly, but I needed time to get there. She seemed like she was okay with that at first, but the next time that I talked to her (and then subsequent times as well), she's gone back to pitching requests for me to go see her - *and ""Bill""* - and that's _really_ gotten on my nerves. I don't want to be an accessory to this secret again. I don't like that she's not letting me process this at my own pace and respecting my boundaries.

To go into detail would be a whole novel, so I'll sum it up as best I can.

My mom and dad divorced when I was 6 after years of abuse, physical and verbal. It was not a cordial divorce. I remember going to court a couple years after that, with custody going back and forth, but generally, it was split pretty evenly. My mom ended up remarrying, and with my brothers (2) my stepdads kids (3) and my half-siblings (3), having 9 kids running around the house for someone like me who liked their alone time and privacy was too much for me. My dad remarried and I could have my own room at his house, so I usually opted to stay with him most of the time. 

While having my own room was great, I still had to deal with the anxiety of living with my dad. He constantly put me down, judged me, my interests, my friends. I wasn't the best student, but I was a good kid. I never got into trouble, never drank or did drugs--but I would be assigned chores as if they were punishments, instead of just responsibilities. He'd be the type of parent where you would hear the front door open, and the entire mood of the house would just be tense, because you're waiting for him to come into your room and antagonize you. I remember one day in my teens I had finally had enough and told my mom to pick me up, and while I waited he made me go out back and do yard work while standing over me, telling me things like 'he never loved me,' amongst other scathing shit.

In my early 20s, I wanted to be empathetic to my dad. He didn't have the best upbringing. He got my mom pregnant at a young age, and they both got married young. He didn't have time to mature. Maybe this is why he lashed out at me, my brothers and my mom? I don't know. Regardless, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to build a healthy relationship with him.

This period actually wasn't that bad. About once a month, we'd meet up for a beer and talk. The only thing that really bothered me was that he would talk about himself, or if I talked about what's happening in my life, he wouldn't really engage or ask questions about it. He'd just be waiting for the next opportunity to talk about his life, or talk shit about someone else. Eh. Whatever, crazy old dad. 

Quick rewind: my dad married Jane (not real name) when I was 11. Jane is essentially my second mother (honestly a better mother figure than my real mom) and she made my otherwise crazy upbringing so much greater with her presence and kindness.

Well, my dad and Jane divorced in my early 20s, and since then, my dad has spiraled. He became an alcoholic. He was a womanizer, so literally almost every month we met for beers, he'd invite his girlfriend of the week along because, I don't know, to impress me? Eventually, it got pretty annoying and our meetups started happening less and less frequently because I made excuses not to go. 

I started dating girlfriend (28f) in 2018, and I wanted to introduce her to my dad. We went to meet up for lunch and my dad invited this weeks girlfriend, making the conversation about him/them. At the time, I had just finished a huge personal project that I was excited about, and when I had gone to the bathroom, my dad asked my gf ""He realizes he's never going to make it in that industry, right?"" and she firmly replied ""If you knew anything about your son, you would know that he wasn't doing it for a career, it's his passion."" After this lunch, my girlfriend had a huge distaste for my dad, and didn't want to interact with him again. 

My girlfriend then looked up court records of my dad, and it turns out he is in deep shit with credit unions. Growing up, my dad owned his own business that he ran out of our house (we had a large backyard with a backhouse where his office was) that was a point of pride of him. Turns out, Jane footed the bill for his failing business, he took credit cards from her and got them into hundreds and thousands of dollars in debt. Jane wanted to spare us from that knowledge because she didn't want to come off like she was trying to poison our perception of our dad.

Another major revelation was my dad got back into drugs. I'm still not sure exactly which, but it was some kind of amphetamine. Possibly meth. There was also an incident, when they were married, where my dad disappeared and Jane discovered that he was staying at a hotel for a night. She suspects that he was cheating on her.

At this point, I've lost all respect for my dad. Trust me that there are a bunch of other things that paint him in an even worse light that I'll spare the details of, but eventually it all came to a head and I decided to completely cut him out of my life, which he did not take well. I told him my grievances, and that he's a liar, a narcissist, and a loser who deserves nothing from me. 

Not long after this, me and my girlfriend-now-fiancée moved out of state. Before I left, I got a message from him on [Facebook](https://i.imgur.com/1svKezo.png), pretty much removing all doubt from my decision.

2 years later, after getting married (he wasn't invited obviously, but Jane came) doing great career and financially, Christmas is around the corner and me and my now-wife are planning on visiting home for the holidays. My oldest brother (who also lives out of state) is bringing his nieces who I still haven't met, and it'll be the first time in years that we are all together for the holidays.

I talked to my grandma recently and asked about my dad. He got married a couple years ago, stopped drinking, and his wife sounds decent enough. She said he's gotten a lot better, and has ""chilled out."" My other brother (second-oldest) recently reconnected with my dad (with boundaries) so he can have a relationship with his kids. They're encouraging me to reach out to my dad and give him another chance, so we can all be together over the holidays.

My wife is cautious about it, but ultimately wants me to make the decision. But I'm not too sure. Do I want this man in my life? Do I want him around my future kids? Should I placate my grandmother who has cancer and probably wont be alive much longer to give her a happy Christmas where we can salvage some kind of picture of a normal family for her? Could it be possible that my dad has gotten better and genuinely gives a shit?

I'm not sure how to go about it. I plan on calling him not long before we begin travelling to our hometown to lay down boundaries, but to extend an olive branch for the rest of the family's sake to avoid drama. I just don't know how I want to go about it. I don't want to be aggressive, I don't want to be condescending. But I do want to be firm and non-negotiable. I don't want him to bring up our past. I don't want him to speak of Jane or my mother. I don't want him to even try to act like he's a good guy (he will never admit or apologize for anything he has done, including physically abusing my mom) or gossip/talk shit about anyone. He knows that my wife has basically opened my eyes to how crazy he is, so I don't want him targeting/teasing/annoying her either...

Sorry, it's a lot and there's a lot more.

He said it's believed that m isogny is far more common than m isandry, across the world and throughout history. And he said everybody you ask will say M uslim countries (like I ran) hate women, and that's billions of men.

He said women have always liked men more through time and across the world too.

He said men who hate women hate them for personal reasons. They see women as i nferior, l esser, i ncapable, u nfunny, etc etc.

And he said women who hate men hate them as backlash against m isogny, not because they see men as i nferior, etc.

He said traditional roles for men and women are not seen as different but equal, and instead most people these days say housewives are housewives because men think women are not c apable and are i nferior. They don't say housewives raise families, they say that they are o ppressed.

He said take s ex with women away and these men prefer men in every way. But take s ex with men away from women and they have many things that they still like about men.

He said therefore women accept more about men than men do about women and he said f eminists complain about how bad it is to be a s traight woman and how they are helpless because of this. They complain about how bad men are and still want them. They are happy to find the needle in the haystack.

He said women are also therefore more s traight than men. But that nobody questions how s traight s exist men truly are. Meanwhile women who h ate men &amp; f eminists...are often called l esbians.

He said meanwhile teenage boys aren't into girlbands or talking about girls. In fact fathers warn their daughters that boys that age only want one thing. He said teenage boys often have to outgrow their immature anti girls views and only want girls for s ex.

My partner and I have been together for a little over two years, and living together for a little over a year. I love him more than I can put into words, he’s somebody I see myself spending the rest of my life with. And I know that he feels the same way. Recently, however, we’ve been fighting quite a lot and he’s grown pretty distant. 

For a little backstory, I’ve been the breadwinner for the entire time we’ve been together. When he moved in with me, I got him a good job at my company with comparable pay to what I earn. We live in a townhouse that I’ve been renting for about four years now, and have been making plans to buy a home out-of-state since our company gives us the opportunity to work remotely. He doesn’t contribute to the household bills like rent or utilities, and that’s never been something I’ve asked of him (I’m perfectly happy managing that, it’s a pride thing). 

Over the summer, I had some unexpected expenses (had to purchase a car after a total loss, and cover some medical bills) that set me back quite a bit. Had to dip into my savings to cover a lot of stuff, including rent for the last three months while I worked on paying off those expenses. For the last two months, I’ve asked him to help lighten the load and pitch in for the rent and utilities. In September he was okay with it, but this month he was visibly upset with me and has been giving me the cold shoulder. We haven’t had sex in weeks. He started sleeping in the basement (that’s where we have a home theater set up and the gaming systems). He stopped doing the cute little things around the house that he used to do, like bringing home flowers every week for the dining room, or leaving notes around the house for me to find when I’m getting ready for work. 

I won’t need his help next month or moving forward, but his behavior has been really hurtful and whenever I try to address it, he brushes me off or just says something like, “I’m fine, it’s fine.” To make matters worse, I overheard him on the phone the other day with his best friend talking about the situation and how it was “unfair to him” to have to go in his wallet for something that’s my responsibility. He’s been more or less giving me the silent treatment since.

I’m feeling really hurt, like a loser, and kind of angry at the entitlement he’s been displaying. I understand that I’ve never asked him for anything before, but if the shoe were on the other foot, I’d be happy to help him. We’re supposed to love each other and support each other, and now it feels like if I ever were to fall on really hard times he’d abandon me. 

I guess what I’m seeking today is advice on how to approach him about this. I’ve tried talking to him to address any issues, and like I said before he brushes me off. I feel like I’m losing my partner over something that shouldn’t have mattered in the first place.

This summer we broke up but continued sleeping together but said to eachother we’d stop if either of us started seeing other people. She obviously didn’t get the memo because she gave me gonorrhoea. I confronted her about it when i got symptoms and she denied sleeping with anyone else and then when my urine test came back positive (around a week ago and 4 weeks since symptoms began and i told her) she reluctantly admitted to it being from one person one time. I later found out this was a complete lie from her friends who said she had slept with around 3-6 other people. This has affected my mental health as now i feel betrayed upset and angry at the one person i never expected to play me like this and lie to me so much.

The urge to get into relationships has never come up to me, not even in my supposedly ""hormonal teenage years"". I never cared about it but as I age, people start to question me more, and it starts to make me feel very uncomfortable since the same people would make assumptions about me ""having way too high standards"" or ""something is wrong with her"".

I do think the stuff I experienced in my teenage years played some part in this.

When I was 10, my parents decided we would move to another country. I struggled with learning a new language and adjusting to a new environment, but I managed. 4 years later my parents decided to move again, to another country. Since I had to start all over again it stressed me the fuck out. But I pushed myself to adjust faster and also do well in school since I was in high school and needed to get ready for university. In those years I basically put my studies first and ignored everything else. 

After I got into university I thought I might want to get into a romantic relationship with someone just like everyone else, but I was wrong. The urge never came up, not even once. I kinda brushed it off since no one had a problem with it.

But after I hit my mid-20s, people start to question me a lot, maybe because relationship talks are so popular but I just can't avoid it. People just seem to think by default you should have already experienced at least 1-2 relationships by my age, or if you are single you should be in the progress of trying to get into the next romantic relationship.

I know I should be comfortable with myself but I just cannot help but feel lost from time to time.

He drank with my the whole time, just as heavy. But he could stop and I couldn’t. I wasn’t ready. I tried to be sober in 2021, lasted 85 days and then failed. I would promise to change but I would fail multiple times. My drinking activities got bad this year ever since I got into a deadly car accident at work (according to doctors I should be dead but I was fine) then they fired me from my dream job. I would black out a lot just dealing with the trauma and unhappiness I experienced because of my career. I would go to local bars and wander around; I would drink drive; I would cry a lot. I was hurting. A lot. But I wasn’t ready to quit yet until august. 

The afternoon I announced I was quitting, he broke up with me saying that he can’t trust me anymore. He said he can’t be with someone he can’t trust. He doesn’t believe I’ll get sober but maybe in the future when I’m better we can try again. He was sobbing and saying this isn’t what he wants and he loves me. But he needs to maintain boundaries and feels like he’s being walked over. That I won’t become sober since he’s around, I had no reason to change. Needless to say, I am devastated. It’s been months now and the wounds are still fresh. I moved out of our shared apartment, work full time, and I haven’t drank at all or even got close. 

Early break up we had a conversation where he explained he hates himself for forcing me to go sober like this. He’s miserable. He is struggling hard. Which to me is saying he doesn’t want this either. I don’t know. 

I saw him a week ago to pick up something I had ordered to the apartment we used to share. He said he’s miserable and congratulated me on my sobriety. 

Other than talking about finances for the lease we’re finishing, we don’t speak. Not blocked but he doesn’t reach out and neither do I. But the despair of this break up is too heavy.

I've been thinking about it for a while, but tonight when he was staying at my house, he started crying asking if I still loved him, and I broke up with him.

It was so hard seeing him cry like that. 

I decided to break up with him. 

Reasons:
 
1. my Nana died back in July, I've been super depressed and treating him badly. Just being straight up mean. My depression makes me mean. 

2. He wasn't happy and I could tell. Our sex life has been non existed for months because of how I've been feeling.

3. I have to put in a lot of effort try and motivate him to do anything. 

4. I feel like we're in two different places right now, I'm graduating uni and he's working a part time retail job without his license and playing video games all day.

5. Sometimes I feel like he doesn't have any patience for me.

6. His family do not exactly have what I would consider a healthy dynamic. They were always nice to me, they just participate in a lot of drug taking, and I don't want my kids to grow up around that. 

I don't know. Honestly? There's a part of me that's screaming why the fuck did I just do that. That was so stupid, what have I done. I'm in so much pain right now and so is he. 

I can't tell if this regret is just me absolutely terrified lose him, or if I genuinely regret it. 

I haven't told anyone yet. He left in the middle of the night after we talked. My parents still think he's in this room with me. I don't know if I want to tell them or try and come up with some sort of lie. I feel like if I don't tell them it won't be real.

When we started seeing each other I fell hard and fast. She was passionate, smart, funny, talented, beautiful inside and out. We had many conversations about needs, wants, love languages, ex's. Great conversations too, where we both listened, and HEARD each other. I entered those relationship hopeful because we really heard each other. We really acknowledged the needs of the other. I was. So easy to do anything and everything to please her. Dote on her, wait on her, anything I could do for her to fill her cup based on all our conversations about needs. She told me all the time how great this relationship is and how I've set the bar. I want to be consistent. I feel that's important to any relationship. Yeah, you aren't always going to be at your best, but your effort is still necessary for the relationship. And effort how your partner needs it. Not how you want to show it. 

To be honest my cup is nearly empty. I was open and clear and honest from the beginning about what I need from the relationship, but I'm unfulfilled. I feel like her effort never showed up. She tells me she tries but I don't see it the same way as her. I feel like I'm still waiting. 

I've tried to talk to her about it many times since and there have been a few times that she has shown up with effort. And effort is sexy as fuck. Effort is hotter than how good you are at something. Effort is SEXY. Sadly I find myself a little bitter because we've been dating for a year and a half. I love her... ending this relationship is not something I want.

We got along at first and she introduced me to two friends and we all got along for a bit. I ended up getting along with those girls more than her, throughout time I found out she's outwardly nice but close to noone, always puts on a front and have a weird need for admiration, also terrifying when she's angry. I always attributed it to the fact that she's younger but I don't think this is normal anymore.

Example of things she would do: she asked to be hosted at my dad's house in a tropical area for a vacation. I told her it would not be possible and didn't want to explain further. She kept pressing on and eventually I painted the rough picture of my family reality, which is that my dad used to abuse my mom and I and now lives separate from us. She called me negative and asked if we knew any positive people to present her to. Another friend came to ask me how I was feeling afterwards because that was shocking behavior to her. I told her I felt pretty betrayed, especially since she was the one who put me on the spot like that and the friend empathized with me. We grew closer then.

After closing my heart and distancing myself to the internet friend, she would always ignore us and bring up her other girlfriends (despite seeming miserable among them I might add) and now it just feels like she wants everyone to be a witness to her glamorous and shallow life. I never really react but she definitely still hovers me quite a bit. I share a birthday with a mutual friend and she invited me to be celebrated among all her friends, half of which I never met. Another context, she completely ignored my invitation for a small celebration for my birthday and ranted about how annoying it was to meet new people (aka my friends), yet expect me to be paraded around her friends, whom I don't hear good news about from the other girls I do get along with.. 

I'm a pretty private person, I'm uncomfortable celebrating my birthday among people I don't know. From what I heard from them, they seem to be pretty materialistic and fake nice people from marketing who will probably give a gift I don't even like or even asked for and expect the same level of expense in return for their birthday. I asked if we could host a small birthday just among the people I know, she completely brushes it off and I can feel the expectation to be going along with her plans, disregarding my personal comfort.

The other girls are down for a small celebration, and I'm alright with meeting her friends just to see for myself what they are like but not celebrating my birthday among them.

I am grateful for him and he's helped me come a long way and grow as a person. We also get along really well and we never fight but I just don't feel the romance in me anymore and I just want to be alone right now. 

I almost broke up with him a little while ago but the conversation turned on how horrible I have been(and I honestly was being really horrible) and he said it wasn't okay for me to just take my love away from him and our cats. I felt really bad and apologized for how I was acting and that I'll do and try better in our relationship. And I have been trying more but I just don't really see him trying yet. I just want to go on a cute date that I didn't have to push him for.

Me [24M] and my wife [24F] got engaged in October after dating for 6 years. At first, we were leaning in the direction of having your standard formal wedding and reception with a big guest list and a venue and all that, blah blah blah. 

However, after looking at costs, we decided this was completely unsustainable and this one night would fuck us financially for the next several months if not years. After coming to this realization, we decided together that instead of this big formal wedding, let's simply do a courthouse ceremony and throw a small party for family and friends without all the fancy bells and whistles. 

My grandmother owns a beautiful semi-rural plot of land, and extremely graciously invited us to throw our party there so long as we took good care of the grounds. We very happily accepted the offer and began sending out invitations to our family and friends. 

Her parents acted supportive at first when we told them our plans, but then after the invitation turned on us saying ""Oh this is stupid.. we're not going to come out for anything except a formal ceremony. What a waste of time."" Not only this, but they've forbidden her 2 younger brothers that are below majority age from coming, despite the fact that they were both ecstatic about the idea at first and were beyond excited they get to see their older sister since that only happens a few times a year. She rarely goes home for the reasons I list below. 

This is a continuation of a long pattern of general narcissism and emotionally unstable and abusive behavior from her parents towards her. She's absolutely heartbroken because her relationship with her 2 younger brothers are fantastic, but legally there's not anything we can do about trying to get them to come. 

She's always been generally disliked by her parents for reasons neither of us have ever figured out, and that has not extended to her brothers at all. A few reasons I suspect is she's a girl (they explicitly only wanted sons), and she is agnostic (They're heavily Christian and think anyone who isn't is going to hell). Her brothers are extremely spoiled by her parents, but to their credit they're both very good kids and absolutely adore their sister/my wife and are nothing but loving and accepting of her. 

We've talked about going NC before, but that's not a route she wants to go down until her brothers are out of the house, which is still several years away. Her parents are also aware of this and have threatened her with the ""Go NC with us and you're never talking to your brothers again"" card to which she caved. She's much older than all of her siblings, who are fairly close together in age. 

With that said, how can I help her through this mess? I know there's nothing we can do about getting her brothers to come - they've explicitly forbidden them from doing so and since they're minors, we can't do jack shit about it.

Other than that, I don't know what to do. NC isn't an option as listed above, and her brothers really are unaware of the level of abuse she's endured. The only one who is would be her oldest brother, but he's also an adult and is independent by now so this doesn't apply to him. 

TL;DR: Wife's narcissistic parents berated our wedding choice, are refusing to come, and have banned her brothers from attending despite her being extremely close to them. This is a continuation of a long pattern of emotional manipulation and abuse and I'm at a loss as to how to best support her through this.

&amp;#x200B;

We met in 2018, were together for 2 years before we broke up. There was nothing dramatic, I was the one who initiated the break up and it slowly happened over about a month. The reason for the break up was because I had serious self esteem issues and I didn't feel like I deserved her, that's the simplest way I can put it.

Since we broke up there's been absolutely no interaction outside from a Christmas letter back and forth, because I wanted to just forget her and hope she found something worth while in her life besides me. I deleted every photo I had of her and even burned all of her love letters and cards which I really, really regret. It's was such an idiotic thing to do

It's been almost 3 years now, and she keeps showing up in my mind, especially when I'm feeling lonely, and at night, and even when I've dated other girls, she's always been the one on my mind at the end of the day. I feel terrible for breaking up with her because she did genuinely love me, and I feel like I took her for granted.
