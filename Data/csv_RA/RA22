I’ve been with my partner for 5 years and I really did think we would be together forever. Today they told me they are no longer in love with me and only love me as a friend. The sad part is because this entire convo started because I made a joke about them loving me as a friend… I don’t think they would have told me otherwise and would have continued to act like there was no problem. I tried to pretend like I wasn’t hurt. That everything was ok but I’m heartbroken. They told me they’ve been feeling this way for a few weeks…5 years gone and I just don’t know what to do. We live together and I don’t have the heart to kick them out or treat them badly. This person has been with me through so much and they’re going back to school… I want to be there for them because no matter what I love them with all of my heart. I want them to be happy even if it’s not with me. My heart just hurts. What do I do for me? Am I being to nice? Am I an idiot? I feel like I’ve lost the love of my life and my other half… I just don’t know what I’ve done wrong. I have no one to ask.

He is going through a few life transitions at the moment, which may influence this, as well, we are both on medication for mental health reasons and it lowers sexual arousal, but I notice in general that he has trouble with sexual intimacy. Last night he had a conversation with me about getting “burned” by several partners who just ignored him or didn’t want to engage with him sexually because he was “awkward” about it. He is neurodivergent - thus social cues, especially sexual may have been confusing or new for him - but when these partners disengaged with him, it did hurt him. And now he’s put up some barriers when it comes to sexual intimacy and I know he wants to grow from that, but more importantly, I want to help him know that he can trust me and I’ll be there for him. What can I do for him in the meantime? What are some next steps I can take?

You’re not supposed to date your co-workers but my restaurant job seems to be a breeding ground for relationships and hookups. Anyway, I (22M) am a busser at this restaurant since July. I go behind the bar a lot to grab the bus tub, put dishes in the small dishwasher, etc. Theres this bartender (30M)who has been working at this place since it opened like 5 years ago and we have the same exact working schedule so hes always there. My roommate (who I also work with) told me a while ago that he is super into me. I was flattered bc I think hes super cute too. The more I started to go behind the bar the more he would flirt with me and find ways to touch my hand or back-hes very good at flirting. Anyway, we’ve had this back and forth thing going on for a while until one night I stayed at the bar with some coworkers for some drinks and we ended up getting really drunk &amp; I blacked out. He ended up driving me home and we apparently kissed which I have zero recollection of. I waited a while to tell him that I don’t remember &amp; it was fine when I did-he wasnt upset. A week later he and I went to a different bar with some other coworkers and he ended up driving me home that night too. We kissed again and this time I remember it &amp; it was so good. 

After all this happened we’ve been much more open about our little “thing” we have at work and people are starting to notice which makes me feel a little weird. Weve been texting a lot more and told eachother that we like eachother a lot. He also told me that he is roommates with his ex bf of 3 years who ended up cheating on him. They broke up two years ago and have been “roommates/best friends since”. This is sooo weird to me. 

I guess what Im trying to say now is that I’m starting to really like him but being coworkers (and me being fairly new here while hes been there 5 years) makes me worried bc it would be so awkward if this all went south. And I’m also wary of the ex-bf/roommate situation. Hes just really cute, nice, we get along so well- Im just horribly awkward when it comes to talking with guys so him being interested means something to me. I’d love to continue this but idk how to go about that in a way that is not going to blow up my job if it didnt go well or have me end up feeling stupid for getting into something with someone whos living with their ex

In between that are what I consider to be hookups and little flares. Half of them I didn't know the name of. Never healthy. I'm not on talking terms with any of my exes besides the boyfriend I had right before I came out as gay (ironic). 

I decided to download tinder to try to get myself into the adult dating world. I hated it at first. People were creepy, only looking for sex, or a third with them and their partner. I even ended up getting some snapchats and numbers and then just... getting ghosted out of absolutely nowhere.

I was actually giving up for the most part until the girl this post is about (lets call her C) reached out. I don't even really remember swiping right on her. I know I saw her profile and thought she was gorgeous. She also said in her bio that she was a musician. 

Anyways, we get to talking. We were pretty slow at first, just answering each other as we pleased via the chatting app on tinder. We start talking enough that the messaging on tinder is annoying so we shift to snapchat. And then we start talking all the time. I update her about my work and school. Eventually I'm staying up until 2/3am with her just because I just can't get enough of learning about her and her interests. I've confirmed she's actually real at this point after quite a few calls via FaceTime by this point in time.

We talk all the time. We're talking right now as I type this. I know so much about this girl and she's so accepting and curious about me. I told her the basis of my trauma, she stood by me while I was upset, and she talks to me about everything I'm into. And I know her trauma, I know what makes her happy, what she wants to do, what she does, her job.

But I am not in love with her. 
The last time I was ""in love"" was with my ex whom I broke up with a year ago. Her and I dated for 9 months and she was a childhood crush, also the first person I lived with.

I met my current partner in August, and we became exclusive in September. She was on the very edge of what I consider to be ""attractive."" She has been losing weight (for her own health, I just came into her life mid loss) which has been helping with how attracted I am to her. 

She checks all my boxes. Agreeable, conservative, kinky, nerdy, gets along with my friends, and she's super sweet. The only box I haven't visited yet is her cooking. (I've cooked or we've eaten frozen pretty much every time, or we've eaten out)

Problem is, I don't have those butterflies, never have with her, and it's concerning. We've had zero fights and she causes me zero stress, she only adds to my life really, I just don't have that spark. She's the definition of a ""good decision for me.""

The typical girl I date and fall for is the tatted pothead with daddy issues and abusive/ trauma bodning tendencies. 

This one is just. . . Healthy? And there's no spark. I love her, but im not in love with her. I feel like I'm just guiding us through the stereotypical relationship. 

She is obviously in love with me, I can see it in her eyes and her actions. I'm her first serious relationship, and I've been through many people so I feel like I have to guide, which is okay. It also means she has no baggage like I do.

What would all of you do in this situation? I'm the only person she's been with, she checks all of my boxes, she's wonderful with kids (she teaches autistic kids) and we share the same values. Pretty much perfect except the spark.

I'm not sure what to expect but I hope i get some sort of advice.**

I've been keeping this to myself for a while now because as much as the title may sound hurtful, I don't have anyone else to talk to about this. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and have since grown to love each other dearly. Recently, my boyfriend and I have switched schools. We used to go to the same school, but due to private reasons have now moved to separate schools. For one, his school has a lot of events and activities to do like school programs, e-sports, etc. He moved to that school with his homies, so he has some people to talk to and has since then made quite a group of friends. The both of us are very introverted and I am proud to see him stepping out of his shell to create connections. They have a lot of fun together, and I usually join their VC's because I have nothing else to do. His friends don't mind me there, and are very comfortable in telling me whether or not its okay for me to stay in vc or not.

On the other hand, I moved to a school just near my house. It's a smaller-scaled school compared to my boyfriend's, and as of the time I'm writing this we've only had our student government as a form of ""event"". Our school does not have any form of clubs, sports, or other extracurriculars except for the main academics. In the same amount of time my boyfriend accumulated his group of friends, I have only been able to make 1 friend, let's call her Mia. My class is very secretive and only talk to their inner friend groups, and the person I befriended was also another new student.

I'm very proud of my boyfriend for being able to step out of his comfort zone and befriend people, especially after the long wait of the pandemic. I'm so happy to see him find people that have the same interests as him, but it just makes me kind of envious. I kind of feel upset with myself? Whenever my boyfriend would let me join him and his homies' vc to watch, I sometimes feel like a burden because I'm not part of this friend group. Although I am on good terms with all of his friends, it still feels like I'm interrupting their boys' time.

I talk to Mia rarely outside of school. We also rarely talk about things other than school purposes mostly because she is a lot closer to my other classmates. If you're wondering about my friends from my previous school, I no longer have connections with them due to drifting apart due to the pandemic.

For the past months it's just been me and my boyfriend, and as much as we both enjoy spending time with each other, I feel like I should have my own friend groups but I just can't seem to find anyone in the same spectrum as me. The only person I've found on the same wavelength as me is my boyfriend, but I also want him to be able to spend time with his friends too.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7603092,public,self,I'm slightly jealous of my boyfriend's social life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0pee8/im_slightly_jealous_of_my_boyfriends_social_life/,all_ads,6,,,,

We do share some clothes and people always think we’re closer in age.

My mother usually looks at flattering dresses and says they would look good on my sister and then look at more modest wide dresses and say they would look good at me and I didn’t really mind because I can see where she would get that idea. Recently my mother and my sister and I were all walking together and my mother was saying that she thinks some girls look better / more beautiful than their sisters and I jokingly asked her who she thought was prettier me or my sister fully expecting her usual response of like “you guys are both my daughters and you’re both equally beautiful” as she used to do. This time she quickly and swiftly said that she thought my sister was prettier and I know it shouldn’t mean much but my mood instantly dropped. She ended by saying that it was just her opinion and that other people think differently (ie my aunt who said the opposite) but it didn’t really help. I was putting on a fake face to my mom for the rest of the night and felt absolutely horrible for feeling the way that I did. Now I feel like it’s starting to show up more with my mom complimenting my sisters hair or saying things like your hair used to look good but not anymore to me. I honestly just don’t know what to do with myself because I know my mother truly believes what she said and ik she wasn’t trying to put me down but still I think I’m just very hurt.

We live about an hour away from each other. So we’ll typically do a fun activity or something on one day of the weekend, and then spend the night together and spend some of the next day together. In total, I guess we’re together for 16-24 hours of the week during that time. I feel okay with this dynamic, but sometimes I wonder if I or we should want to see each other more frequently? I do miss him when we’re apart, but I understand that we both have work and other things during the week. But sometimes I find myself wondering how we would manage if things progressed to us living together and/or being married, if we’ve never even spent more than one day together. We also talk on the phone for ~1.5-2 hours once or twice a week, and text each other pretty much everyday. 

This is the first weekend since we’ve been official that we haven’t spent time together (I wasn’t feeling well one day and then he already had conflicting plans the other day). But we haven’t really talked much either through this weekend. So I found myself wondering if he misses me, or if he feels fine without me. We are going to spend the upcoming holiday together, and I’ll be with him and his entire family.

I could write a whole book about that day, but I will spare you those details for another post. After that day we found each other together at two more group outings, both of which being unexpected (in the spontaneous sense that I didn’t plan on seeing her). 

It was all very exciting under the guile of synchronicity, because since the day we met I have been **stuck** thinking about her, all the while believing she has been thinking of me the same way (*that we are destined to be the perfect couple*). Now it has become ever more a less enjoyable form of excitement, which I will expand after a few more details to the story...

Fast forward to the last time we saw each other. I ended up getting her number. Good sign right? Reassuring right? I called her the next day after texting her, with fantastical ideas, believing that I had finally met someone that is interested in getting to know me (mono I mono, romantically, as a companion, life partner). No answer from the text, no answer from the call, so I ended up leaving a voicemail which strangely turned into a sort of apology. 

Anyways...

To this day (November 2022), I haven’t heard from her. Her not replying to me has led me to disregard most any faith I have had in my intuition and confidence. Our meeting happened over a year ago (Sept 2022), and since then I have created a life to explain how she could have done this to me that include answers to the following questions. 

* Is she some sort of undercover agent that fools unsuspecting single men into hopeless, yet obedient psychotic episodes for the betterment of some higher power? 
* Am I some sort of alien to this planet, who unknowingly lives in a delusional mind-state and is unable to pick up on the social cues that everyone else is able to pick up on. 
* Is this some sort of game that happens when people are romantically interested in each other? 

I am continuing to learn how to cope with the answers to the bulleted questions above, so they are more rhetorical than anything and are only listed to serve as reference to my cumulative life experience. 

More so, I think this post is getting long already and I don’t think me spilling any more beans on how my mental health has continually deteriorated is appropriate, but it is worth mentioning.

Most of all, I continue to blame her as the root of my misery, and I am tired of being miserable. This post is one step I am trying to take to make myself less miserable.

# PROBLEM:

This concludes with me genuinely asking...

What do I do now?

How can I move on from my feelings failing me?

# I am desperate for the kind of human connection we had, and even worse, now I don't know how to a connect with anyone. 

If you have an answer to any the questions above please answer by leaving a comment, and if you have any questions or comments about my writing please let me know. Sincerely Yours.

He likes deep thinker movies and psychological thrillers I think.  He's down for comedies as long as they're not like too much/ridiculous. And action/superhero movies. Im trying to get him into anime a bit but it's a struggle, I'm not sure if he's super into artsy stuff. He loved ATLA, but I showed him spirited away and he didn't like it. (I think he might like princess mononoke or a less wacky one than spirited away)  

I like fantasy stuff, and some sci Fi if it's not too complex. I like romance movies, but I'm also picky with them too. I love anime movies like Studio Ghibli, haven't seen enough of them though. I do like kinda violent movies, but hate horror(I think most horror movies just have TERRIBLE plots, especially the ghost/religious ones because they are funnier to me more than scary) I like some comedies. I'm like not picky at all but so picky in the sense that it takes me hours to find a movie Im in the mood for. We do have somewhat similar tastes in moves and TV, I just have yet to get into marvel and I haven't really watched star wars in a decade. I like movies that give me some nostalgia too

Background history: I’m 23 and in the nursing program, I took a break from school and have a year and a half to go to finish. My partner is 28 and already graduated college and now is working to buy a house in the future. We have been together close to a year but have been living together for four months .

Prior to living together I was living with my parents however I was kicked out due to an argument I had with my mom and I was also planning to leave the house as well due to unsafe/ toxic environment. Due to this I had to put school on hold and find a job and a place to live. I didn’t have a car and my boyfriend would help me out a little by driving me to places here and there but for the majority I was using Uber for transportation.

Shortly after , I was thinking of leaving my new place because my roommates were dirty and threw parties every weekend. My boyfriend saw this and he convinced me to move in with him and his friends so I could save money on rent and be able to buy a car as well . At the end my monthly bills was the same with the car as to just paying for the rent with the old roommates.

Fast forward a couple of months, my boss makes me work part time from home . This puts me in a tight spot with my bills. I start looking for jobs and can’t find anything with a decent wage to live and to be able to save some money for school as well. My plan was to go back to school full time in March. I also start talking to my parents again and begin introducing them into my life again.

Here is the part where I am confused : During the four months living with my boyfriend, I’ve noticed that he is super 50/50 with his spending in the relationship and at times I would feel bad because he would ask me to zelle him for half the groceries when I would be cooking . He also makes 3X as much as me. I would also contribute to our groceries but I wouldn’t ask him to zelle me because I don’t like the feeling of it being transactional. This and other little things in the relationship start emerging and I decide to seek advice from my mother.

Worried my parents invited me back home because they believe my boyfriend should be contributing more financially in the relationship due to the fact that he makes way more and that I’m trying to go back to school. I speak to my boyfriend and tell him I might move back in because I won’t be able to work and study full time due to the financial aspect and I ask him if him and our other roommates will be fine with the rent and he says “ there’s no problem for me to cover the rent”. Hearing this, I felt a little sad and disappointed because a small part of me hoped he would have jumped in and offered to cover the rent until I finished school knowing my struggles with my parents and also because he told me that I was the one and he wanted to marry me and build a future together.

Now I’m scared of going back home because it wasn’t healthy for me emotionally or physically and getting a loan to cover everything is just going to put me in so much debt after graduating .

Were my parents right in their way of thinking of my situation with my partner ? Should my boyfriend help me out financially? Or was I just a roommate to him?

I have this coworker and we are almost the same person at least on a personality level. We have worked about 2 years together. We have grown up together, but only coming close at work. 

Everytime we work together we have fun and it does not really feel like work. I believe I generally make her laugh. Another coworker came to me one day and said that he liked her. I’m like ok ask her. He asked her to go get coffee before work at work. (I don’t think that was a good idea). We now joke about him asking her and having a crush on her. I feel it would be awkward asking her like the same thing he did a couple of months ago. 

The next thing to happen is that she decided to leave work for a little bit to work on a activity. On the last day of working together before she went on the break, she said “ I’ll come back just for you” as we were walking to our cars. I think this was a joke though. 

My friend was doing this activity with her. My friend is really weird and can be annoying. I guess he asked and was talking to the girl a lot about me and about going to see a movie with me. I believe a conversation went like this, 

“you and him should go see a movie together”
“He hasn’t asked me”
“What if he’s to nervous to”
“Well he has to ask me”

Now this is all from my friend so I have NO idea if this is at all true. When I went to the activity to see my friend she came up to me and we had a awkward conversation because it was right in front of my family. At the end of the activity I had to say good job and I did after it. 

That is what has happened up to the current state of things. I’m still waiting for her to hopefully come back to work. I have a little bit of a feeling that she is nervous around me and may like me. My friend says that she would go to a movie with me. (Not my first date idea btw) we don’t constantly Snapchat but at least 3 times a week. Everytime it seems like we both enjoy the conversation. 

I have never done anything with a girl and I’m super nervous on what to do. I think she is super awesome and super pretty. If I had to describe how I feel about her I just think of prefect by Ed Sheeran. Of course I overthink everything and I’m wondering if I’m reading everything wrong and she does not want anything to do with me. Also I don’t think I’m attractive in anyway. I have no idea why I’m posting this . I guess I’m just looking for advice on what to do and my next steps. Thanks

So we have been together almost 10 years now. We have two perfect amazing children! I love them with literally every fiber of myself. We struggled to have children so now that we do they are just so amazing. 

Anyways, my husband makes random comments about how he wishes our daughter was a boy, or how he never wanted a daughter but still loves her. Just has a different bond with our son. I get it… I do. I really had hoped we would have two boys but now that baby girl is here god do I love her! She is sweet and snuggly and Uhg so perfect. My husband loves her too I know he does. I see him kiss her little toes and kiss her head and tell her he loves her but I know part of him still isn’t thrilled. 
He also admitted to resenting me when I took a few months off of work to stay home with the kids. (We both agreed on this) he didn’t admit to resenting me until after I started picking up shifts at my work to keep my self licensed. 
We fight alllll the time. I get pissed at him when he says dumb shit to the kids or when he bitches that one of them is fussing. He gets home from work and plays Xbox till bed time (he works 7-7) on his days off we can’t do anything on his first day off cause he needs to unwind but we also can’t do anything on his last day off cause he needs to relax before going to work. He has a weird schedule so some stretches are three days and others two days. Meaning that leaves every other weekend. He doesn’t want me to take the kids places without him incase something happens. (Like dangerous) we don’t live in a high crime area but we do live in a high drug area… like out in the woods meth heads but I’m not gonna go to the meth lab with my kids we would go to the park that is in a safe area.

Then when I came back out 20 minutes later he asked our baby “are you grumpy like mommy is?” Like wtf I just got so annoyed.

I came to the US as an international student from Mexico. I lived a sheltered and pleasant childhood, but otherwise I became a normal adult. College had its hardships but it was fine. My first real job after graduation was at a meat packing plant. Here I suffered a great deal. I would work 12-14 hours a day. My boss would constantly berate me in front of others and humiliate me. I was also by myself in this country, working endlessly and maintaining my family in Mexico. My body was always sore and I had awful co-workers who would make fun of me, even for the way I looked (I was too ugly, too skinny). I had a boyfriend at the time, who would always call me weak because I would spend my weekends crying. I would see my family every 2 years, I missed my home, and I hated my job. After our 2-year anniversary my parents' economical situation improved so I decided to stop supporting them and pursue a Master's degree. Then Covid came and needless to say, our relationship didn't make it. While we were together, I always resented him for calling me weak. I cried a lot, I whined a lot, but I also met him when I was 22 and very naive. After he broke up with me I endured the heartbreak, I endured my Master's (while working full-time), and I endured my company almost losing business. I was a key person in my department to keep us running. I then met my current boyfriend (26M). He's had a very rough life, from seeing his mom beat up by different men to seeing people killed in front of him. He is also from Mexico and we bonded over our love for God.
My situation has improved dramatically, I outlasted most people who used to be mean to me  and I finished my Masters. I still work underpaid and my boss can be a jerk sometimes, but I am patiently staying at the same place because they're going to sponsor me for a green card. However, I still cry a lot. I don't do this intentionally but things hurt, be it stress, grief, PMS, etc. My boyfriend told me that I need to be stronger, what if I lose a child? I would go crazy he said. I know my life is not tragic, I am grateful for what I have and for the trials that I have endured. I know other people have it worse than me, but I have worked hard for the few things I have accomplished. It hurts me to know that my partner thinks that I am weak . Is this a deal breaker or should I just talk to him?

I have a best friend of almost 13 years, and for the sake of anonymity, let's call her ""Trish"".

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

Me and Trish met when we were 16/18, and we clicked instantly. Never been anything sexual, besides when my horny male hormones would flirt with her around when we first met. Over the course of the years, she's done everything you'd expect from a best friend. She's always been supportive, she tells me when I'm wrong about shit, she's let me live with her rent free for a few months when I was homeless. I could/can call her at 3am out of the blue during a mental breakdown, and she'll walk me through it, and much more. She's also never used anything she's done, as leverage over me to do anything. I do just as much for her, but this isn't about me. Just acknowledging that it isn't a one sided relationship. Her kids (13, 8, 4, and 1) are my nieces and nephews. My kids (6 and 7) are her nieces.

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

But she has flaws. She's SUPER friendly. Almost fake friendly. That is part of how she's able to be almost a bully, but a habitual line stepper, at least. Like she can ask someone ""Wanna smoke?"" And if they say ""no"", often she'll be like ""Nah we're smoking. Let's go pack a bowl"". She also frequently will make jokes at your expense, if you don't check her for it. There was also an instance a few years ago that left a nasty taste in my mouth ever since. I was about to be homeless with my kids, so she let us live with her rent free for a few months, while I worked and got back on my feet. We agreed I'd pay her once I started saving up enough. But a situation happened where I got into an argument with her racist neighbors that threatened to get my kids taken away because ""I don't know what you got going on in there, but it's something suspicious, because I saw the police at your house"". She also had to have seen an ambulance and fire truck too, because that incident was over the fact that Trish's dog bit the living shit out of my hand, so I called 911 for an ambulance. The part that had me looking at Trish a bit different, was that to diffuse the situation, she kicked me and my kids out, in fear that the neighbor would bring that incident up to the HOA. Kinda shitty of her, but I can understand it in a way. What was wrong was that instead of her letting me use my money to get a roof over our heads, she made me feel like shit for not paying her once we left. I felt bad, so I paid her, and me and my kids had to sleep in a car for 3 months, every few days, getting a motel for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is, Trish has another best friend who we'll call ""Angie"". Angie and I are acquaintancesof maybe 10 years, but just recently got really close a year and a half ago. Her and Trish have been best friends for as long as me and Trish have been. A few years ago, Trish told me about how she felt bad because 6 years ago, she was casually sleeping with Angies ex boyfriend/baby daddy, and Angie didn't know, also in doing this, Trish was cheating on her husband. It's extremely shitty, but at that point, me and Trish had been friends for 10-11 years, and me and Angie didn't even really like eachother, so I swept it under the rug, but was aware of the shittyness of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, Angie calls my phone, hysterical, saying she was done with Trish, for good. Her and her ex got back together, and he confessed to it, saying he didn't want to restart their relationship without coming clean. Trish originally told me Angie and her man were broken up, but apparently, according to Angie, they were infact, still together at that point, and Trish knew. I don't know what it is, but now I'm actually feeling quite a way about the shit. It's foul as fuck. It was shitty before, but now it's a lot worse for me to process her doing. Trish doesn't know that Angie knows, because Angie won't tell her. She just keeps posting passive aggressive memes on her Facebook, assuming trish will get the hint. I honestly think she's just too hurt/non confrontational to confront Trish about the fact that she now knows.

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wants to cut Trish off, too. But it feels weird/wrong, because we have so much history, and she's done so much for me. I also don't know how to cut her off, because it's not me to just ghost someone. I'd want to tell her why. But I don't think it's my place to reveal Angie's reason in the process.

I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay. I panicked about being left with the whole bill.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

The day I met him, he let me know he had a court case and could possibly be going away for 3 years. Weed charges, which as a stoner is no issue for me. But when he told me, I had no idea I would care for him as much as I do. Hesitant to say I’m in love, but I definitely love him. I worry about him. I want to be near him all the time. And it makes me feel lost and clingy and like I might smother him away.I’m terrified of losing his interest.  I get genuinely sad when he falls asleep before calling me. I don’t like being this way. 

He’s aware I overthink and handles it amazingly but I’m not gonna keep pushing it by overloading him with my emotions. Him going away isn’t even a dealbreaker for me. I never believed I’d feel this way for someone, genuinely did not believe in love. It takes a lot for me to feel this way and I don’t expect it to happen again. The 3 years isn’t definite and I don’t date anyway. Plus I just found out prisoners can text, FaceTime, and have tablets. 

We admit we don’t trust eachother fully yet. And with the stress of court, it never feels important enough to talk about.  Last time we did, he said he would never ask someone to wait for him and that he thought it was dumb. I told him very plainly when he asked what I wanted, I want him. He’s always expressed liking me but said it was horrible timing. I tried to express to him the way he accepts me, checks in on me, and caters to my emotions is worth the wait. 

Trust is an issue on both sides. Im afraid he will use me as a crutch while in prison and he’s afraid im all talk. Idk how to proceed. For the first time dumping someone isn’t the easiest and smartest choice.

So my wife and I just got married in September but have been together for 8 and a half years. 
Every holiday season, we typically split up the day (thanksgiving or Christmas) between my parents house and her mothers house. Each household is only 8 minutes apart mind you. 

Now my family is rather large, I’ve got three siblings, everyone is in a long term relationship and the extended family (cousins/ aunts uncles) top out at around 50 or so people total. Holidays can get a little busy. 
My wife’s family on the other hand is small. It’s her, her mother and her sister. That’s it. Her dad is around but parents divorced, they typically don’t get together on thanksgiving. 

My parents have many times extended the invite to my mother and sister in law, but my MIL just rather spend thanksgiving the three of em. 

Frankly I would just love if my MiL and SiL would spend the holiday with my family, but I understand that it could be a little much for them , to be honest my MiL has never really given a reason as to why she doesn’t want to join. 

I’ve told my wife that we can do whatever is easiest , which I think would be spending thanksgiving with her mother and sister, (My MIL’s bday is Saturday and we will be with her then as well) as to not make my wife feel like she has to choose.  

I guess my question is, How do others deal with situations like this? I’m a little annoyed if I’m being honest, mainly that we can’t find a way to split the day up.

So! I’ve been with my bf for 3 years now and I truly think he is my soulmate. He’s my best friend, I’m very attracted to him, we have all the same values, love to do all the same things, and love each other’s friends and family. 

The only place I feel like needs improvement is romance. I’ve told him many times, though usually in a fight, that I want him to be more romantic. Examples I have given are that he’s only bought me flowers once in 3 years (despite me buying myself flowers frequently, telling him which are my fave, telling him how much I love them, showing him florists instagrams, and actually that I want him to get me them). Or, that he doesn’t plan dates spontaneously. 

He’s also not very good with words of affirmation. Though I noticed he’s gotten a lot better this year, and when I asked him… he said it was because he noticed how much more loving and happy I am when he outwardly explains his love. So he has changed to some extent there! 

The hard part is, I feel like I have told him… yet no action has been taken. I can’t help but think “if he wanted to he would”.

Sometimes, I think it’s my fault. I put myself out there over the last few years as such a “chill girl” that I feel like he didn’t have to “change” for me. Now that I’m comfortable with him, I feel like he’s “stuck in what worked”. But that’s not what I want. 

I want anniversary celebrations, I want flowers, I want love notes. 

I’ve done these things for him, like random cards, snacks, cute handmade gifts, cute texts, baking for him etc. I just want him to take the initiative to do it, without me asking for it. 

I find myself getting agitated by small things lately because of this. For example, this morning he got out of bed without cuddling on a Sunday and it made me sad. 

How do I tell him I feel this way, without fighting, and that will actually stick?

I disagree and this is causing a recurrent fight eveyr couple of months. How can I fix this? 

My Gf (24F) and I (25M) have been dating for a little over a year now and have one point of contention that we keep coming back to every couple of months. Whatever solution we come to each time only seems to last a few months before it comes up again. 

My girlfriend and I are different when we are in social places, I am somewhat of a social butterfly and will get along with pretty much anyone in any setting, she on the other hand is not as comfortable in those situations. 

Whenever we hang out with her circle of friends it is very easy for me to assimilate (no matter the environment) and I have also put in effort to establish appropriate relationships with some of her friends with whom I have similar interests with. Which as made future interactions easier and more organic. 

On the other hand I feel she has not put in the same effort with my friends. My friends have extended warmth and friendliness to her but it has not seemed to bear any fruit. This has resulted in her expecting me to be by her side at every moment when we are in social situations. This has been difficult for me to do because I tend to move around a lot to diffenet groups where ever we are. Which causes us to have fights whoever because she wants me to do something that I am not able to do. 

This has resulted in me inadvertently cutting down on going to social gatherings with my friends in favour of spending more time with hers since I still enjoy social gatherings. Though this has left me feeling boxed in and like I am compromising alot for the sake of our relationship. 

Of late I feel like I have not been spending enough time with my friends and I am scared that I might start resenting her for it. Whenever I talk to her she tells me that this is normal and it's silly of me to expect to have more time with my friends now that we are in a relationship. 

I don't expect things can be  how they were when I was single but I feel (and my friends have expressed to me) that I have decreased my contact with them to almost just once a month (from nearly thrice a week). 

Now I don't know what to do. I feel like if continue with how things are I will alienate myself from my friends but if I compromise the time I spend with my girlfriend to spend more time with my friends my relationship might suffer. 

Any advice on how I can fix this or any advice on conflict resolution would be really appreciated.

Im M21 and shes F21, we’ve been together since school, so we’ve been together for nearly 8 years. We recently have both gone through some traumatising things in our personal lives which has divided us majorly. She recently had to take up the carer role due to her dad being involved in a train accident which has lead him unable to walk (still has legs intact, going through recovery); shes been cooking, applying medication, showering and just in general doing the things he would do daily. 

Now my accident isnt comparable to what her dad has been through. A few days ago I was involved in a knife accident which has lead me to sever the tendons in my middle and ring finger, which then lead to surgery to repair. It has left me completely incompetent in one hand and normal tasks have become a struggle. 

The reason im saying this is the context of her being put in a tough decision of who is rightly needing more care, even though it was never brought up she felt terrible she couldnt help both of us. This spiralled both of us into dark times as I had no maternal carer and she didnt have the support from anyone to keep going. Her feelings werent validated and she had felt resentment from me. I admit i was in the wrong for not supporting her but i felt with the injury i was going through i needed to be selfish. 

we both stopped talking for 3 days, during those 3 days i had gone through surgery, recovering through pain and trying to figure out what to do with only one hand. whilst this was happening i had completely switched my brain off into supporting her with whatever was happening in her personal life. a day ago she sent me the “final goodbye” message and i just dont know how to react. shes been my one and only for 8 years, and we’ve had our downs and these moments before, but this time i feel like it really is goodbye but i really dont want it to be. shes blocked my number and removed me off of everything. i just want to know, should i try my hardest now? arrive at her doorsteps and apologise? or should i let it sink in and move on?

there were a lot of reasons leading up to my decision of not talking to her. a majority of them had to do with overstepping my boundaries or telling me to “get over it” if i was upset with something she had done. 
one of the biggest things she did that caused me to not want to be friends was her making plans with me at a specific time and place but then sleeping with a guy and ignoring my calls making me wonder if she’s going to show or if she’s safe and all of that. 
now there’s a whole lot more to each story but i do want to keep this short ish. but anyway it just felt like every time there was a new situation with her it just made me want to be her friend less. and i started getting really distant with her. in previous years it was never like this but this treatment had been going on for over a year and it just made me upset.

there was another incident that she started that made me just stop talking to her completely and looking back after that i realize i could’ve ‘fixed’ our friendship if we talked things out. at the time i was so mentally out of it that the only thing i could focus on was making myself better before i could fix any relationships i had. 

regardless of the things that happened i feel like months later i want to apologize or something but i don’t know if i should because i feel like this wasn’t my fault. i look back and see all the things we used to do and i miss that and i just don’t know how to best handle the situation or if i should just try to let it go. i’ve been getting more and more dreams about her too and it’s just really weird.

anyway thanks for the read 🫶

Thankfully my self esteem wasn’t so shot that I didn’t notice this and so my feelings for him disintegrated fast. We were only together for about 6 months total. I met up with him to break up with him last week and he became so nasty and started listing all the things he didn’t like about me. Saying that I just act like a immature little kid anyway, I’m too depressed and anxious, get offended at everything, I have too many hang ups around sex and no man would want someone damaged like me at a young age, being with me was a waste of time because I was in little girl mode as a grown woman, my body was sloppy looking anyway, I mean he went in. It got to the point that I got sick of arguing and couldn’t listen to that shit anymore and walked to my car and drove away in tears.

I’ve been trying to get over this breakup but I find that I keep thinking about his words in my head whenever I’m alone, especially in bed at night. And it upsets me so much, I cry myself to sleep.

 Will this friendship turn to love?

 ▪️Some facts that emerged through research may be mentioned.

 ▪️A boy and a girl cannot remain just friends for long.  Especially in adolescence and early adulthood.  Mere love does not last more than four months.  If you like it for longer than that, it will turn into love.

 ▪️If you look at your face regularly for at least 10 minutes a day and say only good things, then the person likes you.

 If you have to touch your hands or body for more than 20 seconds, the trust between you will increase a lot.  There may be less physical pain.

 ▪️If you imitate that person or like their voice, you already like them.

 ▪️Once you fall in love with someone, it becomes difficult to see him as a friend. Then you can't get rid of the memories of love. When you fall in love, you get a special energy..

 ▪️If you are more than 20 years of age and experience heartbreak

 You may have to worry more about love

In the beginning we had a very healthy sexual relationship, maybe not quite as frequent as I’d have liked, but it was still once or twice weekly (we do not live together). However after a couple of months it dwindled down, and stopped altogether. It has now been over one year since we have physically been intimate. After about 2 months I brought it up, we had an argument, but he swore he was still attracted to me. He said he would do whatever it took, but did nothing. Months later we had the same argument in which he said “you never initiate anything either”. He later apologized and said he would find a doctor, he thinks he has ED, he didn’t want to lose me, etc. He stated his PCP had dropped him due to him not having been to him in years, which is true. And then he kind of just forgot about it I guess. He then got injured at work and has been out about 2 months. About 3 weeks ago I arrived at his house, he showed me a bottle of viagra and testosterone supplements, which he had ordered from a doctor online. Three weeks later he had not even attempted to initiate anything. I was in his restroom today, and I noticed a brand new bottle of cologne, which had been used at least once or twice I think, even though he previously said “I never wear cologne”. I also discovered that 6 of this viagra pills are gone. I am trying hard not to jump to conclusions but my only conclusion is that he is cheating.

He would talk to me mainly about how he was feeling sick &amp; needed his meds that he wasn't feeling very well &amp; needed to go to the doctor but didn't have time etc. We had a few pretty good conversations but I had just gotten out of something toxic &amp; very traumatic not even 2 months before &amp; very openly admitted to not wanting to get into anything serious as I was working on a lot at the time &amp; really still am working on as time goes on. About a week in we were talking daily &amp; the conversation was good I didn't really have feelings yet as i wasn't going into with that in mind. I kinda distanced myself for a couple days leading up to a text from him asking if I no longer wanted to talk. I basically answered with I already stated I didn't want to start anything with anyone for the reason of not wanting to commit to any obligations I can't fulfill at the time. He respected it &amp; said he just didn't know if something was wrong or not &amp; we moved on. I ended up going down to my home town to visit about 3 weeks after we initially had our first conversation. We ended up meeting when I was down there &amp; hooking up &amp; haning out for the majority of the time I was visiting. (I should also add that I have made it very clear to him that I have only really been with my child's father &amp; previous to that, I only dated women. Truly ven then I've only been in 3 serious relationships total because I just do not catch deep feelings for people often.) We connected on a very deep level during thr short time we spent together to the point that when I got back we were stuck on the phone for up to 8 hours a day. He told me every single moment that he missed me he had never met someone like me that people nowadays just don't care about anything &amp; that I ask questions &amp; I listen &amp; I comprehend shit on a level most women do not. He dabbles in nose candy not even dabbles &amp; I was the first girl that told him that he doesn't gotta do that shit that life is worth more. I was the first one to not wanna just blow all his shit up my nose all the time. He started telling me he never wanted kids &amp; that he always saw himself as a step-dad anyways, that he had never even met someone to want to do that for. I told my dad about him that he's younger then me that he may not want to get serious because I have ell &amp; he doesn't want kids so he tells me not to shoot him in thr legs before he's had a chance to even walk like don't knock him before he tries. Then one day out of nowhere he confessed his love to me like he never had before &amp; then disappeared the next day with no explanation no reason &amp; no remorse for how it made me feel. I waited for thr usual morning call it didn't come then a couple hours go by nothing &amp; the same a couple hours later. So the abandonment issues in me start firing off at all cylinders in every fucking direction "" what did I say that triggered this"", ""what can I say that doesn't sound desperate enough to make him call me pathetic but loving enough for him to know I'm sorry"". I started to blame myself even when I knew I had done nothing. Eventually at like 9:30 he called me raging about how clingy I am about how he never even said we were together about how I'm insane &amp; I made this all up in my head &amp; I pushed him away with all of my passive aggressive texts reading ""I hope whoever you're with she's worth it"" or "" That's the issue you can call me when you need validation and I can't call you back cuz you block me. ""I really don't deserve your cold ass attitude dude. I'm starting to really feel incredibly neglected in this whole thing I can't get the same sympathy from you when I feel sick or the same love from you either.""&amp; he really made me think I did too much, I was clingy. I went too far. Then everything went back to normal after I had to beg him to stay. Then it happened again a week later &amp; again 2 weeks after that. Everything would be rainbows his love for me would be never ending but then su deeply a switch would flip.

That he is in love with me &amp; he wants the world to know it. He talks about our wedding &amp; where we will live. But now he pulled back again. Saying the I dont wanna be with you I dont want a relationship with you you come with too much baggage &amp; I already have tij much on my plate. During all this he's suffering a severe depressive episode fueled with cocaine, weed, &amp; alcohol. I don't know what to believe.

Here's my situation: I (26F) pay for my own small apartment. My partner (24F) pays for a room at a shared house in another part of town, but she is hardly ever there. We've been together for two years. She'll sometimes spend a night at her place if I ask her to, but it's basically a PO box and storage unit at this point. She'll go there every couple weeks to check mail and that's it. Most of her clothes and creature comforts have ended up here with me, even her TV and computer. This has gone on for about a year.

I have been struggling to pay my bills and keep up with the rising cost of living. I don’t have a family to fall back on, and neither does she. Since she only rents a room, she pays for her place roughly 2/3 what I pay. She and I are both self-employed in the same field, but she makes more money than I do. Occasionally she will hire me for tasks in her projects, and pays me fairly for it, so it's not like she never helps me out financially. Her rented room is objectively shitty. It's tiny, no AC, occasionally has vermin problems. I don't want to force her to be there if she doesn't have to be. With this said, neither of us are ready to 'officially' move in together. My ideal relationship at this stage of my life is one in which we spend chunks of time together but remain mostly independent. If we could guarantee a place big enough to give us both a little space, I’d take the opportunity, but that’s not really on the table right now. I am the sort of person who could comfortably live alone forever, financial problems notwithstanding. I have autism with sensory issues and I get overstimulated easily. I did not foresee this situation, it happened gradually. Initially I was the one offering to let her stay here for chunks of time to finish a couple projects and seek refuge from the weather, but now it's more of a live-in-girlfriend situation. 

She is very kind and supportive and I love her very much. I feel like she brought so much light and excitement into my life after a really long period of darkness. I have long suffered from mental health problems. She helped me to enjoy my craft again, and I’ve never laughed as much as I do with her. But taking care of this apartment where we both live, buying groceries we often share (she does buy her own meals fairly often), cleaning up after us both, paying water and electricity for two, it really adds up and takes its toll. She’s very messy and does not seem to notice her mess. When I ask her to, she’ll clean up some, but it always gets to a bad state again very quickly, and it becomes my responsibility to make the place comfortable again. I am NOT a neat freak, I’m actually a bit of a slob, but she is much less conscious of clutter and mess than I am. I find myself less able to engage with her in the same lighthearted ways all the time because I feel like I’m lost in my own head, trying to figure out whether or not I am being unfair by having these thoughts.

Attempts to discuss her spending more time at her place, or carrying her weight more by helping keep this place clean, have been generally unproductive. She can’t effectively work at her place because it’s tiny and all her work materials are here. The way she put it, if she were to move all her stuff back to her place, I would see her very rarely and inconsistently, and it would put distance between us. I felt so guilty I just conceded and decided to work harder to be OK with things the way they are, but it keeps creeping back in. She gets so sad and frustrated when we talk about cleaning. The mess doesn’t bother her and her ADHD makes it so hard for her to even perceive it happening, she just can’t keep things up in a space this small. She had made some efforts, and I am grateful, but it's a bigger issue than just washing dishes or putting her shoes on the shoe rack instead of the floor. 

Recently we planned a small vacation and she put down money for our hotel room, which we intend to split 50/50, so I’ll be paying her my half. I am going to have to bust my ass to pay my share and still have enough cash to have a good time. She was giving me tips to improve my workflow and suggested a schedule that would have me working late nights with fewer breaks, like she often does. I know she’s right, and I intend to follow through with that plan, but I couldn’t help but feel a little slighted. Is it not also labor that I take care of us both, always? The reason she can work more than me is because she is unburdened by caring for this space we share, and gets to use it as a workplace for free. I can’t work when the apartment looks like a hurricane ran through it, so the hours I spend tidying also cut into my productivity.

This is uncharted territory for me. This is my first serious long-term relationship. When I am not dwelling on this, I do feel loved and cherished. I don’t want to break up with her if I don’t have to. I want her to stay in my life. I love her dearly. But I don’t want that to come at the cost of me becoming a resentful, bitter partner who can’t communicate. I don't like this irritable, money-obsessed side of myself. She pays her way at her own home. But, functionally, she lives here. 

Sorry for wall of text. My head is an echo chamber of bad thoughts. I’d like to hear opinions. Is it fair of me to broach this topic with a partner under these circumstances? If so, how would you do it kindly? I know that depending on who’s reading this I either sound like a nickel-and-diming harpy or a weak-willed doormat, but if you could talk to me gently that’d mean a lot.

my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

we break up and well i beg and cry and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…
then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building f

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels but said he would make it up to me

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety
i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later (3 days ago) he
screenshots someone's story on in. st a g
ram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

I am 26 f, and dated a guy who was 38 m for two and a half weeks. He was super obsessive and wanted to spend every day together and do everything together, and when I tried to set boundaries because I wanted to spend time with my friends and be alone to work on my art, he would become upset or try and manage my life. He was already talking about the possibility of moving in, and where we could or couldn't be in two years (he was supposedly thinking of starting a family) and he told his parents about me. He is an alcoholic who just got out of rehabilitation, and I have been sober for a while (also former alcoholic, but more under control than him).

I am neurodivergent and quite emotionally fragile, and have a lot of mental health issues that I am still recovering from. He knows this. He knows that I am insecure about myself, and have abandonment issues and been abused since childhood by men, and also tend to get jealous, possessive and easily short-tempered. I want to get better. However, I have dreams of having a career overseas, and he was trying to convince me to not pursue this. I said to him that we had to stop dating because nothing would stop me from pursuing my dreams, but I was \*very\* polite and rational about it. He would often mansplain me and tell me that my work didn't have a purpose, and that me chasing my dreams was a red flag in the relationship. 

Instead of accepting my no, he kept on trying to convince me to stay. I had to block him because he wouldn't stop. Then, he added me on facebook again and I ignored him. Then, he blocked me and added a girl who he knew was my close friend - and tried to hit on her. Then he unblocked me. I found out about this and became extremely enraged - not because I like him (I don't), but because I respectfully tried to break it off due to his controlling behaviour and he still tries to hurt me!

Due to the fact that we have mutual friends and I was told he’s safe I didn’t have to drive an hour home and to drink and have fun and his place is massive with a lot of guest rooms.

So I went over with my mutual friends and a bunch of other people for an after party drinks. I was the only one staying over besides the people who lived there (son and dad) the rest of the time everyone left. Lots of girls were trying to hook up with him so I kinda just went to my room and he tucked me into bed and gave me clothes to wear and closed the door behind me. Literally girls were throwing themselves at him hard but I didn’t care because I just met the dude.

He did kiss me at the event and when I woke up I knocked on his door (assumed he ended up hooking up with some girl) and he was alone and I asked him to take me back to the event venue so I can get my car from valet since it was his event.

Never the less we cuddle and make out and he asked me out to go to dinner with him. And says he can’t wait to have me for the entire night which I kinda stayed quiet at that part and then we had breakfast together and got to know each other 

He also managed to book spa for me since my bday is this week. Nice of him 

Today I asked him for the details of dinner and he wrote this 

“I made dinner reservations at —- for 7 PM. I don’t drive after I drink so I thought I’d get you a car and driver to pick you up and bring you to dinner and then take you home afterwards. Also, I feel I was a little presumptuous suggesting that you stay the entire night the next time we’re together so I thought I’d let the driver take you home after dinner. Please don’t take this as an indication that I’m not interested as I’m attracted to you on many levels. Have a great Sunday night sweetheart!”
