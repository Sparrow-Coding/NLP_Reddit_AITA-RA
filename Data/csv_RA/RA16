After having our first child( now 17 months) the relationship changed and all the intimacy went away. I gave and gave but eventually broke. In my weakness befriended a girl at work who I had every intention to just have as friend but ended up as friends with benefits. We started on the premise that it was just sex and nothing more. That it was never going to be more but a good time and sex. Sex was missing in the marriage and spent 4 months in the last filled relationship with the other girl until she found out she was pregnant.... I had to confess to my wife and her and the baby moved out and I was left destroyed by the thought of losing my marriage and regret of risking it in the first place. At the same time had to figure our what was I going to do about the other girl as she expects me to now be with her as she's now pregnant. 

What's the right thing to do? I love my wife and we have our son who's my world. I'm with him the most and my wife even is accepting to take the baby from the girl and have us raise it if she doesn't want it. Considering the girl goes through with the pregnancy. 

What's your opinion on the matter? 

Fast forward to weeks of pain and back and forth, my wife was willing to try to work things out with me. I told the girl that I will only support the baby but that I could not be there for her beyond. I bought her groceries, prenatal, went on doctor visits and let her speak her mind on a dialy basis. Plain and simple, she wants a chance with me and believes the right thing to do is to forget my marriage, be with her and raise this new child. I explained that I'm going to work on my marriage and that I can't be there for her beyond financial support.

Why would my relationship give me night terrors?

I (25 F) was the happiest I’ve ever been, I finally found a boyfriend I was very attracted to, found funny and felt so comfortable with. I loved when he came to stay, I loved doing things for him, we texted non stop when we were apart

I was chilling with my housemates one night and they asked me ‘what does he do for you?’ I told them he was quite broke and homesick so I didn’t expect him to do anything for me at this point. But at that moment, I realised he did nothing for me. I started to notice, he never phoned me up to chat, didn’t cook me meals when I stayed at his, didn’t ask me questions, criticised me for little things, when at the start of the relationship he was obsessed with me and so so lovely. He never even bought me something as small as a coffee 

From that night, I started getting night terrors, shouting in my sleep, it was so embarrassing. And even when I was in bed with my boyfriend, which I used to love, again I would have night terrors. I started to feel exhausted and dizzy all the time, really self conscious and I had this weird feeling when I went shopping or out the house that I didn’t exist and life wasn’t real. It was awful.

I tried to talk to him about the way I was feeling, but he changed the subject, he would cry and say I don’t know how hard his life is. I asked for more dates but all he said was ‘in due time.’ I suggested a little holiday In the summer which I would find a cheap deal for and he said I was pressuring him. The next week, he was asking for lots of help for him to plan. A trip away with his mates, I literally booked and planned the trip whilst feeling incredibly angry 

Valentine’s Day came round, I got him a card and a bag of his fave sweets. He didn’t get me anything, that evening we went to a comedy show that I had booked and he kept getting annoyed at me for being bad at planning or indecisive about what show to go to next, and I felt really flustered and upset.

The pie chart of my life contains. I'm 29F

1) A few hobbies - interior decor, coding, learning about health/natural medicine, beauty etc.

2) My job - fairly high level job in medical research management 

3) Relationship - we don't cohabit so it's seeing him one weekday evening and 70% of the weekend or so. 

4) Gym

5) Life admin

6)I've got a few friends but they've all recently moved far away so I've got nearly zero nearby friends so the odd few texts a month rather than seeing them in person. 

7)Charity work

first and foremost i’d like to say that i personally think he is very nice and funny and i feel like we have a similar sense humor and expressing ourselves? so i’m not even necessarily trying to get something more than a friendship out of this. with that said let’s go.

everytime i try to make some small talk or even just some talking related to school stuff he barely looks at me in the eye and he always “to the point” with his answers. even when  i purposely engage in conversations about things i know for sure he’s interested, like soccer he’s very dry like i previously mentioned like i directly asked for his opinion abt some national soccer teams and he barely looked at me as always… he doesn’t act like that around his friends not even his girl friends (even though he has very few) while i try to be the nicest to him and show him i’d like to be friends with him. i once even coincidentally met him at the supermarket and i offered help carrying his groceries since we live relatively near each other? that time it was just the two of us but it was really nice we walked and talked a little, i was basically carrying the conversation but every time i asked abt something he’d look at me and would also ask like “but what about you?” and all, like it wasn’t the best? but idk it felt like he was at least putting some effort? 

i got super happy after that day only to come back to college on the other day and not even get a hello or anything like that. that was the only day we saw each other individually, with no people from school and i kept trying to interact with him and get little to no reaction (mentioned above)

pls give me some tips on what to do or not to do? does he absolutely hates me or finds me annoying/disgusting? help ya girl out!

I received a referral from my family friend (27M), who works at the same company. I once slept with this family friend (i will shorten this to FF for brevity) 3 years ago when we were both getting over recent breakups. I did this idiotic thing where I told my boyfriend (24M), before seeing FF for our occasional catch up (happens like once each year) that he and I have once slept together but left out that we’re coworkers. I was embarrassed because I thought anyone would automatically assume that my job was a favor since we had a sexual history, even though I know that FF tries to help my family out all the time regardless. It would deeply bother me to be viewed this way, but I realize in hindsight that it was really fucking stupid and I should’ve been honest and upfront. Just for additional context, I rarely ever see FF at work, we work in different departments and our roles hardly intersect. My boyfriend caught on and asked about it, and I told him the truth, that we work for the same company. This led him to start spiraling and start thinking that I had concealed it for some deeper reason, like maybe I actually moved to the city because I wanted to be with FF romantically but then met my boyfriend and changed my mind. We talked it out and I tried to explain that I was embarrassed that he’d view me differently (I know that this is on me), and I thought we’d squashed it. I felt awful for hurting him and have tried to be more mindful and open since then.

After a few weeks however, an incident happened. We were having sex while high and he came inside me even though we had discussed previously that it makes me paranoid and he should always pull out. Sometimes if he puts on a condom immediately he loses his erection so we usually start off without one (I know this is reckless, but I’m not looking for advice on this) I was really taken aback by this and he apologized. I took emergency contraception, which led to me feeling nauseous, vomiting, and generally feeling betrayed the next day. When I brought it up later, he apologized sincerely and explained that he had done it because he thought I might like it and it was driven by irrational insecurity over being able to fulfill my sexual needs. He said his insecurity stems from the situation with FF, my boyfriend having issues staying hard at the beginning of our relationship, and this old photo of me that he saw (when I was once looking to find my oldest saved photo in my Google photos cloud that I rarely visit or clear out) of a random hook up from 5 years back who used my phone to take a photo of me cuddling with him with my top off (we talked through this and I apologized and we agreed even though we’re fine with each other having pasts it sucks to see stuff like that). And this led to him divulging that he often feels the pressure to perform when we have sex which really upset me because I think it should be a natural and safe act of connection. I was completely unaware he was feeling this way until now. He’s sad and anxious, I’m upset, questioning things, and at a loss over how to approach our problems

It has been bugging me and making me feel like something is missing from me; like I’m not enough. These past few weeks, I’ve told her how this bugs me when she does this in front of me. She denies anything is going on and it persists.

I have two kids (12 f and 8 m), I am a working mom (breadwinner), and my husband is a stay-at-home dad and artist. He takes on some projects here and there and sells some of his work online but does not really earn much, so he does most of the childcare and chores. I feel like he doesn't tell me anything about the kids or involve me in there activities lately; for example, the other day, he was helping his sister move from one apartment to another and told me my daughter needed to go to Wal-Mart or Target. When I told my daughter that we should go to Target, she asked where daddy was. I said he was busy, and she told me to wait and went to grab the phone and called her dad. When they were done with the call, my husband called me and told me not to bother taking her anymore and that he would just go with her tomorrow. I asked why she had to go, and he said she saw this really nice sleepover theme video on TikTok and wanted us to replicate it for her and her friends' sleepover next week. I told him that they were having a sleepover; how come I didn't know about it? He said he forgot to tell me. I told him why I couldn't take her to Walmart, and he said that he understood her vision better, but I said he could tell me her vision, and me and her could bond over this. He said that she really doesn't want to go with me, and he promised her that he would go with her. I feel as though I should be consulted before he decides to do something like a sleepover, and that he should have encouraged my daughter to go with me. This is not the first time he has done stuff like this. He'll take them to a birthday party, go hiking, help them with their crazy hair without telling Mom, have mini adventures, and so on and so forth; and not mention it to me.

And there are times when he overrules what I say, such as when I tell my son not to draw on the wall but he says Daddy said we could, and I ask him why they are drawing on the wall, and he says it's our house, so what's the big deal if they do? Sometimes he just doesn't include me in stuff, like when they were baking on a Sunday while I was sleeping at home, and when I came downstairs, I saw them baking and wondered why he couldn't have asked me to join them. And we eat dinner together almost every night, and I have most of the weekend at home, so I'm not sure how I miss so much or how so much happens without my being aware of it; he will wake up early and take them hiking on Saturday while I am at home sleeping and not even tell me.

I told him how I felt the other day, and he said that there is so much going on that it is difficult to report everything that happens and that he is always doing so much that he forgets to tell me. I felt like when he said that he was trying to say his job is so much harder, and when I asked him if he was trying to say that, he said he wasn't, but his job is so much harder. that he does 90% childcare and 90% housework. I adore my job, which also pays a six-figure salary and keeps us afloat, but it is extremely demanding. I told him that my work is mentally and physically draining and that we shouldn't compare the two, and he said so is being a parent. We ended up postponing the conversation until the next day and resolving everything then. We returned to the original topic, and I told him that I wished he would include me in kid activities like baking and hiking.

She buys clothes from shein/pretty little thing etc. A lot of the shirts are *tiny* crop tops, with splits in the middle, tops that are so thin she’s a win blow away from flashing anyone infront of her.

Me (33M) and my partner (33F) have a 2 month old baby and I now hate my life. 

My partner and I have been together for 8 years, married for 2 of those years. We’re made for each other, super goofy, happy, singing silly little songs, in love, she means everything to me, I honestly don’t think I could find another person to spend my life with. 

I never wanted children, since I was a young age I always said I would love to be married but not have children. People always said “you’ll change your mind” and “you’d be an incredible dad!” That’s not a brag that’s just what people said, I think because I’m a go to for a lot of my friends for advice and support and a fatherly role figure. I was honest with my partner from early in our relationship, the conversation would come up now and then and I started to believe the things people and my partner were saying. 

Now we have a baby boy who is two months old and my experience is everything I thought it would be, I hate it! I should have stood my ground instead of being swayed by others. The decision was mine and my partners though so I take responsibility that I’m now a dad even though I wish I wasn’t. This was my mistake! 

I’ve been having dark thoughts recently due to feeling trapped and having no one to lean on myself, the problem when you are everyone’s else rock/shoulder is you don’t feel like you can ask for that back. I can’t share too much with my partner as she’s being a rock for him and taking over the majority of parenting as she knows I’m struggling. 

Ultimately I don’t want to lose my partner, I can’t but I also don’t want a baby but that’s not going to change. So I can’t leave and I can’t stay.

So basically it's been a week since I stopped talking to her, the first 2 days were very tough but after that, I've been realizing that I didn't need her in my life and things were better off without her. She also got fired from her job of 2 years this last week. Her boss, (who I have anonymous relations with) told me he fired her because she keeps calling in and has been a ""train wreck"" recently, and she apparently cried getting her last check and mentioned me in her outburst. However, this morning she popped into my Instagram dm's saying she was sorry for kicking me out of her life and still wants to talk as friends because she misses talking to me on the daily. Personally, I'm pretty mad she has the audacity to come in here like that because she never gave a damn about my advice in the first place and threatened a RESTRAINING ORDER on me the last time we talked. And yes, she's still with the junkie I mentioned in the first post.

I haven't said anything back yet but my choices are to either take her up on the offer and accept her apology or block her and keep moving on and forward. I'm leaning toward the block her choice but I feel like that would be sour considering she's obviously in a deep pit of anxiety right now.

Eventually she reaches out and says can we just add each other to friend's already? Over time we talk a little bit she seems interested in is sending me a lot of heart emojis next thing I know we are doing everything together and spending a lot of time on the phone

She is giving me thousands of in game gold, we are in separable and one night she gets upset and is crying and reaches out to me and I comfort and console her she messages me the next morning saying thank you for the time and kindness i give her etc

We start staying on the phone 20 hours a day most days of the week. she says she thinks we've had past lives together and that our connection is really strong. she asks me to send her a picture of me, she thinks im attractive and she sends me one and I think she's really cute. She wants me around her at all times she says that things hurt her and scare her like thunderstorms lol i tell her ill protect her and keep her safe and she asks me if i would come take her away and save her life take her home with me.

I really like her and she asks me to video chat. We video chat she looks absolutely more beautiful on video and I really like her. for some reason she is too shy too look at me which made me think what is going on so I just tell her to look at me lol and she has an anxiety attack and i feel like an asshole.

We still play and we talked about it and eventually we video chat more. she asks if i would ever fly to see her I say yes. Eventually we make plans for her to fly to me. She is saying how she wants me to kiss her and fuck her and cuddle me and have me hold her and asks if I would let her sleep on my chest. She says how obsessed with me she is and saying how attractive and sexy I am and how she wants to hold my hand and jump in my arms, sending me pictures of outfits she is going to wear when she sees me asking if i like them etc. I think everything is great and I can't wait to see her.

she is texting me that before she comes I need to know about her anxiety etc apparently she takes a bunch of pills i dont know the full scope of her health but i told her that there was nothing she could do or say to make me leave her and asks me to commit to her and she says she's mine and im hers etc. I start saying i love you after this idk if the language was too strong but that's how I feel and she said she feels the same

One day she tells me that she has a boyfriend of 3 years, isn't coming to see me, and that we'll never be together. I'm really crushed and heart broken because I thought I had found someone and that we were starting a relationship i said do you want me to fuck off or what she says no i if i leave she'd be devastated and hurt herself and she told me to wait for her and for some reason I thought we'd figure it out.

she started like flaunting her boyfriend in front of me and saying how me and her just had to be friends so I said no if you're not going to choose me and step up for me then i have to go. I asked her how she feels about me and how come she isn't fighting for me and she says she does not love me more than a friend and im like what the fuck? Why did you tell me how you wanted me to push you up against the wall and kiss you and hold you down and fuck you? Why did you ask to meet me and say that we belonged together? This is what I am not understanding right now. Did I do something wrong? She said she likes me but can't act on her feelings anymore. Did I do something to turn her off or make her lose interest?

im not watching her move into the future with someone else especially after she betrayed my trust and took everything we built away

The whole time she is like dont tell my sister about us but when she told me about her boyfriend and how she wasnt coming and how we would never be together, knowing I would have to leave I tell her sister look this is how we are I just found out about the bf, if I have to leave please keep an eye on your sister I dont want her to kill herself. My dad killed himself so it's a real issue for me.

i try to continue on but she made up this story how i sent screenshots to her sister, which i did not. she told me she was done and then blocked me. and how I broke her trust by talking to her sister and im like are you joking? I told her she had a lot of nerve talking to me about trust. Kind of feel like I had the situation flipped on me. she said she's pissed off about all of it but im like i should be the one who should be pissed.

im really upset because now I feel like I did something wrong and she isnt responding to any of my efforts to make things right or reconcile or at least have some kind of common communication and understanding. Completely cut out and im not taking it well. It's just so confusing.

I really miss her and I'm hurt. She is not talking to me anymore whatsoever and when I tried to reach out she said please stop texting me. She thinks I broke her trust? I definitely did not. She's the one that broke my trust. My problem is that I still feel a bond with her but I don't know what I can do. Can anyone offer any insight or clarity?

Preface: my boyfriend isn't native English speaker and sometimes there is a little communication barrier. 

My boyfriend and I had an argument last night on the way back to his. He lives about 1 hour 30 min from me and lives in an area where there is a high percentage of sexual assault. It was midnight. When I am in arguments I feel really stressed by them and tend to try to leave (or sometimes I guess storm off) because he won't stop laying into me even though I ask him to stop repeatedly. He always needs to say the last word and also seems to change what the argument is about every 2 seconds, so I just get overwhelmed and start walking away. The argument also started because he was accusing me of not doing enough work (I work part time and am doing a masters and I do actually do a lot of work and get great grades so he was laying into me kind of irrationally) and saying that I need to be better at organising things and I was saying to him I didn't want to talk about that because I was tired, which I think is fair enough. 

Anyway. I walked away. He walked to the house and then he left me outside the house for an hour in the rain. I was freezing and crying so much, begging him to come in over text but he told me for an hour no. His whole thing was that by walking away I was leaving him so I should just leave and go home and stick to my action. I kept saying I don't have enough battery on my phone or any money for a taxi and I was scared to try to go all the way across the city late at night and trying to explain that I wasn't leaving him I just didn't want to argue and wanted it to stop. I even asked him if I could just come in to charge my phone or sleep on the sofa and he said ""no not my problem ask someone on the street"". After about an hour I started telling him to leave me alone and saying I need to get hom because now I only have 1% on my phone. He bizarrely just switched his tune and let me in after an hour and then put me in his bed with him. 

This morning we woke up, I felt horrible and honestly still felt cold from being in the rain for an hour the night before and just wanted to leave. But a friend of his texted him that another friend of his had died that night. He was really upset and I know he was very shocked by this. I supported him in the morning and then went in late to my uni as he had friends coming over so he wasn't going to be alone. 

If his friend hadn't died, I wouldn't feel the need to text him and I would really just not want to speak to him at all. But now I feel worried about him and I want to ask him if he is ok? I don't know what to do? I'm obviously shocked and scared by him leaving me outside and if my phone had died I would have been in real shit but I also know that he is hurting now that his friend died and I don't want him to feel alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - bad stupid argument with boyfriend led to him leaving me in the rain for an hour with no money and low battery on my phone. i don't want to speak to him today but we found out his friend died. we haven't spoken all day since i left this morning.

Hi reddit, I am in a confusing state of mind, so I thought I'd share it here to get some advice on the matter.
Before talking about the event, I'll give some relevant background information.

My parents are kind people, true heart-on-their-chest people who do their best to make people feel welcome and keep up the image of a good family. They're good parents, but they aren't for everyone.
My fiancé is a hardworking woman who has faced a lot in the short time since our relationship began (3 years), inculding the death of her best friend, her grandfather. This is where the story begins.

My fiance moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago, out of her grandparent's home, once she saved up enough money. The push for this is another story entirely, but she was stressed enough to want to move out of that house. Since then, she's been happy to have breathing room when it comes to her job and having a safe space, but it's like she's mourning her grandfather all over again. I've stayed with her as she cried over him when all I could do was hold her.
Here's the slight confusion for me. Because of her grandfather's association with her family holidays, she is not planning to attend any family gatherings or celebrations aside from a small get-together with mutual friends for thanksgiving. Not even christmas will be spent with her family. When imparting this information to my father, he became offended by it, and said that my fiance was insulting them.
When pressing a bit further, he stated that her attitude was that of a 10 year old. I was hurt and tried to explain, but he still stated the same, and that in his opinion, she was acting selfish for not pushing through like her grandmother. To clarify, her grandmother is still having a celebration with family.
I feel like I've had to play peacemaker between them and her and it's starting to make me crack. I need help, any advice, something to ease my racing mind. What can I do?

For additional context, my fiance has depression and anxiety, and a prior point of tension between them and my fiance is when she would get very quiet and timid during a panic attack. They would get upset that during these panic attacks that she would flinch at physical contact or loud noises, saying that they would never hurt her. She also, according to my dad, doesn't come over, which is true, but also of her own parents. She isn't the visiting type, and I've made my peace with that, but I'm starting to wonder of some of what my dad is saying is right. I feel horrible about this whole thing as I love my fiance and my parents and just want this conflict to come to some sort of an arrangement.

It is my moms old house that she sold at a discounted rate to my dad and SM. They’ve just finished renovating the house and my four younger siblings are moving in soon too, SM invited me earlier as moms house is 40 mins away from work. Me and SM are usually very close, dad was pretty absent when I was young so I’m a bit distant from him. 


For various reasons, tonight was the first time I was home for dinner. I used to live with my dad and SM so I did what I always did - bought groceries after work and started prepping around 6. I had enough food for them or to take into work if they didn’t eat. I wasn’t able to have breakfast or lunch today so I was pretty excited for dinner. 


While prepping my chicken salad, my dad came in and said the main kitchen was not to be used by us kids as SM ‘feels like her life is out of control if the kitchen is messy’ and we can’t be trusted to clean up after ourselves. Instead, she wants us to use the kitchenette three floors down (basically half a room with a microwave and sink, no seats or tables) or tell them in advance when we were going to use the main kitchen. We’re also not allowed to eat outside of dining areas so idk what the plan is for that. Apparently SM was shocked by me suddenly cooking dinner but what else did they think I would do if I live there full time??


I said ok, advance warning, I’m going to use the kitchen after work for dinner for the next couple of nights. He said that’s not acceptable and we need to ask permission for every individual instance of cooking. I started crying (stress, hunger, rejection), he ranted a bit more then left and I threw out my chicken salad :(. 


It’s mainly the asking permission to do normal things in my family home that I object to. I’m so happy to clean more, make less mess, not cook on night when SM has plans. 


I’m finding this really upsetting for many reasons but the main ones are:
1. Practically very difficult, I come home tired and hungry, I can’t afford take out everyday particularly not this week as I spent lots of money on dads bday present. 

2. Emotionally I feel like a guest or member of staff at the whim of Dad and SM. I feel rejected, unimportant and like a naughty child when I just want to have dinner. 

3. One of my siblings has bad anorexia, She’s doing better now but I’m responsible for helping her with nutritious, non stressful meals. This is really adding to the stress for me and having to navigate an additional practical and emotional dynamic at mealtimes will so hard for her. I also worry that if SM is negative in food spaces my sister will pick up on it and use it to avoid eating.

I didn't expect me seeking for help here but I am having a hard time lately and here I am. I (m26) am in a relationship for a really long time (more than 5 years) with a wonderful girl (f26). She loves me and I love her , we barely have problems and everything flows fine. We live together for a long time and we have moved to a different country recently. But the only problem is that I think I am obsessively in love with another girl (coworker, I don't see her often, but it depends). I think this happened one more time with a different girl but I suppressed the feeling (successfully) because sometimes I don't really trust my feelings. I think I took the right decision. I told my self that it's just excitement nothing more and it's not worthy for breaking up, although it was easier to break up back then than now.. I am literally thinking of the girl (the coworker) everyday and maybe more often 🫤 . It's so annoying and wonderful at the same time. Her voice and her look calm me down, it's so peaceful. I feel I am a disgusting person because my girlfriend doesn't deserve that. I think the other girl knows that I want her but I am not quite sure. The thing is that I have never felt something like this for my current girlfriend and it confuses me a lot. I have almost made a move for the other girl and I think she responded positively, but the moment I realized I was making a move I stopped it immediately. I hope I didn't put her in trouble. Of course I would never cheated on my girlfriend. But I feel bad for thinking of another woman while I am trying to act like it's all fine. I am so confused... Any advice someone?

For as long as I've known her she's been headstrong and a little temperamental. It's important to note, however, she's never directed it towards me (though I've been a casualty of her temper tantrums and having to clean up her mess or apologize on her behalf). 

Background: Tara has a history of being very possessive. She got into a serious relationship during college with a guy older than us at the time (we were 19, he was 28). He made it known he did not want kids. She, an evangelical Christian with a tumultuous family upbringing, always wanted kids. It's no surprise that when she had her first, he pulled away. She forced him to get married. (Long story there). Didn't work out, and they divorced. 

Fast forward some years later, she finds a new guy (31M) ""Frank"". By all accounts, he is a great guy. They have a daughter together. Here's where the situation starts:

Denise and I were told we'll be the maid and matron of honor. We were happy but this was to be her 2nd wedding and our first experience being her maids of honor was... Horrible. But we love her and went through with it. I was coordinating for months while keeping Tara in the loop. 

A week before the bachelorette (the planning was a nightmare) she tells us that the wedding is off. Now keep in mind that I had already put in a deposit and she told us this about 6 days before the actual event. At which point it was non-refundable. I say this because when you find out what happened it's infuriating. 

Turns out, she was having a several months long affair with her coworker! When she called us to explain everything, she told me her side. It felt put on... like she was acting having remorse and it felt hollow (in fact at one point she said she regretted not sleeping with him the first night they made out). She promised us she never did more than make out and that she owned up to it right away when she was confronted. Denise and I gave her advice to try to salvage the relationship by cutting communication off from her coworker, if not getting a new job, and letting Frank go if she really wasn't in love with him. She gave standard excuses of he wasn't being intimate, she was lonely, etc. While talking to her, I couldnt help but feel livid at how non-chalant she was even after telling us how Frank was so heartbroken. The poor dude had his bachelor party the next day b/c he was too embarrassed to tell his groomsmen and was a miserable mess. (It was his first wedding).

Denise's bf is friends with Frank and asked him out for a beer to try to cheer him up. That's when we learn his side of the story:

 They weren't being intimate because she babies her first and let's her sleep in their bed every night... How can they be intimate? She never cleans or cooks and he does all of that and is tired by the end of the day (he is also a paramedic with insane hours). He tried to invite her to do several things together but she never wanted to. To make things more messed up, the guy she cheated on Frank with... Was in fact in a long term relationship to be engaged. OH AND she had also INVITED THEM BOTH to her wedding. AND she lied about owning up to it immediately, he had to confront her multiple times.  Additionally, after we had that call with her, she wrote this coworker a love poem and left it in his locker. (He had already told her he had no plans to leave his gf for her... This wasn't anything more than a hookup.)

The day they got a beer though, she left the house, dropped the kids off with her mom, and met that guy at a hotel and had unprotected sex. She admitted to us later this all happened a few days after the call she had with us. 

The only reason she owned up to the stuff after is bc... She's pregnant! She had to tell her husband (yes, they got legally married before the wedding). Obviously Frank was devastated that the child might not be his. He didn't want another child... Especially not with all this in the background. He said if it's not his, he's out.

When she told me all this, i felt like I didn't even know her anymore. I'm a person who takes on other people's stress and anxiety. It's just who I am and she knows this. I also cannot be friends with someone I do not respect and I'm having very hard time regaining in any sort of respect for her. 

She lied to us all, and I'm not even sure why she lied to Denise and I. She knew we would find out the truth eventually bc of Denise's bf. But we were her best friends and she looked about stupid details and to our faces the whole time we planned her party. I told her essentially that it's too much and I need time away from her because I can't deal with her stupid choices and I have no respect for someone who would do this.

I'm trying to decide if it's worth talking to her about it, if I need to just let it drop and act like an adult, or if it might be time to slow fade out of the friendship. I'd love some advice.** 

I moved to a new city in late 2020 after I was laid off from my job and went through a nasty breakup. I moved because I got a cool job, needed a change of scenery, and have always wanted to live in this area, but I don't know many people here. Making friends as an introvert while it's also a pandemic has been hard. I've made a few friends/acquaintances and also started dating someone wonderful a few months after moving, so I'm not *alone*, but don't have any really close friends here yet and haven't found a sense of community.

So I was really excited when my friend K told me she had gotten a new job and was also moving to this city. K and I met through mutual friends several years ago in our old city and became close - we hung out a lot (several times a week, usually) and were in the same small COVID pod before I moved. We still talked a lot after I moved and she'd been there for me a few hard times the last few years, and I've tried to be there for her, too.

Anyway, K has another good friend (27F, let's call her L) in this city who I don't know. L went to college in this city and has lived here since, so she has a tight-knit community and a lot of friends.

**Here's the issue - my ""close"" friend K was immediately adopted into L's friend group and hasn't made much time for me since moving here.** I've already told K a few times that I don't know a ton of people here yet, that I'm so excited that she moved here, and that I'd also love to get to know L and her friends. (but I'm also not trying to sound clingy or pathetic - the things I've said have been along the lines of ""oh that sounds cool, I'd love to join you all sometime if you go again,"" or ""they sound cool, I'd love to meet them since I've been trying to find people who also like \[hobby\]"", etc.). And K keeps saying that she'll invite me to stuff with L and their crew... but then just doesn't. K has lived here for almost 8 months now and I've only met L twice.

**K has also been flaking on me a lot when I invite her to things, and sometimes it's because she's hanging out with L instead.** I'm also noticing that I am reaching out much more than she is. Recently, I hadn't seen K in about two weeks and wanted to catch her before she goes home for the holidays for a while. She ended up flaking because she was ""too hung over"" after a party of L's ... that she had originally told me she was going to invite me to :') and that really hurt.

The thing is that when we do hang out, it mostly it feels like old times, except we're only seeing each other every couple weeks instead of every couple days. That, and when I do see her, K talks a lot about the things she's doing with L &amp; the crew all the time, and it hurts my feelings to hear, since I'm still honestly lonely as hell. But at the same time, I'm an adult, I'm almost 30, and letting this girl hurt me like we're in a middle school clique feels ridiculous.

I'm super conflict avoidant (love that for me), and I don't love the idea of having a Talk with her - I've never done anything like that with a friend, at all. I just don't understand why we went from being so close &amp; hanging out all the time to whatever this weird dynamic is. I also know friends just grow apart sometimes.

Me (21M) and my ex boyfriend (19M) broke up about a month ago.

I won't bore you with exact specifics about what led to our relationship ending, but we didn't end on bad terms. They was no cheating or betrayal or anything major like that. Also, I guess I should say that this was my first relationship, and my first love, and so obviously it was also my first breakup. 

He is in university, and I am not. I kinda lucked into a job that pays pretty well and meets all my needs, and also didn't require any degree, so I just kinda rolled with that. At least for now.

Anyway, the general idea of what happened is it was his decision to end the relationship. He gave me the famous ""it's not you, it's me"" speech, and basically just explained that I met him at a time in his life when so much was changing and he was still figuring out who he is, and what he wanted, and he needed time to be alone and figure things out. 

He said that he wished he met me later in his life, because I am ""the right guy at the wrong time.""

I'm not sure whether what he said was true, or if he just said it as a polite way to let me down easy, but regardless, I of course was heartbroken because I did love him so much. Fuck sakes, I still do.

Anyway, after the relationship ended, I took some time to grieve and be alone.

After some alone time to deal with my thoughts and emotions, I thought I was ready to begin dipping my foot back in the water and get back out there, so I downloaded Grindr and Tinder and made a profile.

When we broke up, I deleted all of our photos we had together from my phone because I didn't want a reminder every time I opened my photos app. However, I did save two photos of us, because they are recent photos and I genuinely think I look good in them, so I saved those two, and cropped him out of then.

When I made my Grindr account, those two photos are the ones I used for my profile pictures.

Very shortly after making the account, like within the matter of a couple hours, I got a message from a blank profile saying;

""Michael (not my real name) I'm not the type to be a crazy ex, but are you seriously using two pictures that I was in for your profile pictures? Way to kill me 😭""

This caught me off guard, and hurt a little bit, because I wasn't expecting him to be on there, considering he said he needed time to be alone and figure things out.

So, I explained to him that I was using those photos because they're recent, and I didn't wanna use outdated photos because that made me feel like a catfish. I also explained that I like the way I look in them, so I cropped him out and used them.

He didn't respond. A couple hours after I said that, I blocked the profile he was using so we don't keep running into each other on there.

Anyway, now we get to the whole point of this post... I think our relationship ending broke me.

I keep replaying all our good times in my head, and keep replaying moments of him telling me he loved me in my head.

Also, every guy I talk to, I am always unintentionally comparing them to my ex.

For example, if I'm talking to a guy from there, I will (admittedly wrongfully) judge them by their picture, and make assumptions about their personality, and how it compares to his.

I'll also think about the things me and my ex used to like to do together when we were dating (watch Netflix, go for walks, make cookies, etc) and I will then make assumptions about what that would be like with this person I'm talking to based on their photos (which again, I admit is wrong to do), and how it will feel compared to how it felt with my ex.

On top of this, I lose interest in a lot of guys based on how they text and form their sentences... Because it isn't how my ex does it.

For example, if a guy is messaging me and says something that is grammatically different than the way my ex would say it, I lose interest. Or, maybe a guy I'm talking to uses emojis in a way my ex wouldn't use them, this also makes me lose interest.

So, I think subconsciously (or consciously, idk honestly) I am trying to find an exact replacement, or as close to it, as my ex.

This isn't healthy, I know that it isn't, because it clearly shows that I have not moved on as much as I thought I have... And honestly, at this point, I'm scared I never will.

Our relationship felt so perfect to me. Not to sound cliché, but it literally felt like heaven on earth, and I am so devestated that it has ended, and I can't be with him anymore.

And so, I'm scared that I'm always going to feel like this. I'm scared that I'm going to always try to find someone like him, and I'm going to try to recreate the way he made me feel by finding something that feels like what we had.

I don't know what to do. I know it's only been a month, so maybe it's natural to feel like this. But it's really disheartening because it makes me scared that I'll never truly let go and move on, and I'll never be truly happy in future relationships because they aren't him.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7609374,public,self,I think that my relationship ending broke me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1dtxt/i_think_that_my_relationship_ending_broke_me/,all_ads,6,

I met this guy (Guy A) a year and a half ago and we really clicked physically and also emotionally, however both of us were emotionally unavailable at this point and so we would just meet up very sporadically (once to three times in a month) and hook-up and have great conversations. 

Fast forward about seven months, we started seeing each other once a week consistently and I started thinking about guy A in a romantic way. I had casually dated a few other guys in this time, and I was just slowly started realizing how great guy A was and I was also getting a lot more attracted to him physically. I didn't tell him but I stopped seeing anyone else because I didn't want to distract myself with other people and see if my feelings would develop. For the next three months I just saw him, about once a week. After about three months, I knew I had deep feelings for him and started to envision a future together. So one night I brought up my feelings and I told him that I had feelings for him and I had to tell him because I couldn't let my feelings develop even more if he didn't feel the same way. He told me he liked me but that he didn't have deep enough feelings to see us being in a relationship. I was hurt, obviously, but I respected his honesty and I told him I needed space from him to determine if we can stay friends. We had become good friends at this point. He respected my decision and I didn't talk or see him for about a month and a half.

During this time my feelings ebbed and at the end of the three months I got back in contact with him to see how I would feel. I didn't feel hurt when we texted, so I felt okay with meeting up. We met up and hooked up and I still felt like I could occasionally hang out or hook up without getting too emotionally invested. I accepted the fact that we would only ever be friends and that he can't force himself to have feelings for me. But at the same time I set some boundaries. I kept cuddling to a minimum, if any. I only saw him max twice a month. Often it was only once a month because we both had busy summers.

Then over the summer, about three months after we started hooking up again, he was away on a trip and I met another guy (guy B, 28M). Guy B and I clicked almost instantly. He was visiting his family where I live but he normally lives out of the country, about a 16h plane trip away. He is one of my best friends' older brother and that's how we met. The following three weeks were amazing and I only saw him for that time period. I couldn't remember the last time I felt this way about someone. I also however felt emotionally ready when I met him and just let myself be happy and not second guess everything. I didn't hold myself back from feeling. But then he left back to the country where he currently works. But he also continued to message me and we stayed in contact. Four months later we still message each other and in a month I am going to that country where he lives on a month-long trip with a group of my friends (one of which is his younger brother and everyone else is also friends with him as well). I was excited to see him and potentially explore being with him more or see if anything will happen. The problem is, I haven't been letting myself get too excited, because although he is planning on moving back to his home city (my home city) it could be next summer or it could be a couple years from now. I don't know how I feel about waiting for someone for two or three years that I've only really known for a couple weeks, you know? But I feel like I'll have a better idea of my feelings after I come back from the trip.

And now we have arrived to last night. I met up with guy A while we were both out in the city. We partied a bit together and then had an amazing night together, just hooking up and talking and hooking up. At one point we were taking a break and chatting and he just gets really quiet and says he's been an idiot and that he can't stop thinking about me and that he wants to see me more, that once a week or once every two weeks is not enough. He said so many things remind me of him constantly, that his face lights up when I text him. He says it's definitely not just the sex for him. That he's been wanting to cuddle me and hold me the entire time but was scared to do anything until he was sure, because of my boundaries, because he didn't want to hurt me. I was, understandably, surprised by this, and confused, and a little speechless. At the same time, it also made me...happy. I did still had feelings for him. But I was able to manage them and I was honestly fine with us just staying friends, I accepted things the way they were. But I also never completely stopped liking him like that. 

I told him I had to think about things. That I had spent the last eight months shoving my feelings down and forcing myself to see him as only a FWB so that we can still be friends and hook up. That this changes things because now the only thing stopping me from liking him more is me. He completely removed the barrier that was there before. I don't know if I'm strong enough to stop myself from feeling. But I'm scared of getting hurt. And the fact that it took him so long to realize his feelings makes me nervous. What if two months from now he changes him mind again?

And of course, I'm still leaving on a trip a month from now and will be seeing guy B. Who I also still have feelings for.

In the effort to be honest with guy A, I told him that I had met someone over the summer that I have feelings for but that he doesn't live in the country and might not return for a couple years so it's complicated. (When are things ever just easy?!) I also told him that I do still have feelings for him (Guy A) but that I just need to process things because he really took me off guard. He said that he understands and that he's at fault here, that he's an idiot for taking so long to realize things. He asked me if he can take me on a date and I said that yes we can go on a date and see how it goes and take it from there. Start seeing each other more often. We didn't touch on the exclusivity talk. We spent that entire night wrapped up in each other, cuddling like we haven't in a while. (Because of the boundaries I had set) The next day, we spent the whole day together, I came back home at night. We didn't really get into the feelings talk again, I knew it was hard for him to be vulnerable, and that it probably hurt when I said I have to process things and about the other guy, so I didn't push it.

And that's pretty much it so far!

For those of you who have read this far, thank you. I honestly needed to write things out to get my thoughts together. However, I also wonder if maybe some kind stranger on the internet may have some advice for me?

This is what I think I should do right now: That I should explore things with guy A gradually, and then go on this trip in a month and talk to guy B and see where he's at and see how I feel about him. Have a serious talk with him before I come back to see if we even have a future. Guy A is also going on a long trip that overlaps a lot with mine and will be partying for most of the time. Then when the trip is over and I'm back, I'll have a better idea of my feelings for both guys, and can make a decision. After which I will be honest with both guys and tell them.

**TL;DR:** I told FWB I had feelings, he said he didn't feel the same way. We took a break then started being FWBs again with boundaries.

We went from fucking 3-4+ times a week whenever we wanted - to 2, maybe 3 times, a week and they’re only on days she doesn’t work and is much less enthusiastic. 



Most of the slowdown happened due to constant arguing but we’ve overcome that. She got off birth control about 2-3 months ago. 


She claims that her attraction for me is the same. But today after her first therapy session (she’s said she’s depressed so she started) she admitted that she doesn’t find attraction and sexual attraction the same. So I asked if sexual attraction has stayed the same since she got off birth control, and she claims she doesn’t find anyone other than me attractive in that way, and the reason we’re fucking less is because she’s “depressed, and it hurts”


I countered with saying that if it hurts we can do it in a less painful way. Then asked what she was depressed from and she said that she thinks it’s cause she hasn’t seen her family in a while, and because she works a lot. 


I can understand that, but I don’t understand how being depressed would kill your sex drive. And she only works 3-4 days a week. 


Recently when I get back to the apartment from work, she doesn’t run up to me and act excited to see me anymore. If I try to hug her more than a few times throughout the day she makes it very clear she wants me to stop. She rarely cuddles when we watch tv shows on the couch anymore.

so my partner (24M) and i (21F) have a really strong and loving relationship. we clicked instantly and we have grown so much together over the years, he is everything good in the world. 

this year in particular has been really difficult for both of us, both in our relationship and individually. we’re both in therapy (separately, not couples) and dealing with our own issues and, like in all long term relationships, we started to learn about each other on a much deeper level. for him in particular, therapy has been going extremely well and he’s doing amazing, he’s making so much progress and the growth i’ve seen in him in just a few short months is incredible. but i can’t say the same for me. it’s been really really difficult for me to come to terms with a lot of the issues that have come up and figure out how to cope/move forward. i have recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and my partner knows this, and he knows all of the problems i’m facing and past experiences that have caused them. we have worked hard at communication and we are open with each other on everything, and he knows every part of me (good and bad) and we have always gone above and beyond to understand and adapt to each other’s needs. i promised him that i was going to put my all into therapy and getting better after admitting i felt like i wasn’t giving it 100%, and he told me he loves me no matter what and as long as i’m trying, he doesn’t care. 

almost a month ago now, the reality of the problems i’m going to have to work through hit me extremely suddenly. we’re talking SA, EDs and a past s**cide attempt. it was very sudden and hit me like a ton of bricks, and immediately panic set in. my anxiety took over and i allowed my thoughts to snowball until i convinced myself i was going to let him down and im not good enough for him, and on a whim i told him i thought we should break up. as soon as he left my house, it was as if i woke up from a nightmare and i knew i made a mistake and it was just my anxiety talking. 

since then we have only had one real conversation about a week after this happened. i explained what happened and put absolutely everything out there, he held my hand as we both cried and he told me he’s proud of me. he said he still loves me but he’s so scared i would do the same thing again and he would overthink everything if he was to come back right now, but there’s still a chance we could be okay and i’m everything to him. i love him so much and i would do anything to take it back, i am 100% committed to working things out with him and i have since put myself into all in recovery (not for him of course, for my own sake as well) and i told him all of this. he asked for time to figure out his thoughts but it’s been over two weeks now and i haven’t heard a word. i am so scared we’re damaged beyond repair but i have learned such a valuable lesson here about how to handle myself and know that if he gives me the chance, i can prove it wasn’t me in a sound state of mind who made that decision and i want to spend my life growing with him. i know he loves me and he’s just hurting, and i want to respect his space because i know my actions caused this but i am in absolute agony and know nothing can change unless we start to resolve it together. 

is there anything i can do? or should i just wait it out and hope he comes back to me? everything hurts and i’m working so hard on myself in order to move forward, the only thing missing is him

TLDR - i broke up with my long term partner in a state of panic and now he’s scared of the same thing happening again. i love him and want to prove myself to him, can this be fixed",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7609347,public,self,made a rash decision out of fear and anxiety and potentially ruined my four year relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1dpak/made_a_rash_decision_out_of_fear_and_anxiety_and/,all_ads,6,

We've been friends for about 4, and the first two years we we're pretty close and she was probably my closest friend during those times. We were in our early 20s and I'm now in my mid / late 20s. As the years have gone on, we're still close but I've taken breaks that have lasted months away from talking to her, since there were times when I just felt sick of her. I always end up looping back though, because I don't know whether I have a valid reason to actually be upset with her because I don't quite understand what it is. I'm hoping that by writing this out, maybe someone will resonate or be able to help me identify what's really going on here and how to proceed. 

So I just want to say that this girl is someone who I've done a lot of things for, I've really gone the extra mile to help her and be there for her when she needed help. She is the kind of girl that is always, I tell you ALWAYS chasing a boy. In the last 4 years that I've known her, I have never once seen her without the focus on a guy she is either crushing on or dating. Seriously not even for a week. This is the main priority in her life, and friendships will always come second (including me) since she has very few friends but (close?) relationships, I think I'm considered to be one of her best friends but I know I will always take the back burner. Attention from men is basically her main source of energy, and without it she has no motivation for anything in life. She's 23 or 24 now, and over the last 3 years I've seen her pretty much become financially dependent on guys in exchange for a relationship, (including a sugar daddy who was in his 90's I kid you not).   
I mean hey, if she wants to live her life that way, then what's it to me right? But I think what I find upsetting is the fact that she will sort of pretend like she actually has genuine feelings for these guys, and will absolutely refuse to admit that she's really just using them. Even to me--which is crazy because I'm supposed to be her closest friend. She was recently dating a guy who was a pot dealer in his 40s, and would absolutely insist that she saw a future marriage with him even though she admitted he had narcissistic qualities. They broke up about a week ago, and when I asked her how it was so easy for her to move on to dating new guys within that week she told me that she had moved on ages ago and wanted to break up with him for the last year. Meaning she had them move all the way from Oregon to the east coast together so she could go to school, full well knowing she was planning to break up.. It just seems like she doesn't care very much about wasting their time or energy for her own resources, yet will never quite admit it. I've watched her do this to another guy, an actually really decent dude who she sort of treated like he was overly needy or too sensitive when he really just cared about her. It sort of makes me feel gross watching this but I don't know if it's something that should really matter to me right? 

So aside from her wobbly dating antiques.. As a friend I've also always felt a bit up and down with her. I noticed she would usually be a better, more reliable friend when she wasn't focused on a guy (I've seen this for maybe about a week) then she would sort of drop me and treat me like I was too demanding or needy or expecting too much from her. In the beginning our relationship was much more uneven, where I felt like I was always giving and she was taking, but I've learned to hold back a bit more now. I've helped connect this girl to multiple job opportunities through connections I created on my own when she was struggling financially, and invited her out with friend groups and to social gatherings when she was feeling lonely. I know that I can't expect anything in return from her, but I find it really annoying and disappointing that even if she were to score an opportunity or party to go to on her own, she would never extend an invitation to me or would prioritize someone else she was trying to impress over me if given the chance. 

I think what makes it most upsetting too is that sometimes with the way she regards me, she sort of acts like I'm too needy, or sensitive, or that for some reason I'm overall beneath her. Part of me feels like it makes her feel better about herself. There have been times when I got promoted and asked if she could come celebrate me or have a drink, and she would make it an absolute last priority, groaning and would almost enjoy turning me down. Like, ""im sorry honey, I'm really busy lets hang next week, ok?"" I don't know. something about her being ""too busy"" for me sort of felt like an attempt to feel superior or something to me. 

When my self esteem was lower a few years back, I really valued her opinions and guidance, and when she would do this to me I actually believed her. I'm much stronger and wiser now, and I can also see that if anything, I've actually done better than her, having built my own little community of new friends, scored and worked through some great job opportunities, and just generally have more love and life flowing through my aura and circle. I hope that makes sense.   


Aside from all these things, there are moments that I DO actually really genuinely enjoy talking to her, because we understand eachother on a deeper level and are both very spiritual. It's nice to be around someone else who get's it, and who can sort of vouch for me when I'm going through a problem and trying to figure my way out of it. There are also times when we're laughing a lot and talking about boys and how funny it all is. I'm just trying to figure out If it's all worth it. A lot of times I convince myself that I'm the one with the problem, since I'm expecting things from her that she doesn't give. But I know for a fact I'm really not asking for much--just basic friend shit, to feel like a priority. And it just feels so shitty sometimes. If it's Why does it still feel so shitty?

He lied and gas lit me SO bad. I just found out today that the last two weeks he's started hanging out with his ex gf again. He lied about her too. He lied and told me it was his cousin he was hanging out with and of course he gas lit me when I said I didn't believe him. He said ""I can't even take my cousin out without you flipping out on me"" and he made ME apologize. Then today I find out through a friend who was hanging with his ex today, that they've been out for dinner a couple times and that he's been begging for her back . He told her everything he told me... he told us both that he wanted to take us on vacation, and he told me he was falling for me etc... how can you say these types of things to two separate people at the same time??

He told her today when she and I found out that I'm a psychopath and he's been trying to ghost me and that he only took me out for coffee, and now I'm the physcopath who got In the way of him being with the girl that ""he actually loves"" (his ex). He told her that I won't leave him alone and that I called him last night and asked him to come over tonight..  i sent her screenshots showing that he made me apologize for thinking he was with another girl when he was actually with her ; I showed her that he actually called me , and that he even texted me saying ""I'll come see you tomorrow"". Then he says to her that I just won't get it through my skull and that he hasn't been pursuing me..  when he just got back from being away for work for more than 2 weeks and was texting me all these nice things... saying how excited he was to see me and that he was coming straight to my house when he got back.

Then his flight got delayed and he started drinking..  so I questioned why he needed to get drunk at 9 in the morning, and he completely lost it on me.. calling me names and telling me to grow the f*** up and that no one would ever love me and he's sick of my feelings always being hurt and he has better things to do. (He told her tonight om the phone when she was recording him that he also doesn't feel like putting up with her always being upset)... yet to me it seems like he's the one hurting everyone and he can never be at fault?? He always told me that tbey broke up because they constantly argued.. then blamed me that we argued lots (when i told him I am not an arguer and that I've never argued so much with any of my exs... he still told me it's my fault that we re arguing and that I need to work on myself and take on responsibility and the fact that we argue this much because it's my fault)..

Now he's gone and unadded me on everything , after he told her he had ""already blocked me"" (he actually only just unadded me on social media , Im the one who actually followed through and blocked him). He stopped responding to me when they were on the phone arguing and i haven't heard from him since..

I cannot believe how much this guy can lie directly to my face but yet he would always say that I'm a liar and I'm the crazy one and tells his ex that he's been trying to ghost me...meanwhile he's trying to plan a vacation with me and he even had me as his background on his phone and on his Apple watch and she saw that and asked who I was... now since she found out , he's stopped replying to me and I have no closure at all , just left here crying with no answers and just a broken heart...

How can I move past this? It hurts so bad . I've never seen anyone lie to this degree and manipulate two people , all the while we both have proof of his straight up lies !!!! 

I should have known when he got verbally abusive with me too, and even told me the other day that I'm ""lucky that he didn't toss me like a piece of paper across the room and it's a good thing he's not abusive otherwise he would have"". But him just telling me he would do so if he wasn't abusive made me think that he actually would toss me like a piece of paper If he could. 

We talked on the phone every night that he was at work... I wish I knew sooner because otherwise i wouldn't have tolerated his emotional abuse (not that i should have from the beginning anyways..).. but he always made me feel like i wasn't good enough for him and that I needed to work on myself because otherwise no one will ever love me :( he knew I struggle with severe depression , he met my parents, stayed at my house for days at a time and now he's telling her that he loves her and i just got in the way because of my craziness.... 

Someone please tell me how to stop this heartbreak over someone as terrible as him??? 

I hope she doesn't get back with him either... but watch.. he will get what he wants and I'll just be the gum on the bottom of his shoes that he used to get her back


TL;DR

How do I stop the heart ache of being lied to by a master manipulator after his ex and I found out he's been leading us both on, and he's told her that he ghosted me and that we only went on a coffee date, when just the other day he was talking about taking Me on vacation etc... and staying at my house and calling me every single night... please help:(",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7609290,public,self,How do I move past getting no closure from my abusive ex boyfriend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1dftn/how_do_i_move_past_getting_no_closure_from_my/,all_ads,6,

I would say something and he'd turn it into a whole argument about how my attitude is bad, that I am the sort of person who can never be happy with anything, and that he is ""of course"" right.

One example is that last week I came over to stay with him and we were just sitting, I was telling him how my day went, etc., and then I said "" now you should tell me something interesting about your day"" and he started a whole fight about how I blamed him for not talking when he was, of course, talking (tbh I was initiating convos and he was just replying, I didn't even blame him, I simply ask him to tell me something interesting).

At this point, I was emotionally drained because of his constant blame games to the point where I burst into tears. To which he said I was ""making him feel bad by crying"". He consoled me and everything and we went to sleep. The next day, I woke up with a headache and was slower than usual, so he started another argument about how I was still trying to start a fight when he consoled me at night ""without any mistake"".

After I started we found ourselves texting non stop. 

It started with friendly banter, to texting and to obvious flirting in the work place. He would bring me sweets and lunch. 

I can’t deny that I developed a crush on him. Until I noticed that he flirts with another younger girl in the office too. I was hormonal and upset that day and I confronted him about it. Ever since then there’s been an obvious distance. 

Needless to say, I’m not that upset given that workplace romances especially with a superior never end well. At this point we don’t text as much as we used to, there’s no sexting and weekend flirting. 

Initially I was kinda upset because I liked Chris. I looked forward to our messages and I really enjoyed speaking to him. I’m not sure if he’s also upset that a guy asked me out but.. Chris is now distant. I also told Chris I’m not a relationship type girl. Which I didn’t know would be a problem given he’s a hesidic jew and I’m a Muslim and there would be no way. 

Still.. Chris insists on texting everyday. I’ve been a lot more distant with my responses but he still asks about my weekend. He used to respond to my stories on what’s app and send me funny memes but no more.

I’m not sure how to let it go or just let it lose it’s steam? I kinda feel like he’s texting to keep his options open and doesn’t want me to quite lose interest but he’s also kinda confused on what he wants to do.. 

He left for Florida today and said he wanted to say goodbye before he left but an hour later just kinda left.

I was feeling sick, and stuck with fever at home. We also live 2 hours away, if that adds any context. I wished her to have a good night, and that was it.

I woke up very early, at around 5. She texted me 30 minutes before that, saying that she was a little drunk, but that she was happy she didn't have to pay for her drinks (so who paid for her drinks???). At around 5.30, she said she was heading home, and then texted me when she arrived.

I noticed then that her Instagram got a new follower, a profile of a new guy. I also noticed that this guy liked FIVE of her latest photos. She proceeds to text me when she woke up, and a few minutes later, I noticed she followed him back.

That's the story. Now, it's clear that I have my own insecurities, otherwise I wouldn't be checking her followers/following, etc. It's true, I admit that. I also have a problem with intrusive thoughts and maybe an anxious attachment, but I constantly work on it, and try to be better. I know I need to trust her, and I do, but sometimes I just need to vent.

What would someone do in this situation in a healthy relationship?  
Let it go? Or confront her (at the risk of looking insecure and not trusting her, even though I'm seriously working on it)?

The point is that, in my head this guy tried to flirt with my girlfriend, and maybe the group of guys he was part of, bought drinks to the group of girls my gf was part of. Although I don't really like that she accepts drinks, which are a clear signal for guys to hit on girls, I understand the allure: free stuff. So ok. I know if I say anything on it, I get labeled as controlling so I just suck it up.  
Then he probably asked her for her Instagram, and I'm also aware that many girls will just give their social media, as to avoid (horrible) guys that might be pushy and even threatening. So ok.

But why did she follow him back after she woke up? (it might be different if she followed him back at the party, as some guys can be assholes and actually check if the contacts are real or put pressure on the girl). I also don't think the excuse of ""making new friends"" is applicable, because he is clearly hitting on her (liked 5 pictures straight away, etc).

I became distant throughout the day. She could tell, and asked if I was mad that she went out, reassuring me that ""nothing happened, \[she\] didn't dance with any guy, and \[she\] didn't do anything wrong"". So why didn't she mention this guy? Why not tell me that a guy bought her drinks and asked for her social media? Did she even tell him that she has a boyfriend, which I think would be the rule if someone offers you a drink at a club? (she doesn't have many pics on Instagram, around 10, I'm not in any of them, only in the stories that she saved on her profile).

I have told my partner that all I want is for him to feel safe to tell me anything and come to me if he needs help, but I fear this is only feeding what he thinks is ""love"" which is the shame cycle - he gets disapproving attention in the form of concern for his drinking problem, and feels loved for it. But this is not a healthy way to get his needs met - he needs to ask for what he needs, not look for shame and disapproval (lie about drinking or drink way too much) in the hopes of getting the conditional love he received in childhood. **What specific boundaries should I set regarding this to protect my energy and peace? How do I show him I am not responsible for his emotions, while still having compassion?**

Here is the letter draft:  
""Hi BLANK,

I hope you and BLANK are well and staying warm. 

For the privacy of BLANK, I ask that you not share what I am about to say in this email with anyone other than BLANK. 

I am writing to speak with you about BLANK and his relationship with alcohol. His dependence on alcohol is growing more and more concerning, and I am trying my best to help him and offer compassion. Sadly, this has been a struggle since about 2018 when he started the job he has now, and I fear he may be getting past a point of no return. Normally, I would keep this information to myself and try to figure it out between the two of us, but I am getting desperate. **He is drinking about 4-5 beers a night now**. As you may know I stopped drinking last year because I realized I was not doing it for me, so he drinks alone most nights. Sometimes he goes to a bar and he also drinks at bowling. **My main focus over the years has been to stay calm, let him know when I am concerned and continue to suggest he get professional help, like therapy or treatment.**

This past week, he decided to do a dry week after my suggestion. He seemed filled with motivation to do it. He said ""I see you’re concerned and it’s very understandable. Thank you for being available. A dry week is certainly something I can and probably should do. I need to do it on my own terms though, but that’s a very good recommendation."" The result was that he was unable to go more than a day without drinking... that I know of because he tends to lie about drinking. On one of the days, I left the apartment and came back, I said ""I trust if you drank you will tell me the truth and know that I will not judge you for it."" He then said ""Ok, I had 1 beer"" I said ""Ok. Just 1?"" Then he said ""I had 2, 2 tall beers... which is more like 3"" with a look of shame on his face. I then said ""**thank you for being honest, that is all I want, for you to feel safe to tell me these things and ask for help if you need it**."" But he continues to lie about how much he has had. In the beginning (many years ago) it hurt so much to be lied to, but I have learned to just accept that he is not telling the truth and forgive him for lying. **I have learned to not even ask questions about his drinking actually. I only asked because it was a dry week.**

I'm unsure who to go to about this, and I really don't want to get anyone other than you or BLANK involved. I feel like I'm drowning, and the weight of his drinking is swallowing us both. I want him to be happy and full of joy again, but the alcohol is preventing that. It's sapping all of his dopamine. The good news is that he seems to be aware that he has a problem. The bad news is that he feels tremendous shame about his dependance and shame when he lies. He also seems to not see that his drinking is his responsibility and he needs to get help. I fear his shame is only making the problem worse and the only person who can tell him that is a therapist. 

**Please, how can I help BLANK see that he needs to go to treatment or therapy?**

With love,

But anyway, me and my gf are both 22 and have been together 3 years. Planning on moving in next year. 

We have a wide friendship group, but keep to ourselves a lot. We have a group chat with about 20 people in it, from school, college and mutuals. There’s one girl in the group who has been in our lives for ages, but never overly liked my girlfriend, however i’m decently close with her bf. She got drunk the last time we saw eachother and got pretty belligerent towards a lot of people, to the point where the drink up was called off. 

We haven’t seen her much since. My girlfriend posted last wednesday a quote, nothing to do with this other girl. Something along the lines of keep people around you who uplift you. Our friend however jumped on this and claimed it was about her, how my girlfriend never liked her and that we are trying to turn the friend group against her. We just brushed it off.

When we came out, our friend (who i’ll start calling M, i should have from the start of the post lol) came and “confronted” us. She ignored us saying we have no issue and that she’s being weird, and then literally lunged at my gf. She looked genuinely unhinged. My gf is 5 foot nothing and is never going to be up for a fight. I tried to separate them and she spat at my gf, slapped my face and continued to keep coming. I box and would never consider attempting to knocked her out, but after a few tries of pushing her away, i swiped her to the floor. After this she stood up and swung a couple times and came at me again, so i hit her real hard, open palm and she went down and sobbed. 

Despite what happened, we checked she was okay and left her shortly after. I woke up to a lot of texts from her side saying i’m a woman beater, she’s going to press charges, and that some people are scared of what i’m capable of since i hit a woman. Of course a majority of the friend group are starting to acknowledge she’s crazy and not someone you want around. How fucked am i legally?

When we got home, he was sobbing about his surgery, saying he missed his brother and dad (who both passed away from side effects of drinking). Nothing I said helped. He got violent. Not towards me, but in general. Throwing things, punching walls, yelling at me when I was trying to help. It was very scary. The scariest part was when he took a knife out and locked himself in the bathroom. Luckily, one of our roommates who’s a close friend of his was able to help me talk him down and he didn’t do anything.

I haven't been looking for a job since cause I haven't found the courage to. I have a little a temporary job working at the local burger shack and do gig apps for now just to get a little money in the bank. I still am struggling to make ends meet, cause I need alcohol to help me cope with what I am going through. Usually, after my 4-hour shift of flipping burgers, I'd go to the bar and get drunk all the way until the last call. Then I'd come home either throwing up or passing out on the floor every other day. During the day before my shift, I would take this time to hang out with my son who is only three years old.

   I went to visit my girl's parents at their humongous beach house in Laguna Niguel. There was a pretty big gathering of their friends and family and tons of alcohol. I found my girl's parents' stash of vodka. I started drinking it with this new friend I made at the party down in the cellar. Before you know it, we finished a bottle and a half and were hammered. I was so drunk it was embarrassing I was hitting on different girls, insulting guests, and spreading rumors about other people at the party. my girlfriend and I left early,  taking our son, we got home and I don't even remember going to bed that night. I woke up feeding my son, and my girlfriend woke up and came to the kitchen. She was pissed saying that I embarrassed her that night. I told her I was sorry and that I'll change, but it got very intense and we start screaming at each other back in forth. Our son started to cry, and I told her ""look at what you did"". She was so angry she started crying saying that I need to go to counseling or she'll leave me. she stormed out the door saying she was going to go back to laguna to apologize to her parents for my behavior. Then she said I am a loser and a piece of shit all while slamming the door. This got me so sad and upset and I started drinking more in the morning.

All my stupid GF wants to do is nag Now when I drink it's a problem? I'm the one taking care of our son, I'm the most responsible. all she does is work during the week and party!!! now she's yelling at me for just a slight screwup I made? I got so mad, I packed my things for at least a week, took our son, and drove all the way up to my grandma's house in Fresno which is like 7 hours away. I sent her a text saying that since I am a loser I am taking a vacation up to Fresno with our son cause Fresno is for losers anyway. She replied back saying that I need to come back and we'll discuss it. I told her I'll see her in maybe a few days.
