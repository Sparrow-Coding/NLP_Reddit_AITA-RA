just to make clear : i have the sweetest and most gorgeous and friendliest bf ever and he has never given me the feeling of not being good enough in whatever context u could think of. 

and that is kinda the problem. bc he deserves the world. he has never ever said anything abt my insecurities (ig he knows i dont like talking abt my insecurities. 
since my insecurities r quite obv, many ppl, even strangers, point it out a lot. he never did) 
he always calls me beautiful and pretty and is the most acceptant person ive ever met. 
now i have to options :
1. he either rly doesnt mind and just thinks im beautiful or 2. he does mind but he knows im insecure and doesnt want to hurt my feelings.
doesnt matter which one, i feel like he deserves smth a lot better. especially bc i dont like myself. i just want him to have the best of everything.

i am absolutely talentless. 
i have bad grades, i absolutely cant talk to ppl bc im shy, i dont have any friends, i cant cook at all, i cant drive, im scared of going further than kissing, i dont even have a bank account bc i dont know how it works. i suck at every form of sports and i dont have a single talent. i even suck at gaming.
i am flat asf. no ass no tits. im shaped like a door and i am way taller than the average. i have acne everywhere and im way too hairy. im not rly skinny but also not fat. i just look weird. i wouldnt say ugly , but just weird.



and i know i am absolutely not what he wanted but he seems to not care. which is absolutely amazing ofc, i am so thankful and i love him so much. he makes me feel loved and wanted. but i just feel so bad that i am me. bc i just rly rly suck.
he deserves so much. i am not even the bare minimum. he does everything for me and i cant give him anything back bc i am just rly talentless.

 and i can imagine that somewhere in his head he would love someone who isnt this flat and weird looking. i think he deserves someone who looks prettier and cuter. probably more feminine. i got not a single curve on my body, and my skin sucks in every aspect. i am not cute, or pretty or hot nor even smart or talented. 

i want him to break up with me so he can have someone better than me.
but at the same time i think he rly loves me. so neither me nor him could break up. if this doesnt work out till death imma make death come a bit early. no one has ever loved me like that, and i have never loved some like that. he feels like home. but i feel so bad for being me. i am trying to be better but it rly doesnt work.

he is this rly smart, good grades, funny, handsome, beautiful, strong, nice, talented in every single thing ( im not joking ), friendly, loving, caring, warm, accepting guy that is liked by everyone ( but never enough to every be friends with which i dont understand ). he is always sleepy and just rly chaotic in the most adorable way ever. he cant rly take care of himself. i mean he could but he doesnt

and i am this girl that is hated by everyone in school ( due to some events ), just disliked in general ( mainly bc i am too shy ), i never talk to anyone bc i physically cant, not rly pretty, absolutely stupid and talentless girl who cant do anything by herself.
and we only have each other.

but apart from the fact that i am physically not the most appealing, and i know he would love someone prettier, i cant take care of him the way he deserves  to be taken care of.
since we know each i try to remind him to take care of himself bc i sadly cant do it for him. but he has to additionally take care of me too.

and guess what, his ex is the opposite of me.
she is pretty, good grades, smart, artsy, smaller &amp; skinnier, cute, clear skin and very light and thin body hair, medium ass and boobs, cooking as a hobby, has a job, i think she has a license, has friends, is sporty, can talk to ppl, liked by everyone and is confindent. she is super organized &amp; structured and always has a plan. she always took care of him.

i just genuinly dont know what to do bc i feel so bad that he is stuck with me.

This is going to be long and I’m not sure if all of this is relevant information, but I want the whole situation out so I can get the best advice about this.

 Me and my friend who I’ll call Marie and I met when we were in middle school. The year before we met, she met a guy I’ll call Dennis. From what she told me, he was normal that year. But when we met, he was incredibly mean to her. He would flip-flop from being her friend and being nice to her one week to screaming in her face to leave him alone and ignoring her the next week. She excused it as him having a tough home life, but all I saw was him taking his anger out on her. This was all throughout middle school and into a lot of high school. The whole thing was really ridiculous; he was basically her bully but then the second he showed any kindness she was back under his spell. It was the only thing we’d ever argue about. 

Marie had a tough childhood growing up, as well. Because of this she was at my house a lot. She’s basically my sister, and my family loves her like their own. We’re 24 now, and around a year and a half ago I got into a serious relationship. I’ll admit that prior to this, we were in a codependent relationship. We spent nearly all our time together (We had issues last time I was in a relationship because she said I was ignoring her). She went from spending 4-5 nights a week at my house to 3 nights a week. We were discussing our codependency issues throughout the entire first month of my relationship, and I genuinely believed we were working through the issues…

And then she reconnected with Dennis. Within a month of them talking, he moved in with her. It has been a year and a half since then and I’ve seen her maybe 5 times. We went from spending most of the week together, to not even seeing each other every other month. Marie sent me a picture at the beginning of their relationship of a hole in the wall, and she said Dennis punched the hole in the wall because something had pissed him off and she kinda played it off as something cool or a joke. I have tried to plan things with her multiple times, but it never works out, and I think that’s because of Dennis. I invited her to my birthday and she canceled the day before. We planned to go out to an event last month: me, my boyfriend, Marie, and Dennis. But, again, the day of she canceled. It would have been the first time in several months I’d even seen her. She told me Dennis had woken up on the wrong side of the bed. My boyfriend and I went to the event ourselves. 

He doesn’t have a job and basically refuses to get one, he sits at home while Marie goes to work. She’s bought him hundreds of dollars worth of gifts, like video game shit for him to do while he’s home. She started drinking with him, when before she never wanted to drink due to a history of alcohol abuse in her family. She’s cut off her other friends, due to issues I think Dennis caused(at least one I know he caused due to exaggerating the situation to her). The only friends she does have are her work friends, and that’s only because she needs to see them to get money.

I don’t know how else to reach out to her. He’s now causing issues with her sister, who she lives with. I feel like he’s isolating her from her support, and I believe he’s been trying to get her to cut me off since they started dating. I don’t know how to help her, she’s with him all the time and shows him her texts. I feel like I can’t call out his behavior without being cut off as well. How do I help her? I care about her, she’s like a sister to me. We were doing a good job at working out our codependency issues. She’s my best friend and I love her. I don’t even think she sees this as a bad situation, all she has ever wanted is someone to love her, and I know Dennis showers her with affection.

In the end we worked it all out making funny jokes about how bad the sex was that it made her cry (not the actual reason she was crying) and I asked her to become my girlfriend which she said yes to. A month into the relationship I wanted to know more about her, so I asked typical questions about her past. She is super honest and told me everything that I needed to know. At the beginning of the relationship I did not care about her past but the more we spent time, the deeper my feelings got for her and suddenly I started caring a lot. At this point she was still talking to her ex but she was completely over him is what she said. Her boyfriend cheated on her mentally. I personally believe that she is fully over him. I tried to just wait and see if she realises that I would care that she still talks to her ex and would remove him. I had to hint that I was not comfortable especially since he cheated on her. Why does she need to be friends with him? Months later into the relationship thinking back this was a massive red flag, even though I know we got into a quick relationship. She gave her iPad to me to do some study and while air dropping pictures from my phone to the iPad I saw old photos of her and her ex. Like them in bed. One picture really hurt me the most. It was a love heart finger of her pointing it to the ex whilst he was sleeping. Before I saw these pictures I would do the same to her but she called it cringe. This hurt me deep down. Was pouring my eyes out on the train. I told her and she explained that she didn’t want to really see them so she never got to delete. Also that some photos are connected to the iCloud and she doesn’t want to delete the other good photos at once. Is this also not a red flag I should have seen? I tried to get help from podcasts about this disorder called retroactive jealously which is being jealous of someone else’s past especially since I don’t have a past as it makes me not feel special. There are certain things which would bring negative thoughts into my head and it would spiral down into more negative thoughts. I have not cried once when I’m with her but she cries all the time when I talk to her about this which makes me feel like shit. I don’t like the fact she slept with others which had no real meaningful relation. She told me herself It was a mistake to do it, but I doubt she really means it. She tells me the reason she realised that it was a mistake is because of me. She has been trying to help me with this and comfort me telling me I’m the best she’s ever had. She has just met my parents and I’m not too sure what to do because I don’t want to break up with her. I have really enjoyed the last 5 months with her even through all the ups and downs.

We have been together for a year. She suggested a few months ago that living together might be something she'd want. Only then did I begin to think that I might want that too. We're both quite busy so there are times when we get to meet only a couple of times a month. I started dreaming about how we could see each other every day - at least for a moment. And now when we saw each other I noticed how I felt - as corny as it sounds - like a piece of me is missing when we are separated. But recently, she changed her mind completely and I was now alone with the thought of moving in together.

She did nothing wrong as we didn't promise each other anything, but I did feel betrayed in some way. She told me that she wanted to live her ""student life phase"", but said that she hopes we'll be family someday. I understand her reasoning behind her decision as we're rather young and living together might limit our lives at this stage. And perhaps this is now the right thing to do. Living together in the future might be easier if we first discover how to live on our own. However, when I asked which style of living she sees herself in five years, she answered: ""My opinions might change as time goes by, but I probably live in my own apartment.""

Acknowledging that her opinions might change tells me she thinks so strongly about this that the chance of her changing her mind is non-existent. This really struck me. I understand living together might not be current now, but I think living separated would be too hard for my future self to swallow. I enjoy what we have now, but there is a possibility that all the effort I put into the relationship leaves me unhappy in the long run.

I’ve definitely had to learn to slow down and give him ample time to gather his thoughts and respond in conversations, but it’s driving me crazy. 

My family is a very “if you have something to say, speak up!” we don’t need to be asked to share our thoughts, we just put it out there or make funny quips in a conversation. It’s normal for us and we are pretty close. 

However, my boyfriend needs to be spoonfed questions and it seriously irritates me. A  typical conversation with him will go like this: 

“Hey how was your day at work?”

“It was good”.

“Oh nice not too busy?”

“Not really”

“….” 30 seconds of silence

“Okay well did you get anything to eat?”

“Yea we stopped for lunch”

“…” 30 seconds of silence

“Okay how was that? Did you and the new coworker go together?”

“No we didn’t”

…Silence…

Over and over again. It’s like he won’t given an answer longer than a sentence and won’t expand on any of his thoughts. I definitely pause a LOT between these questions and will be sure I’m actively listening (no phone, eye contact, affirmative noises, blah blah).

I try SO hard to be patient with this but I feel like this is not normal. I honestly get the vibe he’s disinterested in speaking to me completely. He says this is not the case. 


Even if it’s not a “small talk” topic it’s the same way. I’m well versed in various conversation topics and show interest in his hobbies and will ask questions, but it’s the same dry responses regardless of the topic. I can talk to my sister, dad, friends and random people for HOURS! We’ve been dating for 4 years and I can count on one hand the amount of times we’ve had a connecting conversation together and it was usually while he was high (marijuana-he had to quit for his job). 


I’m starting to wonder if he is depressed, because this feels like a deeper issue than being introverted. Plus- I am naturally introverted in the sense I need to recharge my social battery and it takes me a while to break out of my shell with people. In his interactions with his family he’s definitely more talkative, maybe I’m the problem? 

I’ve tried to ask him about it, and he just kinda shrugs and says this is just “how he is”. But it’s not with his family…

This lack of emotional connection is starting to affect other outlets of our relationship. I feel like I can’t  share my thoughts/feelings because it’s not reciprocated, and I’ve felt more “meh” in the bedroom the last couple of weeks. 

I’ve tried trying new date activities, new hobbies to try, board games, weekend trips with no avail….

When I was 12 years old I was a healthy weight but i wanted to start eating healthier because of a few reasons but the main one being that at my school we learnt about how chicken nuggets were made and that scared me. So I stopped eating McDonald's, then after a while, I stopped eating junk food, then sugar, then dairy, then by the time I was 13 I was eating completely ""clean"" which is what I would call it. Clean eating. I lost a lot of weight and became underweight, and when I was 14 I became more underweight, and my parents were concerned. I lost my menstrual cycle and got diagnosed with anorexia nervosa which was a very scary experience for me because I cared about my health and losing my period and the fear of losing bone mass as a result caused me stress. So, I had to attempt recovery with a team and a meal plan to help me gain weight and therapy, which was going alright at first because I enjoy eating food, I like the taste and the texture and I began to discover the reasons I developed this ED. I liked feeling like a normal teenager because I started eating chocolate again, I got my period back, I was a healthy weight again and it was really good. 

Then later on at school someone was talking about cooking something and whether they should fry it or bake it, and someone said that they shouldn't fry it because oil clogs your arteries, so I said that making one thing with oil isn't going to clog your arteries and why shouldn't they be allowed to fry it? And then both of them yelled at me and said that oil is bad and it's high in fat and then my teacher in an attempt to diffuse the situation she told me ""everything in moderation, even too much salad is bad for you"" and it just made me upset so out of spite I started eating clean again, started reading about healthy eating on healthline and I started watching YouTube channels like Bestie, Dr Eric Berg and BabbleTop. Then things got worse and I full on relapsed. Everything started triggering me. Like literally everything, Huel, Noom, HelloFresh ads on reddit, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest and especially Quora would trigger me. seeing people eat food that I want would trigger me. It caused me a lot of distress because I really wanted to eat normally again being able to eat healthy and unhealthy foods but I feel like everyone would shame me and think I lack self control and everything I googled for advice was telling me that its good to eat healthy but I really want to go back to how I was before. I'm underweight again and I'm making this post because I've lost my period again and my parents are once again worried and I don't know what else to do. I want to be able to eat junk food again I really do. I hate this life. I hate every food I eat, it makes me miserable, I'm so hungry and I wait all day to eat foods that I don't enjoy and I hate it so much. I want to be normal again.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her. I told her that sometimes couples fight and that I couldn't have read her mind since I didn't know I was supposed to pay again on the second date.

I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my socks and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.

this a long story so I'll try to wrap things up.  

I've been hanging out with this girl \[26F\] for nearly 1 year, and 2 days ago I fucked up big time. Essentially we were sort of friends, I had feelings for her, while she saw me as her big brother. For every problem or need I was her first number to call, everytime we had a chance we spent time together and had fun.

I was all she had, as she don't have many friend and hate her parents.

Lately I noticed something wasn't right, as she started seeing her ex bf once every week at his house. This thing started to bother me so much that 2 days ago I went where her bf lived and saw her car parked. I don't know what I was thinking but I started to ring his intercom at late night. Then not happy about this I went up stairs near his door and I stood there trying to  eavesdropping. I got caught by a camera, and now If feel miserable. 

Afterwards, she called me and told me about this, about how I scared her and everyone else present at the moment, since they live in a shady neighborhood. 

After this I told her that I shouldn't be a part of her life anymore, as I don't deserve anything and she doesn't deserve a person like this in her life. I mean I can't even look at her without feeling shame. She still wants to keep in touch with me, and after I said the things above she seems even more angry and disappointed.

My ex bf (m33) and I were in a relationship for 5 years. broke up three months ago due to poor communication on both our parts and no commitment on his. After me and ex broke up, I started seeing a different man (m30). 

Man A and I had terrific sexual chemistry in the beginning but it kind of faded after the first couple years (like most relationships) although we still had immense love and like and respect for each other and always enjoyed each other’s company immensely. but years and years of poor communication and the relationship not going anywhere didn’t help anything. 

Man B and I were together a short time but it was quite honestly the most wonderful and fun time. And the absolute best sex I have ever had. There are a lot of red flags with man B (because of course there are). But he took his time, he was gentle and rough and sexy as hell. He’s protective and goofy, determined, and secretly sensitive. and he’s like a painting he’s so beautiful. and honestly the **biggest** I’ve ever been with in my life. 

I’m not with either of them anymore but have recently started talking to A again (there is significant history and trust and familiarity obviously) and just the other night he started to kiss me and wanted to go further but all I could think of was B. I wanted to say B’s name. I was picturing B the whole time. I couldn’t go through with the whole *deed* because I was doing my best to be honest with A about my feelings.

I know that A and I could have an amazing and happy life together. how do I stop thinking of B? 

I never ever in my life have loved sex until B. It was like an awakening honestly. I NEVER thought sex was that important and I was close to thinking I was asexual until B. 
idk if I’m *in love* with B. (I just needed a semi-catchy title for the post)

Both are career-oriented, fairly outgoing and well-put-together people. Both of us have had several long-term relationships, have dated regularly, and sexually experienced. I have increasingly become concerned about our lack of intimacy, throughout our whole relatniship. I hit the gym daily and have been told I'm good-looking - she is beautiful herself. She is also intelligent, comes from a great family, kind and generally someone I admire. However, I have been in and know what it's like to be in a relationship where you can't keep your hands off each other, and this has NOT been it, even from the beginning.  

When we first started dating, she mentioned that she wanted to wait until we were exclusive to have sex. New to me, and I'd prefer we confirm we're sexually compatible before committing, but I really liked her, so I obliged respectfully and never pushed the issue. We'd make out, but no oral, no shirt off. While discussing her past, she mentioned that she frequently used to have sex on first meetings. Of note, I had explicitly asked her not share details of her past encounters. She reassured me that she  would have sex daily while in past long-term relationships, at worst, five times per week. It also came out that her change of heart regarding not having sex occurred literally just before meeting me, again fine. 

However, once we ""made it official"" (put a title on being BF and GF, exclusive), we still weren't having sex. She had an upcoming trip for a month and still stopped it at no shirt coming off. It was another month till we finally had sex, and even that was like at the last possible minute. Sex would be sporadic over the next few months while she was away at school, and even after not seeing each other for weeks at a time, it'd be several days into the meeting before she'd stop rejecting an advance or initiate sex herself. She NEVER sexts, doesn't like talking about sex - so it can be months without this part of our relationship being addressed. She instantly shuts down ANY sexual discussion (what makes you cum the most, what fantasies do you have etc). 

When I brought it up at first, she was receptive to my concerns. She reassured me that she was either really tired from traveling, stressed with work, on her period (but still never initiated oral sex or the like) etc, and strongly reassured me that when she was back and settled, everything would be fine. Well, she's back, and spoilers, it hasn't changed.

She'll come over, and will constantly reject my advances. Won't let me touch her boobs while we're cuddled, will turn away while I try to go in for a kiss, or give me a tiny peck. We'll be nearly naked and I'll kiss her neck and she'll SQUEAL and is generally very squeamish around me. We'll go an entire weekend without sex. When she does initiate, it's only when everything is perfect for her, and has to be on the bed, and missionary. She has refused to try anything sexually besides the very vanilla - a huge turn off for me. She's also very bossy in the bedroom, dictating to ME which positions, when to switch. She hates my cum, and I've seen her nearly gag at it going on her back; she also HATES when I'm sweaty. 

When I've brought up this incompatibility recently, she's gotten more defensive and we've had arguments. She has said that ""she needs time to warm up"" and I'm pressuring her for sex, and that when I bring up this issue it makes her feel inadequate as a partner. She has now begun to be dismissive of my concerns when it's been two weeks and we haven't had sex and I bring up that I need intimacy in a partner. 

With her starting to bring up engagement and kids etc, I'm beginning to feel resentment boiling up and I'm not sure what to do about it. I have a growing feeling she's not very attracted to me, that she's only with me because I'm the safe option, and have money. For example, she hardly ever compliments me appearance wise, and has criticized me for being short before (going as far as to poke fun at me in front of friends. her exes were all 6'1+, and I'm really short, plus she has gone on and on to her friends about how height is a big deal to her and how she almost didn't date me for it). For example, we recently saw each other for the first time in a week, I had been hitting the gym and was wearing. form fitting outfit, and spent time on my hair, beard etc. Her first words were ""Wow, you look so short in those!"", as she laughed, and turned her cheek when I came in for a kiss. 

Is this a simple incompatibility? Am I pressuring her too much? Am I not approaching her arousal or desire in the right way? How can I explore this topic with her?

We talked. Its not going further than this. We will either be friends or nothing. Its been a week since I last saw him and I miss him alot. I dont know why, but it feels like everything is bothering me this week. I just want to go see him, hug hum a bit and leave. But for reasons I cant explain I cant do that. I just message him instead. 
I feel like I'm annoying him cause he doesnt respond like he used to. I decided during this week to not message him first. So he messages me and I reply. Sporadically during the day. But I really just want to chat and its not happening. So I feel like I just annoy him with memes or random questions. He never said I do. I just think I do. I feel lonely, I miss him. I dont want to bother him so I desperately try to keep myself busy.

This month my friends tell me I sound like I fell for this guy. I so didnt want that to happen but I know I already did and I just dont tell him. I dont tell anyone. I just exaughst myself, then cry on my own, then try not to think about it.. He doesnt feel that way for me. He's just perfect to me. He's everything I ever wanted but I'm not good enough even to be his gf. I know for a fact he doesnt sleep with anyone else. Not yet anyway. I just know that when he does (he's free to do so) it will hurt me. 
I know, most of you will say I have to leave him and cut ties with him completely. But the truth is I wont make it. I miss him already, I'll miss him too much. I just want to see him. 

I know he didnt just think of me as a sex opportunity. That was a factor but he seems to care about me. Especially if I'm sick or hurt, but also if I'm just upset. (Last week he came to pick me up from work at 2 am. We went to his place for a couple hours then took me back to work at 4am.) He keeps saying he cant really feel anything anymore, and I thought I was okay with it. Turns out I'm not.

I'm scared. I think I do love him but I'm afraid to say so. I know its probably not gonna last with him but I just want to spend time together.. I havent had enough yet.

Our relationship isnt perfect, and im wondering if that is why im having doubts. Im not perfect either and can tend to be a bit clingy but my partner at times lacks to speak to my love language (physical touch, words of affirmation) i have talked to him about this throughout the years and he has improved but some of it is just ingrained to who he is. Most of the time i AM happy, but sometimes i have to check in with him and make sure needs are being met on both sides.

I feel stuck but i also feel like im exactly where im meant to be...how does that make sense.

We used to be in the same class in primary school, never really talked too much, he was always very awkward with me(kind but I got a sense he was a bit shy). After primary school we went to different schools and weren't really in touch. This year I met him on accident, he approached me and seemed to be very keen on meeting me, he even hugged me. I used to come across him a lot since then and we always just smiled and each other but didn't really talk. 

I texted him if he wanted to meet this summer and we went out. To be short it was nice, nothing special, he said he was thinking of me the whole time(after I texted him)

Then nothing, tbh I just moved on with my life, he went on vacation to another part of our country. He texted me 3 weeks ago if I wanted to meet with him again, I decided to do so but didn't have any hopes for nothing more than a friendship. He took me to a restaurant, asked a lot of questions, opened the door for me multiple times and was just very kind and gentle, but I could tell he was still shy. Then we went on a walk and he complemented me on my personality a couple of times. I had to go home early so he drove me back to my house. He also invited me to a New Year's Eve party. He texted me after we met(nothing fancy, like 4 texts) He also wished me happy birthday today and that's pretty much it.

I don't really know how to view this situation, he is very kind but he was always this way towards me. It feels like I'm the more confident one in this case tbh, and in other relationships I'm mostly the shy one. I think if he liked me more he'd text me but...I like him and I don't text him so I'm not sure if that's the right indicator especially if he is this shy. I don't wanna be naive tho. I was also wondering if I could ask him to the prom, but tbh I am scared he will reject this offer.

I’ve always thought things were a bit odd and I wasn’t treated….the best. Being so close to things sometimes blinds us/I should probably work on my self esteem. 
 

We started marriage counseling because we can’t seem to stop fighting. The marriage counselor asked to meet with us each alone after a few sessions. I had my session recently and he told me I should leave my husband, that he believes him to have Paranoid Personality Disorder. He is going to use his session with my husband to discuss this with him and encourage him to see a psychiatrist (psychologist? Now I can’t remember and my head is a little fuzzy with all the EMOTIONS.) I am also going to strongly encourage/push him to go. I have no idea if he will or not. The marriage counselor is not a doctor, but wow, he may have hit the nail on the head. I’m reading all about it and peoples’ experience living with it and I just can’t stop crying. (On top of that, it seems the outlook for folks and their relationships with this PD is pretty freaking bleak.) It’s like all the pain I’ve been pushing down, I can’t deny any longer. It feels wild and disorienting and absolutely heartbreaking to have someone who is essentially a stranger call out the behaviors I’ve been getting more and more concerned about. If it’s not PPD, it’s something extremely similar. Right now I am dealing with him accusing me of trying to exert mind control (his words) over him over things that are really basic marital spats (according to the therapist). It’s a bit easier to know there’s a reason and look at this through the lens of *something is really wrong* rather than him just being an asshole and trying to hurt my feelings/make me crazy, but it is still a total punch to the gut. 
 

 Has anyone dealt with this in an intimate relationship? Has any form of therapy, etc seemed to make a difference with someone you love?
 

 I know divorce is an option, and frankly, it may come to that. Going to give the old “in sickness and in health” a bit of a shot before I head down that road. If he’s willing to do therapy that is. I am also going to start seeing a therapist solo, I need help processing everything and getting my own head on straight about what is “normal” in a relationship now.

He stated he was 6/10 and I responded with ""oh God, if you think you are a 6/10 what do you think I am?"" And without hesitation, he said ""you're a 6/10 too"". 

This was a really big gut punch for me, I struggle with a lot of self esteem issues. I was in a horrible abusive relationship prior to my current bf. My new bf has been nothing but wonderful but this answer was too much.

I know that is the realistic answer but I've also heard him talk about how hot people are and it hurts to know he will never talk about me like that.

The conversation died really quickly after that, I was just kinda going with the motions of the game and trying not to cry. After some more wine we started talking again and even flirting.  But I can't get that 6 out of my head.

TL;DR:
I've had a crush on my Kung Fu teacher and feel that I've been putting moves that were reciprocated(ish) and I'm wondering when I should cut my losses and stop chasing him. 


Story:

Me (Female, 26), Him ( Male, 38)

For the past months, I've been slowly trying to build a relationship with my Kung Fu teacher. Ive tried to be more open in classes, smile more and interact with him more. I thought he was interested with the way he was acting with me, subtle touching (even when he didn't need to), always looking at me, making an effort to be close, sitting on the bench while I'm talking with my friend stating hard at me. He propose to me to help me build my website and then we could work out a partnership together. Since I already knew how to build website I refused. The dance between us continued but with him bringing more attention to me in classes. Yesterday was the celebration of his company, to which I went dress up to the tea. We didn't interact much, however, I did give him a gift to which he seem really grateful for and told me he was gonna open later. That night we didn't really talk much other than in group, most time he seem frustrated and sad, to which I dont understand. He always look at me from afar during that time but never come to talk to me. We were always with people.

I feel like I've been doing more chasing than him. Something is telling me to hang on but I don't know what my strategy should be now ? Like I'm wondering if I'm pretty enough or if he is just not interested.

Everything is great, we have an amazing connection, I enjoy every minute spent with her, and I love and cherish her so much, I'm so grateful for having her in my life.

  
But lately I feel as if I'm falling into a pit. In the whole 10 months that we were together, nothing sexual has happened, beside me going down on her only two times. I'm very affectionate, but she's not, not in the slightest way, and basically I have to take care of all the physical aspect of the relationship. She never initiated anything in the whole 10 months, she rarely expresses any desire for me, and now I'm starting to feel that a lot. I feel hurt, I feel repulsive, I feel hopeless, and I don't know what to do.

I've tried to bring the problem to her in a non-judgemental way, I've always tried to listen to her, to her needs, but she has so many difficulties opening up about the matter. Her previous partner cheated on her, and that's definitely something that's having an influence on the whole situation. Every time I bring up the issue, I always get an angry ""I need my own time"".   
With her I've always tried to create a positive environment, one in which she feels comfortable sharing every problem and everything that's going wrong, but for some reason she just doesn't trust me, she just won't open up.  
I don't want to break up with her, I love her to bits, but I feel like 30% of the relationship is missing, I don't feel close to her, and I feel rejected.  
I don't have that much experience, she's only my second girlfriend, so what do you guys think I should do? What would be the best way to approach the situation and try to let her know that I'm on the same side as her, and not an enemy?

I'll try my best to gather my thoughts here and put it together as neatly as I can!
So about 7 months ago me and my husband became friends with the neighbours (lets call them Steve and Stacey) through children and common interests.

After a while we have started doing things quite regularly together, me more than my husband, twice a week I go to children's clubs with Steve and go to the gym once a week with Stacey and last weekend they invited me round to their house for drinks and to just have a chat about how I'm feeling etc, perfectly normal. 

Here's where it gets confusing, Steve is telling me about his sex life infront of his wife, she's reciprocating, they're going back and forth about intimacy issues with children and how they rarely get time to themselves which is kinda okay, right? But then Steve starts telling me a story about a threesome he had infront of his wife and I am shocked at this point but it doesn't make me uncomfortable or anything, I am an open minded person and I don't mind talking about sex but then he starts joking (or I think joking...) about how they rarely have sex so he ""goes out to get laid every now and then"" and laughs, he said something along these lines multiple times and his wife is unfazed. 

I spoke to my husband about this and he thinks they are swingers and trying to hint at something. What do you guys think? Is this normal behaviour? Are they just very open about their intimate life? Or is there something else going on?

He barely responds when I talk to him and if he does it's pretty cold. He also doesn’t want to meet up anymore. I’ve also received a text that he told all his friends that I’m pulling away and that he doesn’t know what to do, while he’s the one ignoring my texts.

During elementary school, I always followed my friend A, but for a few years I’ve been becoming my own person. However, now it seems that she’s following me. So it was no surprise, when it became obvious that me and my boyfriend were becoming a thing; she told me she also liked him. I told her that me and J were together, but she didn’t like that answer. She’s been sticking to J, I’ve told both of them that I’m uncomfortable with it, but they just laughed at me. I thought I was overreacting and dropped it. Now, however, Alice and Jelko have been getting closer, to the point that he walks away from me to talk to her.

I’m also a pretty insecure person, however over the years I have built quite a bit of confidence. But J and A managed to tear it down in less than a month. I’m really interested in music, both classical and modern, and most of my week is dedicated to it. However, every time I talk about music to either of them, they get really annoyed and laugh at me for it. It is, however, my main interest and it’s the first thing people learn about me. I also have celiac disease, and it doesn’t matter how often I tell him to be careful every time he eats gluten around me he seems to ‘forget’. A is also quite rude to me; for example, Friday she told me very rudely to shut up when I was talking to J (who wasn't replying at all) and J's friend was standing next to us and instead of defending me, he started a conversation with Alice. It was his friend that noticed five minutes later that I had walked away (I was still within hearing distance). It was so rude, that I started crying in public and went home.

To be honest, he’s the one who ended things and I was also distancing myself from him because I was unhappy with the situation. It was the second time we were in contact and this time we saw each other and hooked up. The first time he left because he couldn’t forget his ex and wanted to work on his mental health so we went no contact which I respected. 

The second time he came back, and promised he worked on himself and he wanted me back in his life. I took my time to accept him back. We became friends again, and we met personally for the first time. It was a great time and we remained in contact.

I don’t regret it, I did enjoy my time with him, I knew it was gonna end. It’s the reason why he left for the second time that makes me angry, he left because he wants to go after his ex again. It’s weird because I feel a mix of relief and anger about this situation.

I do realize it was stupid of me to believe that he was over her (they did have a very co-dependant relationship, his family had to meddle because it was taking a huge tool on him). I also saw that even tho he struggled with mental issues, he never worked on them and just pretended he was a bad person and didn’t deserve anything. 

I saw many red flags so by the end I just started to distance myself to gather my thoughts and find the courage to end things. I have been doing therapy since I’m 18, I may have BPD (I have been visiting a psychiatrist who told me I present the signs but it’s too soon to tell), I struggle a lot with cutting people off my life and I know that I want something more serious now but I’m afraid. I know I’m still healing from a bunch of stuff from my past and from my terrible dating experiences. I deleted all the dating apps I used to try and concentrate on myself.

I ask her if she wants to do something fun and she usually says she's too tired or she says she does but rejects everything I list off. I then usually end up staying up later doing things by myself. Even when she does say she wants to do something she only does it for like 20-30 minutes before passing out.

We text every day, all throughout the day - good balance of question-asking and story-telling. We've gone on 3 in-person dates that went really well. I'm historically someone with an anxious attachment style so I'm very sensitive to changes in the way people interact with me - I interpret changes as signs that I'm about to be abandoned. I've been in therapy many years and have done a lot of work on my own to try to cope when those feelings pop up. Until last week, I felt secure with this person. She seems stable and grounded and is very inquisitive and interested in me. She has a lot going on. She plays a sport multiple times a week, she's got a kid who's involved in school-related activities, and she's selling her house.

One day last week, she texted me a bit less than usual and later in the day told me her day was crazy busy. I totally understand that and I didn't feel weird about it at all. She said her job will be very demanding the next month and she didn't know it would be and that she can't really plan for any dates right now. I asked how she liked to be supported when she's super busy. She said all she asks for is understanding. It felt good to get this information.

We still texted every day but a little less than usual, which is understandable. Then, one day, she didn't text me at all. I still sent a typical ""good morning"" text and it could be seen as not asking for a response so I didn't feel so weird about it. She texted me the following day and the day after a little. Then there was a stretch of 5 days where she didn't reach out at all. I sent a text the first day just with a little good morning text. The next day I sent a stupid little story of something that happened that day. 3 days pass and I don't hear from her.
On day 6, I texted that I hoped she had a good week and she responded saying it was wild and asked how things were with me and I responded short and sweet. I realized I was afraid of sending her another message with a question for fear of overstepping some boundary and pushing her away. I also was afraid of coming off as disinterested by NOT asking a follow-up question.

At this point, I'm unsure of how to proceed. I think I have a few options:
1. Text her if I want to and just deal with not getting a response but risk annoying her.
2. Don't text her until she texts me so as not to overstep some boundary and risk not seeming interested.
3. Text her once a week to wish her a good week.
4. Text her to ask what level of communication she wants from me: like are inquisitive messages ok? is she fine with me just sending texts that don't require a response? does she want me to wait for her to contact me?

I just feel like I'm not sure where the boundary is with communication and I don't want to assume anymore. I also don't want to push someone away who is super busy because I've made this situation about myself by asking this question. I also don't want to give off the vibe that I'm not interested anymore.

TL;DR: person I've been seeing for a short while got very busy with work and stopped communicating as much as we have been and now I feel weird about reaching out. I want to ask what level of communication they're okay with from me during this time but I'm afraid of seeming needy/pushy.

I have a problem... I (24 f) am in a mostly happy 3+ year relationship with my partner (25 m), but I do have a big problem. for the last few months my mind has been pushing my partner away from me, in the following way: I literally get soo much anxiety when he is around me and I have a hard time handling this. I just kinda feel.... repulsed in some way? Bit I don't know why because he isn't doing anything wrong. My body and mind just scream to get away from him, run far, far away. And never go back, because then the anxiety will stop. He just left my house because I kept being anxious, I have a hard time controlling my emotions and I am crying a lot. That makes him sad too, so for him this is also really difficult.

The problem is that I know I love him and I was so crazy about him before all this happened. But I am really pushing him away right now and I can't stop. I also don't even know what the reason is. I can't be relaxed anymore while talking to him, and when he touches / hugs me I feel so anxious but at the same time I want to keep him close. But I also want to run away.

My mind screams to break up with him next time we see each other. And I do think breaking up is a short-term solution for this problem, because then my stressfactor is gone. But this problem will probably rise again in a new relationship. And also, I really don't want to break up because I love him so much and we are a great match. And I know I feel this way because of the anxiety. But my mind keeps saying that all this anxiety could be because I wan't to break up and I just don't want to admit that. I don't know if I can handle it any longer to feel this way when we're together. But I really want to make this work. I don't know what to do :(

About 3 years ago, we had our issues and broke up, and he immediately got with her. He was emotionally cheating at the very least. 

We haven't spoken in 15 months and he is blocked everywhere, I forced the no contact because he kept coming around. He saw me on a dating app and sent a message. He wasted no time telling me he's been trying to contact me to tell me he's been sober for a year (his drinking was a reason we broke up too), and has never been able to get over me. He explained he went with the other woman because she enabled his drinking and comforted him, as well as to cushion our break up and not be alone.

lately this past month me and my boyfriend have been continuously arguing, almost (kinda) breaking up 2 times (no longer than a day).the arguments along with some of the things he tells me i am when he's angry ( ""ungrateful, hoe, manipulative, anger issues, bipolar, etc"" ) has really taking a toll on me; since 2020 my already higher than normal anxiety kept getting worse and worse, and it's higher than ever. i have multiple rashes, i scratch, grind my teeth, bite the inside of my cheeks, no motivation/ procrastinate showering (i have ADD it's not depression, can't take my meds be i have ALL the bad side effects)/ basic night hygiene and end up waking up in the middle of the night for hours over not doing it and being anxious, and i really don't know what to do. know he is struggling heavily with his manhood but it's causing me so much stress, and i saw a bit of breakage in my hair while getting ready for work yesterday and i'm so scared it's falling out. i love him i really do and i want to be with him, but i really want to resolve this because the stress is too much and i have panic attacks so much and it’s bad. any advice on how to handle this? how do i make him feel more ""manly""?

things he doesn’t feel manly about:
-no consistent job
-no money ( and the fact that i work more and have more money than him)
-his grades (failing everything with F’s, but he doesn’t even try so he’s scared he will have to drop out and go back to community college; community college = no job fast)
-he barely works out anymore 
- doesn’t feel like he can make me “happy” (??  i guess he thinks it’s his job idk) 
- his car is broken (off facebook marketplace) and he has to repair a lot more with a lot more money than expected initially
- and he is assuming i’m cheating bc i accidentally liked another guy (mutual acquaintance friend; looked thought my phone while i slept without asking after) and even before that kinda he thought i was like a hoe or something",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7597894,public,self,how to make my boyfriend feel better,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z07iu0/how_to_make_my_boyfriend_feel_better/,all_ads,6,

We have 3 kids (my Husband and I). I am at home cooking every meal, get the kids up and ready myself, waking up with the baby every night (excluding maybe 2-3 times a month one night wake up), trying to launch my coaching career while studying to become salesforce certified (just completed 2 other certification prior I’m a certified professional coach through ICF, this current certification is to help get a job while building from home). On top of it I’ve been doing my husbands college homework because he gets paid to go and it helps, but it’s too hard for him he realized (it is biology super hard). The youngest was born in June, she is actually easygoing, middle Kindergarten, oldest middle school. I’ve tried to bulk shop and make bulk meals to cut down $, everyone leaves their dishes out everywhere and things and track dirt all through the house and walls. I’m also in charge of laundry which is thrown all about the house. Middle schooler is in charge of hers but has been hiding hers in ours periodically, and is going through the “gross” phase so I’ve had to do a lot of losing privileges etc. She makes some of her food depending the meal. 

So I have had discussions and made suggestions about how to make these things go easier for me, all ignored. I’ve asked for a break more than just “take a bath”. I feel like all I do is take care of the home, kids, and study and zero self care or hobbies. I have no personal time I’m on autopilot.

I am pissed the above caption was the suggestion from my husband, like they can not do their part of not being total mess makers and him giving me more than a single wake up for a night or two a month and maybe sleeping in and an actual few hours or day to myself. He isn’t a factory worker etc he doesn’t do anything extremely strenuous he’s a realtor (I was one for years before my youngest). Many times he is scrolling tik tok or playing a video game when I approach. He gets mad when I wake him up to ask if he can help citing he’s tired and “you’re the stay at home mom this is your job”. He for no reason stays up late (12,1,2) and wakes up at 9-10am. When we had the 3rd - his idea - I said I would not be putting this one in a daycare (we don’t need to and also our 2nd spent a lot of time there due to real estate and speaking events and never again). He agreed and said he’d help out.

I’m just mad. I don’t need “more energy to do more” at the cost of my youngest, when everyone at minimum could just do their part and my husband could too and back me up.

I wasn't ready for a relationship and I'm honestly still not.

Things have been much calmer lately and we talked things out multiple times, she tells me about her hookups, i tell her about mine with bo bad feelings. She's very open to how she feels and she's told me every single time she felt like she hasn't moved on completely.

Thing is she's been dropping obvious hints lately about wanting to hookup again. Nothing close to how romantic the hints were when we first started, its purely physical hints now.

She is a very attractive person and we get along really well, i would hate to hurt her or put her in a situation in which she doesn't know how she feels again.

I'm thinking of talking to her about it and establishing boundaries to make sure no one really falls in love, I've done it before with success to be fully honest.

Iv’e always had my best friends from I met growing up that I’ve met from middle school to highschool and we hang out when we get the chance. I’ve also got a group of friends similar in size from the ones at home in college. Between both my friends groups, we’re all guys and only about 3 of them between both the groups have girlfriends.

I don’t typically have fun at these types of things, I don’t have much in common with the types of people who go to them, and I do try to force myself to like them so I can meet new people, especially girls, but when I go, I virtually have nothing in common with these people and it makes everything so stressful and difficult. I dress well try to present myself well and defent at having conversation, but deep down, I more typically a introvert and like anime, games, deep conversations, movies.

I don't know how to push these feelings down especially when I hang out with my friends and they're talking about all these new girls etc. But it is also confusing to me as I am really happy with my girlfriend and we have a very active sex life. Even mundane things with her are super enjoyable.

I don't know if I should bring these feelings up to her and I also don't know how to suppress these feelings.  It has nothing to do with her I'm not interested in dating other girls it's strictly sexual curiosity.

There is a good friend of mine (33 M) and my friend group that just will not leave my house. I have gone from politely hinting to blatantly telling him to leave but he just won't. I'm here alone, I don't want to cause any drama with my friend group or getting the police involved and honestly I don't have the time or energy right now. I feel trapped in my own home.

I am in the middle of some extremely demanding and competitive studies at the moment. I have to study or be in class nearly 12 hours a day.

This has been hard when it comes to balancing relationships. I am letting a friend (33 F) of mine who is currently unemployed stay with me while she gets on her feet after a bad break up. She is very helpful around the house and is good at getting our other friends to leave or distracts them while I study. However, she recently had a family emergency and had to leave for the weekend.

This other friend of ours found out and asked if he could come over for the weekend and keep me company and I said no directly and that I didn't have time to hang out I have to study so it wouldnt be worth the 3 hour trip for him. He kept insisting and insisting so we came to the agreement that he would just come for an hour and we would eat lunch together then he would leave.

So, I was surprised when he showed up with a suitcase and asked him where he was staying and he just smiled and said ""here, I hope you dont mind. It is just a very far drive."" I just said ok, you can stay in my room. I'll be in my office studying I can come down later to set the table for lunch. I thought that was that. 

However, he decided to come in where I was studying and slurp his coffee and make commentary on his book he was reading. He would also just keep sighing louder and louder. I turned to him and told him I am trying to concentrate and it is a bit distracting. He promised to be quiet and said he just wanted to spend time with me because our friend who is living with me often chills and reads while I study. 

He made a nice lunch and we talked and chilled like usual and then I went back to the office to study. He came in and started getting touchy with me and I told him again to stop and I need to study. He then decided that this was a good time to ask what we were. I just answered with we are friends. I'm not looking for a relationship right now and continued on.

 At around 2am he asked if we could go to sleep. I told him he can go sleep in my room I'll just sleep on the mattress in the office when I'm done. He looked disappointed and said ""I thought we could maybe sleep together in the same bed?"" I told him no, we already talked about this. We are just friends. He left and around 3:30 am I decided to go to sleep. I left my door cracked open so my cat could get in. About 15 minutes after laying down. He entered my room and started spooning me. He whispered ""y'know, I think we are something more serious than just friends don't you think?"" and tried to kiss me and my neck. I just froze for a second and then burst out crying and pushed him away telling him I really just want to be left alone could he leave. He just hugged me tighter and told me that he understands my studies are hard. I told him that I want to sleep alone and he can go back to my bed, but he refused to leave ""because I was so upset"". So I got up and went to my room to sleep. 

The next morning, I didnt know what to do. My computer and all of my papers were in my office so I just went in and turned on my computer to study. He was still laying on the mattress and asked me to come cuddle and I told him no and I would really like it if he left now so I can work. He pouted and just said he would go for a run to clear his mind and leave after. I said fine. He kissed me on the forehead and left. I didn't make eye contact or say anything. Well, now he came back, took a shower and literally will not leave. He is downstairs eating right now and I have just been studying and ignoring him as I'm writing this.

I know I sound spineless but this is a long time friend of our group and idk what has gotten into him as he is not usually like this. I really want to avoid drama as I am already stressed out of my mind... thanks in advance for the advice.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7597868,public,self,How do you ask a friend to leave your house in a polite yet effective way?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z07cm5/how_do_you_ask_a_friend_to_leave_your_house_in_a/,all_ads,6,

She picked me up at 1pm, took me to a birthday surprise, a VR arena, we played 4 game. it was on a meta quest, she got so in to it a bit too much, she accidentally punched me. After that we went for food then went bowling.  

After bowling it was 10:30pm, she says “what else do you want to do” it’s 10:30pm it’s dark and mostPlaces will be closed. So my head is thinking “is she hinting, she said she didn’t wanna stay out late, she has work ” I told her “you said you didn’t wanna stay out for too long, I know you got work tomorrow, I don’t want you to feel like you have to” she said “if I wanted to go home, I would of already gone” i suggest all these different things  but she decides  to take me up a mountain and we had conversations. 

When I saw her two months ago, we hung over all day again, one of the things we did was drive up a mountain and talk. my sister asked me did we have sex up the mountain (weird question to ask because I don’t talk to my sister about stuff like that) , I literally told my friend about this yesterday I said “she thought me and you had sex” she laughed and said, “next time tell them yes, say it was like titanic, it was hot and steamy, we did doggystyle and we did anal” she has a sense of humour for sure but I’m thinking in my head “do friends joke about having sex with  each other ” she dropped me off at my house till 1am. I just came to ask you guys, is this just banter or she’s hinting ?.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7597867,public,nsfw,Sublimable hints or just a close friendship?
