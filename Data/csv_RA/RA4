My friend powerlifts and enjoys going to the gym. My boyfriend also goes to the gym regularly. He asked her to help him because he says his form isn’t good and she wants practice programming workouts. I told my boyfriend it would make me uncomfortable. I’m aware that the reason is because of insecurity and irrational jealousy. He still went to her gym because I told him I don’t control him so ultimately it’s his decision. My friend asked if I was okay with it, I told her it was up to him. 

I don’t know what to do. He’s still going to keep on going regardless of how I feel because “It’s just working out”. He said I can join them but I don’t have time anyways I work a 9-5, their schedules are more flexible. This also upsets me because he went hiking alone with her last month and they went out to eat after. I don’t think they’d actually do anything to hurt me but it still upsets me.

I made a post on this thread about a month ago, and was overwhelmed by the support I received from this community.

I really dug into him in the post - mentioned some specific transgressions and how he dealt with them poorly - but I think this deterred the audience. Everyone was sure I was being emotionally abused, especially after finding the detail that his ex-wife is also a relationship therapist who is a professor and community activist against domestic partner violence. She has essentially written textbooks about how the man I’m with was verbally abusive and dismissive to her 15 years ago.  She divorced him and he was despondent for years about it, but through therapy was able to come to the conclusion that she has unaddressed OCPD and their personalities clashed big time. 

I have met her often, and she is indeed a raging asshole. The two boys we co-parent are constantly berated by her, especially the youngest who I adore, and she never spends quality time with them. She is not well-liked by her colleagues, and is a classic helicopter mom (I used to work at the school system the boys go to - she was the type to constantly be there bitching at the teachers about our youngest son’s grades). 

My partner on the other hand is very well liked by his colleagues and the boys are not spoiled here by any means, but they love being around him. He is very kind, smart, and loving. 

However, he is terrible at fighting. So terrible that even though I love everything about his personality, I am struggling to stay in this relationship. Mostly, he is dismissive of my feelings, so I’ve stopped bringing up things that bother me. For instance he has a habit of leaving used floss picks around the house (like on the dining room table), and it’s totally gross to me. I talked to my therapist before I talked to him so I could bring it up the right way. I did exactly as she told me - calmly assert that the habit really bothers me and request that he be more attentive. He said, “Do you know what a ‘soft start’ is? It helps you get the things you want in a discussion like this. Do you think that was an effective soft start?” Which derailed me and eventually led to him saying, “It’s really about perspective. I am able to forgive you when you leave blankets unfolded or a dish in the sink -  you need to be able to shift your perspective to maintain the peace.” 

He is good at making the argument feel like it’s going in circles, but I’m not sure who he is protecting. He is neglectful - he doesn’t text back very often, he doesn’t send compliments my way often, he doesn’t initiate intimacy - and he has great reasons for all of these things that make them land back on my plate to deal with by myself. Both of these characteristics together - poor fighting tactics and lack of positive attention - are murdering my good feelings for him. 

He’s a relationship therapist, so how do you address these issues with a literal doctor of relationships? He holds strong to his rationale, never softens to salvage, and has walked away from me multiple times because “I am overwhelmed by your behavior.”

My “bad relationship behavior” leans towards being TOO accepting and quiet. I grew up with very loud and abrasive alcoholic parents, so I am hyper aware of my tone and body language during conflict, probably to a fault. I want my partner to feel seen and heard and want us to make a compromise. I’m always ready to learn and adapt, and have never had a problem in this arena in previous relationships. Why this one with a “relationship expert?”

I am completely closed down to him at this point, and feel stressed in his company even though we haven’t had a fight in a few weeks. I cried in the dark the last time we had sex - he finally initiated something so I wanted to reward it, but I didn’t /really/ want to do it.

I want to open back up to him and take responsibility for how I have withdrawn, but I also think my withdrawing is for my own protection.

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for over a year now. Before moving for medical school in August and becoming long distance, he introduced me to his parents in July, and I really hit it off with both of them - it's to the point that I text his mom almost every day and talk to her on the phone at least once a week. My boyfriend's mom will text me that she loves me, and my boyfriend constantly discusses the future with me. He's in his 4th year of medical school right now, and I have played a role in his decision for where he goes to residency. I come from a pretty conservative Indian family, so with all the above factors and putting in all this effort with him and his parents while going through my first semester of medical school, I guess I started considering them family.

My boyfriend has a brother who is older and started dating his girlfriend around the same time that my boyfriend and I started dating; the difference is that his family knew about the brother's girlfriend months before they knew about me. She's been accepted by not just the immediate family, but also the extended family, whereas no one in my boyfriend's extended family is supposed to know about me. This has bothered me a little bit, but I actively try not to compare their relationship to ours, since my boyfriend's brother is older and their family want them to get married soon - they are at a different spot in the relationship.

I guess the issue I'm having is feeling like my relationship isn't validated, and I'm an outsider to their family. While I would have gone home to spend Thanksgiving with my family anyway, it would have been nice to at least be invited/told that I'm missed, since the brother's girlfriend is spending Thanksgiving with them. On top of that, my boyfriend has barely communicated with me this week (which, trust me I get because he's with his family), which fuels this feeling of not being missed; I consider my boyfriend my family, but I'm starting to feel like he doesn't think of me the same way. 

I've spoken to my boyfriend about this, and he said that I should stop stressing and comparing, because in a couple years we'll be in the same spot. However, it doesn't help how I feel right now - at this point I realize that I've gotten ahead of myself in this relationship, and if I want to preserve my emotional/mental health I need to pull myself back. I do love my boyfriend, and I feel like if I give things time things will be okay.

We had a child together who just turned 1 this month and she is also currently expecting our second child due in late May. At the beginning our relationship was that of fairy tales, we regularly joked that what we had was true love, or “Movie love” as she would put it lol she took the time to try to enjoy my hobbies, I did the same, we laughed a lot, talked about our future and pasts etc normal “honeymoon” phase stuff. This went on for about a year or so and slowly she started becoming less affectionate, stopped showing interest in my hobbies, stopped outwardly showing love and so I brought it up and we talked and she said she understood and would work on it. This is when she started to break up with me every time we had an argument or fight. She’d walk out, get in “her car” and just leave, wouldn’t answer calls texts anything. Eventually she would answer and I’d beg her to come home and apologize (even if the argument started because I confronted her and told her she did something to upset or offend ME). This went on for almost a full year until we had a HUGE knock down drag all fight because after coming back from out of town where she was as cold as Ice the entire time, I sat down and tried explaining I wasn’t happy, and that I thought we’d be happier apart. Again she freaked out but this time got more suicidal than angry, said she needed me, didn’t feel safe, wanted to die etc so I went back to her. We agreed she needed help with her mental health and she went for what she likes to call “a grippy sock vacation”. She came back medicated for her issues, and has been in therapy since that time. Things got better for a week maybe a month but she went right back to gaslighting me, making me feel bad for feeling certain ways about her behavior, but this time she has the support of her therapist (who is either giving terrible advice or she’s just not telling her therapist the whole story) either way since starting therapy a year ago or so she doesn’t break up with me after every fight but things are still not good. I have brought this up to her affair a few different times, and it doesn’t really matter what I say or how I put it. It always ends up with me apologizing to her for having hurt her feelings. I love this woman. She is my best friend in the entire world and I could not ask for a better mother to my children. I don’t want to lose her. I want her to stay my best friend. I want her to stay a coparent I had friends growing up that stayed a week at their mothers, a week at their fathers, and their parents were best friends, but not romantically involved and that is what I want, I don’t know how to bring this up to her because every time I’ve ever brought it up to her. It has always ended up with again me apologizing and so maybe my problem is sticking to my guns. I’m not sure now in regards to our children I love my son more than the air that I breathe. I love him more than I ever thought a human could love some thing I will love my second son, the exact same and I want to be in their life as much as physically possible I’m not trying to abandon anybody here. I’m not trying to abandon any responsibilities I’m a father. End of discussion and I will be your father for the rest of my life. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done with my life but I just think that romantically my relationship with their mother is not working anymore, so my question to you is do you have any advice for starting the conversation and maybe how I should put things?

It took me almost three years to ""conquer"" him and this summer we finally got together. I am, in fact really happy. He is smart, good looking, friendly, ambitious, funny, etc. And he always tells me how much he adores me, that I am the only person who truly knows and loves him. We are moving together in March (his idea). In the last weeks his sex drive decreased, although over the years where we got to know each other, we had tons of sex and I always had the feeling he finds me attractive.

And now comes the point. Yesterday he admitted, that it took him such a long time to ""fall"" for me, because he doesn't find me pretty. In other words: he and also all his friends (he's 31) think my face is ugly and also told him so. 

It is weird, because I never assumed myself being THAT ugly. I have a overbite, but straight teeth, I'm well educated, really friendly and have - no joke - a body like a model. Nice boobs, nice butt, small waist, long blond hair and I'm tall and have long legs.

To get back. I am now, deeply insecure about that. I find myself having fear to look in the mirror nor in his face because I don't want to remind him of my ""uglyness"". He also told me that is ex girlfriend absolutely hit his beauty standards in a woman (small, big boobed, figure like someone who already got children) and I feel that I could never give him what he needs in a woman.

Although we had great times we’ve had out bad times as well and every time we did she would blame me for starting them.

So this needs a lot of context. I've been with this person for a few months now (we were friends for a while first) and I was hesitant at the beginning because he said that he loved me quite quickly. It is also worth noting that we live in the same city, but different areas and we see each other when we can considering that he's busy a lot. He talks about his exes often, also mentioning how he was invited to go out with one of them on a day we were meant to have a date, but promises that he's cut all contact with this ex and has no feelings for her. Lately we've been arguing more and more, usually because he points out all my flaws but won't address his own; I apologise for anything i may have done to hurt him (he says me pointing out that he barely makes time for me anymore is hurtful) but he told me to ""suck it up"" and get over the fact that he's different towards me now.

 Days ago, I recommended we take a break to have some breathing space because the arguments are taking a toll on us. I tried to discuss it with him and get to the bottom of why they occur, but he's in denial about the fact that he not only starts said arguments, but makes them bigger than they need to be; i admitted to also insulting him during one of these arguments. During the whole conversation he didn't accept any blame and made himself out to be entirely innocent. He didn't particularly agree to the break at first but soon after said he wants to. It was at this point that he said he ""doesn't love me as much anymore but it's only a possibility and isn't sure if it's true yet"" - to which I said that I was confused. I was even more confused at the fact that he said he doesn't want to break up, but is unsure about me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7622661,public,self,"He says he doesn't love me as much anymore, but wants to stay together?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2rvxm/he_says_he_doesnt_love_me_as_much_anymore_but/,all_ads,6,,,

I was dating this guy long distance who lived across another continent. He asked me to come visit him in the spring, which I did, and we had a great time. About 1.5 years in things settle down and I notice him slowly distancing himself. We do therapy, which seems to help, and we attend that regularly. In the mean time I booked another trip to go to his country because he couldn't easily go to mine. I spent $4000.00+ to fly there and even booked events for us to do. He knew about this and even offered to meet me and brought up the idea in the first place.

On the aside, his family didn't like me. They never met me, not once, and I never spoke to them either. They were religious and said I had a bad aura and it would mean his demise if he continued seeing me. He ignored them on this for months. A few days before I was due to fly out he told me he had a bad fight with them and that his parents were not speaking to him. 

He slowly pulled away more and stopped responding to texts. The day I was supposed to take an international flight I called him to confirm that he was still meeting me at the airport when I landed as he had previously. He had told me all the way up to that point he was going to meet me and it was important to do so since the city he lives in is pretty dangerous, especially for foreigners. He must have said he would be there at least 20 times leading up to it. He even said it the day before. On the phone that morning he once again agreed to meet me at the airport but seemed reluctant.

An hour later I got a text that he couldn't come and he would figure something out. I didn't hear from him for another hour, at which time I was freaking out because I had a flight due in 5 hours to get to that would take me out of my country.

I furiously began cancelling everything I could. I couldn't cancel everything and incurred penalties of $2k+. I immediately messaged him and told him to never do this again to any human being as it violated every tenant of human decency to ghost someone on an international trip. I would be a lone foreign woman in a very dangerous city if I landed there with no one to meet me.

My self-esteem and heart is shattered. I don't really know up from down right now. I blocked him on several platforms. I doubt he'll try to message me, but I suspect he listened to his family about my 'bad aura' after they had that fight and decided last minute to throw me away for them like trash. He always tried to show up for me before all this, but the last time I talked to him he was callous and cold on the phone, like it was a great effort to speak to me while I begged him not to abandon me after I touched down. That's when he reluctantly agreed again he wouldn't. Prior to all that he was absolutely adamant he would meet me and did so in the spring.

Still processing this. I've never had something happen to me like this before. I'm not even sure what was going through his head. It's like a switch was flipped and I was nothing to him.

I want to see my boyfriend.  He’s been really depressed lately and I just want to make sure he’s okay.  Just talking over the phone is not enough, I need to see him.

Im just not sure if my workplace will find it reason enough to take off during a blackout month.

I’m just so worried.  Since daylight savings ended it’s been difficult finding time to talk to him.  He calls me on his break we’re in the middle of setting up the store.  When we’re done he’s finished with his break.  He calls me when he finishes work but I’m in the middle of closing up which requires both my hands. (I work in a jewelry store and we put away the jewelry every night) I get home from work and it’s late for him…he stays up for me but it’s so late I feel bad sometimes.  

I’m off when he works, he’s off when I work…

I feel stuck.

We’re long distance with a time difference currently 5 hours (4900+ miles away).  The furthest a couple can be while still living in the US…

My other siblings (we have a very large family) always pay for her, no complaints. But sometimes I feel taken advantage of. For instance, on my bday she gave me $50, but then wanted me to pay for her meal and come on a trip with me where she paid nothing. My bday present basically paid for her trip. I should also note she doesn’t outright ask for me to pay, but she’ll forget her money (conveniently), or she’ll talk about how expensive her lawyer fees are for her divorce and how she can’t afford anything. But she wants to see me every two weeks and it’s never even.

My siblings think I’m being stingy but I think she’s taking advantage of all of us. I saw that Mila Kunis interview recently where she said she’s never paid a cent to her parents and that was kind of what made me realize how much I spend on my mom.

It was wonderful, but we had some problems largely caused by me. We broke up in September and were both distraught for the whole month we were apart. 

So, one month ago, he reached out and we enjoyed a wonderful two days together. However, I confessed some things and couldn’t bear the look in his eyes when he looked at me. He couldn’t even kiss me. Essentially, during our relationship I was not over one of my exes and that led to me making some disgusting choices that still sicken me today. I was still emotionally invested in the past and valued that over what was right in front of me. I loved him. I did. I was just not over these romanticized ideas I’d had of my ex and I. And when we would fight, I went back to those ideals, because that first ex and I never fought—we weren’t together long enough. There was none of the struggle of a real relationship. It was wrong of me. I know I am right to feel ashamed and guilty. I can’t get over the anxiety sometimes that this will happen again. I know relationships take work, but bc  I have that summer fling with zero conflict, I couldn’t stop romanticizing it. And I let myself do it for so long as a coping mechanism. 


But back to the problem. the next day after our two days together I broke up with him because I knew I was not good for him, and also because I couldn’t bear going forward knowing the relationship was built on my disloyalty. Knowing that anytime I looked into his eyes I’d see the pain I caused. And I thought it was the best case scenario. I thought he wouldn’t be hurt anymore. And I thought I would have to be met with constant reminders of the pain I caused. But I still am. I still wake up every day crying. I still get so nauseous. Sometimes I’ll see people say “once a liar, always a liar” or other ones like that and I’ll just panic because I feel like I’m never going to be loved like that again. Because of course I should have had better judge of character. But I was so selfish and now I can’t see myself in a positive light—and I know no one else will. Because people who emotionally cheat like I did are not trustworthy. I can’t even trust myself. 


And every day it’s the same thing. I cry about him never coming back. I cry that I’m never going to have that love or love someone like that ever again. I can’t bring myself to delete any photos or texts. I freaked out yesterday when I saw he hadn’t read something I’d written. I was so distraught over the thought of him never coming back. 

But then, when he did read it, I felt instantly better. And then I started to worry. What if he comes back and I have to sit there and see he doesn’t trust me? What if ten years down the line he says I never got over what you did? What if I can’t sleep from the anxiety of what I did ever again? 


And in short, it’s those two things that are tugging on me. I want him back because of the love that is there. I think of him and I’m instantly calm. 
But I can never have him back because of the pain I caused. Because I can’t ask him to forgive me and move on. It will never be the same. And that ruins me. 


I still can’t believe I ended up here. It’s fully my own fault. I know I have to separate my past from my present. I just have always regretted my past very strongly, even minor things, so something like this that’s permanently hurting him and affecting me is really, really hard to see myself moving on from. But I’m so scared to lose him. I’m so scared that I’ll never love like that again. Or find someone who loves me like that. I’ve never been so open with someone before. 
And I still ruined it.

Hi guys, so to explain the situation, my (26m) gf (35f) has got a guy friend that we both know through work. Recently we’ve both had a hell of a lot going on through deaths in the family terminally I’ll people and her trying to adopt her friends child due to them being put in care.

Now because of this she asked if we could have a break because it was going to affect the adopted child as they had seen it as something concerning that we were a new relationship and that she wouldn’t want her. I completely understood this and we agreed we would still be each others person and that we love eachother no matter what.

The thing I’m struggling with is the mutual guy friend. She’s been spending a lot more time with him recently on her own and it’s making me paranoid something is going to happen, they do smoke weed together and such but I’m overthinking it and becoming possessive of her and it’s causing more problems when all it has to be is we are a secret for a few months.

Obviously we used to spend every day together, took her to work and took her home and now he’s doing that sometimes too. Understand she needs time on her own and with friends.

She’s having a couple of days to breathe at the moment and staying in an hotel. Now I know he’s been round because she told me but I’m very paranoid something is going on between them.

How do I fix this? I don’t want to cause more arguments because we’ve spoke about it before and she made me aware I’m coming off as very possessive which I’m trying not to do.

He said “nothing, I knew this is what I’ve always wanted and hoped for, but reading it made me feel like it’s not real, I’m feeling a bit odd and in a state of disbelieve, maybe because I’m not used to getting what I want”… i was disappointed, but I told him let it sink in. Then I talked about how he’s been a little cold lately, and that it makes me have all kinds of thoughts, is he: (falling out of love, cheating, upset, etc)? he said there’s no reason and that’s just him, and he’ll try to talk more (he told me when we first met that he’s naturally aloof). he also said he’s always been the diplomat and and rational one in any relationship or friendship, but with me he couldn’t be that person, he said I’m the most rational person he knows, (I guess he was feeling out of character when he was too clingy and emotionally dependent on me at the beginning).

I was raised extremely christian by pastors. I was also raised very republican and to find homosexuality disgusting. Luckily, my political beliefs and obviously my sexuality have since flipped. I have just recently officially turned away from christianity within the past few months. I, unfortunately, was very involved in ministry so I can’t leave until I come out or my family will start asking questions. I have full intentions of coming out as Bisexual and Agnostic in January. I have also ONLY dated and had sex with men previously.

The beef:
 
I am now dating this girl that I am soooo down bad for. She’s literally the most gorgeous girl I have ever seen. But, I have NEVER had a sexual experience with a girl before or even explored my sexuality at all. I’ve never even watched lesbian porn. She likes to be dominated and has lots of sexual experience with women. I am a top and she’s a bottom, so I’m VERY nervous. I have such impostor syndrome with being bisexual that I feel like I will have a hard time being sexually attracted to women. I think it’s just my nervousness getting in the way and the fact that I’ve spent my entire life being taught to hate that. I’m sure once I do it once it’ll be like second nature. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How do I go about getting over this because I’m most definitely super into this girl?

Me (18M) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for around 10 months ish now. We go to school together, hang out everyday met at school etc. Recently, actually it's happened quite often not just recently, we've been getting into really bad arguments. Most of them start of with extremely pointless things which I don't even remember and it always seems to go exactly the same. For example our most recent one was, about how during school time, I was at the cafeteria and he was supposed to be there but I guess he was late for some reason which is fine, I was just looking for him. A while later I find him and I go up to him and said ""Oh I didn't see you I missed you, where've you been"" to him raising his voice at me saying ""In class"" looking visibly pissed off. Then he proceeded to not talk to me the time we were there and (we usually walk everywhere together) sped off while we were walking together. Later during the day he texts me saying ""kys"" and to that I replied ""thanks lmao"" and he says "" yeah you really deserve it"". This obviously pissed me off and hurt me a lot so I didn't walk with him after school and just got on my bus. I was pretty upset and sort of ignored him for a few hours and decided to focus on something else, I was watching the world cup matches and so I posted a few stories regarding them and to those he replied ""shut up stop talking about your stupid football"" "" I dont wanna hear about it"" many more messages along the lines but thats the jist of it. Then proceeded with more messages saying ""go fuck yourself"" ""go fuck (a friend of mine)"". He then talked about how I walked by him to my bus without looking at him (I didnt know he was there) saying "" oh you looked so cool walking to your van"" "" bitch literally walked by me dickhead either tried to look cool or didnt notice"" ""walking like some big ego athlete"". Obviously I was quite upset about him saying all this so I argued back and kept talking about how I was talking to other people perfectly fine and was only just pissed at him, which doesnt make sense because idk if Im supposed to be pissed off with everyone when one person has pissed me off. Throughtout this whole convo he kept on insulting me like that and I just got tired and decided to mute his messages and he had a semi breakdown saying ""I cant fucking tell you anything"" ""I fucking hold in everything cus you just tell me to calm down and fuck you""(this really isnt true, he mostly tells me his issues and I try my best to solve them, if i cant i usually just try to be there for him"". Recently he went on a trip with a group of friends and they shared a room with one of our mutuals (F). He didnt want to sleep on the bed at the hotel because there were stains on it which i completely understand but then they slept on the couch with his friend which did make me a little uncomfortable and I mentioned it but I understood since there wasnt much of a choice. In our current argument he brings it up saying ""I fucking tell you im uncomfortable by something and you just focus on me sleeping next to someone"" and continues ""everytime i fucking tell you something i worry if youre gonna be upset by it"" (none of this is referring to anything and personally it just felt like he wanted to find things to be mad at me) also this was all after his anger spell where he continuously insulted me and said a lot of fucked up shit. I told him that I understood that there were issues and that we could talk about them any time and that we could talk about them if you felt like you wanted to, but I didnt understand why he decided to bring everything up now, and to me it felt like he was sort of playing the victim which I mentioned to him, to which he got increasingly got pissed off at and kept on telling me to go fuck myself. Again he says "" fuck you you probably dont even want to have sex with me"" which I honestly dont know where that came from since we literally did it the night prior and I wanted to. Since I'm in one of my school sports teams, we get new jerseys and he knew about those and he just says ""new jersey how fucking nice ill fucking find it and rip it before you wear it"" I told him that if he wanted to properly talk about things and sort things out but we arent going to make any progress if he keeps on being unreasonably angry like this, To that he just says fuck you leaves me on delivered after saying ""nothing i ever do is good enough"" ""im gonna cut and sleep bye"". Next day at school I really didn't feel like speaking to him I felt insulted and disrespected and mostly hurt, but he talked to me sort of normally so I just went along, although I was hesitant. After we got home he asked me if we were gonna talk about tomorrow and I said sure whenever he wanted to. He said he was sorry and I told him I was still pretty hurt and hes like ""whats there to even talk about I was being a dick"" ""I didnt mean any of it but thats for you to decide"" and then he just says "" you know what I said, I wont say it again its up to you"". He was obviously quite upset and crying and so I tried my best to cheer him up , he said he wanted to call and I said alright. We got on call and he didn't say anything, neither did I, I didnt feel like speaking. He then hangs up saying ""yk what sucks theres no point in calling were just sitting in silence"" and I asked him why he left and didnt speak and he said it was because I sighed, I honestly dont remember sighing I dont even think I was breathing that loud so I told him I didnt. He then replies with ""whatever, my fault you sighed"". Fast forward to now, we're on call hes crying his eyes out and I feel like dogshit, I dont know what to do if Im doing things wrong or what I should even do now. Long post I'm sorry I know its formatted badly but I have a test I need to study for so I was in a rush.

PS. we've had plenty of arguments like this, but I didnt really mention them because the same thing happens everytime (he gets upset about a small issue, gets mad at me, i try to fix it, get insulted and hurt, feel bad because he said he didnt mean it, i dont bring it up again.)",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7622523,public,self,I don't really know what to do right now,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2r88i/i_dont_really_know_what_to_do_right_now/,all_ads,6,,,

This is my first post so sorry if it's messy, has grammar mistakes and comes off as a rant instead.

So first, my parents always expect me to have very high grades like 90+/100. They also think that if I really studied hard, I could be perfect in any test. So when they see I'm not perfect in my test, they would think I didn't study hard enough. I mean that would be possible but they expect it from me and that doesn't help with the stress I'm already feeling. When I did get high grades, they wouldn't even praise me or be proud of me since they just expected it from me. 

They also wouldn't let me have my own room and let me be alone in our house. It because mother is always worried that a disaster might happen like a fire or someone breaking in. They wouldn't even let me go outside on my own and they have the audacity to blame me for being shy. Like, did you really expect me not to be shy when you literally won't let me be in the outside world. They don't care about privacy and would think that I'm hiding something if I talk about ur. They don't like me giving my phone number to anyone except our relatives. 

And the time when I can use my phone is just ridiculous. I can only play my phone during weekends and they also have a time limit (12:00-1:30pm and 6:00-9:00pm). I always have high grades and it's rare for me to have average grades, especially failling grades. I just feel that it's extremely unfair when my classmates can use their phones whenever they want. Also, my father kept telling our relatives and his friends that all I do is play my phone and sleep. I feel really hurt that he and my mother disregard my high grades like it's nothing, probably cause they already think that it's a bare minimum. I don't know why they are like this. Why can't they try to see things from my perspective? Why do they have to put such high expectations and strict rules on me? Why can't they just try to be content and be happy with what I can do?

I have some hobbies but I don't usually do them since my parents want me to be good at it. Like that one time, father knows I want to play piano so he bought one and expect me to be good at it. I don't even know anything about piano and he wants me to teach myself. That makes me lose any interest I have in piano and he gets angry because I wasted his money. Next year, I will be in senior high and I don't even know what I want in my life. I just go to school cause my parents would get angry at me if I didn't. Everything just seems so exhausting to me and not worth anything anymore. Sometimes I wish that I when I wake up, God would take pity on me and won't wake me up in this world anymore. 

I know people will say that I should just ignore them but it's hard when you're with them almost all the time. It's hard hearing them all the time constantly belittle me, tell me that I'm ugly, point out my failures, get angry even at the simplest mistakes and expect me to do what they want. I don't know how people can cope up with this, I don't have anyone I can trust to tell about this. Taking to them won't get me anywhere since I already tried that. They would always think they're right and that it's for my own good. They will tell me that I'm lucky that I'm even studying at a private school, have a home and have something to eat when all I need to do is get high grades and do what they want.  So yeah, I don't want to have that talk again. That's also probably why I'm anxious when talking since I'm scared that I'll say something wrong. 

So should I just ignore it or do you guys have any advices on what to do? If I just need to ignore it can you guys give me some tips on ignoring it. I'm pretty sensitive so I cry when I hear something bad they say about me.

There are  4 people In my friend group including me, or I guess, was 4 people. Me (18m), O (18f), R(18f), and L(20m). We all went to school together, O and L dated for a few months at some point, broke up and only got back together halfway through O's senior year. O and R had been friends for years, and I became friends with O at the beginning of our senior year (we were all 17 when we became friends)

Over the year me and O became really close, and I developed feelings for her, I love her, in every sense of the word, but I knew she was happy how everything was, and all I want is to see her happy.
Me and L have never had any problems with each other, not that I know of at least. But we also didn't hang out unless it was woth everyone.

Now to actually relation ship advice part. Monday morning O blocked me on everything, the previous Friday we had plans that got canceled, I was told her parents needed to talk to her about the fact that she was moving out, which sucked, but it sounded like something her parents would do. Well over the weekend she was really weird about talking to me, at first I thought it was due to her talk eith her parents, similar things have happened. What I mean about weird was she would leave me on opened, or delivered, and our streak timer popped up, which doesn't happened unless one of us is being dodgy.

Well Monday morning comes around and I see the timer so I send a snap after her leaving me on read and go about my day. A few hours go by and I check snapchat and find that she blocked me, my heart dropped, I could feel my pulse across my body as I tried everything I could to see if could still talk to her. 

Blocked on everything

I started asking all of our mutual friends and eventually R gets back saying she doesn't know anything but will ask, later that might she tells me O said L blocked me. I've since learned that our plans on Friday weren't canceled, or at least, R went to O's on the day of the plans, and the day after.

I'm writing this because i don't know what to do, I want to talk to her, hear the story from her end, but the o ly way to do that is go to where she works when she gets out, but I worry that it's crossing a line or something. 

I just want her to be happy, but I don't know how to do that right now.

The relationship got extremely mentally and physically abusive. He made me hate myself and used me financially, sexually and drained me in every way possible.

Looking back on it I was so delusional for putting up with it and staying. It only gets worse, leave when you can. I am alone now but its much better and peaceful.

I'm learning to love myself and be at peace in my own company, its important to heal before jumping into another relationship.

She and I were very close in our early and mid-20s, and I spent so much time with them growing up. My parents were divorced and my mom had full custody, but I still saw my dad a lot. He lived with my cousins and her mom my whole childhood. The past 10 years she and I have grown apart a lot. We don't talk very often--maybe sending each other video messages a couple of times a month. I moved out of state, but I still make it a point to go visit a couple of times a year. Still--she's the closest person I've ever had in my life to a sister. We've been through a lot together; not for years, but still. I have another maid of honor that I've also known my entire life--our mom's were best friends in college and raised us together. She and I talk multiple times a week, however, I don't know how to explain it; I just cannot even imagine not having my cousin in my wedding and right by my side. 

My cousin has a lot of friends she's closer to than she is to me so if she ever got married, while I fully expect I'd be a bridesmaid I really doubt I'd be her maid of honor, but part of me doesn't really care. 

I'm thinking of saying something like, ""I know that the last several years have seen us not be able to spend as much time together, but you're super important to me; really the closest person I've ever had to a sister, and there is no way I'd want to do this day without you!""

However, when I met my partner (now Fiancee), I didn't expect that everyone in her life would view me as some form of social predator. 

My partner lives in London, and I was living in DC when we met. We quickly formed a bond, and further developed into a deep romance. I love it, and I love her. After some time, she asked me to move to London to be with her. This wasn't something I had to take much time to think about, and before she could finish asking, I had already said yes. In turn, I quit my career (something I'd worked 20 years to build in the engineering and space industry), folded my company, sold all of my belongings/properties and moved to London. This is where I thought things would get 'better'. Unfortunately, I hadn't quite considered that her friends and family might be an obstacle. 

My partner's previous relationship ended rather badly and publicly, with her previous partner literally running off with a celebrity. I've never had to handle a situation like that and I'm filled with compassion and empathy for her situation. But this is where the issue arises. Her family and friends are constantly comparing me to her ex; who it seems was of an abusive and parasitic nature.

I have my own everything. I don't need or want anything from her in terms of material wealth or purpose in life. I'm happy with the person I am. If I can't be value added in a situation, it's usually not a situation I find myself in. The point is, I'm nothing at all like her ex, and have no designs on seeking anything from her other than love and time for which I'd hope we would live a beautiful life together. 

The more people I meet in her life, the more I get slapped around the proverbial face with comments of the ex and my being or not being anything like her. It's deeply hurtful and rather frustrating. In the beginning, I was patient and understanding, but now (after some time) it's quite simply, mean. I'm the butt of jokes, humiliated and compared to someone who only seemed to take from others - all while literally giving up everything to be with the person I love, and asking for nothing in return. 

Is there a way that I can deal with this that's not both harmful to our relationship and/or exclusionary regarding any future relationship with her friends and family?

I (20F) am dating a man (21M) that, honesly, i find utterly attractive on so many points. He has the face, the body, the personnality, the maturity and so much more. We've been dating for a good few months now, and kind of made if official not too long ago, even tho he told me it was official for him since the beginning because we always were exclusive. Everything seemed to work well for us, until...my insecurities began to make a mess out of this relationship. I am an hypersensitive women and he's quite an emotionless man, even tho he has a great emotional intelligence.

At first it was nothing too bad, i just found him out of my league but kept it to myself. But, since he's not a very vocally expressive man, it was hard to feel attractive to him (no compliments, ever)...even tho i tried communicating that to him, explaining how important words of affirmations were for me. Time passed by and we both had weeks we couldn't see each other that much because we both have a busy life (him more than me, tho) and would still try our best...but he hates texting and calling so when we were not seeing each other, we did'nt really have any flirty contact online or anything to be honest and THAT flared up my abadon trauma. I felt like he would leave me soon and so i did the most pathetic and intuitive thing i coud think about : i told him i would prefer us to stop seeing each other. I was in the toxic mindset of : leave before he leaves. From there, i saw how affected he was and it broke my heart, i didn't really think that he was that attached to me since he would only show it through phyical contact or intmacy, which was not enough for me. We kinda made up after that but it felt really weird.

Our second big argument was about a value we don't share : i don't believe in friendship between a male and a female, he does. So when i saw the ammout of girls he would follow on instagram (that he knew personnaly, or not) and what they would post (half naked picture i felt like it was so dissrespectful towards me and told him how important it was for me for him not to do that. I didn't gave him the order to unfollow them but rather explained how affected i was (at that point i was legit having nightmares of him cheating with one of these girls, regularly...one of my ex cheated and it stills haunts me). He didn't undertand at first and didn't do anything about it and my peace of mind was kind of on the line so honestly at that point i wanted to leave the relationship. So that's what i did, for the second time in a short period of time. It still affected him greatly and, once again, we talked it out. I felt bad for staying, because i felt like i was putting him hrough an ultimatum even tho it wasn't my intention at all. I just wanted to feel respected and for the nightmares to go away. I felt terrible at that point. But we still went on with our couple journey and life continued.

During that time period we had a couple of small incidences or fights if you prefer, always about small stuff, nothing important or major but it was getting heavy for us to bear. I would often go silent because i was uncomfy and didnt know what to say. He hates when i'm in my corner in silence because it clashes a lot with my personnality. Also, at that point, i told him i would like him to take more intiative. I love being surprised, not knowing where we are going to eat etc. And it always was me who invited him (often paid as well), i surprised him with a massage, flowers, chocolate...a lot of romantic stuff that he never reciprocate. I didnt do it for him to give me anything back, but i would like him to do similar stuff.

The third and last big fight was a couple of days ago. I felt like he was becoming distant and that it was a bad idea to enter this relationship so early on after the last one (a week after, and last one was relatively long AND abusive) and i just starting wondering why he was with me and my insecurities flared up. We talked a little bit and honestly i was so disappointed about the way he would answer but i could sense he was getting so tired of our small arguments and was ready gettinf off of the relationship, he was even the one asking me ''so, do you want to break up or what?''...i said yes, because i felt like that's what he wanted and overall the best for both of us. He cried. A lot. I did...a little bit, i was too shocked to react proprely. The night passed and we saw each other the day after, ''for a last time'' we said. We still wanted to be together. We still loved each other. But it' so different now. He is cold, distant and seemely scared of being with me because i already left him 3 times. I know i'm toxic for that behavior, but it's my intuitive response to fight or flight. He told me my behavior was childish and hurt him a lot.

After talking, we came to the conclusion i needed to work on my self-esteem, we needed to be more ''fair'' during our arguments (aka him and I vs the problem, not him vs i), he would try making time for us to call when we can't see each other and i would stop breaking up after every big fight out of fear.

Honestly, i love him a lot and i want it to work. We are super compatible when we dont fight.

My question is : how do we make it work? We discussed about our problems, we know the root of them, we kind of have a good amount of plausible solutions and we both want to stay in this relationship, even tho rationally we both believe it might not be the best decision to make.

I haven’t heard from him since we made the date plans and now it’s 2:30pm day of and he hasn’t texted me about it today.

I don’t really have a problem being the one to confirm the date but, if it’s obvious he’s not that into it then I don’t want to waste my time by going. But it could always end up being a fun time and break from the stressful work week.

I started dating when I was ready which was just 3 years ago. I didn’t just go into dating world with nothing and playing around. I didn’t play men’s heart because I know when I started date, I waited for 25 years of my life. Because I knew that I was never ready until I was finally feeling ready at 25.

I had some issues with my inner child and family but who doesn’t??? I did my healing and still healing, because who doesn’t??? I went to therapy. I journal. I basically did things to heal and still do it just like many of us.

Now, I’m not perfect but I know I’m not bad. Ain’t I??? I’m basically an average woman who has many good qualities but also bad sides just like others.

I still date and look for relationship even after my last breakup a few months ago. I did not hide and I did not stop trying. I did not give up but I still cannot find the one or be found by the one and move forward in life with marriage and all.

Our group is made up of three people, me (23F) and two other guys. One of them is out of the picture cuz he's frequently sick. So it's been up to me and the other guy, Matt (26M) who's repeating the year, to do everything. 

For our current project, Matt never saw something like it before and we were both clueless. But as I keep looking and searching on my laptop, he sits there and watches with me, occasionally getting bored and going through his fb feed. Idk how to explain, it feels like I'm doing all the brain work of figuring out what to ACTUALLY write while he's only skilled at giving out generic info that seems solid but is actually very vague and you wouldn't know how to apply it in writing. 

For example, I do a calculation, he asks me ""are you sure of this value; Seems too big"" and I'm like, you were sitting right next to me when I caculated it, what the hell! I then ask him to verify it by doing his own calculations and he never does it. 

Anyway, when we met two weeks ago, I got so frustrated with his attitude that I told him let's split tasks. We discussed what we will be doing and I found a good procedure in a book that we can follow. We agreed that I do the design for mini reactor 1 and he does the design for mini reactor 2. (They're completely independent.) I breathed a sigh of relief for the first time and never checked whether I got any messages from him again. 

When we met in class this monday, while I've done the whole thing and printed my progress, he didn't even make it past step 1 as he said that he didn't know how to calculate the temperature difference. He said this is my fault as he tried to reach out to me and had I answered and explained to him, he would have made progress. He blamed me for not picking up his calls and not answering his messages. I told him I wasn't obligated to explain anything to him, that he could have asked the professor or looked it up online or whatever. We kept arguing back and forth the whole time and it was just exhausting. 

I've been ignoring his calls/messages to meet up the last couple of days as I don't know how to face him anymore. It feels like a ball of fire is stuck in the pit of my stomach and I'm so angry at him. I'm not sure what even is the problem between us. He's clearly not lazy.

My bf (24M) and i (20F) are quite new, about a few months in and we're happy. 

However one time I was over at his place, I snooped on his browser history. I'm not proud of it definitely and I really wish I didn't. I admitted it to him and I recognize its wrong and I will definitely not do that again either because of what I found out. Like that thing they say, you fuck around, you find out. Well I wasn't ready for what I found out. 

I saw his browser history for the past two weeks and saw that there's this girl he stalks on social media everyday. I confronted him about it and he cleanly admitted that he does it. I appreciate that he didn't gaslight or deny it in anyway too so I think that's definitely a plus. 

But going back, he said he does it cuz this girl is somebody who he's liked for a long time (even before he met me) who he's shoot his shot to her a couple of times but kept getting rejected. The girl is a good/close friend of his and they tried one date but he said that's it. Like close friend since high school kind of thing. And he said that the stalking was more of leftover curiosity now to see if the girl would somehow show regret for rejecting him. He said it was more of a spite thing. He has still reassured me that he loves me. 

Ofc, it didn't sit well with me at first but during that time, what matters to me was it wasn't love or anything similar to what we have. Fast forward to now, I'm still uncomfortable about it and brought up about unfriending/unfollowing her. 

He said he didn't want to because it has something to do with his past because his ex used to make him block girls online, even very close friends. So he promised to himself (even before he met me) that he'll never cut ties with friends again that easily. 

It definitely hurt because that entails he can't do anything about the whole uncomfortable feeling that I have but I do understand and respect this promise he made to himself. I personally never thought, nor do i like, being that person that makes my partner cut ties with friends. It leaves a bad taste to my mouth. 

So after all that, I agreed to let him still follow the girl on social media and come to a conclusion that this is something that I have to work on on my own. He doesn't fall short also dont get me wrong. The guy is amazing, reassures me I'm the only one, follows through on other things, it's just this one aspect. I also know they don't really message each other anyway but only keeps each other on close friends and private social media accounts (or atleast her in her private socmed, but bf doesn't have a private acc). 

I'm think that maybe this is my insecurities manifesting so I'm really really trying hard to work on it. I guess in a way that's why I'm posting it here also, to validate that I hope I made the right decision. I really do love my bf, I really want to make it work so let me know if im doing it right.

There are many things I love about him, but I'm having a very hard time coping with his slowness, his lack of concentration and his avoidant tendencies.

I'm an anxious person, and I'll admit that at first I might have emotionally overwhelmed him with my attachment style because I wanted to know him better than what his secretive nature allowed him to show.
But this has changed tremendously over the course of time.

On the other hand, I sense that he has done no real work to better suit my needs as his partner. And he doesn't acknowledge the hurtful things he's done to me, intentionally or not.

I'm tired of constantly fighting to better our relationship on my own (looking articles up, learning about attachment styles, possible neurodivergency, eventually suggested that we see a therapist together but he declined).

I love him very much but the way he dismisses my feelings and always shifts the blame on my anxiety disgust me.
Not to mention the things I have found out about him through my own investigation.

I'm having so many intrusive thoughts.

So, we both left most of our friends for the move. In the past two years I’ve made maybe three or four local friends which, combined with my family and long distance friends, works great to fill my social needs. 

My partner however has not made any local friends. She has hung out two or three times total with people she got along with from her workplace, when I encouraged it, but none of those turned into friendships. She also has a couple of close online friends, but that’s it. She recently started working from home and, since she doesn’t drive, is really only around other people when my friends or family are around. 

That would be fine if she needed less social support, I guess, but she obviously really really wants to make friends but only with my friends. I do NOT want to have our friend circles be the same circle, because I think it’s important that we both have social support outside of our relationship. So now it’s something that causes just a bit of tension for us. She has some mental issues that make it harder for her to pick up on social queues, so I don’t think it’s always intentional but even after we’ve discussed my boundaries around having a few separate friends she still invites herself to hang out one on one with my friends or family, and will claim that they are her friends too and she doesn’t need to make friends. Again this would be fine if she didn’t need more social support, but every time I go for a game night or a hike without her she expresses her disappointment at not being able to go and says she wants to hang out with xyz friend or group that I’m hanging out with.

well he admitted to watching it and that he never really stopped watching it and had just been telling me he stopped because i didn’t like it. 
i feel betrayed, so many conversations we have had since June have been lies, he’s been lying right to my face, he knew it was wrong and told me he felt guilty about it but didn’t stop doing it. i would also like to add to it that since i have been pregnant i have felt less affection from his side, he doesn’t cuddle or kiss me as often and doesn’t try to have sex with me, i have told him this also and he told me not to worry and that i’m beautiful inside and out and that he will do better then changes the topic and nothing changes.

I spent the night with her the day I asked her out and thought everything was going well but the last few days she’s been leaving me more on delivered and we’ve been talking less. I don’t know if I should double text her saying I want to see her because I do miss her but at the same time I don’t want to come across as needy so I really don’t know what to do. I can see her on snapchat most the time so she’s ignoring me on purpose but I’m confused as to why not just reject me in the first place and why invite around ?,True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7622279,public,self,Idk if I should double text her or give her time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2q8xy/idk_if_i_should_double_text_her_or_give_her_time/,all_ads,6,,,

We’ve lived together almost our entire relationship. Yesterday, I came home from watching my niece. Well he had to look something up on google and I saw the page open for a girls OF. I have really bad body image issues and have told him that. I view paying a cam person not as cheating but as disrespectful when you’re in a relationship and I have told him that. We have a pretty good sex life and I don’t care if he gets off when I’m not home but I wish he wouldn’t pay for it. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it, I’m honestly just in a spiral. I’m not mad at him for it, it just makes me feel like crap. I’ve been cheated on in the past and I don’t think he would do that but I’m just in my head about it. The girl looked nothing near my body type (I’m a little thicker) she was skinny with big… assets. I don’t know what to think or do.
