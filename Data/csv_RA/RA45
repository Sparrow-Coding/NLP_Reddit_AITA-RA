I (24f) have been texting this guy (22m) I met on Tinder for a couple weeks. We go to the same school, and I‚Äôve seen him in passing but never spoke. Our convos have been pretty standard, he is flirty but says some sweet things at the same time. I‚Äôve gathered he‚Äôs a pretty busy dude with his job(s) and schooling from the way he texts. I wasn‚Äôt able to text him for a couple days due to being out of town, but texted him when I got back yesterday. He almost instantly asked me to hangout, after being particularly flirty (I had sent him a pic of my cat in my chest and he joked that he wished he was him). I told him I was free this weekend, to which he said he had to work but could hangout after, around 8-9, and offered his place but said he lived in a dorm. I then offered mine as an alternative. I know this screams hookup, which I‚Äôm fine with, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll just be a one time thing?

I met my husband 14 years ago and we have been married for 7. We were on and off before we got married, and when we were ""off,"" I had a short relationship with someone and had my son, who is now 11. My husband is a great man, husband, stepfather, provider, and a hard worker. Ever since the first time we slept together, the sex was underwhelming. He finishes in 2 minutes and has never enjoyed pleasing me in other ways. Years ago, I communicated to him that I was bothered by it, and he started trying to please me in other ways. But, it feels artificial... like I'm forcing him to do things he doesn't want to do. I ignored the bad sex for years, telling myself it wasn't important to me because I loved so many other things about him. I just recently started therapy, started working on myself, and started taking responsibility for my own happiness. Long story short, as it turns out sex does matter to me. Because of the years of bad sex, I'm not sexually attracted to my husband anymore. Our marriage is otherwise good. We have fun together. He is my best friend and biggest supporter. I can't tell him that I'm not sexually attracted to him. It will break him. I can't tell him I'm not pleasured by sleeping with him or that I've been faking orgasms for years. We have talked about sex a lot over the years, so telling him how I feel now will change nothing. I don't know what to do. I hope a wise mind out there somewhere can give me some advice.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in some serious need of some very serious advice. I‚Äôve been crying about this pretty much all day so while I‚Äôm requesting constructive advice, I‚Äôm begging you to please go easy on me. Basically, I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 2.5 years now. He‚Äôs not necessarily my ‚Äútype‚Äù, but when we met I was struck by how kind, charming, and positive he seemed and we began dating. We moved in together very early on, partly because we were swept up in the newness of our relationship, and partly because he knew my home life wasn‚Äôt the best. 

Our relationship started off so passionately, and we were always off on dates and intimate and having sex very frequently. I know this is usually how the beginnings of relationships are, so I wasn‚Äôt worried when about 1-1.5 years in, our sex life started depleting. It went from every day, to a couple times a week, to every few weeks, to every other month, etc. over the course of the 1.5-2 year mark. And it‚Äôs all my fault that we aren‚Äôt having it, I‚Äôm just not in the mood to do it with him. Now I can‚Äôt even remember the last time we had sex, I think maybe it was towards the end of April? He started making out with me a couple weeks ago and I went along with it, but didn‚Äôt feel that lustful feeling I used to feel at all, I kind of felt nothing. We hug I guess kind of frequently and sometimes cuddle while sleeping but that‚Äôs pretty much the extent of our intimacy. No hand holding or spontaneous kisses or even declarations of love or anything like that on both sides. I feel awful about it.

I talked to him about how it felt like we were becoming more like friends about 2 months ago, and he took it really well and promised that he would work on it; I had kind of left it as, I don‚Äôt know for sure these things will make it better but I want to try. So far, nothing has really changed and I still just don‚Äôt feel the same as I used to. I cant tell if it‚Äôs just the normal ebb and flow of romance in a relationship coming out of the honeymoon stage, or if there seriously are just only platonic feelings left.

Enter a coworker to make this horrible, heartbreaking situation even worse. When I started my job about 5 months ago, I automatically knew this coworker was my ‚Äútype‚Äù, so I avoided him like the plague. Only recently he‚Äôs been coming and talking to me more here and there, but nothing crazy deep or personal or anything like that. Of course, these short interactions have been causing me to develop a crush on him that I‚Äôve been trying my hardest to shut out because I really don‚Äôt need that complication right now, and it makes me feel even more guilty about this situation. And then tonight, guess who texts me randomly and asks me on a date this weekend? You guessed it, my coworker! So I very softly rejected him and am completely dreading going into work tomorrow, and I‚Äôm overthinking how to make things as least awkward as I possibly can! And the worst part is that there‚Äôs a part of me that wishes I could have said yes. There‚Äôs a part of me that gets butterflies thinking about what it would be like because I‚Äôm attracted to him, and it just really sucks. It‚Äôs just not fair to anyone.

I love my boyfriend, I‚Äôm just not sure that I‚Äôm IN love with him anymore, and that‚Äôs really fucking scary to me. I don‚Äôt know if I could do life without him, he‚Äôs my best friend and we do everything together; I don‚Äôt think he would want/be able to be friends if we broke up, and I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to. I‚Äôm just really stuck right now and I don‚Äôt have a therapy appointment until 2 weeks from now so I‚Äôm turning to you guys to shed any sort of light or perspective on this that I could be missing. Is this a grass is always greener situation? I‚Äôm tormented by the thought that I would regret it if I ended things. I had a really bad relationship before him, and he single handedly helped me learn how to trust again, and now I feel like having these thoughts about my coworker is just the biggest slap in the face to him.

For a while now, any time I bring up something that he does that makes me unhappy, he Apologizes, says he'll do better, then immediately goes back to his behaviors when I forgive him. He is unemployed, which I have no problem with at all I don't mind paying for him and paying for rent, but all he does from the moment he wakes up til the moment he goes to sleep is play on his computer. He never responds to any of my texts, but I know he is online to see them because he talks to his friend literally all day. When I try to spend time with him, he says he will but forgets and ends up playing with friends instead. Even when we're together, he's distracted and barely acknowledges me, I basically have to beg him to pay any attention to me. I know he feels bad about being unemployed and I reassure him its okay, but he asks what he can do to help so I'll ask him to cook and clean (if he doesn't want to I tell him its okay, that I can do it myself, but he usually says he wants to) but when it comes time to do chores or to cook, he takes 5√ó the amount of time to complete it because he is on his phone the entire time playing games or texting his friend. I've told him that this really bothers me because I have a schedule I need to follow, and that if he doesn't want to do something that I can do it, and he'll apologize and say he'll do better but he never does. I feel really bad having to bring up old issues with him because it makes him really sad when I'm upset with him but I feel like I'm completely shut out of his life and like he doesn't even care to put a little bit of effort in. Its been like this for so long, and I love him so much, he really is a good sweet person when he wants to be but I just feel like I'm a stranger to him, and I hate having to micromanage everything he does because he won't start or do something or finish something unless I tell him. He won't give me affection anymore unless I tell him. I could be crying and he would straight up ignore me. I just wish he put effort in like he used to, I know he can be such an amazing boyfriend when he tries but he just doesn't anymore. I feel like this is the end for us, but I don't have any family or friends, and if we break up he'll have to move out back in with his abusive family. I don't know what to do.

I broke up with him almost 2 years ago because of some personal issues and demons I was dealing with and unfortunately just wasn‚Äôt being my best self. The breakup was lengthy and emotions ran high on both ends. Thankfully my family who assists us with childcare helped with the custody trade offs so that we didn‚Äôt see much of one another for about the first year that we were split. 

We have slowly began to work together, communicate, and rebuild our friendship. He is a man of action but VERY few words, so the fact that we‚Äôve been able to have talks is huge. He knows I am deeply remorseful of the way things ended, and has acknowledged that he wasn‚Äôt always the best partner either. We are both mentally a lot better and have talked through the worst of the bitterness. 

Recently I touched on maybe getting back together in the future. He said maybe one day but not anytime soon as he is still processing his hurt. 
I understand and respect his side but the more and more we see one another I don‚Äôt feel like his actions and words match up. For example: 

-When he drops off or picks up our son he will sit around on my porch and just chat with me about life, nothing to do with the kids. 
-He always hugs me when we part ways. I‚Äôm talking a 30 second long embrace as opposed to a quick one-arm platonic goodbye. 
-We trick or treated with our kiddo on Halloween and he held my hang the whole time. 
-He let my Facebook request sit for a year but recently accepted and posts a good bit of love songs, some of which he‚Äôs played for me before. 

I want to say again that he is a calculated person, not the type to speak or act without putting thought into it. Even though I regret breaking up I‚Äôm doing my best to ignore my feelings but it‚Äôs getting hard because he is being affectionate with me. 

Should I ignore what he‚Äôs doing because of what he‚Äôs already said? Or say something about how he‚Äôs acted lately?

After spending the day at a party, I(23F) called my boyfriend and asked to stay over at his place. When exposed to social situations, I‚Äôm quite the butterfly but I do appreciate downtime, especially with my favourite person. I left my friends as I was exhausted and basically drove across the county at 10pm. When I get there, we briefly catch up after which he excuses himself to tidy up the bedroom.

I found myself asleep on the couch two hours later. I rarely wake up before my time but something didn‚Äôt feel right. I hear him on a phone call arguing with somebody at 2am. They had been on the call for hours. I wait another 30 min as I try to sleep but I‚Äôm tossing and turning. Eventually, I had enough and left. It‚Äôs worth noting that I do not like unnecessary conflict. I went back to the car with intentions to leave but it was too late and quite a far distance.

He‚Äôs pleaded with me to get back to the house but my spirit is not in it. I can‚Äôt force myself to get over something. I‚Äôm waiting for another hour for it to be safe enough to go home. Finally, he told me that he respects my decision but left the door open for me. I feel conflicted. I don‚Äôt want to go back. I‚Äôm emotionally drained from the party and not being in a safe space will only push me further. I‚Äôm cold and tired but my spirit is calm. There‚Äôs not much I can do now but I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how to approach this issue. He has apologised profusely but didn‚Äôt explain the call. I didn‚Äôt ask either. I am probably too emotionally riled up to make the decision on approach. What do you think?

I'm a really successful entrepreneur, bringing in 6 figures and I've been dating this woman for 9 months and I've noticed she's completely broke, she makes a maximum of 1000$ a month and rarely has more than 100$ in her bank account.

It's just been a huge financial burden, we go to places to eat or hang out and its like I'm babysitting, she can't pay her half I have to cover everything and it just goes against everything I have been taught.  

I feel like logically this is also bad for my financial future, as the max she will ever bring is $3000 a month so I'll be forced to carry most the financial burden in the future too. If I was with someone even 60% my level by retirement there will be millions of $ that we could have saved.

I know I could probably teach her to make more money, but I'm trying to launch new businesses , I just manage to squeeze enough time for dates, I cant mentor someone.

My ex left me 3 years ago because I was earning less than her at the time and she worried about our financial future, it sort of made me realise that women date smarter than us and I should take this into account in thr future. 

 I do really love this girlfriend, shes talking of marriage and I'm thinking in my head if I marry you my kids will have a worse future and I'll have a much poorer retirement.

Also shes pretty short, over a foot smaller than me, I'm worried our kids may be short as a result as genetics plays a factor. It just feels unfair on them, especially if we have a boy as girls will look down on him for being under 6 foot.

I feel like my exs and experience with women have fried my brain, a few years ago I wouldn't be thinking about how much a girl makes or how tall she is, I would just care about love. But I feel like my standards were too low. 

I really like this girl and I feel like I'm going to lose her over some silly stuff but it keeps bugging me man, i dont wanna think like this but its like I cant help it, I feel like an idiot if I don't, like my standards are too low

This girl has taught me how to be happy 
Just breathing around her, makes me happy

Recently we had a lot of fights, since the past couple of months we have constant fights where i think i don't get attention from her.

Our relationship was private, and most no one knows of it.

A couple of my friends do but that's it.

Initially we decided we won't tell people but later I told my good friends.

She hasn't told anyone ever, and says her friends tease and poke her over all this, and if she will tell them they would make fun of her

Now the thing is we are in different classes and she has strict parents we get little time together other than that we are confined to texts.

I do not like on particular friend of hers mostly because initially he used to tease her, my name calling (very prevalent in my country, couples are teased) 

It escalated to some big fights

This week we had a major one and next day she said she wants a break, i said i want to date you, but she said she just needs time to think, a weeks time to be precise, this resulted in us fighting again and again over the past three days, over something or the other, 

Once it was the fact that this boy i don't like is always too close to her, and is interrupting conversations it got ugly

Today she was really irritated and was talking to me roughly i kept trying to sooth things, blind sided by the fact that she needs space, i tried to talk, organise outings anything that would make everything fine, when nothing worked and she was still irritated we again fought, i told her that she is being rude and it hurts a lot, we kept going at it back and forth and in my anger i called her a bad person


All i think of is her, i am really in love, i can't think of anything else

Is there any way to make this break not end in a break-up

PS: i do seem like an asshole but this is very abridged please don't attack me, a lot of details aren't here and this is just the necessary bits to explain my issue.

Edit: after this fight i did say, that i don't want more fights, take space and time and i will respect this, but because of how stuck she is in my head, i keep trying to talk more and more, and then things complicate.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7576959,public,self,"my 20m relationship is on a break right now, and everything is uncertain what to do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yy7yxj/my_20m_relationship_is_on_a_break_right_now_and/,all_ads,6,,

I feel like I know the answer, but at the same time, if I'm having to ask, maybe I'm not there yet. I (27F) am married to my high school sweetheart (30M). We've been together for 10 years. There have always been certain qualities I didn't necessarily love about him, but I have always looked past that because I was in love. Now, after all this time, I'm realizing maybe he's not exactly what I want or need anymore. And as you can imagine, I‚Äôm different than who I was when we met. Him, not so much. To start, I feel like he's sort of a man child. He doesn't play video games all day, and isn't a sloppy mess, but he's a little bit of a mama's boy, can't take constructive criticism, and struggles with simple things like making his own doctors appts. Sure, maybe that's something a lot of men will pass off as a women's duty, but I prefer more of a... man. And as I'm growing older, I'm realizing he's missing some qualities I find attractive, and he spends a lot of time talking about what he wants for his future but makes no move towards it. 

He's not very driven. He's overweight and will only workout for about a week before he gives up. For reference, I work out every day. He also talks to nobody but me about his life issues. Which makes me feel like he just 'dumps' all his anger and frustration out on me, and it's draining. He has friends, family but won‚Äôt talk to them and refuses to see a therapist. There's always something new every day that's negative within his life - he doesn't process stress well. I'm not perfect either. I don't love his family and that's been a recurring issue in our relationship... I wanted to push it to the side because I loved him, but I'm realizing I don't think I can spend my entire life having to be around them too. His mother is just as emotionally draining as he is. Not to mention, we've spent our anniversaries fighting, holidays fighting, etc. There's a lot of reasoning behind me wanting to walk away, and hard to keep it concise and detailed. 

Don't get me wrong, this man is still my best friend and I love him with all my heart which makes it so hard to just walk away and why I'm willing to try. I just don't know if I'm in love with him anymore, I do feel like I've fallen out of love and I'm not sure how to get back to where we once were or if I even can. This isn't some volatile relationship where we hate each other. But - Should I stay with him for comfort just because he's a nice guy who loves me and we're best friends?

It also doesn't help that I've gone through some sort of awakening recently. I feel like I've become a changed woman these last few months - maybe it's because I'm growing older and tired of just being 'content'. I want more in life, I want to see/do more things. And I feel like he's holding me back. I do truly believe us 2 together have taken each other as far as we can, and it may be time to let go and move forward. We've become stagnant the last couple of years, (after getting married basically) and as the saying goes - familiarity breeds contempt. And I never wanted to get bored of the man I love but that's where I am today. Bored. Unfulfilled. Wanting more. I know when you get married you‚Äôre supposed to work through it all together and I‚Äôm not trying to give up. I just think I realized too late that we aren‚Äôt the best match anymore. 

Unfortunately, within the last year I've realized (since I've spent my entire life with him since 16), I've done very little on my own and haven't experienced much. It made me sort of panic. I feel we're slightly codependent with each other. He doesn't even like when I go out for a girls night... I just feel suffocated. I'm also just ready to spread my wings. On my own. For whatever reason it may be, maybe because I held back from taking chances during my teenage years. And didn't have the option to take chances in my early 20's. Because I've spent most of those loving a man I thought would be by my side forever.

I should also note, I went through the honeymoon phase all over again right before our 10 year anniversary. I mean, I became obsessed with him just like the beginning. But it seems when that came to an end, everything hit me. And I'm very aware the honeymoon phase doesn't last forever and marriage isn't easy and it's never going to be perfect. But this feels like much more than that. 

Our sex life has gone tremendously downhill the last few years. Of course, being in a relationship for this long, things are bound to get boring after a while, but he doesn't even seem to want to spice things up or add much excitement. I'm always the one trying to make plans for trips or a concert for a date night. He's always complaining about the money being spent for any occasion, which hinders what we can do and experience. I just feel like I'm missing out. I also know this man loves me with his whole heart so I feel like I'm having to choose between my happiness and the fact that we only live once, and having this love that was supposed to last forever.

This isn't a grass may be greener type of situation, I know it won't be all gold and glory if I choose to walk away. But it excites me, what my future may look like if I move ahead along. Also, we have had multiple talks about the circumstances of our relationship right now. He knows how I'm feeling as far as thinking this may be the end of the road for us. It's sad to say, but when I think about the future now, I don't really see him in it. 

Disclaimer: I do not want this come off as selfish at all. Like I said, I feel like getting older has changed me obviously &amp; has made me realize we only have one life to live and I feel like I've wasted a good amount already.

&amp;#x200B;

Married 13 years ago. I had more wealth than her. Three months prior to wedding (outta the blue), \*she\* asks for a prenup. Wasn't even on my radar. When I asked why, her reply was that it was to show she was in this for love, and not my money. Essentially it was the standard ""What is mine stays mine, what is hers stays hers (house, retirement, etc). Prenup was drawn up and signed by both of us. She had a great FT job (dealing with lots of legal stuff) with benefits, and jointly owned her own house with her sister. She is college educated with several degrees. She moved into my house and continued to pay 1/2 the mortgage on her own home. 

She then had a medical event which forced her to have to quit her job and rehabilitate. Her sister then decided that the house was underwater and was going to walk away- foreclosure. My wife decided that she might as well just go along with the idea of giving the house back to the bank. Our finances were OK. A few months later, my wife was able to go back to work, but she didn't want a stressful job, so she just worked retail for minimum wage.

Here we are now- and divorce papers have been served. She states that she now wants 1/2 of everything (my house, retirement, etc) and spousal support because things have drastically changed since she first signed (again- it was HER idea). She is more than capable of working full time at a job with benefits- she just doesn't want to. She has one daughter living with us from a prior relationship- the dad pays child support. She has never been a ""stay at home mom"".

She even threatened to end our relationship at some point. Anyways, he admitted that he liked her for a while because he thought she was pretty. It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal, but later on, after all of this happened, I sent him a picture of a girl I saw on Tiktok and said it looked like the girl who caused problems with us. He scoffed and said I am terrible at telling whether girls are pretty or not. He then asked me how pretty I think his friends crush is (we‚Äôll call her Jen). I replied with ‚Äúuhm I don‚Äôt know.. maybe a 5?‚Äù Because I genuinely didn‚Äôt know. He laughed and said she‚Äôs a 10. This really hurt me but later he apologized for it. We were over it until today I was looking through his photos and saw a picture of her. She was sitting in front of him and you could clearly see her butt shape through the seat.

I love this man so much, but since he quit his job I have been having serious questions about our compatibility. 

So in June, he decided he was unsatisfied with his job (he‚Äôs a software engineer). The company we worked required us all to come back into the office 3 days a week, and on top of that he didn‚Äôt feel challenged by the work and felt he should be paid more (I definitely felt he was underpaid). I think he was also tired of not working for a real tech company cause our company is pretty conservative. 

Since he was a few years out of school and hadn‚Äôt practiced some of the concepts that would be tested in technical interviews, he decided to quit in July. The whole time I begged him not to because I had been hearing that the hiring market was going to change.

He worked at studying, but he also had his fair share of fun and messed around playing video games like a lot. Finally in September, I started getting on his case asking him when he was going to start applying. He applied just as major tech companies announced enterprise hiring freezes.

In the past two months it has been so stressful. Obviously, it‚Äôs been hard for him. He just doesn‚Äôt show negative emotion often. But it has also been agonizing for me. I don‚Äôt mean to make this about me. It‚Äôs primarily about him, and I know he feels terribly. But I am constantly resentful that I‚Äôve had to basically mother him, I‚Äôm stressed because he has no income and needs to pay his part of our rent, and I‚Äôm frustrated that he doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Mostly, I‚Äôve realized that I want stability, and I‚Äôm upset that he doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same level of ambition as me. I‚Äôm also upset that he didn‚Äôt have a plan, and it‚Äôs embarrassing for me to constantly tell my best friends that he still doesn‚Äôt have a job because HE CREATED THIS ISSUE. 

And finally, when I‚Äôve tried to talk to him about it, he like doesn‚Äôt even admit that I was right when I told him that tech companies were going to stop hiring. He won‚Äôt admit any fault and doesn‚Äôt seem to even want to talk about his unemployment at all. It feels like he has no motivation to even try harder to find a job.

Most recently, he got to the final round of an interview and they denied him. This was the ONE company that showed an interest in him in the past 2 months. On the same day, I was told I got a promotion and a raise. The contrast was just too much. I feel so upset because if only we had the same ideas about work and ambitions, our relationship would be almost everything I ever dreamed of. I am not sure if we can work through this.

I would find myself muted and I still don't understand why.

I could tell he was like maybe a drink in bc he would compliment me, he started following me on my media's.


He was telling me how he's always wanted to be with me, and that we always had this bond. I didn't say really much cuz it just felt off. He messaged me all day Sunday, and when Monday came i was on tiktok and saw that he had unfollowed me and he removed me from his followers, he also did it on Instagram as well. (I assumed he got back with her) i made a paragraph saying how I was pretty much done with him treating me like that and I gave him and ear full. He said ""I was at work sorry"". 

Like he had time to just do all that? Then he said that he wanted to stay single and that he was afraid I'd want more than friendship, but if i didnt then we could be friends. I don't know where he came up with that, bc I would ignore his flirty messages, I told him I just wanted to be his friend to begin with, but he never followed me back and now I'm not hearing anything from him.

I (36 F) just found out the reason my sister (34 F) has been minimal contact with me for the last few years is because of things she is mad about with her wedding a few years back. To preference she's my younger sister and always seems to have been the favorite; I moved from our rural area to a major city rather stay in Farmville because I like modernity and sister stayed taking on our dad's farm and our mom, who is not exactly a stable person always was loving her for being the baby but were both LC with her. Anyway I recently found out through relatives that's she's been pissed about events that happened at her wedding and its one of the reasons we haven't been in contact for a few years

Anyway when my sis was getting married, I was already disappointed and irritated because even though I'm her sister she didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid. She said it wasn't practical because I live out of state but I think that was bullshit. I think she just didn't want to include me.

Next few things that happened were when they planning at the beginning of the year and I found out they were going a medieval theme I really wanted to wear a flower crown that I could order from a florist I know but sister wouldn't let me because that was the head piece she was wearing. I think she was afraid that her's wouldn't look as nice because they got married on the cheap; she literally foraged the flowers a day before and made the crown and bouquets. She offered to have her stylist that dose hair braiding to do something for me but it was clear she just didn't want to include me as she hadn't involved me in the wedding in any way.

I had a tentative date for the wedding but when I got my invite it was the week after the one I had been previously told because of a conflict date with venue, or at least that's what she said, but the problem was it was the same day as an event I had and had already paid to be in. I had a compromise in mind, if she could move the ceremony back an hour I would have enough time to do my event that I had already paid for and be able to fly in for the wedding. She wouldn't and said I could come to the wedding or not. I did go the wedding but was $200, the day itself seemed fine and afterward I took a bottle of the mead they had served at the reception to take home but I couldn't take it on the plane and had to leave it. I knew sister was mad about this, told me that in her spiritual practices (Nordic paganism) that the mead that was left was to stay with the couple that they would drink together over a certain time period, apparently that's where the term 'honeymoon' comes from but it all seems hokey to me and just another excuse. Apparently all this is why she went no contact, but I did offer compromises and lost out on money and events to be there.

Well today she invited me to get groceries together (we remained friends). Afterwards, we talked about the relationship a bit, just about some things I did wrong &amp; about how I took the relationship for granted as it was my first relationship. I apologized again and she forgave me.

He'll usually let me know he's going and say he's going with (O, D, B, or Z) all different male friends of his, that I know very well, and are at our house pretty regularly. Well almost every day he comes home, and tells me that oh well, some other coworkers showed up too, some of the girls were there too. Even one night I called him at 1am when I woke up and he wasn't home, and he let me know ONLY THEN, that he was at a house party with coworkers. That there were hard drugs there, and girls I don't know, he promised he was coming home soon. He didn't even bother to tell me, or ask if I wanted a break from the dogs after I just got off of a 13 hour shift. Trying to sleep for my next 12 hour one the next day. It finally came to a head tonight when he came home drunk again after ""Just getting Pizza and a beer with O, cause we had a bad shift"" only for him to drunkly admit other people were there too. I told him this made me uncomfortable, and I was tired of only finding things out when he got home, or when one of his coworkers joked about the girls getting drunk and handsy with them all. I told him I was tired of him acting like he's single when he's not. He's got mad and said I didn't trust him, so he left the room.

That his coworkers ex's! Have even been invited and shown up, but I'm not? He does plenty of other things with them all as well that aren't a bar, that always somehow land on days that I work. I lost it one night on him and said he only had until next year to use me not being able to get into certain bars because of my age as an excuse, and it still feels true now. He says I'm being controlling and I need to trust him more because it isn't fair of me to feel like this when he hasn't done anything to jeopardize the relationship, but how and I supposed to know?

Deep down I would really like to be in a relationship with a women who makes me swoon. But I just don't feel good enough or in the right space mentally for a relationship. Also social anxiety makes it hard too approach women. I have body image issues and face issues I feel like I look too androgynous and like a teenage boy or a stereotypical fuck boy.

I end up having sex with men and women. Even if it's the opposite of what I truly want.

No strings attached doesn't run into these issues as often. I also think I have some problems with sex as in maybe sex addiction. So if I got a partner what if my urges become too much. Not as much of a problem in casual relationships. I wouldn't want to make my partner feel used.

I don't know if I am actually attracted to men at all or if it is just easier to get with men. I think I'm sometimes hurting myself by doing so because afterwards sometimes I feel empty. Maybe this is because I'm not actually attracted to men. But its confusing cause I don't hate being with men sexually it's just not as enjoyable as with women.

This is probably gonna be a relatively long post, so I apologize for that, but I really need some general advice as I feel like I am making no progress.

I am a very work oriented person. When I know what needs to be done, I will sit down/get up and work on it until it is done, and I will do a good job as well. Whether it be academics, sports, or anything else, as long as I know the **fundamental basics**, I can improve (for example, lifting 5 pound dumbells at the gym until I can lift 10s).

When it comes to dating, I am **literally clueless**. I am around 5'10"", pretty good looking (I've been rated 8/10 by a female acquaintance). I have no problems being friends with women (many of my friends are girls), but as soon as you're out of ""friend"" territory, I'm in completely uncharted water. I don't know how to text in ""suggestive"" ways, how to flirt, how to **show interest** in girls, and just how to build relationships naturally. How do I get from seeing a pretty girl in one of my classes --&gt; getting her number --&gt; talking to her semi-regularly --&gt; asking her on a date?? I only have one semester left in college, a place where I have the largest pool of similarly-aged women that I will ever have, and I am TERRIFIED about my future. I've made like no progress in any of these aspects, as I have had no idea how to go about making said progress, and I am very worried that I will legitimately die alone (If I haven't made progress in 21 years, whats stopping me from repeating it for another 21 years?).

I'm fairly confident most of the ""coaches"" that I see online are just scams and that what I need is a guy-friend who wouldn't mind spending a few days really forcing me out of my comfort zone, however, I unfortunately do not have any guy friends like that. What the hell do I do???

P.S., I am a nervous wreck on the dates I go on (excessive sweating, mind blanking, shaking from literal adrenaline release because my brain equates girls to lions in the wilderness apparently).

TL;DR: 21M guy never dated in the slightest, doesn't know **anything** about approaching women and building relationships with them that are not just friendships. What are some things I can do that are synonymous to picking up 5 pound weights during my first time at the gym such that I can practice building these skills to avoid dying alone?!!",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7576762,public,self,"How do I, (21M), build dating/relationship skills when I have no foundation upon which I can do so?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yy7e0w/how_do_i_21m_build_datingrelationship_skills_when/,all_ads,6,,

Throughout the years I‚Äôve felt an emotional gap. There‚Äôs great communication when it comes to work (I work with him in his business) or gossip but emotionally, none at all. This has been an issue every now and then as I get to a point that I get immensely depressed as he shuts me down. For example, today he was angry I got home late and didn‚Äôt have dinner. I had a chiropractor session today and it was full and spent about 40 minutes with my mom after (she had taken care of my children). While I was on my way home, he called me surprised I was not home. It was about 7pm before I got home bc of traffic. I asked him if he could grab some meat from the garage refrigerator and he refused. Argued it‚Äôs my job to have dinner and left to go get fast food. I texted him that we shouldn‚Äôt have the luxury of eating out when we have plenty of food at home. He came back with food for everyone anyways. After he ate, I made a comment asking if he thought I did nothing all day as he always complains of me. He completely shut me down and told me not to start. His job is to supervise and do on-site estimates. Every once in a while he is on the job the entire day. My job is to keep him organized (make his schedule), answer and make calls, send contracts, etc. Apart from taking care of our 1 year old and taking our daughter to school 20 min away which takes time away from my duties. I tend to get behind on cleaning when it gets busy or I feel overwhelmed or get sick. Or if I get a backache (had an accident within this past month). He complains I don‚Äôt do anything all day, and complains more if he doesn‚Äôt find me home. It‚Äôs hard to even get him to watch our kids while I go to the chiro. I‚Äôm not sure if there is even a solution. I feel he wants the luxury of a wife, but won‚Äôt give me the love/affection one would expect. He refuses to talk about problems, his sexual desires are low (I feel like I‚Äôm to the point of begging), he isn‚Äôt the type to hug you unless it‚Äôs bed time.. No dates allowed. He sleeps halfway through a movie. No surprised like hugs while in the kitchen. Refuses to shower together.. I mean, is this even normal? Is he getting abusive with his expectations? Is this okay to expect for the rest of my life? Am I not good enough for him to respect me? I‚Äôve stuck by his side through so much and helped him grow what he has now.

She did not want a divorce but it had to happen. We were yelling at each other every single day. We weren‚Äôt getting along.

We‚Äôve co-parented well for the last 18 months. After the divorce she refused to speak to me for half a year, after she would finally talk to me we were good co parents. We would co exist and be friendly to each other. It wasn‚Äôt long until she was begging me to take her back.

It‚Äôs been over a year and we talk on the phone every day. Just to check in on the kids, schedules, and things like that, and every time she asks for a second chance. I always said ‚Äúnot now‚Äù and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs discuss that later‚Äù

Tonight she came over unannounced and brought me flowers and literally fell to her knees and begged me to take her back. She told me she‚Äôll never yell again, she‚Äôll be the perfect wife and she‚Äôll do whatever it takes. She reached into her purse and showed me her wedding ring and said she takes it wherever she goes and it‚Äôs her most prized possession. She literally started bawling and said she stayed faithful even though we were divorced. She said all she‚Äôll ever  want is for me to take her back. She said she‚Äôll wait the rest of her life if she has to.

I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I have been faithful too. Not because of that, I just didn‚Äôt have a desire for anyone else. I miss my ex wife very much but it was understood we just weren‚Äôt very compatible.

I told her I‚Äôll always love her but we just aren‚Äôt compatible like that. She said we can go to therapy. She said if there is a will there is a way. I asked if she was really willing to go to therapy and actually give it 100%. She said she‚Äôll do whatever it takes to get me back.

I told her we can give it one more try. She wiper her tears and hugged me and thanked me. She asked for a kiss, and I gave her a smooch.

This was only about an hour ago. I‚Äôm just confused on where to take it from here. I‚Äôm looking up couples therapists around us. I just have a lot of questions.

My 30th birthday is in a few days. There‚Äôs a gathering planned at my moms house. I don‚Äôt know if I should bring her as my partner once again or if I‚Äôll get weird looks.

Do I tell our kids? They are ages 7 and 9.

She only ever got a certificate in ""computers"" from a community college in the 1980's, so she was never able to move up in her office and that frustrated her.  She always told me ""accountants don't have souls"".  

I never really knew what I wanted to do when I was growing up.  My absolute favorite classes in my high school were accounting classes, I can't explain why but I found the work really enjoyable.  As I've gotten older and learned more about myself, it made sense.  I told my mom I wanted to go into accounting - oh man, she got so mad.  She very much discouraged me.

I got my bachelors in social work, which was interesting.  I got hired in hire education and did my MA in educational leadership.  It's okay, but I don't find my work fulfilling.  I've been having some issues feeling like I hate my job for a long time.  It's not bad - there is upward mobility, I can work anywhere there's a college, and usually benefits are great.  Besides not liking the work, though, the pay is not good.  I've been at my job 5 years with a masters and I just reached $40K/yr.  This is a good salary for where I live, but generally until you reach upper admin, the pay is peanuts.  

I don't feel like I have a skill.  I just help the students do things they would otherwise be able to do themselves.  

As an employee, I am able to take courses for free.  I've begun an AAS in Accounting and oh my gosh, I just love it.  I would really like to do accounting as a career.  I'm able to transfer the AAS credits back to my undergrad university, ""mix"" it with the gen eds I did with my BSW, and I would just have to take some upper level accountancy courses before earn my BSBA in Accounting.  With my MA and BSW credits, I would have everything I'd need to take the CPA exam - I may not do so immediately, but I could, and I could get real accounting jobs that pay real money.  

I really want to achieve my CPA and work as an accountant.  Every field has downsides and no field is perfect, but I really like accounting and I want to do it as a career.

My mom is totally unsupportive.  She tells me I'll get depressed and hate my life - news flash, I have been depressed and hating my life for several years now.

Her lack of support makes me feel less confident.  It's just that I could do a job I enjoy, that pays me well (depending) and allows me to work all over the country.  Especially if I get the CPA, that would be life changing.

She just doesn't understand.  Her vehement discouragement really hurts, and I hate not being able to share things with her.

This is something I deeply want, but no one understands and people doubt me.  Even though I've aced my accounting courses and I'm happy, that's not enough.

Everything has been going very well, we've never fought or anything like that before. She moved into a new apartment a few months ago with two single friends. When her and  her roommates have time off they will sometimes mirror their phones to the TV to scroll through tinder together. I Personally think this is super fun, my single friends do this all the time as well and I see no issue. However, about 3 days ago she asked me if she could get a tinder account (mind you my girlfriend never asks permission from me to do anything). I thought it was a little weird for her to have tinder but she assured me it was for what her and her friends do as they run out of swipes. She said the account would be anonymous or under a different name and pictures. After that I said sure if its just her friends wanting to look at guys on the TV. I've gone back and forth over the three days on weather I cared or not. 

Today I went over to her place to pick up some stuff she had printed off for me. When I went in her place her roommates weren't home. I was only there for maybe five minutes as I had to go home and study. When I got back she had texted me a screenshot of her tinder and my friend had come up in her feed. I thought it was funny at first but then I realized that if her roommates weren't home that she must've been swiping through by herself.

I now feel uncomfortable with her having it if she is using a dating app just for personal enjoyment. How should I go about telling her I feel this way?

He used the fight as a reason why I shouldn‚Äôt go because it would cause trouble for him and his friends, he really blamed me through everything.

As I‚Äôm sure you can all guess when the concert came he went with his friends and I stayed home. I was very distraught and felt really betrayed.
