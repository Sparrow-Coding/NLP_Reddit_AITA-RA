Unless I’m crazy, all signs points out he’s interested. 
He’s always complimenting/ flirting with me, winking at me when he sees me, lock and deep eye contact, always smiling, very courteous, caring, when we talk I feel like he’s pushing his chest all the time, he would always lean to talk to me, etc. He also seems curious about me ( asking questions about where I’m from, etc),  he even told me some very deep and personal things that happened to him. And he would sometimes talk to me about the fact that he’s not married yet , doesn’t have kids yet, and how he’s not with his ex anymore ( weird stuff like that ). 

so I decided to reciprocate and just compliment him to see if he’s really interested before maybe asking him out . Last week, I told him that there was something that I really wanted to ask him, but i don’t know how to say it. He responds by saying : whenever you’re ready let me know ! And winks again.

then after we were done with our convo, he reminds me not to forget about what I wanted to say. And I ended up just telling him that I find him really handsome today. 


He replied : Aww that’s so cute, thank you !! 
( i don’t know why he said that’s so cute lol , but unfortunately I couldn’t really see his reaction when I complimented him, because I was basically leaving when I said that. ) 


today I see him again at the cafeteria. He starts the conversation again by asking me how my day was, and we were talking a little bit about little things… but he seemed so relax as usual… like saying that I find him handsome didn’t really change anything? Of course he was still smiling, still looking at me in the eyes, he didn’t seem uncomfortable, etc… but I’d thought maybe this would’ve made him understand I find his attractive and he can ask me out lol. 


So now I’m just not sure if he’s just a nice guy?  Or perhaps he’s too shy ?? Or maybe the work setting and he want ME to ask him out ( the fact he’s a man and he has all the risks   )?

We mutually spend a lot of time together but do make an effort to hang out with friends separately and together.

My gf had started spending less time with her college best friend before me because she wasn't as into the friend group and the amount of drinking and it became less too as each of them became more busy.

A few weeks ago we went to one of her parties and it was really fun and I'm glad we went. We also invited two of our friends she didn't know, one named Mark and his gf.

At one point it was just her best friend and I and she said, ""you know your girlfriend was *my* best friend before you came along"". I'm not sure if that conversation would've continued because her bf came over and we all started talking.

After the party the best friend texted my gf that she really liked Mark. I'm almost certain that she wasn't ever that emphatic about me. It hurts a bit because I've been trying to arrange things with hanging out with that best friend but there's been a lot of schedule conflicts.

**TLDR:** At a party gf's friend said ""you know your girlfriend was *my* best friend before you came along,"" and later texted my gf about how great one of our mutual friends is (I don't think she's ever been as emphatic about me). 

Its been making me feel weird for a bit and my main confidant and closest to the situation. I want to talk to someone about it to help get it off my mind.

So much of our time has been shared through it, many late night conversations about all of life, laughs, and love. We share so many core values and views/goals on how to navigate the world around us and what we want in life and so many shared interests/passions. The emotional, intellectual, and physical chemistry and compatibility are the best that I've had with a partner. She has everything I'm looking for in what I would want in a wife and she has said the same about me. Also, we have not been dating other people. The timing is just not good though.
.

She was dating a guy for 6 years living together,ready to marry him, which ended due to his cheating,  just a few months before meeting me and needs to learn how to become her own person. I was already planning an across country move but wasn't 100% certain, to live in a mountain town that has all of the outdoor recreation one could dream of for 2 years. She is not emotionally or mentally available for a relationship and needs to take the time and space to find her own sense of fulfillment, happiness, and self worth independently without a partner. 
.

We both agree that it's such a special and rare connection, that came so unexpectedly, and I've allowed myself to fall in love with her. There are so many things we haven't had the time to do together yet like climbing mountains and so many places to travel that weve talked about. 
.

We've talked about how we understand she needs the time and space to work on herself and get where she wants to be. She also wants to stay in touch,  but doesn't want me to wait around for her to be ready. She also isn't sure if she really does need that time for herself since she doesn't want to lose me or have me be the one that got away. She wants to come visit to ski and climb when I move in a couple of months but also is unsure if that would even be healthy.
.
She is confused on what would be best for her to do. I don't think there's any easy answer and that It might be for the best to go no contact and move on from eachother so she can have her time and space to develop her own fulfillment and be ready for someone else down the road. If it was meant to be then circumstance will pull us back together in the future. 
.

Has anyone else had to end an extremely positive and uplifting relationship due to circumstance that isn't either person's fault? 
.
Now we just have 1 week left together since I'm going out of the country for a month, and then am moving 3 weeks after I get back, and are enjoying it like it's the last time, but I don't want it to be the last time...but I know for someone I love I do value her happiness and wellbeing even if that means it isn't with me.
.
While I'm overseas the next month she wanted to separate and not stay in touch, but she also says she doesn't actually want that because talking to me and knowing about the adventures I'm on makes her really happy, so why end something that gives so much fulfillment? She is definitely confused and I want to stay with her and wait it out.

Sex was happening regularly and naturally would just happen without planning it or anything for example we would be in bed watching a movie and one thing would lead to another and we would end up having sex. As for a year ago, I have been having to ask if she wants to do it because it got to the stage where it wasn't happening naturally anymore and then when I tried to make a move, she would say she wasn't in the mood. When I now ask if she wants to, 90% of the time it is a no. She will ask once a week if I want to and obviously I am going to say yes.

I feel like the dynamic of our relationship has completely changed. I feel less of a man because she isn't desiring me or wanting me sexually anymore. Because of the arguments this has created, sex doesn't feel the same anymore and feels forced. We have to use lube majority of the time because she doesn't seem into it. I have tried discussing the issue I am having with her which always leads to an argument and nothing changes it just creates stress and makes matters worse.

The first few years were great because my libido was being matched. My libido hasn't changed at all now and isn't being matched and it is really affecting my connection with her. I also mentioned it was affecting my connection and she responded with ""I will not be coerced into having sex"".

What can I do to turn this around? Should I give her space and concentrate on myself and let her come to me? Should I change my attitude towards her?

(Recap) Me and my gf have been dating almost a year. Went over to visit her and phone was dead and used hers when she asked me to look something up. Found she had previous searches of this website called chat blink. Looked into it and had a history which looked like using adult chat and going to a section labeled matches. Which is a dating section. 



UPDATE 

So I confronted her. And here’s exactly how she explained it.

“So I know how it looks and i can honestly explain. It’s a site I found when Covid happened and I used it to find new friends. I even found a few and added them on discord and we would talk and have group conversations all the time. There was this girl we would play cod and there was this guy who had a whole family but got split up and had a lot of stuff happen I can go into a whole story talking about it all. And that’s really it.”

So I’m just like 

“Wait. Hold on. That’s “it”. If it’s from Covid and you guys talk on discord now why do you go on it. Why do you use the adult chatting tab when there’s regular options. Why do you constantly click on people’s profiles and use the website even now. I feel to me that your using this because I’m not enough for you. Because if I was enough if I meant enough to you you wouldn’t do this. You wouldn’t wan to look for more friends especially on a site like this.”

She then said

“I go on it now to see if any of my old friends still go on here. That’s it no other reason. And it’s because adult chat is the only place regular people go on I know that sounds contradictory but that’s how I met my friends and I just use that. And you might see that I click on people’s profiles but I only click on their messages that they send me to block them and that’s it. (You can receive dms but can’t see the message unless you click on their profile) and I don’t know I can’t explain I just go on here to talk to my old friends and see if they still go on here. You have to trust me on this because no matter how I explain it it might look bad. It might look weird but I’m being honest I never did anything bad I promise you.”  

I say 

“I don’t know. This doesn’t sit right with me. Something just seems off because why would you keep visiting it in secret. Like it definitely feels like you hid this from me. And if you did why w would you for any other reason than for it being wrong. For a reason that you need to hide.” 

She says. 

“I did try and hide it I did use a fake email to set it up because I didn’t want you to think I was weird for doing this.”





This was literally her response. I couldn’t take it at this point. I go off a bit more and again and again it’s more sorta good points but not really at all. And we end it with ok imma sit on this and think. 

So about her. She is very Christian. She is the most innocent person I know in the sense that I know she cares for me and wouldn’t consider cheating. Not even a small whiff of cheating. But after all this now I just can’t trust her. Like understandably. I tell her I’m having trouble trusting her. 

We talk a bit more and it settles down and we rest on it. The next day I try to think positive and hangout with her and maybe try talking to her from a positive point of view because I do love her so very much. The day goes on and it’s actually a nice day. 

The next day I’m having some issues as I’m just rethinking everything and I’m just like wait a second she did this and it’s not even that solid of a defense. And I just reconsider it all again and we fight again. 

Ok now here we are today things were going great and then she started to get stale with me. I ask what’s wrong and she said how she wants a little break because she can’t deal with me not trusting her. And how she thinks I’m not ready to be dating. At first I’m like what. Your serious you have trouble with me not trusting you.  But then I’m like you know what your right let’s have this break. 

And here we are. Me making this. Honestly I’m confused why she is the one upset at me. Like if I had something like that but I was innocent I would go out of my way. Bend over backwards do everything in my power to make you trust me again. But you got mad at me. Seriously now I’m even more suspicious.

And we were really happy for a while until we had some problems. I messed up in some moments in upsetting her and she would get so angry at me for alot of things that seemed like it wouldn't be a big deal to me but she would blow it out of proportion and she would cuss me out and stuff. After so many of that I got pretty numb and sometimes I seemed like I wasn't as affectionate as before. She noticed and we argued about something else and then we talked about it and I told her I felt like I was walking on eggshells with her and she was really heartbroken about it bc she felt happy w me overall when she got over our arguments. But after this we apologized to eachother and now she seems to be controlling more about what upsets her and stuff. I feel like it's getting better and we've been happy. The other day we had a bit of an argument which ended in with her a but dissapointed waiting for an answer that I gave something different which she thinks I don't love her as much as she does me. She didn't tell me that but I feel it bc she just wanted to drop it. So I feel she's holding that inside. And well after that we've had no fights and she has been very nice w me being all cute and stuff w me too.

 I feel like she is trying and all to be better and I have been having fun w her when we hang out but Idk why inside I don't feel much of the excitement as much when I get to see her anymore. I just feel like we're acting everything is fine and all happy when we're not really although I di feel she is happier now so I feel kinda bad sometimes I feel like breaking up with her and think about pursuing other people, I've never thought of planning on cheating on her or anything though, I've been through that and I don't ever want to make anyone else feel that specially her. Idk guys I don't know how to feel either, I feel bad for her if I break up w her bc she has cried alot thinking I was gonna break up w her before and I don't know if she can take it. Plus we have things planned for future weeks too like in a couple days I got to take her to the airport so she can visit a family member and in a while we're planning to go on a convention and she already said she bought me something for our 6 month of being together, etc. Also since we've been for almost 6 months and we've already been on trips together to other states and gone do things I would've never imagined like a concert for the first time to me.

TLDR:I'm (20m) conflicted about breaking up with my gf(20f) bc we've fought alot before and now it'd gotten better in the relationship and we're happy but inside I don't think I feel as happy as I'm supposed to but I'm too scared of breaking up w her bc I feel bad ill hurt her.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7550223,public,self,I don't know if I want to break up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvg846/i_dont_know_if_i_want_to_break_up/,all_ads,6,

I have this recurring problem with my Dad where he'll ask me a seemingly simple question and I won't understand the question, so he'll get frustrated with me and yell at me. A few minutes ago, he asked me if I had spoken to my Mom earlier today. I said yes and then I kind of stared at him. In my head, I was thinking ""*Spoken about what*?"" He then raised his voice a little and asked me ""Did she call you and tell you about her car breaking down today?"" and I was like ""No."" He started to get frustrated and he yelled ""Well that's what I was talking about when I asked if you had spoken to her!"" I stared at him blankly. I had spoken to her this morning before she left for work, but our conversation was not about that and she had not called me at *any* point in the day to tell me that her car had broken down, so I did not initially understand what he was referring to when he asked me if I had spoken to her. After a few minutes, he stormed out of the room.

There was one other time earlier this month when I was taking a shower and my Dad came home super pissed off about something. Just as I was beginning to dry myself off, he asked me ""Did you just get out of the shower?"" I immediately blurted out ""No"" because it *had* actually been a few minutes since I had gotten out and I really didn't understand why he cared to ask in the first place. As soon as I finished in the bathroom and came out, Dad started cussing me out. He yelled ""I *know* that you didn't just get out of the shower. If you had just gotten out, then I would have heard the water turn off. That's what the question implied. Did you just not understand the question or something? Do you not understand English? God, you're such a fucking dumbass! You're so SPED!"" I, again, stared at him blankly. Tears started to well up in my eyes. I really felt like his question was vague and I couldn't do anything to argue back. I'm not even special ed, but he made me feel like a complete idiot at that moment.

 My Dad and I have a long history of miscommunication and I'm really just tired of him getting angry with me for not understanding what he says.

It had been months and months of him coming home pissed off, complaining about what happened and each day something different would occur. It took one phone call after work from him for me to come to the conclusion that whatever was going on at work was no longer a joke and had crossed the line. When he told me what was going on I didn’t know what to do or think, I was shocked. I called my mom right after (she works at the same place as him) and she was so upset that she started crying. At first she told him he had 48 hours to report it or she had to do something about it, as she is a supervisor and is mandated to report. I got off the phone with her and called him and told him and we were gunna talk more about it later that night. Not even 10 minutes later my mom called and said she had already reported it. I immediately knew this was going to be a problem as he had been telling me the whole time this was going on about how he didn’t want to report it whatsoever. 

Now flash forward 3 months from my mom reporting it. He is in a different position, tucked away forgotten about and lives with constant stress, anxiety and ptsd about the whole situation. He feels as if his place of employment is trying to tuck it under the rug until everyone forgets about it and he is very upset. He says that it’s all my fault and blames most of this on me… I did not know that my mom was going to do that, I only called her because what he had told me that day shocked me so much I couldn’t believe what grown men were doing to him.

We (19 M&amp;F) have been FWB for around 3 months and we’re friends for a few years before. A few weeks ago she admitted she has feelings for me and I said the same. We didn’t become official due to life circumstances but the point is we both care about each other and this means more to me than just a casual hookup.

The only problem is I’ve never made her finish. She told me she’s never climaxed from penetration, I finger her every time we have sex but she’s never gotten off from that either. I went down on her once but it smelled and she didn’t seem like she liked it so I stopped and never tried again. She has always told me that it’s her issue and her meds and porn usage make it really hard, but the thing is she had confronted me about not getting her off since I only tried going down on her once, and I explained to her I don’t like giving or receiving oral (which is true), and she seemed understanding since then. Since then she tells me she enjoys the sex but I still don’t really trust her bc it’s clear that this issue bothered her at one point.

This has started to affect me mentally to where I feel embarassed to be naked around her and I feel disconnected when we have sex. It also started making me insecure about my size, especially bc she likes touching me down there. I’m only like 6.3 in and it hadn’t bothered me much before but now I feel insecure about it as well as my physique now. It honestly makes me want to kill myself sometimes. It also has made her feel like I don’t want her becuase I refuse head and don’t like her touching me down there, and these issues have obviously led me to stop initiating with her since I’m so embarrassed. She can also tell when I’ve been withdrawing into myself during sex and it really hurts her. She says it makes her feel ugly and unwanted. 

I never wanted to be like these guys I read about on here that never give their gfs orgasms, it’s humiliating and makes me feel like an idiot when I try and fail every time. I also never wanted to hurt her like this. We talked about things and decided to take a break from sex and hanging out for a few weeks, but I feel like the only option is to stop seeing her entirely. I don’t know if I want to have sex again, but at the same time I know it would upset me if she started sleeping with someone else because she is the only person I want. So I feel like maybe I should stop seeing her entirely. Need advice on any other solutions becuase I really don’t want this to be the end

I saw a few comments talking about an update after I posted the OG. So here it is. 

Anyway, we've been communicating more and the night I made the post, I asked Tom to come over so we could talk. He did and things went well, everything was good. We joked and laughed about bullshit and listened to music at the beginning, he sang and danced around. Then we got into the discussion.

I may have been a little more aggressive and loud than I should've been but I was tired of him not understanding the actual point. He kept reiterating that nothing was going on between him and Carol. He seemed genuine and had told me that in our texts before and that he didn't want to lose me. I ended up yelling at him that that wasn't the point. I said I probably wouldn't have minded the increased conversation between him and Carol **if** he wasn't taking attention away from me to give it to her. 

I told him I knew if I wasn't getting the attention, somebody else was and it was her. I said that it really upset and hurt me that **my** boyfriend was giving another girl the attention instead of me. It wasn't acceptable. But here's the thing - I genuinely wanted to rip this man to actual shreds that night. He told told me that he has other things to do than talking to me constantly. I was stunned into completely silence, mouth hanging open and everything. 

I did flip out a little. It wasn't my proudest moment but I think it was necessary. He seemed to understand my point more. I calmed down, reiterated my point again and he apologized several times, he's still apologizing for things. I do not hesitate to communicate how he makes me feel. I got out of a DV situation early this year and while I do struggle with seeing my worth, I do understand that's just self-esteem issues and that I am worth quite a lot. I say that as humble as I can but everyday I try to improve myself, everyday I try to be a better person than I was yesterday. I'm a shitty person but I'm fixing it, it's just a process that takes time. I know I have worth if I can self-reflect and take those revelations to heart to actually fix the problems within myself. 

We've been talking more, it's not a lot but it's more. I can see the effort. That night, he let his walls down a bit. I understand why people have them up around me because of the BPD and splitting. But he admitted something I said to him a few days prior was hurting him and it's all he ever thought about anymore. I can't remember what it was, he didn't specify. Regardless, I apologized and said that sometimes I say things I don't mean in a moment of what feels like panic and deep hurt. I admitted that I do go too far sometimes and I regret that but I'm trying so hard to stop. 

He has been more affectionate lately. I do get hugs, kisses happen sometimes. I'm not stressing about it because I can see he is trying. Do y'all know the toothpaste metaphor people tell their kids when trying to get them to understand you can't take things back? That's why I understand. I can't say vicious things, mental illness or not, and expect people to forgive me nor do I. I appreciate that he's trying regardless. 

He's on his phone less but that's because when he starts for any reason, I jump on mine. I guess he doesn't like it lmao. Our visits do not last long at all and I don't want him to be on his phone. I want us to spend time together, silence and all. But at least he's trying. Nobody else ever did.

When we first started talking we both had talked about having relatively high sex drives. Everything started out fine and then suddenly only like 3 months in everything crashed.  
It started by our sex feeling very one sided like it was a race to the finish line. After awhile of that I started to get annoyed since we only see each other on weekends and he has a kid so it sucked when we could, it wouldn't be enjoyable for me. I tried talking to him to give him a direction on what I like but instead it just seemed like I ruined his confidence.  
Now he won't initiate it and when I try he acts as if he doesn't know that I am trying to set a mood. He will kiss me once and pull away. When it's been awhile I have to just very bluntly ask him if he would like to.. and he ALWAYS makes some sort of comment or awkward joke that either completely turns me off, typically because it makes me feel like I am giving him a task to do.

When I try talking to him about it he either says that I never look satisfied or he was watching a movie.  
I try really hard to show that I am enjoying it. He uses the movie excuse a lot which makes me upset because movies can be paused and half the time he complains that the movie sucked after.

This happened with my last 4 year relationship, so I am taking it very personally. Although, the last guy I was dating was cheating on me which caused a lot of those problems.  
I don't know what to do anymore. I've looked inward to see if anything has changed with me to make him unattracted to me but I really don't think anything has. Our relationship is doing well other than this. He's been talking about wanting to move forward in it. I just don't understand why this is happening.

She is funny af and the banter was just nonstop. I'm super awkward and kind of timid and she is super outgoing and will roast you about anything, so it was a funny dynamic too. I don't remember exactly how the conversation came up, but fairly early on, she said she was not really looking to get into a relationship. I just said something to the effect of ""that's cool"". However, me being perhaps arrogant or just clueless, I thought that if she did go out with me, after a few months maybe she would have a change of heart. Maybe I thought she was bluffing. At this point we were just texting and my biggest fear was getting friendzoned. Which leads me to what I think was another mistake on my part and that is that I was quite persistent in asking her out which aside from perhaps making her uncomfortable, looking back I feel so embarrassed for myself. She would just say things like ""I would, but I have plans with my family"" and eventually she said she had trust issues with strangers from Tinder and that I should just be patient. Weeks go by and now we're texting daily and talking on the phone for hours at a time. Even more weeks go by and finally after I stopped trying to ask her out, she suggested we hang out. So we went out, we were out for the whole night. We went out a few more times and after some time, I told her that I really liked her and would like to continue seeing her if she wanted to as well. The response I got was straightforward and honest, but nonetheless me being the fragile being that I am, I was disappointed and sad. She basically said that I am really sweet, but that she does not want to get into a relationship with anyone. She just wants to have fun. At this point, I thought I was getting friendzoned, but then she basically said that she thought I was very cute and she would be down for ""romantic"" stuff. She said, she just doesn't want to be committed to anyone. So without saying anything else to her, I just thought she was looking for a FWB. I was a bit bummed out, but after I reflected on it a little, I decided that I was fine with just having fun and if it lead to something more then cool and if not, then also cool. Now this is where the confusing stuff starts for me, so bare with me. After a little while, she told me that her family wants to meet me and I do meet them more than once. We continue going out and talking on the phone almost daily. She even starts sending me cheesy text messages constantly. Keep in mind, while this is going on, I did my best to keep myself grounded. I never asked her ""so what are we now?"" or anything like that because I remembered what she told me in the beginning. At this point we had already hooked up more than once and at least I knew she liked me. We were planning road trips etc. Fast forward some time, she starts ghosting me out of the blue. Well, she'd reply once a day or two days and her texts were really cold and just distant sounding. After a few weeks of this, I ask her if anything is wrong and she basically accused me of taking this too seriously when I wasn't even reciprocating any of her cheesy texts or stuff like that even though deep down I really wanted to. After that conversation we kind of started texting normally, but we did not go out because she said she was busy with school, but I found out she was going out with another Tinder guy. She was the one who told me nonchalantly so I didn't say anything so we just kept texting. I was upset even though I never told her. I was upset because I guess I did catch feelings and now she's seeing other people, but I was also upset because even if she wanted to continue being friends (or FWB) with me she just sounded more and more distant and disinterested. So I just stopped texting her for a week. She texted me a couple times, but I did not think what she texted me was worth a reply, so I ignored her. More weeks go by and I genuinely forgot some movies at her house, so I called her to ask for them back. She did not answer. I called her a couple more times over the period of three weeks and the call would ring for a good minute before it went to voicemail. I lastly texted her and just asked about my DVDs and the texts delivered, but I received no reply. It kind of confused me why she doesn't just block me, but it is what it is. Now it's been like two months since I last spoke to her let alone seen her, and I have no clue what happened. I'm not mad at her, because she did warn me she did not want anything serious, I'm just kind of sad that it ended like this. My theory is, she started catching feelings and for whatever reason she caught herself and hit the breaks hard and put up a big wall. I have very minimal experience with women (I've only had three girlfriends in my entire life) so being exposed to this kind of situation confused me a lot and just made me sad. I guess my biggest mistake was catching feelings even though I never expressed them. There's a lot more details that I left out for the sake of trying to keep this short, but I think I covered the important stuff.

I’m 22 male and have never had a girlfriend before. I started a new job recently at a grocery store and I cant get one of my managers out of my head. I’m really doubting that she’d ever look at me that way.. mostly because she is quite taller than me, and I know a lot of girls aren’t attracted to shorter guys.

But I’d really love some advice on how I can start a conversation with her maybe.

Today I was waiting for my shift to start in the staff room and she came in and we had the most basic conversation “hi, how are you” etc. Then later on she stuck up for me when somebody (jokingly) said I’m wearing the wrong uniform. I actually do wear the wrong clothes so I told her lots of customers ask if I even work there and she laughed and made fun of me. Then she gave me a few fun tasks to do. Then at the end of the night she gave me the worst task, and laughed at my reaction. 

I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it and trying to find hints in mediocre interactions. She’s very friendly and nice to everyone, especially since she’s a manager she can’t exactly be mean to me lol. I’m not sure what it is that draws me to her because as you can see most of our conversations are about work, but when she laughs with me I really enjoy it and I get super excited when she comes over to talk.

Before we actually made it official it was very much friends with benefits over text, making flirty comments which became sexual and messing about in person but not full on sex. He was pretty much all for it and comfortable with the idea of sex, and when we made it official we were deciding to go slower. 

However about 5 months in, we hadn’t had full on sex, I should mention I was not a virgin but my bf was, and I was like okay….this is fine, I respect his boundaries and consent and will not pressure him, but felt a bit down about the lack of sex. I expressed this to him and he  then turned around and said he wasn’t sure he wanted to because of religious reasons, this was such a surprise becausecause I was not made aware of him maybe trying to be celibate till marriage, but he wasn’t 100% sure. I felt I was lied to a bit, I felt like celibacy was forced on me. Sex was important in all my previous relationship, as an emotional and physical connection, and I still feel this way. 

He has had issues before with performance and no judgement from me, I have been understanding and let him know there is no pressure. he decided he wanted to have sex, however first time we had sex it was extremely stressful because of this, but I kept that to myself, I didn’t want to make him feel like shit. We took it slow and I let him take the lead and stop when he wanted too to try and help. Our second time was better but that’s it, we’ve done in twice in a year of dating. 

He gets extremely shy about anything regarding sex when I bring it up and in turn that makes me feel bad for making him uncomfortable, so I’ve stopped, it makes me scared to even initiate anything past kissing too. It makes me feel so ugly and disgusting and like he he isn’t attracted to me and I feel rejected, it hurts.

There were little to no problems and when we did have them we were great at sorting them out. My parents liked her, her parents loved me. We would have fun joking about getting MARRIED one day and what we would name our kids. In August, I had to leave for college. It was the saddest I've been for years and we cried and cried for a whole hour. We didn't want to give up on each other though, and we decided to try long distance. I was across the county, but she planned on going to a neighboring school the following year. It went smoothly for a few months, we called every night and texted during the day. Still great. After a while, things got a bit rocky and we started to drift a bit, but it was mainly the separation anxiety. We compromised and decided to take a break from dating so we could experience other people with the hopes of finding each other at the end of the road, but we would still talk as friends occasionally to keep in touch.

The friendship thing went south pretty quickly. One of my best friends from school who she worked with started seeing her, which bothered me but I stayed cool about it with her. This dude is an absolute scumbag btw, he's been in legal trouble with most things you could think of, and he's heavily addicted to marijuana and gambling. I still talked to her sometimes but it wasn't the same. As it turns out, he was a horrible person to date, as he never spent real time with her, left her texts on delivered for many hours at a time to go gambling, and was on his phone whenever they hung out. She would vent to me about him, but ignored my advice. About a month later, (yesterday) he just explodes my dm's saying horrible things about me with every type of laughing emoji you could think of saying ""I stole your girl bozo get played"" and other foul things.

If I need to shit on him some more, keep in mind that her friends had to question why she kept seeing this guy, and when she had him over for dinner the first time, her parents told her they preferred me ""a hundred times out of a hundred"". But she kept giving him chances. At this point, I wouldn't care if she was dating anybody, but it made me sad to see herself constantly going through it with someone who didn't care for her. I even offered to get her with some nice guys I knew, because it made me sick the way she was being treated.

Obviously, I'm feeling bad for her, so today I expressed my concern by texting her. To my avail, HE starts texting me back with the same bull shit from yesterday. When she gets back on her own phone, we start talking, but she tells me she doesn't want to talk at all anymore. She's telling me that life is destroying her mental health, and she blames it on me. Personally, I guarantee that the problem is her insane abusive new boyfriend, but I stay quiet about that and we talk for about 30 minutes and she tells me she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore for that reason. All she would tell me is that I was childish for wanting to text her. I end the conversation by telling her that I'll be there for her if she wants to try again one day, and that I'm sorry for everything. I'm writing this about an hour after this happened.

I (f) and my partner ""Rose"" (f) started dating 10 months ago, and i fell head over heels the when we first met.

Rose admitted to me that she was demisexual, which i was slightly confused by concidering our first time together but i understood. However yesterday she asked me what sexual attraction felt like which turned into her admitting to me that she was asexual. 

Apparently shes always known shes never been sexually attracted to anyone, so i asked about us having sex very quickly after we first started dating. She implied that she has never been sexually attracted to me, and had sex with me just so we could persue a romantic relationship together....???

Have i been reverse nice guy'd??? Instead of being nice and being romantic to me in order to have sex, she had sex with me to be nice, romantic and to start dating me??

Im so confused and a hurt. I feel like she thinks i only ever cared about the sex, i wouldve been completely fine waiting or never even having sex if she had just told me. I had a track record of falling for one night stands for a while, which makes me wonder if she used this to manipulate me by using sex to form an attachment?

My son is 23 years old still he stays with me.  Today a 23 year old woman reached out to me via Facebook. She is 6 months pregnant with my sons child. I had no idea he even had a baby on the way. She messaged me videos of my son threatening her to get an abortion. 
Also my son was texting her trying to bribe her to abort the baby with money ($200) and i knew it was my son from the phone number the screenshots had on them. She told me she was my sons ex. And was scared. I watched the videos she sent and was in shock at some of the things my son had said to her. He sent videos of her admitting she would be doing it alone and he wanted nothing to do with them and to just get rid of it. 
  She blocked my account after sending me this 


My son told her in the messages he basically was gonna be a dead beat  dad she was going to do it alone numerous times. 

My son didn’t tell me he had a child on the way nor could i believe how bad he was trying to manipulate this girl too abort my grandchild.
I want to meet up with her for support and to apologize on my sons behalf. My son hasn’t denied that it’s his child but he admitted to emotionally abusing the situation

We live together.

He can be very impulsive which leads him to do many amazing things to our home but he can also drop projects or go super slow if he loses interest. He has ADHD so its not him being careless, it's just how his mind works. For example, he got some astro turf from his work for free last month that he wanted to fit in our garden and it's still laying out on the front garden, it's unsightly and our housemates have complained. It'll get picked up eventually and I'm sure look great when he does it but it's just been left.

Onto the main issue: he also got some free planks of wood to redo the floor in our living room. We have a narrow hallway and he stacked up heaps of planks in there to later take through to our living room. A housemate said it was hard to walk through the hallway and to please move it, which he said he would but didn't. During the night, while walking in the dark to lock our front door and forgetting about the new planks of wood stacks, I walked into one and bruised my toe joint. It's been painful to walk since. At first my boyfriend said I was being dramatic but since it's gone on he's been very apologetic.

This was nearly 3 weeks ago and after seeing a podiatrist today they said I may not be able to go back to my old exercise again for another 6 - 12 weeks. Exercise has been a huge mental health anchor for me lately and I've already been struggling, so I was seriously upset at this news. I've made comments already that I have felt he was to blame for the injury but I sent him a voice note saying if he'd just moved it when he was first asked, none of it would have happened and his impulsivity has consequences and and although I love our new floor, it's cost me financially and mentally.

He works late and has text me saying he feels uncomfortable seeing me and he'll stay somewhere else tonight. He's not picking up his phone.

I feel awful for this misplaced resentment, I know it was an accident and ultimately my responsibility and I feel like I've driven him away. What can i do to fix this? I'm also really struggling to keep a level head when I'm so sedentary.

On mobile 

Sorry this is a bit long, I (21f) am friends with this girl (22f) from high school. I'll call her T. Back in high school we used to be really good friends, I've known her since we were 12, to the point where we got matching tattoos. She sent out an invite to all our high school friends that now live in Europe for her birthday. A combination of her 20th 21st and 22nd birthday. 

I was the only one out of our high school friends who could make it since we live in neighbouring countries. I asked T is it was alright that I bring my bf (25m) and one of his friends (25m) that was visiting us. She said yes and sent me the date and location of the village she lived in. 

The party was last Saturday, we arrived in her country Saturday morning and spent some time in the big city before going to the train station. She had called the day before asking if we can arrive at the train station before 18hrs. T picked us up from the train station and the ride to her house was perfectly normal. When we got to her house she showed us the room we would crash in and let me know that she was leaving to go to the party. She said she would send me the location in 10 minutes as it was walking distance away. 

I was very confused as I thought we would go together but she was very insistant that we took time to get ready.. Although we did not need time. At first I thought it was because she was going by car with her friends and we would not have fit in the car with them. I still felt strange about it. 15 minutes later she sent the location of the party and my bf his friend and I walked over. 

When we got there she introduced us to her friends and then went with them behind the bar and did not engage in conversation with us. Neither did her friends. We felt very weird about this... T was making drinks and giving them to her friends but did not offer us any. 

I had brought a drink from the country that we went to High school with me as a gift for her as it is not possible to get in Europe and I had been back a couple months ago and still had a bottle left. She did not say thank you. This hurt. As the drink was difficult to get and I thought she would be appreciative that I made the effort to bring it for her. 

The party was awkward, she did not speak to me except for 5 minutes when she was extremely drunk about a situation that happened a few months ago in Paris. I was in Paris because I needed to go to the airport there and one of my friends, Z, was living in Paris, we decided to meet up for lunch. Z told me that T was there as well and was also going to the airport. I found out that T and I were going to the same airport, her flight was an hour before mine. T said she would take an uber after lunch to the airport. Then she asked me how I was getting to the airport. 

This was awkward as I would have thought she would suggest I join her in the uber and we split the fare. I told T that my plan was to take the train. T said that after lunch she was going with Z to pick up her stuff before getting in the uber and that they would drop me off at a metro station. Drunk T said that she wanted me to ask her to join in the uber. Although I feel like if I did I would be overstepping. 

T then proceeded to get get black out drunk and passed out on a sofa. None of her friends went to make sure she was alright, so I sat with her and took care of her. After a while she woke up again and ran off to her friends. I didn't see her again the rest of the night. Which is weird as the place was not that big. 

Later her friends came to us and told us that we needed to leave. It was not even that late, 2am. They kicked us out so we were just standing around outside. This is when I found out that T had gone home. She did not tell us how to get into the house as the door was locked. Her brother asked me if I could get inside and I said no, so he gave me his house keys. Bf, his friend and I then just walked back to her house and went to sleep. 

The next morning we were talking about how strange the party was and how we all felt really uncomfortable being there. Eventually at around 12 T walks past the open door and just says hello, nothing else. T then disappeared upstairs. 

I think maybe 30 minutes later we could hear cutlery clinking. T was having breakfast/lunch with her friends upstairs. At this point the boys and I were feeling very unwelcome so I went up stairs and asked T if she could drive us to the train station as the next train was at 14hrs. She said sure and just to let her know when we were ready to leave as it takes 20 minutes to get there. She was watching Netflix and eating with her friends. 

We packed up and 5 minutes later I asked if we could leave earlier so we could have time to eat something at the train station, nobody said goodbye to us. I don't remember if she even thanked us for coming. When we were at the train station eating I was talking to the boys and they felt like it was very strange behaviour. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. 

Honestly I would have preferred if she had told me not to come than to feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome at her place. So I've been thinking about it for a while and I don't know if I should text her about how I feel or if I should just let it be. I probably won't ever speak to her again as this is not how I want to be treated by someone I consider a friend and I would never do this to anyone of my friends. I wouldn't even know what to say to her. I'm just really hurt and confused about the whole situation.

We’ve known each other since childhood and always had crushes on each other but never dated until 10 months ago. This relationship has had ups and downs. There’s literally always something or drama going on, not necessarily between us but it also involves the mother of his child. I don’t care for drama and feel like at our age, there’s better ways to handle conflict so that’s been a lot for me. My boyfriend was caught back in May messaging several other girls on Facebook messenger. He didn’t apologize because he felt it would not be genuine since he was caught. A week later same issue, he felt bad and I was seeing changes. That lasted a couple weeks then I was noticing his phone facing down, always in his pocket, under the pillow, frequent bathroom trips and just overall almost annoyed with me for no reason. 
He promised after the second time in May that he was not messaging anymore girls and would think further about liking other girls pictures and understood how it was disrespectful. But in September, right after his birthday, I received a message from a girl on Facebook. She sent me screenshots of messages between my boyfriend and her from that weekend (I saw the messages early Monday morning). I was crushed. He asked if she would visit him in June. Also that he took his kid to see Jurassic World, but he doesn’t have a car. I was the one who took them to the movies. 
He doesn’t have a car, so I transport him and he stays at my house during the weekend to have visits with his son. Which occur almost every weekend as his son lives in the same town as me. I have to drive over an hour to get him and often have to come up during the week at some point because he “misses” me but I kinda feel like it’s because he needs a ride to work. Since that morning in September, I’ve really struggled with wanting to continue this relationship. I feel so betrayed but if I try to talk to him about my feelings, he gets so down on himself that I feel guilty or like maybe I’m not seeing things from his point of view. On top of that, holidays are coming up and I can’t stand the thought of his son having to miss out on time with his dad. I love him, and I thought I forgave him but I don’t. I’m wondering if it’s too late to talk to him about how this has made me feel since the last time was in September? As I mentioned, I had to take him to work that Monday morning and did confront him. He said he gets drunk and does stupid things then said sorry. He was of course super loving on me afterwards but that was it.
The past week I feel like he’s back to his ways again. Just acting annoyed, liking more girls pictures and being secretive with his phone again. I just don’t know how to bring this up without it sounding like I’m trying to start drama. There’s a looot more to this, but the loyalty is what’s really messing with me the most.

We get along great together and I can honestly see us going the distance because of how well we communicate and how open we are. I have one thing that drives me kinda nuts about him though, and it’s that he won’t let me pay for things! 

For some context, I have a full-time job and I make a decent amount of money. I’ve been living with my parents for the past 2 years because they have a house that’s 5 minutes from my office and it’s also been a great way to save up money. They’re great and are encouraging me to stay with them for as long as possible so that I can save more. Tbh I’ll probably move out the beginning of next year though. Anyways, my boyfriend knows all this and that I’m living with my parents so that I can save up money. Meanwhile, he’s in med-school and all of his money is literally studentloan money.

It feels entirely wrong to let him pay for things when we go out on dates since this isn’t *really* his money, but he *insists*. I know he’s just trying to be sweet, but I feel so guilty about it. He likes to take me out to nice restaurants sometimes, and I’ll have every intention of paying, but he sneaks them him card while I’m in the bathroom or something. I’ve tried negotiating with him to at least let me pay for my half of the meal, but he doesn’t like that either. Recently, I’ve started using an app to send my half of the bill to him afterwards, but he’s said it makes him feel uncomfortable so I’ve stopped.

I’ve tried to convince him to let me pay, but I think for him it’s this thing where he just wants feel like he can provide for me. I feel like I’m taking advantage of him though. I’ve had this conversation with him several times, but we can’t reach a conclusion on what to do since we’re both so stubborn on our own points of view. He jokes about how he’ll finally let me start to pay for things in a few years as motivation for me to stay with him longer. Or another joke is that in a few years when he gets his “big doctor salary” then this will be no big deal for him and I just need to stop worrying about it. Is there any way to convince him to let me pay for at least my half?? Should I just give in and let him try to spoil me with his studentloan money??

I would just ask her out but there’s confusing things in the way and I’ll do my best to explain it out completely:

So to start
We always got along, since we first met we immediately became good friends and she was always saying how we should go out on a night out and stuff similar.
She told someone else that she finds me attractive but “wouldn’t want to corrupt me” obviously being a joke. We were talking about it a few weeks later and she just was straight forward with finding me really attractive.

I decided to just leave that be and left it. Didn’t want to do something stupid and scare her off or anything like that cause I have a history of being stupidly rash.

Eventually we did end up going out to a nightclub. It was fun, we were drinking she was touchy. And when I dropped someone else home she was texting me she missed me and stuff. And we ended up making out. Now she obviously told me that the kiss meant nothing. And I don’t think about that night whenever I think about asking her out. We were drunk. I accept that. Means nothing.

At work she’s coming up to me talking to me. We talk about shit a lot, she makes a lot of eye contact and I kinda notice she talks to me more than anyone else. Tells me everything, all of it. 

But, gotta be clear and I’ll give the bad sides;
She’s either horrible at texting or isn’t into me at all.
When it comes to texting she’s not very responsive at all. She replies with a few one words every now and again. Takes a bit to respond and shit like that. Which is obviously something I can’t ignore.

She also WAS talking to a guy, but she clearly doesn’t like him very much?? Atleast when we were talking one night I just asked her how it was going with that guy. She said they were still talking but she doesn’t really like him. And that she’s annoyed because she turns away good guys and blah blah, she wasn’t saying this *about* me as we was just talking casually I hadn’t asked her out or anything.

I just have a massive crush on her and I do understand there are plenty of signs, my friends don’t want me going for it since they know I’ve been pining over this girl for months.

Situation:gf of 4 years is uncomfortable with my best friend (let’s call her k)of 2 years. What to do?

I have a best friend who I met during an internship I did. She is an introvert and we got connected through similar interest. I did tell my gf about it and she was happy I made a new friend. K always respected my relationship and never crossed boundaries. But the director of the internship program accused her for being lazy and me and my other colleague defended k. Since then the director started giving me a lot of trouble, so k completed her internship in 4 months and I did that 5 months. So i did tell everything to my gf and she thinks k is responsible for me to mess up the internship ( we couldn’t start the project because there was a license issue), k was not responsible,it was the director. 
So my gf is not comfortable around her.  I recently moved to a different country where k is doing her masters. In the initial weeks k helped me to sort out things and I did tell my gf about it. Gf didn’t say anything at that time but today gf told me that she’s still uncomfortable with k. 
I asked her if she need me to cut contact with k, but she’s a nice friend and as I said earlier she never crossed any boundaries and always supported me the way she could. I love my gf, I don’t know if i am making a bad judgement. I don’t want to force gf to have a friendship with k but the atmosphere is a bit tensed.

Especially during special events or holidays he shuts down, treats the family poorly, almost acts like a toddler. (Last Christmas he slept on the floor in the mudroom and left the next morning without contacting me for 4 months because I made a joke about Baby Jesus) I understand that he has severe unaddressed mental health issues, so I try to be as accommodating as possible and to include him in things. My family basically only consists of my dad and my sister(f26).
My wedding is in 9ish months and I started collecting names/addresses for invitations.
Today my dad texted me:
*”Are you considering “Joe” as a guest or as ""Dad and one other?""*
“Joe” has severe cerebral palsy and is also older now so he is confined to a wheelchair. Due to his condition he can no longer walk, and has never been able to speak. With age he is also losing more and more motor skills.
As a child my dad would always convince me to be polite and accept hugs and kisses from “Joe” even though it made me uncomfortable.
My wedding reception unfortunately is not wheelchair accessible, as it is taking place on a farm - there is a very long dirt road you have to walk up. It also does not have big enough restrooms in the barn to facilitate someone in a wheelchair.
I was initially upset because I never even gave my dad a plus one option, as the people he hangs around are sometimes questionable characters and I don’t want complete strangers at my wedding.
I told my dad:
*”The reception is not wheelchair friendly, but he's welcome to the wedding but logistically it won't work at the reception”*
I don’t really want him there *at all* but I wanted to compromise because my dad offered me $1500 to help with the weeding as my fiancé and I are paying for it all by ourselves - mostly everything “nice” my family does is conditional.
My dad replied:
*”He would die if he couldn't be there for everything. He loves you. I'll look after him.”*
At this point my jaw hits the floor because, like, what the fuck. I’m always doing damage control for my family, like I have to tell my dad not to wear crocs to my wedding…
I replied: 
*“I said no, I’m sorry.”*
He said:
*” Him and I will find something to do after the ceremony. That frees up 2 spots for your reception.”*
I cried for a bit because honestly I’m busy and emotional and I cannot deal with the guilt trip, and this is what I replied later on: 
*”You have to understand that I take full liability (legally and financially) for anything that happens during the wedding and reception.
“Joe’s” well-being would be in jeopardy as there are no ramps, no suitable sized washrooms, no proper flooring. This goes for someone with a disability or a broken leg it doesn’t matter.
Secondly, “Joe” has some personal space issues that I am not comfortable with, I do not wish to be kissed or touched by him and this behaviour should not be considered funny or encouraged.
I have already spent a lot of money on this wedding (MY wedding) and have had to make decisions that maybe not everyone will like - hopefully they can have what they want at their own weddings.
So if your attendance and help, monetary or otherwise is conditional then that’s your decision, and a very unfortunate one if you continue to try to make me feel guilty for not inviting your friend to my wedding.”

I don’t know what to do other than that but looks like I’m out the donation from my dad and he’ll give me the silent treatment for about 2 months until he makes a depressing phone call on Boxing Day or something.

I don’t really know what else to do at this point so any advice will be appreciated.

She came to Germany due to her business trip and i went to her country we met continuously and we have had sex every time plus we enjoyed each and every second specially me. i bought her presents, and once flowers and always bought something for her which she likes.

Once she mentioned her therapist told her she needs a good sex, and she thanked me multiple times, things went quite far and i become very attached to her as she was sharing each and everything with me, calling me, and wanted to talk almost everyday even i was busy but i gave her all my availability and time. i thought she loved me as she was always interested to meet me as we stayed quite far but she always wanted me to take the first step, i took paid and unpaid leaves from my work just to meet her and spent time with her.

while i assumed she loves me, but it was more like FWB thing for her which i got to know after some months. she sometimes said you are good friend etc. but everytime we went on a date, i paid for the restraunt, grocery and even whenever she bought for herself i paid for it, i don;t know probably my stupidity.

I got signs of being used sometimes but i ignored them as i loved her, eg: she asked me to book a theme park which she likes and wanted me to pay for her, until i asked should i sponsor ur ticket too, she said no no i can pay for u too as u are a good friend, and i told her no thanks we can split it.

things became worst when we met on a date 2 months ago, when we went on a restraunt and i paid there after we ate, and went a bit fast to the door, while i saw she is still sitting and i went back, which made her feel angry and mad at me, i felt sad as she misunderstood and i told her i came back for u as i didn't notice, she was a bit rude u went fast and bla bla, my fight language is just to stay silent so i don't say something wrong which might hurt her. she bought something afterwards from a store for me and i had my flight and she had a train to her city, i decided not to go with her and made a excuse on which she said f\*\*k you which made feel sad and because of what happened in restraunt and her words, and i decided to leave the appartment and she started to cry and appoligized and said she says it as a joke to her friends and they dont mind  while i cried for the issue of restraunt and also her words(probably it was my childish part) but it hurted me.

She used to text me almost everyday  but after that  she stopped to contact and was contact every 2 3 day. It made me feel anxious if something is wrong after a lot of struggles I asked what she feels for me yesterday and she responded you are a nice person and no one treated me like this u treated me like ur gf maybe in future I might get same feelings like but then she said she don’t want to give me any hope. and i deserve someone nice.

It made me feel heartbroken. I don’t know why I love her. Even after this my mind is not ready to cut off. What I should do here? I don’t know why I care so much for someone for whom I am more like a option. she sees my messages sometimes and replies after 2-3 hours which was not the case before.

I don’t know why I am holding on to her but I would be grateful if someone can advice me something It’s my first relationship and which never even existed :( and i can't even focus on my job nor my studies, i am checking her insta and fb almost everyday and thinking about her and these thoughts are making me feel dipressed, i can't even have a therapy as its very hard to find it in germany if we don't speak german :( I would be grateful for your kind advice and suggesion. as i live alone her while parents live far away from me nor i can share it with my friends.

We had been married then 5 years, I am 35M now and this is a throw away account obviously. This meant a lot of nights out, drinking heavily and just about half the men in her employer coming around to ""give her advice,"" which meant to many of them trying to talk her into bed and several succeeded to some extent (not full bedroom activities but things well over the line and one indirect boss taking advantage on a retreat). 

Half of her colleagues is an exaggeration but it felt that way at the time. But one colleague was physically involved with her after a happy hour as a group function from work, oral sex for him basically, and one supervisor showered with her nude (I know showered nude sounds weird to say but she was nude, he was not and kept trunks on in a pool shower after a swim at a hotel on a retreat, him thinking his suit on made it okay but getting hands on her, which I had known but nothing further with that man). Other men treating her like something fun for the group of them at the office, which bothered me most of all because they knew her home life situation and still tried to treat it as fun and worse, some caring people there.

We got past the situation when she got better as time passed, she saw a counselor and also she made new friends in a new town. I saw a CBT counselor for my resulting anxiety but never got to talk about much since those guys don't do much more than tell you how to do CBT and mindfulness, but it helped me some and our marriage survived what was a pretty awful period. She did a lot to be a great wife over the years since.

In our new town we had a new friend group. It turns out now that once she felt better about what all went on and felt secure about us, she told her friends (the female halves of these couples we made friends with) a lot of what happened. This was back then, but it turns out they have known all this for some time. I'm also bothered that they in most cases told their husbands so that I feel doubly betrayed, her telling and also them knowing and not telling me. I feel like at least one of the husbands also did some feeling out of whether she was still up to cheat at that point, though that couple has since moved away. Basically ""jokes"" about her past that were I feel meant to see if she was still like that but that is my interpretation.

I'm also not happy that the wives knew so much about what she did, and supported her and said it wasn't that big of a deal, lot's of people go through that, her situation was to blame not her, etc. I found this out recently from her probably best friend from our friend group, who had assumed that I knew that they knew and thought I was brave to not be embarrassed and also that we stayed together, essentially, but also somewhat jokey about it because she thought I had known and that time had passed so I was over it too. But it seems ""new"" to me and embarrassing both due to details being shared and it somehow being sold as a thing we're past. I am much better but feel like it should have been kept private even with this group of people who are otherwise great except the one who has moved away since.

Is this a thing to bring up this much later, given we're otherwise very good now and have been for a long time now? How to approach this if I do bring it up and do I speak with them or just her?

A few months ago his mother decided that she no longer wants him to speak to me.

A couple dates later I invited her with our coworkers for a night out, and she declined, so I invited over a tinder match that I wanted to meet. An hour before we were suposed to leave, she asks if she can come with us, and I didn't have the heart to tell her not to come, since I sincerely preffered her over the tinder date, but it was too late to cancel the date with the Tinder girl. 

What I did is that I knew that my current GF didn't want our coworkers to know that we were dating, and If I didn't make any moves with the girl from Tinder nothing would happen. And so be it, nothing happened, everything went well. Outside of it, neither of us had other sexual partners because being 100% sincere we slept together almost everynight, being alone only like 3 or 4 nights out of a full month.

A month passes by and we decide to formally date and be exclusive, one weekend we're chilling and she starts asking questions about previous relationships, and asks me if I ever met one of his previous dates, would I like to know them or know they dated, I said no and asked her if she wanted to, she said yes and I openly told her that she already knew someone, I explained to her what happened that night and she was livid, she couldn't believe that I would do something like that. 

She explains to me why she felt betrayed and that she can't trust me anymore, I agree, that I should've told her at least before we left, and I openly apologized, I told her that one of the main pillars in a relationship is trust, and if she believes that she can't trust me anymore, that I would be okay with it ending our relationship. She agreed to end the relationship, we thanked each other, and I took my stuff and left her house.

An hour later I had over 10 texts and missing calls from her, asking me to come back to talk, I came back, and she basically said that she's sorry, that she's willing to keep the relationship but we had to be 100% transparent, and I agreed, so I told her the full story, from where I met her, why I choose to invite her, and we made an agreement that we would be 100% transparent about everything that involves us, between other things. I have not lied to her regarding anything else, and I've been transparent an open about everything. She openly told me that she has a lot of anxiety seeing me on my phone, but she doesn't want to be the type of person that asks for my password or constantly checks my phone, and it's something that we've working through. 

We had some issues, but overall it went well afterwards, until 3 weeks ago, where she was already pretty pissed at a situation that happened at work, and started asking stuff about that night and tinder date, I was pretty overwhelmed and I was replying being completely careless (since well, as I said, I have nothing to hide), and she asked where I met this person, I told her tinder, and she asked me that why I am telling her this information now, why bother hiding it months ago to avoid a problem to just bring it out months later and have a problem now.  I was sincerely disconected and replied ""Yeah, I guess"", she got mad and stopped talking to me for the rest of the day. 

The following day after work I sat down to talk with her, I apologized for saying that I wanted trouble now, that when I did that back then I didn't see it as an issue, and she basically jumped back and said that she wasn't mad about that, that she was mad that I lied again, because according to her I never told her that that date was a tinder date, that she thought she was a friend from my hometown. I was pretty confident that I already told her that back then, but it's not a matter if I did or not, the problem is that she can't trust me again. 

Now we are stuck in a point where she doesn't want to open up with me because she can't trust me, I moved back to my house, we've stopped having intercourse and she's lashing out at small things or small coments, I've always felt like she hasn't let go of that situation from the start and even though I think that I've apologized hundreds of time both through words and actions. 

I've talked with her and told her that everytime she feels like that, she should tell me, so I can give her enough information or show her what I'm doing so her anxiety slowly goes away, but she doesn't want to since she doesn't want to be ""that person"" that is insecure about herself, that she wants to be a strong, confident women and hates the way she's feeling with me, even bringing up twice the idea to break up, just to back away from it seconds later.

We're both still here because we know our relationship is worth the issues, but being in a relationship where my partner is constantly lashing out at me for comments out of context due to high work-related stress and the insecurities is starting to become tiring. I've already spoke to her about it and she managed to calm down and be less agressive, but it feels like we are stuck and aren't able to move on  and I feel like we have no tools to work with.

I know trust isn't something that you earn overnight and it's incredibly difficult to rebuild, and we're both willing to work towards it.

I (27M) have been with my now wife (25F) for 7 years, shortly after getting married I found messages with her flirting with a male from her work nothing hardcore but things like if your wife wasn’t around I would be first in line/ I know how to get you going and you know me ;).
I was emotional and confronted her before getting any other information she denied anything going on but stated that I hadn’t been showing her the attitude she wanted from her partner and was unhappy for some time and even went as far as to go on dog walks for hours on end with this male as she did not want to be at home with me.
Since then I have been to therapy to better myself and to deal with finding those messages, since then she has shut off completely not acting like we are a couple and more like roommates and has even gone as far as telling me to go and date other people and that I will never be as good in any way as the male she was flirting with.
She still talks to this male almost daily and even makes off jokes about him even though I’ve asked her to stop.
I’m not sure what to do at this point I keep trying to get the spark back in our relationship but it feels like she doesn’t want that anymore I can’t believe I am asking this but what advice would you all give me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7549889,public,self,Is the relationship salvageable,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvf4o1/is_the_relationship_salvageable/,all_ads,6,

I never saw myself posting here, but there’s a first time for everything. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 months and she has been taking birth control the entire time. This month her period was late, 2 positive tests later she went to the doctor and no surprise she is pregnant. It’s estimated she is very early in her pregnancy, probably 2 weeks or so. 

We are both very good with communication as soon as possible. We have even talked about this situation before we were ever intimate, and the steps we would take in the event that she would become pregnant. I think at this point it’s important to add that we are both very pro-choice, and I fully support her in her decision to terminate the pregnancy at this time. We agreed to this well in advance as she doesn’t want to have children. I am okay with not ever having children.

The reason I am posting here is that I am (unexpectedly) facing the fact that in this moment we could have had a child together, and I was kind of happy to see the test come back positive. I wasn’t worried since we are both well off and could easily have started a family together. She is the love of my life. We have only been dating for four months, but I’ve known her for years and I fully intend to marry this beautiful woman; she is my person. 

Our plan was to always make this one decision, so we have. I would never try to convince her otherwise, and I haven’t. I told her it is always her choice and I will support whatever that choice is. I’m sure these feelings I have will pass, but I think I want to be a father some day. 

Do I tell her that this experience has given me some perspective of what I thought I wanted wasn’t what I expected? Do I even bring it up? I know she’s going through an extremely stressful time and my main focus is to make sure she’s safe and supported right now. I hesitate to throw that of course. The “what if” aspect of things is bothering me, and it’s giving me sort of an existential crisis about whether or not I can be happy child free. 

At the end of the day I want her to be safe and happy. How do I express my feelings without making her feel uncomfortable? How do I let her know I unconditional support her decision and don’t regret this, but may not want to be child free in the future in a tactful way?
