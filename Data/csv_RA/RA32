We  live in different countries and  have been in an LDR for almost 2 years and have some plans to  live together in the coming year or two, but in the meantime we make do with the video calls and meeting each other every few months for a month or so.  
As i said, lately she has been hanging out more with this guy friend during the day, and ofc she can hang out with whoever she wants so i thought nothing of it.  
two or three weeks ago she went drinking with  a few friends and that guy was one of them, and she  announces that he's staying over cuz he lost his last train to his city and is too drunk to look for a hotel.

  
I got uncomfortable right away, lightly voiced how it made me uncomfortable but didn't make too much of a fuss because it seemed like exceptional circumstances. I felt stressed the whole day but again, didn't make a big deal out of it besides being  maybe  more quiet during the day.  
it is also worth noting that her house is very small and she has no couch, so they slept in the same room, she sent me a pic of how he slept in a different mattress so as to not sleep in the same bed. That doesn't make me feel any safer at all cuz the mattress is barely 50 cm away from her.  
I assumed it was a one time exceptional thing and didn't think about it more  


This part gets tricky so bare with me. Basically we are in some Discord servers together but since there's a bunch of servers i almost never talk in, she probably forgot i'm in them.

So barely a week after he stayed at her place, the guy says on one discord server that  it's pouring rain  and is having a hard time making it home. he said that to no one in general, was just a vent it seemed. Not even 5 mins later my gf replies to him saying he should stay over cuz the rain might not stop. He was indeed in her city but he wasn't even close to her house and she just offers that unprompted. That really weirded me out. anyway according to the discord convo  the rain stopped and he ended up making it home,  (other members of the server teased them about my gf offering the dude to stay over, and she didn't even defend herself or mention she had a boyfriend) either way i didn't mention to her that i was kinda ""eavesdropping""  and just let it go , again  


and that leads us to yesterday. my gf went to lunch with this dude and he left. so far so good. then later that night  my gf tells me the dude is staying over again and i ask for the reasoning since she didn't go out drinking this time. She says he is IN  A DIFFERENT CITY , he rode his bike there but now it's too late to make it home with or without bike, and that it's cutting it close but he can probably make it to at least her city before the last trains. ???  Sounds extremely convoluted to me. I cannot hide my frustrations with her about this  but manage to not freak out and just tell her that i am really not comfortable with this especially cuz it's not a one time exceptional thing anymore, but i also can't tell her what to do so it's up to her.  


I went to sleep with a knot in my stomach and a headache, hoping i'd feel better the next day. Nope, i still feel awful and confused and disrespected. I voiced my concerns through text  (maybe not as calmly as i should have , i admit) and she just got defensive and said that they're just friends and that she should let her friends sleep over any time she wants, and then did something that i feel like it's  a low blow, she compared me to my parents and said i was toxic and controlling like them ( my parents are narcissistic to a t and have been toxic to each other for decades, me and my gf are absolute saints compared to them)

I dunno where to go from here. I really don't want to let this ruin the relationship but if this continues and she  does it progressively without caring for my feelings, i don't think i can keep this  going. And no nothing like this ever happened in the years we've been together, she hasn't had guys or girls over ever. Me neither, i would never even think to have someone over out of respect.

I (23F) live in an appartement building on the middle floor, so there's someone under and above me. I don't really mind the noise, I just tune it out, but about maybe a year ago , the couple living below me had a baby. Now, I think it's common knowledge that babies are loud: they cry, they scream and the parents can't do much about it. I just kinda deal with it. However, my boyfriend (24M) isn't quite as accepting.

We've been together for about 10 months and he comes over to my place most nights (even though he has an appartement on his own and I have two roommates). I can only assume that the baby's room is under mine because we can hear him (her? Idk) cry very clearly and we hear his parents talk and sing lullabies to calm him down. It's annoying but it is what it is. For some reason, my BF goes COMPLETELY nuts about it. 

Every day, he goes on about how he hopes the baby will FINALLY shut up, and how rude it is that the baby cries, and how he can't believe that the parents allow him to make noise like that... He ignores me when I try to tell him that it's just a baby and that the parents are doing what they can. I mean, I'm sure they're a lot more annoyed than we are! Then, at night, if he's woken up by the baby crying (which happens almost every night), he'll wake ME up and start complaning about it.  I've also told him many times to get earplugs or, if it annoys him so much, we can stay at his appartement sometimes, but he always says that he ""doesn't want to give in"", whatever that means.

Things kind of exploded last night when he, once again, woke me up in the middle of the night and shouted that he couldn't stand this anymore. He was REALLY angry, I've honestly never seen him like this, he kept saying that I had to deal with this and that he couldn't live like this. I told him to please calm down, and he screamed that I had to go shut up the baby. I said that I didn't know what to do, it wouldn't change anything to bother the parents, and he stopped pacing, looked at me and just said that I obviously cared more about a random child than I did about him. I tried to tell him that no, I love him and want him to be happy, but he just grabbed his clothes and left, banging every door on his way out. I tried texting and calling him, but he doesn't answer me. 

I just don't know what to do. I love him so much, but I feel like he's going overboard, it's a baby! Should I go talk to the parents? I feel like that wouldn't help, but maybe it would calm him down? How do I talk to him about it? I just really need advice on how to deal with all of this, please help me.

Apparently she sent him a letter about 6 months ago because she finally found out who he was, as he and my sister’s mom (deceased) opted to give my sister up for adoption when she was born. I don’t have much context as I’m trying to respect my dad’s process, but all I know so far is that my dad and his college sweetheart had a kid they weren’t ready for all those years ago.

My dad knew about my sister this whole time. My mom found out 6 months ago when my sister sent my dad the letter. So that’s a slight point of contention, but it isn’t necessarily my business (yet), so I’ve decided to take a backseat and wait until my dad is ready to talk about all of this. 

I don’t feel excited, upset, or anything really - but I have been thinking about it constantly. I’m just curious, has this happened to anyone else? My parents had me much later in life (mom was 41, dad was 51) so I’ve always wondered if there’s a possibility I have siblings, but now that it’s confirmed I do have a sister (who is 30 years my senior…) I’m not entirely sure how to go about processing the news.

To preface: at the beginning of this year I was a stay at home mom, and he was the main bread winner. We moved in with my mom in October last year as we couldn’t afford our place anymore and have been living with her and our toddler in one room. He was mainly paying our car note, insurance, phone and other expenses for our kid( I rarely asked for money for myself). Around February after finally getting our toddler into daycare, finding out I was pregnant and not being able to find a job for myself, I decided to enroll in a coding boot camp. I had no way of getting monetary support from my family so he did the kindest thing and agreed to pay the $1000 deposit and $2500/month fee for the 3 month boot camp (payments would continue for 3 more months after completion). After paying the deposit, I found other means such as my tax refund and etc to pay the rest myself. He’s also helped my mom with a $1500 cash gift to help around the house. 

Now fast forward to now in November, I gave birth to our daughter in September after a very difficult pregnancy and traumatic birth process. I had found a job after graduating the boot camp and am currently on paid maternity leave until January. In order to keep things fair and give him a break, we agreed that I would take over all of the bills for the rest of the year to make things even and I am more than okay with that. 

Here lies the problem: I don’t believe our responsibilities in this partnership are evenly distributed. I am staying home while he works, but I do 90% of childcare in my eyes while occasionally cooking and cleaning and dishes and etc. I told him last night that I don’t believe he puts in enough effort to help me with our children and taking care of our household. During the week our oldest (2F) goes to daycare (I wake up at 7am, get her ready, feed her, pack lunch and drive her to daycare all while running on 4-5 hours of sleep if im lucky because of our newborn). Their dad stays with the baby while I drop our oldest off. when I come back from dropping her off, im back on baby duty until 4pm where either I go pick her up (with baby in tow) or he does and sometimes he will stay with her for an hour or two to play and spend some time with her while I do whatever I need to get done or attempt to get some rest if the baby is sleeping. After that he leaves again for work and I spend the rest of the night with the two kids handling dinner, bath time, play and bedtime as he usually gets home late. On The Weeknd’s I am the one who wakes up with both of them still and takes are of both kids during the day. It has always been this way.

The way I see it, this past week has been really tough on me and I’ve been experiencing really bad migraines (which I have told him over and over) and I find myself having a shorter fuse with the kids which makes me feel like shit. So I told him I need him to do more because even though I am staying home, I still contribute financially  and  I am in distress and need help. His response was that he feels he has been doing more lately and feels like I am downplaying the things he does. I told him that knowing im not feeling well he should’ve put in more effort and I need more from him than just taking our oldest for a couple of hours when I ask because I am still left with our baby which doesn’t count as a break. I’ve told him that our division of responsibilities is clearly uneven because he gets to leave whenever he needs alone anytime  and do what he wants when I have to basically ask him for permission to leave the house.

An example I used for our conversation was a couple weeks ago I planned to go out with my friend (first time out without the kids in years). And I had to tell him weekS in advance so he could plan ahead to watch the kids for the night. Granted he did and im grateful but my mom was home watched our eldest most of the night before leaving for a night shift and I came home an hour and a half after she left. So really he didn’t have to do much child rearing at all. 

Another example is before this night out, that I had him watch our baby in the morning while I dropped our oldest to daycare and went to a hair appointment in the next town 15 minutes away. I was 1 hour into the appointment and he called me multiple times stressed as the baby wouldn’t stop crying and I had to make my stylist rush so that I could get home. 

His response to all this again, was to get defensive and say that I was once again downplaying him and being dramatic again because he did in fact watch the children regardless of what I say and he did it in efforts to let me have some alone time and that in his defense he didn’t even call me during the night while I was out. He says that he has his own stressors such as his family (he is the eldest and basically the father figure for his 4 younger siblings, two of which he is very much supporting financially), work and other things. He says that by saying these things I negate all the thanks and appreciation I’ve given him in the past and forget how he supported me through the first half of this year. Again I tell him that wasn’t my intention and that I’m glad he cares so much for his family and am grateful that he took care of us financially, but as of right now I need help and he’s ignoring that and being a jerk when all im asking is that he help me actually parent our children instead of expecting me to ask him to babysit one of them or making me feel like he’s doing me a favor every time I need a break. I told him I feel like I have to act and think like a single mom when I’m supposed to be able to lean on him as a partner. He said he is doing more and would do even more to help once I start back working in January. 

The conversation went on and on with neither side feeling heard so I said okay whatever goodnight roomie, since that’s what he was making me feel like anyways. He said that was an ugly thing to say and that he would have his things packed if that’s really how little I think of him. I told him it was sad that he feels that way and we went back and forth for even longer. I ended the conversation by saying all I wanted was for him to say he would take them  both off my shoulders for one day a week so I could really relax, not tell me “maybe when you start working again” or I’m “downplaying” his efforts as a dad, and I guess I fucked myself by having that expectation. I said that I will now work on self regulation so as to not subject him to my dramatizations anymore. His reply was “Expectations don’t make sense without proper communication”.


I don’t even know how to feel anymore. Am I  downplaying him? Am I asking too much of him? I just feel so overwhelmed and alone and In his perspective he’s also overwhelmed and feels like he’s doing his to help me more. Any thoughts?

so i have a close friend i made in college. shes really sweet and kind we we met on a very good start. 

i threw a party on friday halloween at my place and invited everyone. bought food drinks etc

we all were drunk happy and having a good time.

a lot of videos were posted mainly of us having a good time and dancing and being funny.


i entered my kitchen and her and another guy friend were dancing sooo funny! they were just hoping and waving their hands up in the air. 
 the girl jumps from one spot to another and yells my guy friends name and looks super fun and drunk and smiles. 

i post all the videos to the groupchat.

i also posted that video on my private friends story as it was so funny and i didnt see any harm. 

apperently they were both annoyed but i talked with the guy and he goes “ya it was funny but we were also drunk and maybe its a violation but i dont care much its whatever she did seem very bothered” the guy later said he didnt care and we hang out and we’re fine

i addressed it to her and she said it was fine. a week later she asks me to delete it from the group chat as well. i do and apologized. she told me she did tell me to remove but i didnt listen. i quickly hugged her and apologized.

Its november 19 and well she has asked me to be her partner for some class that i am struggling with tremendously and shes very good at because she has prior classes beforehand.

we were assigned with 3 assignments. we had to pick her apartment as a study (we are architecture master students) she mesures her apartment with help of some guy. the guy helps and she finishes hw 1.

i have my exes past examples so that will help us a lot.

hw2 she did it alone after i attempted and failed bc i don’t understand the class well.

she shared me the info on thursday and missed a deadline for another class


i kept asking if she needed help and she says she would do it


anyway today i come to find out shes still pissed at me bc of that video. and it will bother her for a while and bothered at the fact that i didnt help her in some assignments as shes stressed and tired.

she keeps saying shes got it so i thought she got it snd since some  guy was helping her i didnt see the need lol",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7591920,public,self,i posted a video to the public am i violating her…,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzmpds/i_posted_a_video_to_the_public_am_i_violating_her/,all_ads,6,,

We have three children (10, 7, &amp; 4 years old). I am an animal lover and have absolutely no objection to pets - we already have 6 indoor pets (3 dogs, 3 cats). We went YEARS with only 1 dog and 1 cat. In 2020, we got a chocolate lab - she's been the absolutely best dog I've ever had. That brought our count to 2 dogs, 1 cat. Totally fine.

At the beginning of this year, after randomly walking through PetSmart, my wife and kids found another foster cat...3 days later we adopted her (I was outnumbered). This past Spring, we started fostering dogs for a local nonprofit rescue group by my wife's insistence (I wasn't asked about this...we fostered two dogs immediately and I was never asked for input). We ended up adopting one of the two first foster dogs (I was outnumbered in this decision again). 

Fastforward to this past September, my wife got a wild idea to give our daughter a kitten for her 7th birthday. Again, I got pressured, guilted, and outnumbered on this...the day after my wife found the kitten, we adopted her. In case you lost count. That's +3 F\*CKING ANIMALS to our family since January with a constant rotation of foster dogs (sometimes 2 at a time) added to the mix. Common thread here is she's impulsive and persistent.

Some even further back story : We have had some very bad marital issues the last two years following her second round of infidelity in November 2020-January 2021. As a quick summary: we separated and she moved out (her choice), I tried moving on after she went hog wild when moving out, she caught wind of me talking to someone else and as a result, she basically moved herself back into the home, we agreed to work on things through counseling, but she became very abusive. In addition to our marriage counseling, we both started individual therapy where it was identified that my wife has been mildly emotionally, mentally and verbally abusive our entire relationship but, due to a lack of experience in other relationships, I had no idea we were so dysfunctional and I'm embarrassed to admit - I didn't recognize her behavior as abusive, as I had nothing to compare it to. It was also identified that my wife has a personality disorder and CPTSD. We ultimately got dropped from our marriage counselors due to her resistance to their counseling, and things death spiraled up until I moved out this past August. I have since moved back into the family house and her abusive behavior has throttled back to pre 2020's affair.

Here is the meat of my question: My wife has said the dog fostering is a part of her ""therapy"" in that it brings her happiness and makes her feel like she's doing some good for others. I don't mind supporting her with it for that reason. To be honest, I do 85% of the feeding, taking out to use the bathroom, and cleaning up the messes from these animals. It's f\*cking stressful on top of having 3 small children. But, whatever...

She's NOW wanting to adopt ANOTHER DOG that we just fostered (bringing our total to 4 dogs, 3 cats) and wants to continue fostering more dogs. She has brought it up multiple times over the last two days despite knowing my resistance to it. While at work today, she has texted about it. I told her I would prefer to have a conversation in-person rather than by text. Hours later, she texts asking about it again and openly confirmed she was trying to circumvent the conversation.

Ex Boyfriend - Max

Child - Sarah

Ive been in a relationship with this girl for a year and its been really great. but i've noticed her roommate (that is married but is also her ex boyfriend) has been acting more than odd recently. He lives with my girlfriend and his wife. but he often hangs out a lot more with Hazel than his wife and his wife complains about it a lot. I know for a fact they aren't doing anything ""dirty"" and she has 0 feelings for him since she now sexually identifies as lesbian. the only reason they live together is because they have had a kid in the past. which he knocked her up and cheated on her after. leaving her with a kid. props to him for coming back into Sarahs life. It is hard for me to deal with them living with each other but it also forms my patience and trust with her a lot. and for some odd reason i see him and his wife as parent figures since mine unfortunately passed away in my younger years.
but tonight. things got weird.
I text Max because we are friends and i start off with a nice greeting and we start talking and yaddayadda. Since i know Hazel is in the same room as him and watching tv i ask where she is, and he ultimately responds with ""i'm deep dicking her"" which actually infuriates the living fuck out of me! and i told him off and said how about i talk about your girl like that! how would that make you feel?? then he proceeds to send a picture of her back somehow and i just.. snap.. and i never do that. then he says ""were not actually fucking. i just took a picture of her back."" ill also go ahead put in what my response was to him. it was in the moment and i feel i shouldn't have snapped that much.
""FUCK OFF, LITERALLY HOW WOULD YOU FEEL WITH MY HANDS ALL OVER YOUR FUCKING WIFE MAX?? ITS SO DISRESPECTFUL! THEN SENDING PICTURES LIKE THAT TO ME?? ITS SO FUCKING TRAUMATIZING TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT."" (he knows i have severe ptsd and some of it is from past relationships cheating on me)

Then he proceeds to call it a ""prank""
and i tell him ""no?? you don't fucking do that!""
and he says 
""Well sorry bro, it's a joke not a dick, don't take it so hard!""
Then I say
""im sorry i snapped but i just did NOT like that and i have boundaries that ive already pushed past and beyond my limits just to make everyones life easier and avoid controversy"" 

It stopped there. I proceed to text Hazel about this and shes confused and says that he took her phone and is intoxicated.
She says
""I mean yea i think it was shitty. Im not entirely sober and he’s not either. Im sorry""
I ask if shes coming over tomorrow and she says ""sure if you don't hate me""
i say ""i don't hate you i just feel like he should be a decent human fucking being and not say shit like that.""

Thats where it ended. but i just want everyones thoughts on this whole ordeal. sorry its long but it is an important situation for me to talk about. 

please be nice in the comments.

He was having a lot of fun and so was I. He dropped me home like a gentleman, and that was that.

Before this date he had been messaging me barely throughout the day, I did a stupid thing I checked his snap score which was going up while he wasn’t answering me. I didn’t want to give into my overthinking and so I pushed those feelings away. And went on the date. I had even asked him if he was still interested the answer was yes. Now it’s the next day after the date and the same thing is happening again he’s replying super slow and we have barely talked today. I’m just so confused because one minute he’s messaging me a lot and he seems so into me and then the next minute he’s super short and drive with his messages and doesn’t seem interested at all. When he’s doing that it makes me feel upset, because one second I’m thinking this guy is really into me and the next I feel like I don’t even matter to him. 

Nothing is official yet so a part of me feels like I don’t have the right to question what he’s doing, but the other part of me feeling like he should at least respect me enough to tell me he’s busy or doing something before going ghost. He always tells me before I even ask he isn’t busy at all and he’s just at home, and so that also confuses me. I normally don’t stick around if someone’s giving me mixed signals but I really like this guy.

there's this girl in my high school. I've been kind of keeping an eye on her for a couple of months, but only so recently I found a common friend to introduce us. Let's say me and her know each other for 2 weeks now.

If I initiate a contact, like a simple conversation on the school corridor, she usually looks interested and happy with that. But it's only then XD.   
If I text her, the conversation dries out really quickly and I don't want to keep it going when I can clearly see she's not into it.   
Unless I'm the one to initiate a contact - dead silence. She'd never came into my class or texted me first.

A few days ago I was like fuck it, let's see, and asked her to grab a coffee. She agreed and we had a great time actually! But since then one big nothing because I decided not to text her first again and again.

I know for a fact that she's been busy and running on like 5 hours of sleep pretty much for the whole time we know each other, but well, something tells me if she was interested she'd show it.

So then, what do you guys think I should do? Just stop talking to her and move on?

so i have a close friend i made in college. shes really sweet and kind we we met on a very good start. 

i threw a party on friday halloween at my place and invited everyone. bought food drinks etc

we all were drunk happy and having a good time.

a lot of videos were posted mainly of us having a good time and dancing and being funny.


i entered my kitchen and her and another guy friend were dancing sooo funny! they were just hoping and waving their hands up in the air. 
 the girl jumps from one spot to another and yells my guy friends name and looks super fun and drunk and smiles. 

i post all the videos to the groupchat.

i also posted that video on my private friends story as it was so funny and i didnt see any harm. 

apperently they were both annoyed but i talked with the guy and he goes “ya it was funny but we were also drunk and maybe its a violation but i dont care much its whatever she did seem very bothered” the guy later said he didnt care and we hang out and we’re fine

i addressed it to her and she said it was fine. a week later she asks me to delete it from the group chat as well. i do and apologized. she told me she did tell me to remove but i didnt listen. i quickly hugged her and apologized.

Its november 19 and well she has asked me to be her partner for some class that i am struggling with tremendously and shes very good at because she has prior classes beforehand.

we were assigned with 3 assignments. we had to pick her apartment as a study (we are architecture master students) she mesures her apartment with help of some guy. the guy helps and she finishes hw 1.

i have my exes past examples so that will help us a lot.

hw2 she did it alone after i attempted and failed bc i don’t understand the class well.

she shared me the info on thursday and missed a deadline for another class


i kept asking if she needed help and she says she would do it


anyway today i come to find out shes still pissed at me bc of that video. and it will bother her for a while and bothered at the fact that i didnt help her in some assignments as shes stressed and tired.

My therapist went off on me for saying I didn’t want male attention and accused me of ageism for turning down an older man while I was in a relationship 

So I’ve been seeing the same therapist for over three years now, and beyond a few red flags in the past I’ve benefited greatly from our sessions.

One of the things that helped immensely was her compassion towards me when recounting past events that haunted me years after the fact with guilt. A huge part of our sessions was centered around SA that happened specifically from older men in my early adulthood, and she is the only person I’ve ever shared any of this with. 

One of the things we’ve discussed recently was me coming to terms with the fact that when I was 22, a 44-year-old I worked under at a job at the time attempted to rape me when I was drunk at a company party. I had feelings for him previously and had immense self-blame over what happened to me.

Im bringing all of this up because it feels relevant.

Yesterday during our normal session, I came in kind of laughing because a man in his fifties had given me his number about an hour beforehand. I laughed it off, said it was a very interesting way of being picked up. She asked me if I was going to text him. 

I was confused and answered that no, of course not, I’m in a relationship. She began to get agitated, which was something I noticed as I was walking into the room initially.

I told her that the owner of the cafe I worked at got really worked up over the situation and said it was inappropriate that someone that much older had asked me out, pointing out how much younger I look for my age.

I said “I wish men didn’t give me attention at work and just left me alone”

She went off. Went off on a rant about how I should feel “fortunate” that men hit on me, that I was being “ageist”, how I “had no idea” what his intentions were, and how “calling all older people disgusting” was ageist and proved that I had an irrational hatred of men.

She went on to go into a tangent about how she was 52 years old and my “constant talk” about “disgusting older people” was triggering for her and that my “sweeping generalizations about older people” was a personal insult to her.

She then brought up something during a previous session to make a snide remark about my character. It was awful.

I was completely shocked. This went on for twenty minutes until I finally said “maybe we should end this session”, she said “I agree”, and then told me she’d see me after the holidays.

I was so shocked I was shaking violently outside of the office. I drafted her an email afterwards telling her that I thought she was incredibly inappropriate and that we should end our sessions.

She responded in an email doubling down, insisting that she’d done nothing wrong and that we had a “completely different philosophy in how we viewed the world.

Before this we had been dating a little over a year. We've lived here around 4-5 months, we split the cost of everything and we help each other out when we can. My boyfriend seemingly has stress and anger issues, I've known this for a while but we moved together anyways because I came here for a high paying family job, and he didn't know what else to do with his life I think, along with being in a relationship with me and wanting to go with me. 

Almost a month before we moved, I broke up with him because I felt that we had a lot of differences. I'm a more calm person and he explodes kind of easily. We're both musicians, and I love music more as a hobby though I would take jobs with any band or orchestra if there ever came the opportunity because it's fun. For him, it's all he wants to do in his life, to be a successful musician. He puts so much pressure on himself that music is no longer fun for him. 

I've always been there for him when he's stressed or sad but it's never ending and he can never be optimistic, he often says he's sorry that he's a bummer to be around and I tell him that he's not a bummer, but sometimes I can't stand being around him because he huffs and sighs and he raises his voice, even though he knows that yelling really scares me but sometimes I can't blame him because he's just so angry or stressed out. 

He also never puts out sexually, and this has especially been bothering me the last few months because he's told me that he's no longer that interested in sex, he's not often in the mood but he'll always be down to receive oral  or a hand job. The amount of times I've put out orally severely outweighs how much he gives me oral, he's done it maybe 5 times this whole relationship. Even when I ask him to do it more, and I remind him that it sure would be nice to be on the receiving end more, he never does. 

He doesn't rub my back like I rub his, and if he does it never lasts longer than maybe 20 seconds, even if I ask for a massage or comfort. We rarely kiss. We used to have sex maybe 4 ttimes a week, now I'm lucky if it's twice a month. I ask him why he's not interested and he just shrugs every time. 

I feel it was a mistake moving with him sometimes. We're there for each other emotionally but physicality is a need for me and no matter what I say he won't be there for me in that way. I don't ever pressure him to, it's not like I get angry at him when he gives me a no, I understand and I would never force someone to be intimate with me, ever. I know what that's like.

What do I do? I can tell him a million times a day that I want more intimacy but I don't think he'll ever change even if he's said he would a few times.

When i got with him I knew he drank heavily (almost daily) and that he smoked 🍃 on the weekends. He doesn't consider neither of these things an addiction when they very clearly are however I didn't have a problem with this and still wanted to be with him regardless. 

That's until it started interfering with our relationship. We had to go long distance as he wanted to pursue a career opportunity a few hours away and since we are so early into our relationship we both agreed it was best to not be moving in with eachother just yet. He still comes to visit every couple weeks and I guess that's fine but it's often full with smoking and drinking to the point he becomes so out of touch with reality. I try and distract him by filling our days with fun dates and such but his ""smoke breaks"" have been imprinted in his brain and nothing could make him forget about it. 

When he isn't visiting we still try and keep our relationship interesting by playing videogames together or watching movies however even those are cut short or sometimes he forgets about them entirely and ends off ditching me to go drink with his friends, he always returns by sending me a message about how sorry he is and how his friends ""just showed up"" and how they ended up having a few drinks or whatever. He promises we'll talk the next day again and again but I've learned to just accept the fact he most likely won't end up talking with me. 

I've been begging him to watch a show with me for the longest time, I really enjoy it and hoped he would to. He finally gave in and agreed to watch the show so we call eachother and start watching but it quickly becomes clear he's extremely out of it, he kept needing to be reminded what was going on in the show and didn't say much the whole time other than a few giggles at the shows jokes. The whole night had felt ruined and I think that's when I started realizing just how bad his addictions were. I just feel so alone in this and don't know how to bring it up.

I not only want him to stop drinking for our relationships sake but for his health as well, I mean for crying out loud he got covid about a year ago before we were together and nearly died because of the condition of his lungs. I know addiction can often be a sensitive topic and I don't know how he'd feel about it.

TLDR: Relationship with gf has deteriorated since she spent the night at her ex's, might have lied to me about it and constant arguments have ensued, I'm starting to develop strong feelings for a close friend of mine.

First off, I'm aware this sounds awful and I sound like a pos but please hear me out. I(M23) have been dating my girlfriend(F23) for 2 years and it has been good for the most part, we've had ups and down like any relationship but around the 1-year and 6 months mark we had a massive fight about one of her best friends (M23). They dated in the past but broke it off, anyway she spent the night at his place which I wasn't aware was going to happen, she later told me they slept in the same bed. Obviously, I was upset, because I would never do the same thing, and this caused a fight that almost culminated in a break-up. (To give some context gf suffers from anxiety and BPD). She swore nothing happened between them that night and that I was the only one she loves since she doesn't feel anything for him anymore but I just couldn't believe it. She then called me saying that it was a mistake and that if she didn't have me, there was no point in living anymore since I was everything to her. I became extremely worried she would do something extreme so I forgave her and tried to forget about the whole incident by rationalizing that she wouldn't lie to me.

Everything returned to normal for a while but ever since small issues that shouldn't be a big deal turn into fights and arguments are now the norm when they used to be incredibly rare. She gets easily upset at me when I try to talk about our issues and reverts to saying that she would rather die than keep having fights. I have recently also realized that she has lied to me about multiple things in our relationship which has made me doubt about her telling me the truth about what happened that night with her ex.

I have known my friend(F23) for about 3 years but we became closer after I asked her for her point of view. I have always only seen her in a platonic way but recently I have found comfort in her words and advice. She treats me with extreme kindness and consideration, she is always giving me advice and looking out for me saying that I'm a kind person which at this point I was starting to doubt. She is always there for me when I'm feeling down and I can spend hours talking to her but it feels like minutes. I feel guilty and like a hypocrite, because I am starting to develop feelings for her.

Hi, I(f18) don’t have ADHD, but my partner(m18) does. We are currently on a break due to him being too overwhelmed with everything and just wants a break to calm himself down. We do not know when the break will end, but we still talk to each other everyday, just without lovey dovey couple stuff. 

The reason we started this break is because he feels overwhelmed from all of our arguments(which we definitely need to work on), and I feel that I’m not getting enough attention from him. I didn’t know that all of our feelings were caused by ADHD (ofc we can definitely make it better, but the negative cycle started because of the ADHD). I know that he loves me dearly and I love him with my entire life, and we still do see to be with each other for the rest of our life, so I want some suggestions as to how I can help him with his ADHD and our relationship in general.

She got back together with her ex a little over a year ago about 2 weeks after breaking up with her abusive ex. A lot has happened in the past 2 years and she hasn't had time to hang out like we used to. We used to hang out after she was done work, but then she did so many drugs the withdrawl caused an ED so she didn't want to see me for roughly 2 months, she only wanted her bf (which is fine). She changed her work schedule to work friday-tuesday at her minimum wage job to match her bf's schedule (I think he makes over $20 an hour). Her family moved about 30 minutes away from our hometown and I helped them move everything and then I moved about an hour from our hometown the next day for college. 

An ongoing battle with her is trying to make time to hang out without her bf because she constantly says she doesn't want to spend any time without him on her ""weekends"" with him and doesn't want to hang out after work. Whenever I bring up how frustrating it is that she has no time to hang out she says that she won't change her schedule or book days off to see me because she ""only"" gets 2 days a week with her bf (they basically live with her family full-time, rent-free) and she won't hang out after work because she just wants to sleep and make her bf dinner. She basically told me she won't have time to hang out until she and her bf move out together in hopefully less than a year's time, otherwise, she's moving out of state with her family. 

I guess I'm just frustrated that I cannot see her without her boyfriend, ever (I don't like him and vice-versa. He just kinda tolerates me) and she is unwilling to take any public transport to meet me anywhere (she doesn't drive, he drives her everywhere). Is this friendship worth it?

If it's relevant, we'd had a brief relationship previously which was also intense but great but after a month due to him getting cold feet and spiralling (various mental health issues including ptsd and anger issues - ex military) he ended it quite suddenly. I was gutted. We reconnected a few months later and things were going really, really well. 
I fell pregnant and we both agreed it wasn't sensible or even really viable for us to continue the pregnancy. 
I had a termination at home two weeks ago. He was with me for the whole thing, was an amazing support and stayed with me for a couple of days afterwards. It was physically and emotionally brutal. I knew it was the right thing to do but I was still emotionally distraught and physically found the whole thing really hard. 
He left two days after the termination and seems to have immediately spiralled. I had to go overseas for work a week later for a few days. I asked a couple of times before I left if he wanted to come over. The response was he was either busy with his side business or struggling and needed space. Both times I said that was absolutely fine and that i hoped he was looking after himself. 
He told me he was struggling and trying to process everything and became quite remote. He has some mental health issues that he's always been very open about and seeks therapy for. I really admire that about him, and tried to give him space and understanding. 
While I was on my work trip I was at a conference with a bunch of pregnant women. I was still bleeding the whole time. It was awful and really, really hard to try and behave normally. I spent a lot of time hiding in bathrooms crying. Truly awful. During that time we spoke every day but it was quite superficial. He spoke a little about the therapy he was having and how he was having a difficult time. I tried to be encouraging and supportive. He never asked me how I was once. 
At the airport on the way home I asked if he wanted to come over for dinner the following day. He replied he wanted to focus on his business. I just kind of snapped. I was restrained and respectful but I was pissed off. I told him I was disappointed he didn't want to see me or see how I was and we hadn't seen each other in over a week. I told him I had a friend coming over the following evening as I needed a shoulder to lean on after spending the last few days with a bunch of pregnant women while still bleeding from my termination. 
He blew up. The messages were vitriolic. He accused me of guilt tripping him, of making him out to be the bad guy, that he always has to convince me that he wants to be there, that he sees similarities with me and his controlling ex, that it's exhausting always having to convince me he wants to be there, he doesn't want to try and build a relationship with anyone as he's tried a few times before and it's always ended due to other people's selfishness and he's not responsible for how I choose to see things. 
Now, I responded to these messages, reiterated I had said or suggested none of these things, I simply needed support and wanted him to want to be there for me in quite a firm and assertive way, but I tried to keep reminding him I cared about him and wanted to have a relationship with him. It didn't matter what I said, he just wanted to fight me and ultimately the relationship ended. Over texts. I ended up apologising for not realising how much pressure I was putting him under and what affect that would have on him. 

A week later, I know in my heart it needed to end and I can't be in a relationship with him. I don't think I should have apologised as I don't think I was being unreasonable. But then again, maybe I was being too demanding on someone who was dealing with so much. 

But I guess I'm asking for outside perspective, have I been gaslighted here? Was I putting my own needs and feelings before his? Maybe I was really selfish to be putting pressure or triggering guilty feelings in someone who has some pretty heavy mental health stuff going on? Or was I justified in calling out the lack of support? I just feel pretty lost and can't tell if I've been a selfish  arsehole or if I was right to call out what I needed.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7591729,public,self,Ended a pregnancy and relationship broke down a week later because I was too demanding,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzm25p/ended_a_pregnancy_and_relationship_broke_down_a/,all_ads,6,,

My ask is how can my boyfriend and I move forward in our relationship. The history of my current relationship is extremely loaded, unconventional and turbulent. I attempted to end my current relationship a couple months ago by going on a trip with another guy and informing by current boyfriend of my actions. It was a grand goodbye and needless to say my current boyfriend and I ended up back to together. I've known my boyfriend for 4 years. We have been in an off-and-on relationship since then. I would consider us to have very different personalities. I am an introvert and very independent whereas he constantly needs my attention. This has caused a huge toll on our relationship as I do not get the space I require. Additionally, there is a lack of trust in our relationship. Which I can admit is my fault. My boyfriend used to go through my phone. When he cannot get access to my phone, he accuses me of cheating. He is not without his own dishonesty, poor behaviour and power plays in this relationship. We've decided to try again. He is dedicated to this but he requires I spend all my time with him and that I find ways to fix our relationship. He says he needs my support and I am responsible to support him with my time and effort. Although we have our own separate places, I've spent every single day of the past 3 months with him but it does not seem to be enough. As an introvert, it often gives me anxiety and feels exhausting.  I barely speak to my friends on the phone anymore and no longer go out. He does not go out either. Furthermore I mostly work from home and so does he.  I need space to thrive. This has taken an extreme toll on our sex life. I do not feel sexual at all. I cannot get this through to him.

I know my wife for 14 years, married for 8, and have a kid. We were always good friends and fun to be around. But I never loved her. I never missed her when we stayed apart for months. 

I cheated on her in our 3rd year of the relationship. And once again after 5 years. Later on many times but mostly phone/video sex with some women I met online. All these years I NEVER had the slightest doubt that I don't want to be with my wife. And eventually, we married, and had a kid 3 years later. I cheated on her again a few months ago.

We started to live together pretty early, as it was financially beneficial for both of us, as such, it comes without saying that we really didn't know each other at that point. Dumb decision but bear with me. We have had a lot of up and downs, through which we have somehow gotten through with lot of tears and effort. He has changed a lot since the beginning of our relationship (for the better), I could even say that he is a completely different person. But one issue stands - CoD.
When we started living together, he lost his job and I was the only provider for few months, as such we didn't have a lot of money and got in to a few debts. The first red flag, which should have ended our whole relationship right there and then, was when at the time, he bought a ps4 from the money he won by gambling. Basically the ONLY money he got at the time, while I was working basically every day he spent to buy PlayStation. I was livid. His response was:It's not real money, as he got it by gambling.
From this point on things went to downhill pretty fast, he would be playing non-stop for 12 hours at a time, not do chores while he was at home, he would be easily frustrated, throw fits, completely disregard my needs or wants. I was miserable, I felt abandoned, we had a lot of fights, he was lying like I have never seen people lie before, at the time, lying was as easy as breathing for him. There would be like a week or 2 of normal behavior from him after some dramatic, relationship-ending fight, but he would always go back to that game. This went on for 1.5 years, 1/3 of which he would be unemployed. It gave me PTSD similar symptoms. I would wake up from deep sleep even by hearing the noise of PlayStation turning on, even the mention of the game makes me unreasonably angry, I can't sleep knowing that it is on in my house, i would have nightmares about my partner and the game or related stuff. Whatever I do, however I'm trying to reason with myself, the sound of that game makes me spiral into a flashback of all the bad emotions that happened for that prolonged period of time.  
Now, my partner knows all of this, we have had thousands of conversations about it, screaming, crying matches, which all end in some sort of compromise that, unfortunately he is unable to keep. The recent one - he can play whatever amount of time when I am not home(I am not home a lot, as now I study and work, I am away for minimum few hours to a whole day, EVERY day) and, if he is not working, he has to take care of the chores for the day. But that is not manageable for him. For the last 3 weeks, he has been unemployed again and all I see is him play that game, last few days, I think he has played 13+ hours a day. I gave begged, I have pleaded, I have screamed, I have cried. But nothing ever makes him stop. Just bunch of empty promises that get broken up in days/ weeks. I am tired. And I feel like I have no escape. 
I know that the reasonable thing is to break up, but unfortunately, for multitude of reasons, we are in significant debt, that will take a long time to get payed off. At this point I am almost dependent on him to get that payed, because, as I mentioned, I am also a student, I can not have a full time job, I can only work half-time and have animals. 
As he is not working at the time, and I have a reasonable income, for next 2 months I would be able to support myself alone, but that's that. 2 months. I don't know what I can do after, but I cannot continue hearing the humming of that electronic, the clicks of the keyboard, the constant comments. It's as if I'm living with an asshole neighbour, that disregards the sleeping time. There is no closeness, no warmth, no intimacy. 
The difference in his character when he is not gaming and gaming is like night and day. The longest he has not played have been 1.5 months. He was sweet and caring, I felt actually loved. 
Yesterday I asked him to leave, to which he replied that he can't leave me with this debt. I don't care anymore. I just want peace. I brought this up today again, to which he replied that he is going to change as soon as the training season starts ( he is an athlete), to which i asked""how is this going to change my current situation?"" He couldn't answer. I asked again, why hasn't he left, as he was planning to meet his friend and family this weekend, he said that he is going to tell me on Monday. For anyone wondering, it's not like he is busy. He is, as I am typing this, just sitting in the other room and playing. I came from work few hours ago, that's all the conversation we have had. I just want to rest. I'm tired of fighting, I'm exhausted of being angry.
I just needed to get this off my chest, because I have no one to tell this to. If anyone has a partner that chooses a game over you - please leave if you have a chance.

I was bullied relentlessly as a kid, &amp; developed eating disorders. 

The past 5 years I’ve been heavily focused on my career, which comes with a lot of stress and an exhausting schedule. My weight has gone up and down. I thought I was doing okay, but still felt somewhat insecure about a recent weight gain. I was struggling so bad with depression and suicidal thoughts from being overwhelmed with just life.

I had been friends with this guy for a year. We were FWB and I just wanted to be around someone who I thought would make me happy. He suggested I spend a weekend with him and also wanted to plan a vacation with me. I went to visit him and I thought things went fine. I suspect he’s an alcoholic and has addiction issues. I tried to not judge him for that. There were awkward moments at times between us, but I knew things took a turn when we ordered food and he asked for me to pay for mine. It was different, because he always paid for everything. There were times during sex, he couldn’t get hard. I worried if it was me. 

When I left his place, it seemed like things were still going okay. Two days after I left , he continued to talk about the vacation. Then he later called and said he couldn’t do it anymore. I still kept in touch and just asked him if he’d like to reschedule and then he called and admitted how he didn’t enjoy being around me, how he was just waiting for everything to end. How I’m someone he doesn’t want to spend a lot of money on, but we can still be friends and have sex whenever I’m in town. 

He said he wasn’t excited to see me again and that there were never sparks between us. He said he respected me and that’s why he admitted all of this. I was hurt. I knew nothing romantic was on the table , but I thought he was a genuine friend and I really needed one.
As we were talking, he said the sex wasn’t that great either. 

So I asked, if it was me. He said he didn’t find me attractive and he wanted to say more, but he didn’t want to hurt my feelings. He just said “I’ll just say, you need to do some squats.” My heart sunk to my stomach. I was so embarrassed. He claimed he still wanted to have sex with me and that he somewhat cared about me and apologized. He admitted to having an alcoholic and using drugs. I told him to get help and take care. 

2 weeks later, he and a friend went on vacation. His friend posted on his public Instagram story making fun of me. He asked him how many bitches he had , and my ex FWB said 2 and said my name and another woman’s names . He described her as a “Jewish bitch” &amp; He described what I did for a living, for bragging rights . As I’m somewhat of a public figure.  I was so disgusted by this. Later in the video , His friend responded with a joke , saying I have that job because  I “set a record for the most amount Twinkie’s a person can eat.” My ex FWB said he was a hater and how his women are movers and shakers and his friend replied that the only thing his women move are the ground because we’re so fat. The both laughed and the video ended. 

This was posted on a very public Instagram story. I was so crushed and cried almost every night after that. I couldn’t eat for a long time, because of how upset I was. I ended things officially with him through a text and even brought up his addictions. I just wanted him to hurt  just  as much as I did. I blocked him and I don’t even know if he responded or not. 

I’m now extremely insecure and honestly never want to have sex with anyone again. I’m embarrassed by my body . I just look at it now and burst into tears. How can I move past this ? I’ve been trying to work on myself so I can feel better , but there are days where it’s extremely hard to just get out of the bed. I’ve been pretty consistent with a workout routine, but no matter how much weight I lose, I still feel like a failure and that my body will always be  unattractive. I haven’t even been able to be social anymore after this occurrence. I’m just tired of never feeling good enough and his actions have brought to an extremely lower point, than where I was before.

TL;DR
I man who I’ve been having sex with for a year, called my body unattractive after I recently gained weight.

He feels terrible about it and I can tell it’s genuine. I still love him but I’m having a hard time getting past this. Im heartbroken.

I am 22F, about to be 23 next month. I have lived with my boyfriend for the last year, and it has been amazing, but I feel this constant looming guilt/shame/anxiety surrounding living a life outside of my family, I guess you could put it.

I come from a very close family, mom and dad and two younger siblings, who all still live together of course. Every time I leave from visiting with them I am flooded with such anxiety - this feeling that I am a disappointment of a child, that I just up and left the people who were so good to me - though the logical part of me knows I am just starting my own life and doing what essentially everyone does by moving in with their partner. What is even weirder is I didn't even move out of the city, they are only 20 minutes away, so I don't know why I feel so bad about it.

Like I said it's been a year and the feeling still lurks. I find myself overly texting all four of my family members, almost to overcompensate for seeing them less. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has ever felt this way or if I am totally alone on this, and if anyone has felt this way or maybe knows why I feel it, you could shed some light or advice.

My track record previously before dating him and briefly in the beginning of the relationship was me going out to bars a lot with my friends and having what I would describe as a good time. Some nights, of course I’d get drunk and be hungover the next day etc. (this did not inhibit my work or school work). I did that for maybe 2 months after we got together and then he expressed his concerns about not liking that I do that. We had almost broken up because of it but we worked through it and communicated. 7 months later my friend that would normally always be out (the catalyst sort of) moved far away lol. So, naturally I stopped going out even less often then I already did which was probably 1 time every 2-3 weeks. 

Over the summer and this fall I think I’ve gone out to the bars and drank like 5-10 times is a span of about 6 months… maybe. 

This latest night out was like switching back from nights and after like 2 weeks of being sick so I was of course isolated/not doing much to make everyone else safe. Anyway, I went out and had like 6 (1 was a flight) beers over like 10 hours and his biggest thing is me smoking or vaping. Former smoker, quit over a year ago but when I drink sometimes I crave nicotine.

I was surprised to find out that at 21 she had already slept with 19 guys.

She felt uncomfortable talking about it, so our conversation was very brief, but apparently when she moved abroad to study she felt alone and started partying heavily and having one night stands and situationships with other guys. I myself have only had one sexual partner before her and take sex very seriously as something that should only happen when love is involved.

To give you a background ( it will be long so please bear with me) I have been friends with the guy(M) for about 5 years. We went to the same college and were in the same class through all 4 years. The girl (P) and M have been in a happy relationship since almost about the same time (5 years, although they were friends before college). In college I mostly used to hangout with my guy friends and didn't have any major group of guys and girls hanging out so i had only met P like a couple times in college. P and I only became friends in the last year of our college mainly because we got placed in the same company and because she started giving me relationship advice and 3 of us got close as a group after that( we still only used to talk on phone, because of lockdown we were all in different cities)
After college, P and I got jobs in the same city but since we started our jobs in lockdown we went to the city for only a week and that would be the first time we actually got some real face time and that is when things started to get uncomfortable for me( let me remind you we are friends but not very close ones and i used to only talk to her on conference call with my best friend M).
So, our company gave us accomodation in the same hotel and her room was right besides mine. Let me list the things that did not feel right to me.
1. She used to be very touchy from time to time, be it watching a movie or just walking in the market and extra touchy after alcohol.
2. While laying in bed and watching movies she sometimes used to put my hand under her head as in a cuddling position. It felt awkward and since I could not just push her away i used to entertain this for like 2-3 mins before making some excuse to get out of bed. 
3. Again I am reminding you we are not very good friends according to me atleast. It happened twice that she started crying in front of me. Once it was about some personal family stuff in her life. Second time it was about how she somehow felt suffocated in her relationship( but she maintained the stance that she is reasonably happy in her relationship and M is the best guy Anybody could hope for). While crying she asked if I could cuddle with her and comfort her and it got so awkward for me I didn't know what to say and there she was already hugging me and crying more.
4. On of the nights of crying she came to my room at night and asked if she could sleep in my room because she didn't want to be alone. I could not say no( at this point I feel I should have said no to a lot of things). The bed was pretty big so i just scooched to the corner and put a pillow in between but she literally moved to the centre of the bed and was again touching me with her hand. I swear that was the most uncomfortable I have been in my life. 

After sometime, all our friends decided to shift to same city for 3-4 months until our offices opened just for fun and again there she was. Now she was not that touchy ( still a little bit touchy in front of her boyfriend also) but I got comfortable again. I told myself maybe she was just having a rough week and didn't mean anything by all those things listed above and maybe took me for a very good friend. 

After offices opened, since we were in the same company we again shifted to the same city and for lack of having acquaintainces and lack of single bedroom apartments we had to move into the same flat( this was a mistake because I kept telling myself it was just that one rough week and M and P are genuinely happy which they actually are). All the things started happening again except asking to sleep in the same room. I am not a very confrontational guy so i made sure I reflect it with my actions that I am uncomfortable with the things she is doing. I basically reached the point of locking myself in my room and not letting her in for days but then I felt bad for her since she was mostly alone and didn't have many friends. So whenever I started hanging out again she repeated the same things as if completely unaware of her actions. 

After 3-4 months I decided to quit my job( not because of her, to pursue my startup idea). Now she has also changed her job and moved in with her boyfriend. Now the thing is i have completely stopped talking to her and M has noticed that and has been asking me constantly for the last few days that why am I not speaking to her. he thinks there is some fight between me and P and is asking me to resolve it with her even if I dont tell him anything (M is a pretty cool guy and would never suspect that something could go down between me and P). I just tell him that I am not very good at keeping in touch with friends and i just don't have the time or something but he knows something is not right and wants me to resolve it with her. 

What do i do? Please help. I have not been able to think about anything else for past few days.

I was her first real relationship, so the first couple months we had issues of her talking to others guys, including her ex. Not flirting or anything but definitely not things you do in a healthy relationship. We’ve moved past it though and things were good. But this outburst in the car hurt more than anything she had done before combined. I felt instant resentment towards her and if it weren’t for a few things I would have left right then. We have a house together, and her car is in both of our names, and a few other things tying me to her. I love her and until now this relationship has been a dream, but I don’t want to hold on to it hoping it gets good again, because that’s why my last relationship ended horribly. I don’t want to make that mistake again, but I really thought she was the one.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 5 months now and we have been long distance for 3. I flew across the country to see her last month and things have been overall wonderful. I am really falling in love with her and I plan to locate to her city by the end of summer. In person things are great, it’s like we knew each other in a past life.

But with the distance, when things bother her in her life or if I unintentionally do something to upset her, she shuts down. Total verbal silence, disconnected eye contact, and won’t answer anything. Seriously I’ll ask her very politely and patiently what’s wrong and try and work through it with her but she will only answer binary questions with a head nod or shake. She’ll just continue vacant eye contact and smiling through me trying to solve the issue. It’s very frustrating that I can’t get any sort of communication back from her. 

She is a very quiet, shy and introverted person normally but it’s very frustrating that I ask her for 40+ minutes on video call what’s wrong and trying to work through it with her and she’s just silent with me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7591630,public,self,Why does my (23M) girlfriend (20F) shut down whenever there’s a problem?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzlqj6/why_does_my_23m_girlfriend_20f_shut_down_whenever/,all_ads,6,,
