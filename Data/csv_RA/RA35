She said she will contact me after she figures some stuff out. I said alright, take your time, I'll wait. She said ""thank you so much please don't take it wrong I just feel lost."" I said ""yeah, I get that and sometimes you need to figure things out on your own"". Three days later she thanked me again for understanding and said it means a lot to her. I said no need for thanking but have you figured it out now? She said no and that she feels depressed and unhappy and sad. I asked why but she didn't know. I adviced her to take a therapist, she didn't answer. 2 days later she thanked me again. I just send a smiley back and later asked if she is feeling better. No answer. 4 days later I told her that i miss her and if we can talk tonight. She said yeah of course, she is out with friends tonight but would call me after. She called, but told me how tired she is and that we can't talk for long. No problem. I told her I like her and that I just felt the need to talk to her because I also don't know how long I should wait. She told me to not wait, but to move on. I was heartbroken but accepted it, hung up and wished her all the best. But I couldn't sleep that night so at like 5 AM I asked for a ""closing interview"". I asked when she lost interest and what I did wrong. She told me that I've been thinking too much. She said she thinks that I'm a really great guy and everything but she is a red flag for me. Furthermore, she feels like a burden to everyone and she has got to find herself and love herself first and that she thinks it's better to do that alone. I told her I don't see her as a red flag but as a wonderfull person and she is definitely not a burden and that I think I need to work on myself too and she is right, it's better to do it alone. I also told her that I do not want to call it quits because I think we could have something great.

I (21M) have two best friends of five years (both 21F) one I have always been a lot closer with and have known each other longer, Im going to call her Emma. We all still live with our parents (UK). Over the last year she has distanced herself from me slowly. She has had an addiction problem with drugs/alcohol and wasn’t able to get through the day without benzos. She had to be resuscitated and taken to hospital in an ambulance one morning after a bender with my other friend who I’m going to call Anna. I wasn’t there as I went home. Her parents never found out that she was at hospital all day. Anna lied to their faces all day whilst staying in Emma’s. A few weeks later she then almost died on a cocktail of oxy, diazepam and xanax and survived got fully clean for a few months, went to NA meetings. During this period she barely ever wanted to see me and ghosted me a lot, but would see Anna a few times a week. Anna and I would still hang out though.

In the last month Emma has completely broken her sobriety. I found 100 Xanax in her drawer, when I asked her about it she later accused me of stealing a sheet. She is ordering lots of things off the dark net again. I spoke to Anna about it but she doesn’t seem too concerned. (Bear in mind Anna has autism, she doesn’t often challenge anything Emma says and just goes along with whatever she says most of the time.) Emma is pretty much always high again like she used to. Over the last while, they keep lying to me about if they’re hanging out or not or we’ll have plans as a three, and they’ll cancel on me then end up hanging out as a two and sometimes posting pics so I find out. 

I barely see them anymore, maybe once or twice every couple weeks, yet they are hanging out with each other all the time. They are my only friends and it is making me so depressed. I don’t understand why they go out without me constantly when we all have plans together and they easily could just invite me too. I am upfront when something is bothering me so I have told them both separately how they are making me feel but they just come up with some bullshit excuse each time, or brush it off. (BTW there is no chance they are in a relationship)

Anna speaks about how she wishes we could all hang out as a three but constantly lies to my face about whether she’s with Emma or not, lies about what they’re doing. She pretended she didn’t know about the 100 Xanax when I found them, acted shocked etc but then later I found out she already knew. I am also worried about Emma because she is very clearly going through a relapse right now and everyone just seems to be ignoring it? I haven’t spoke to her about it yet for fear of losing her friendship entirely, which makes me a coward I know. My boyfriend goes to college with her and tells me she is always looking faded. Last time, when she had to be resuscitated her mum rang me and asked me if i knew what she had taken so I told her and Emma was really annoyed at me.

I don’t want to completely destroy what is left of our friendship I’m worried she’s going to take too much and OD again. I can see where this is going and it’s nowhere good.

We are great at supporting each other in achieving career goals, personal goals, we go on fun trips, enjoy some of the same things in our spare time. To the outside eye our life is great and we go through periods where I’m very happy. But his general manner of doing things is unattractive to me. He does not project the warmth I desire in a partner. He has digestive issues and farts and burps around the house and in public. He’s very rational and seemingly lacking empathy. What’s normal communication and energising to him is far too aggressive and draining for me. He likes to argue, it’s fun for him, he sees it as a game, I don’t. He also often just ignores me, I don’t believe wilfully but just because he’s occupied with something else, but it drives me nuts to be left waiting for a response. I also am expected to do most of the chores. On some days I really don’t want to be touched by him. It doesn’t help that I never found him super attractive in the first place. He has attractive qualities, and sometimes we have fantastic sex, but I wouldn’t have picked him out of a crowd.
This is my longest relationship so far and I’m proud of it, we’ve achieved a lot together, I feel safe and secure, our love has settled as in it’s this calm love where it’s not very exciting but it’s stable. But on some days I despise him and I’m disgusted by him and I just want to break up. These break up thoughts keep coming again and again. Yesterday they were the strongest ever and I worry about our relationship but when I talk to him about these issues he doesn’t take it very seriously. I’ve made many suggestions, we’ve recently done our first monthly chat about our relationship so we can regularly work on it but it was hard to convince him to agree to it and he had nothing to add to the conversation. I don’t believe I can change him and I don’t believe I should want to but I really do. But I also understand that for all the benefits of this relationship I have to make some sacrifices. I’ve come to the conclusion that only I can decide how many sacrifices I am happy to accept, but I wonder about other people’s experiences with this. Advice?

I’m in an FWB situation and while we were doing it (doggy) yesterday, I told him to promise me if I’m DTF, he won’t say no; to which he replied ‘who knows what the future holds.’ Thing is, before he replied me, he sat me up and place his chin on my shoulder (like a cuddle from behind). We were in that position for quite awhile before we continued to which he kissed my back. He later said that I have the best p*ssy he ever fucked. 

I just find it weird because this is the 3rd time we’ve done it but while making out this time he started kissing my lips slowly. While we were doing it (missionary) yesterday, he went slower in me - I asked him literally 3 times why’d he slowed down, he didn’t reply me but just stared into my eyes.

After sex, he told me “it’s just lust.” 

FYI, before we did it yesterday, I told him about a guy I like and asked him how I should approach him but I was sad because due to my insecurity I don’t think the guy I like like me that way. Basically I was distractedly upset at the start and my FWB realised and kept asking me if I wanted to do it cuz I looked sad and distracted and all. 

IDK what to do or what this will lead to. I basically need advice on this relationship. It’s both our first times as FWBs. Occasionally he will bring up how amazingly wild the sex will be if I were to stay over at his place which I haven’t as I’m still living with my parents.

Like I respect that she still has freinds that are boys but sometimes she can go a little too far. In between classes yesterday when she was ignoring me to talk to him I just walked away and once he went into his class she looked around for me then came up to me and said “ why did you leave me?” And I said “ it looked like you were too caught up with Jake.” And she started to tear up so I hugged her and comforted her I just don’t know what to do. Honestly I blame myself sometimes because I’m not good at starting conversations.

On the fifth date he mentioned that he had deleted all dating apps and a few dates ago I asked him if he was talking to any other girls and he said that he is a monogamous person and had stopped talking to other girls after our first date.

I've met his friends and he's told people about me (never introduced me as his girlfriend but rather as someone he's dating). 

Recently we travelled separately for a week and he was very communicative mentioning that he misses me, can't wait to see me and trying to se up our next date. However, he's been a bit distant after we got back. He seems distracted in public but pays a lot of attention in private. He's stopped communicating as much and his texts have gotten more straightforward and to the point. I'm travelling for the weekend and he his texts are short and direct. I know he has an exam coming up soon that he's been focusing on so I've tried to communicate more and be more expressive (and he's reciprocated that at times).

Basically me (33F) and partner (36M) are going through a rough patch(been together 3 years)….like to the point of it almost being over.
It’s mostly over him being shit- forgot my birthday last week and small arguments that turn into big ones. 
One of the reoccurring arguments is his ex wife’s lack of boundaries. She invites him over for dinner with the kids and he goes. Don’t jump down my throat- I know this is good for the kids, but his ex wife is newly single and whenever she is newly single this happens. It just doesn’t sit well with me. It’s not an ‘us’ thing, I’m not invited. Anyway, last week I expressed my annoyance about it. We had a big argument about it and he basically told me to get used to it and I said ok. He didn’t take my feelings into consideration. He told me I was jealous. Which I’m not, I’m very open to the different dynamics of families (I’ve spent the last 2 Christmas’ with his ex wife).
Today, he accidentally left a voice Mail on my phone, he was talking to his mum and said ‘yeah, now that ‘Sarah’ is single again she’s asking me over for dinner, and I just don’t want that, it’s not fair on ‘Emma’ ‘ (me) and his mum was like yeaaahh (agreeing)
After I heard this, I sent it back to him and wrote- not having a go at you, but I guess my feelings are valid then? Because last time we spoke about it you told me to get used to it, but now you’re telling your mum it’s not fair to me. You haven’t said this to me, so I guess you agree? 
He just wrote back ‘whatever ‘Emma’ , I said it wasn’t fair, at least you know how good I am’ and is now angry at me(!!??)
I’m actually SO confused. Can someone explain to me what I’ve done wrong? Why is he so defensive about this????

So I guess the crux of this is- he has never said to me that it’s not fair. If anything he’s told me I’m crazy. But is telling his MUM it’s not fair.

i asked him while we were a few weeks into dating if he would be ok if i posted on my ig but he was quite “uncomfortable” with it? and later on probably 1 months ish into the relationship i got a little upset from seeing how my friends are just posting about their other half happily. So i asked again whether it would be ok since we are alot more stable now, he mentioned that he had a talk with his mum and she said that she wouldve been upset if she was me so the advice she gave him was to let me post whatever i wanted to, and then he said it would be ok for me to post from then on. But later on i took a photo and instinctively i asked him again whether its ok to post but he seemed uncomfortable with it again… and asked if it would be ok if i posted in my close friends list or another account with lesser followers which i then proceeded to say “it’s not like all 800 of my followers would know you?” and he said thats exactly why he does not to be posted… i got really really upset over it, since he kinda promised that i can post. not just that, he does not have any intention to post anything on his end as well.

honestly through the 3/4 months we have fought / argued / get really upset with this topic whenever i bring it up. he’s reason for not wanting to be posted has always been cause he’s uncomfortable with being on the internet and that’s just how he’s parents brought him up and he needs time.

F dating a M both in our late 30s, no intention/possibility of marriage or kids. My BF “Al” and I have been together for over a year, but were friends for years before that after meeting at our mutual friend’s wedding. Both of us are kind of loners by nature (except I’m very emotionally close with my family), so yeah, we were lumped together at the singles table, lol. 

Last year we decided to start dating and move in together, it’s been a rough adjustment for sure but we’re working on it because we care about each other. But something keeps nattering at me in the back of my mind - the guy just does *not* understand or participate in random acts of kindness. Like if someone started a “pay for the coffee of the person behind you” chain, he’d likely be the one to break it. He doesn’t tip when he doesn’t have to (which I kind of get, I guess, I just like to slip the Dunkin people a dollar each time because they have it pretty rough and he doesn’t get why I bother because “they get paid more than servers” and it’s not a societal expectation like it is at a restaurant). 

I guess from working retail/food service in the past, having a hard childhood, and being the victim of bullying in school, I developed a soft heart. I like making people happy in little ways because the world is miserable enough. Tbf, I can be a little bit of a people pleaser too, but I’m in therapy and working on being more assertive.

Recently a new coworker started at my job - he’s an older guy and just moved to this state after his divorce, his ex and teenage kids live several states away, and all his friends live in his home country (he’s been in the US for a couple decades) or his previous state. I asked what he was doing for Thanksgiving and he said nothing, probably just going to watch TV. I asked if he’d feel comfortable with me bringing him a plate of the food I make - it’s nothing fancy, but he was ecstatic and super happy. When I told my BF though, he asked why I would bother. I said because it’s just a nice thing to do, and if I were in his shoes, I’d appreciate the gesture. 

BF said it was “pointless” and “weird.” I argued that if it makes us both happy and doesn’t hurt anybody, what does it matter? He said he just doesn’t get why I would bother. I’ve tried to explain the value of generosity and giving for the sake of it, but he’s always just gruff and flippant about it.

Unfortunately, I got attached because of hormones. We parted ways in good terms even with me being confused and told him I'll remember him fondly. I insisted a goodbye cause I didn't want that bad shadow over me, and thought, finally out of sight out of mind. He's a very bad or dry texter at least towards me so I thought I was doing good strides the first two months. He still messages and replies to stories every now and then though and replies almost immediately when I reach out too. Now that he's relaxed and started travelling, and I have started travelling myself, the messages have been near constant. At some point in this month, I've finally told him that I got upset at him detaching, and that I'm still trying to get over my attachment. He said sorry, said he wasn't aware and that he doesn't know what he wants blah blah. Two weeks ago, he asked me a favor that sort of extended his presence in my life for a year. I agreed to it, but in hindsight shouldn't have probably. Now, I kind of feel resentment because even though I appreciate his friendship (we had a good kind of friendship going on while we were still hanging out at his place both comfortable and a bit vulnerable towards each other, and we banter and tease each other a lot still in messages), I'm still trying to get over this attachment and I feel like it's one-sided, I give too much and show him that I care, and he doesn't reciprocate much. He knows I feel this way, shouldn't he have stepped back? Why do some people do this? Is this because I reply to him whenever he reaches out especially when he needs something?

I (37M) and my wife (28F) have been together for 9 years. I won't go on forever about how she treats me or how long this has been going on but I will say it contributed to my essentially detaching myself from the relationship mentally and emotionally. 
Some relevant background is this: 
She is self-diagnosed bipolar, I am formally diagnosed high functioning autistic. 
I suffered a severe medical event that has left me unable to perform intimately and having significant mental hang-ups about sex in general.
We are common law married, this means (for the state that I live in) that we are living as married and do not require a marriage license to be considered married. We do not however share any financial or otherwise legally binding situations.

So with that out of the way, here's the story.
For the first 6 years of our being together we were basically joined at the hip, didn't really have any outside friends and we were pretty secluded given a situation that had me basically taking care of my elderly father more or less full time.
But about 3 years ago, I acquired another set of hands to take some of my responsibilities in looking after my father and thus, both her and I got to get out more. I made some friends and they by and by sort of revealed to me that she was taking advantage of the situation. I was caring for her about as much as I was caring for my father. To them, this was a toxic situation that was beyond my eyes until...lets say without divulging too much that she was directly involved in the reason my father had to be put in a nursing home. We had to sell the house in October of last year to pay for his care and her and I moved into an apartment with one of those friends I made and a 4th roommate.
Since then, it has become more and more obvious to me that she is taking advantage of my money and my...shall we say programming to just clean, do the hard stuff and not complain. 
And regardless of all that, it's the not complaining bit that is biting me in the backside presently. So here's where it gets hard to explain but her and I have had this agreement since about 2 years after we got together that if she really needed intimacy with someone, she could and we have as a result, an open relationship. I have only 3 rules for it and they are use protection, don't bring anything home and not in our bed. She follows these rules quite well and I haven't had any problem with that part at least. 
But it has been some kind of way for a couple years now where everything I do makes her cry...and I can't um process people crying in any normal sort of way, I just can't cope so I always feel like I have to have done something wrong and I apologize constantly, for everything. My friends seem to think she is taking advantage of this very clear symptom of my autism because it happens so often and I end up canceling plans, spending money on her and just basically groveling to atone. So there is, evidently sign one of toxic behavior...although I think I might just be a pushover.
So this behavior of mine is important to note here because I cannot tell if I am being a hypocrite in regards to the situation or not.
She recently met a guy who is also ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and she has been seeing him intimately. But honestly I am beginning to wonder if she's moved on because she can tell I'm tired of being treated like dirt once I saw the light of what she had been doing for so long. 
She compared him and I. Apparently we stand the same way, we have all the same features she likes in a man, appearance wise. We both have large teeth, deep set eyes, dark hair, boney hands, piercings. We both dress the same, like classic cars, we're both military brats. The thing is, I get the feeling she wasn't making this comparison in a ""oh look, twinsies"" sort of way. 
He is 19M, and there are some things we don't share...like for instance I am short (5'6"") and he is tall (6'even) and I am out of shape because of range of movement issues I suffer from and he is...in immaculate shape. He goes to a psychiatrist and is on medication for his anxiety, meanwhile I do not because of a traumatizing past with such treatments. But most importantly was a conversation her, him and myself were having the other day where she, as playfully as she could said flat out ""He's like you but younger and less f#$%ed up."" And all I heard was ""He's better than you in every way."" And it hurt. 
Now, the kicker here is I actually wanted her to find somebody new and move on from me...it's easier than having a whole breakup and all that encompasses, which kinda scares me. Yes, I am well aware I am a coward, that doesn't need pointing out. But what I wasn't expecting was her to bash everything about me using him as some sort of model of the ideal man.
I've had to interact with this guy and every time I do, I just feel worse and worse about myself. My past haunts me every time I see him, mistakes I made and was previously proud to have bounced back from come to mind every time he walks through the door. I feel small, fat, old, useless, decrepit and broken now that I know that's exactly how she sees me. It makes me skin crawl when she touches me in a way it never had before. Unlike all the other men she was with by my permission...now when she touches me, I get flashes like in Eyes Wide Shut of what she and him did with those same hands and arms wrapped around me. I get sour in my stomach and I feel my heart race like I want to run away from her touch. 
But I dont even need to ask, I know she has moved on. Although here is my true, full and complete problem, we've just resigned the lease to our apartment until November of 2023 and for financial reasons, we must live together still. Worse, we only have the one bed for her and I, the couch is occupied by another roommate and so...I have to continue sleeping in the same bed as her as well. 
So my world is in a tiny little box where I go out to ""work"" (Doordash) and I come home to her and sometimes him here. I try my best to be pleasant but I can't take the stress and nausea I feel when I'm around both of them. 
It is my hope that she will just one day pack up all her stuff and leave to move in with him and it all will end...but in the meantime I can't bring myself to unload all of what I've been feeling to her or him...I feel like I'd be throwing a hussy fit and that gives me more anxiety about it, makes me feel worse. But as a result, I'm feeling more and more scared of myself because I know this isn't healthy and I am bottling stuff away and eventually it will just pop without any warning.
I guess this post is a sort cry for help because I don't know what to do, about her, about him, about myself...how do I cope with this? How do I interact? Should I keep playing along and acting like it isn't bothering me? Should I just let it out in whatever screaming fit I end up having and let us break up then and there, regardless of what I think she'll do? Like, without mentioning too much because rules here say I shouldn't...she has a history of physical abuse of myself and to a lesser extent, cat who is my ESA. So to boot, I am also afraid of a physical altercation that could result my being...well the violent husband, even if I was just defending myself or my cat. We also own many thousands of dollars in firearms in this apartment (none of them legally hers) and I don't want any physical altercation to evolve into something...well at the least extreme, they pose a hazard and if the police are called, whether or not they're used, could be confiscated. At the most extreme...well none of them are loaded at any given time and most of them are locked but I'm sure you can imagine what sort of outcome I'm fearing here. And besides putting locks on them, there isn't really anywhere we can legally (or safely...from theft) store them outside the apartment for the time being.

We've been part of the same online friend group for about 3 years now, and I can confidently say I know her better than I know many of the people I hang out with in person. I know people will be inclined to comment ""buhh long distance never works"" as soon as I mention this, but I really don't think distance has anything to do with it, and soon enough it will be even less relevant.

We tried our hand at an online relationship, which lasted about five months before ending with a very painful breakup. I tried getting my mind off her, dating other people, but eventually figured out that it just wasn't for me. I got back in touch with our friend group after isolating myself for a while, and at the moment I think the hatchet is mostly buried between us. I can't speak for her, but I personally don't feel any awkwardness when we talk anymore, even when it's just the two of us (I'm usually really bad at one-on-one conversations). She has been going through a lot lately, both with her first year of college and a brief fling that ended very poorly. She's a troubled soul taking on way more than she can handle, but she still holds up better than I ever could. I'm really proud of her, and I wish I could be there in person to hug and comfort her whenever she needs it, but for now I'm just working with whatever I have. 

I should also mention that I recently applied to college in the United States, so in about a year we should be on the same continent at least. This is something that I wanted to do since I was little and it has nothing to do with her, but it *would* make any potential future relationship a lot easier. 

I'm just worried about what this is doing to me. I guess it's kind of romantic that I'm willing to drop any wishes of dating anyone else just to be with her no matter what, but sometimes it gets really hard to keep going. I know I'm not responsible for her, but I can't just stand by and watch her destroy herself. She's convinced that she's beyond saving, and I feel like she keeps unconsciously trying to prove it to me, but when we were together I made a promise that I wouldn't give up on her no matter what, and I intend to uphold it.

However, I can confidently say that we love each other very much and always fixed the issue at hand.

About a year into our relationship, she was diagnosed with severe depression. We were good for awhile as she started to take her medications. But there are many nights when she would talk about her problems and feelings where I wouldn't be able to help her out or give the reassurance shes wanting. I don't know what shes going through as I always faced my problems head on. Obviously she can't do that as shes sick. I always recommended getting daily exercise, eating healthy, having goals, getting a therapist. At the moment, we cant afford a therapist. She tries to eat healthy or go to the gym but it rarely happens.

I love this girl very much but it is hard to be with someone whom I feel like is not doing their best in making their mental health better. Im the polar opposite in a way that I know that feeling sorry for myself doesnt do anything for me. I try to be healthy physically and mentally as best I can. I also plan my future so I don't get anxious of whats to come. Shes the complete opposite. AGAIN, I don't know whats shes going through fully so I'm trying my best not to judge.

I’m not going to delve into my past about why this makes me uncomfortable but to say it short I’ve had previous partners that have cheated. I don’t let that effect this current relationship as everything with her is almost perfect. She’s kind, compassionate, beautiful, loving, open and as into me as I am into her. We met a bit over a year ago and chatted off and on through social media but neither of us made a move at any stage because we thought the other was just being nice. Her and her ex were on and off again and our chats were never anything but friendly till I eventually asked her on a date about 4 months ago. 

Now this ex of hers in my opinion is the type that is waiting in the wings for our relationship to fail, typical nice dude who treats her like the sun shines out her ass. She told me she broke up with him because she loved him but was never able to fall in love with him which I can relate to because I was much the same with my previous partner. The difference is when we first started dating she had plans on night to hang with him watching movies which I said made me way too uncomfortable. She didn’t understand at first but I explained why that made me uncomfortable and she canceled the (date?) night. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with her hanging out one on one with this guy and she agreed. 

She says she only sees him as a friend and that she has absolutely no residual feelings left over for him and that if he tried anything she would cut him out her life right away but I don’t trust this guy in the slightest if I’m totally honest. 

I had a friend who I had slept with a couple times a few years ago message me to see if I wanted to go snorkelling to which I said no because I didn’t want to put my new partner in a position that would make her uncomfortable and blah blah blah. Well I talked to my gf about this and she said she was totally okay with it. She said she trusted me and didn’t mind who I hung out with and I felt guilty as hell I placed any kind of restriction on her and told her she could hang with him but just not in a date like scenario which I think is fair?

He goes to her gym and messages her a fair bit so the are in constant communication and I have no fucking clue how cool I should be with all this. Just looking for how others would deal with this situation. I told her I’d like to meet the guy sometime soon as I’m a pretty good judge of people so I think I’d know if he has an ulterior motive to the friendship.

I (m21) have been in the relationship with my long distance girlfriend (f21) for a year and a half, and we’ve known each other since high school, were always long-distance. We’ll continue be this way for another year until we graduate and move in together, as was always expected. She’s been visiting once in a while, since I can’t because of my schedule. The problem is I don’t enjoy our thing anymore, but also not sure about my feelings, if they’re situational or there’s a fundamental problem. Like, would it really be the best thing to break up? 

More context. I don’t have a prejudice about long-distance if you both are commited, I communicate pretty well and am adept in resolving misunderstandings. Of course, it is completely different, but a person can bear with annoying part if it’s worth it. 
We don’t have much in common. She doesn’t have an easy life: occasional problems with her parents (she hasn’t separated yet and it affects her), anxiety, a lot to do in university, she doesn’t work and also hates her major and feels like falling behind compared to her peers; all this considered, she doesn’t do much out of her university deadlines. I’m telling you this so perhaps you can understand me better. I’m a very busy person (university, full-time job, additional classes, physical activities), I succeeded in creating this routine just recently. My close friends sometimes ask me how and why we’re dating, but I genuinely never thought she’s “lower” than me in any way, it’s not even a question. 

To the main part. I’ve been catching myself dreaming of how we could have interesting conversations, how things could be really exciting, while in reality we are only talking about mundane things and what bothers us. I know I can make things more interesting, but I quickly lose motivation when my partner doesn’t share the same level of initiative. It feels weird, like I’m the only one who needs this, so I started to avoid this feeling. 
I’ve been consoling myself that things will get better once we moved in together, but she visited recently and, in short, it wasn’t great. She’s been very passive and I was sad and upset about it, we talked and she said this is the way she does things, she didn’t understand what’s wrong. And it’s hard for me to feel loved when my energy is not reciprocated.

I start to feel that if we move in and this frustration re-emerge later, it would be unfair to her, she’ll be moving to the big city I live in. But I also can’t just bring this up until I figure everything out myself, otherwise she’ll be upset about herself and our conversation will go the feelings way. Also I feel like I’m being unfair to her situation, like I’m even considering our breakup when life isn’t easy to her. But it’s not as if I know for sure anything is going to change. After she moves with me, she will have to work in catering industry for a while, and it is known to exhaust people momentarily. But how right is it to prioritize myself in this kind of situation? Not clear for me at all. Perhaps I’m just exaggerating? I’m not even that free daily to complain as if this is a tragedy, some days I don’t think about it. But it’s true that I do enjoy us rarely. I wish we’ve spent our free time with more quality, and I’m not sure what to do. Marriage and kids are not my first priority in life, I would manage without those things, so it doesn’t affect the problem. She’s just a special person to me and is an immense part of my social circle (not in proportion or in action, but because of our history), and, considering the complexity, it’s hard to see if those feelings are worth making such drastic actions.

I love him more than anything, but he says he's confused and doesn't know if he loves me or just cares for me. 

See the thing is, we broke up over something COMPLETELY stupid and avoidable, before that, we were both madly in love, showed emotion towards each other, etc. Ofc there were issues and misunderstandings that did actually strain the relationship, but i think we could have fixed them. 

But now he barely speaks to me. 

We are long distance, so it makes rekindling of our relationship much harder (I think). I want to see him constantly but I know he probably won't be able to see me cause of work, idk how to bring that up without seeming pushy.

I seen that the best way to get that love back or at least try, is to re grow it out of friendship. How does someone do that?

Relationships scare me, but with him, my entire life changed for the better. 
I feel sick just imagining life without him, and the way I felt when we ended things, absolutely destroyed me in a way that I don't ever want to feel again, it was terrifying and lonely and so dark.

I've been in other relationships, but this one is special in ways I can't describe. 
I understand forcing the love will only hinder it, but he says he wants to fight for us and try, because in the past he never really has.

I've learned to love myself with him, love myself without him, I've gotten over jealousy and self confidence issues, I've truly become a better person. 

I miss the sweet man that he was, and I hate what this break up did to us. He wasn't the only one to experience changed feelings. In some ways I see him differently, but I still love him so incredibly much, even for his faults and for other things that came up after the breakup.

I know he is in love with me deep inside. It's the one thing I'm certain of, not cause I'm scared to lose him, but I just feel it from him still, even on the days where we barely talk.

But how do I begin to try and build this love back up?? We are together again now, trying to get back to what we had, or rebuild it/start over.

How do I not force it even though I wish he would just wake up and love me like he used to- this is a whole different kinda painful to hear the man you love more than anything, say he's confused.

We have a 4 year old and live a very happy, content life. He’s a perfect partner in almost every way. Patient, loving, thoughtful, helpful… he’s always gone above and beyond as a parent and I’ve never had to beg him to help with anything baby-related. That said, there’s something that’s strained the relationship since I’ve had the baby, and it’s the one and only thing that makes me feel super self-conscious.

He’s gotten into the habit of commenting on and questioning what I eat. I’ve always been tall and skinny, but after having our daughter, I still have about 20 pounds I can lose. Even still, I’m by no means “overweight,” and could still be considered “thin.” I’m just softer than I’ve ever been, and obviously my boobs have grown. But almost weekly, I get questions from him like “are you watching your intake?” Or “You’re eating bread again?” Or “Those have a lot of empty calories in them.” I’ve told him time and time again how it makes me feel; self conscious and fat. His mom has even mentioned to me that it bothers her (because he goes so far as to do it in front of others). Every time I bring it up to him, he says he’s just looking out for my well-being and wants to live a long and healthy life with me. I call BS because he never did this before I got pregnant. 

He’s super affectionate and often comments on how beautiful I look, but his other comments have still seeped into my sex life and have caused me to be very self-conscious. To the point of hiding my stomach when I change clothes in front of him. 

Truly, he’s 100% in every other way, but for some reason has latched onto this thought that he can tell me what I should or should not eat. And at this point, I don’t know what to tell him. How would you approach this?

she literally does nothing in her life but sleep and hang out ... with no future plans or any purpose .... 

and it's affecting her self-esteem ...and thus her behavior was always a bit bizarre .. for instance...

1-she always proudly laughs that she gets bored of people, and doesn't care about people's concerns ... that her friend would talk to her her deepest problems and she wouldn't sympathize or care ...

that i would tease her with this and she'd laugh proudly .... in my speculation it's because she finds some sort of esteem in not caring .. makes her feel strong or whatever ...anything would be an esteem boost since she doesn't do anything anyways and her self-esteem is in a deep low ...

.

2-.. i compete in a few sports .. she says competitive people got issues .. and you are sick that's why you do this .. i took it genuinely and i really considered her words rather than dismiss them as mere offense ...

3- A girl fainted in a restaurant we were in and am a doctor so i went to help ... she left me.. she said it's because i couldn't handle your show off unnecessarily explaining to the patient's relatives stuff ...

We're classmates and share the same desk, social circle, everything. I don't have any close friends that are not also his friends. In fact, I don't want to cut him off at all, I wish we could stay good friends.

The problem is, our ""romantic relationship"" is no different from a platonic one. We just call it dating, but we act like friends most of the time. There's no romantic gestures, we hardly ever go out or meet just the two of us, he doesn't really text/call and only responds to my texts sometimes. Me trying to initiate meetings and dates and texting and intimacy all the time... it just feels forced, like something he doesn't want.

He's very busy and tired, I know that, but my romantic and intimacy needs aren't met and that makes me feel very bad. He doesn't seem attracted to me that much, too, he doesn't compliment me or tell me he loves me, ever. So honestly we need to change the label from ""couple"" to ""friends"" and that's all. I deserve to date someone that desires me and finds me attractive, and he deserves to date someone he finds desirable and attractive.

But I can't do that, because every time I tried to talk with him about it, telling him he doesn't care and doesn't love me in that way so we shouldn't keep dating, he tells me it's not true that he doesn't care and starts being nice and cute and cuddly for a while. And I, again and again, feel sorry for him, and feel like the worst person on earth for considering breaking up with a nice person that he is.

And then we're back to acting like good friends again, because it's not possible to have a relationship without the chemistry he clearly doesn't feel. I feel either like his buddy to drink a beer with, or like his mother, never like his woman. He's also immature very often, and yes,  explicitly told me he wasn't attracted to my body. 
All of that made me lose the attraction towards him, I love him very much but it's a caring friendship type of love.

I have tried asking nicely, I've tried crying and explaining how I feel, I've gotten mad and walked out. I've tried to get him help. This argument has been going on for YEARS.

Everything was great until Sept 2022, i was going to college in his country and he was going to the same college. 

I really badly wanted to escape my household, my family did love me, but i had to fight a lot to eventually stop physical abuse in my family. I knew this place will not allow me to grow. I went on the dating app when i was strugging with my family, met him there, we hit it off and everything was fine.

In Sept 2022, when we were about to meet, visa issues made me take a gap year. We were in LDR again. 

In September, i was so anxious and upset because i wasn't getting any time from him, i would say i miss him and need him, i was crying and told him how I wasn't able to sleep, he said okay. There was no effort from his side, i tried to threaten to breakup, i fucked up. It was mean, i shouldn't have brought up breakup if i was scared to live in a different country without him. I apologized so much, gave us time, did my work and it was okay ig. 

 It got weird since he went to college. He was always supportive and caring but since last 2 times (in November) when i explained i was upset/struggling with family, he replied idk, and went to studying. He said he didn't know how to help. Fair enough, but later i confronted that i would love some support from his side, i even told him how he can (by asking questions and validating me).
He ended up telling me, he was busy then couldn't think of my situation which is why i replied like that. He said you aren't busy with college. There was no assurance of future support.
Next day on call i was clearly upset, didn't kiss/hug him. He didn't even bother to ask me why? And last time got angry because while we were watching something together on a silent call, he chocked on food and i didn't notice. Next day after call, i decided to confront him that i am not getting support and i don't think it will work. 

He said this is bs, why do you not tell me what you need. I told him exactly what support i need and how i need it as mentioned. He said he does spend time with me everyday watching something on call, i said how that is not being supportive. I told him how he denied my request to be supportive, he told me i didn't deny to be supportive, i understood and will be supportive next time. I asked him where he assured me this, to which he replied, in which text did i deny it? Neither for both (support or denying support).

I broke up then saying i didn't feel supported and you were busy, want to focus on college which is fair and i can't be in a relationship where not only my needs are not met, there is no effort put in to meet them either.

He told me my brain is fucking with me just like in September, that i could communicate everything but i decided to take this approach. He said i never did it when i was on anti-depressants (i was on then for my own issues, quit them in August and felt so much better). He said maybe he should talk to my father as he is worried about me. I feel fine, i am not numb, i am able to emotionally regulate myself. I don't feel hate for my family or for anyone which i used to when i was on meds.

I need help, i deleted any ways to contact him on phone so when it gets hard i don't make a stupid emotional mistake, but god is this so hard. I was about to live in with him, he is a great guy idk what happened to him, i feel like the stress of college made him egoistic and that everyone should tend to him but he doesn't need to reciprocate. I really have no clue. I am struggling to eat, sleep, and study. It sucks, idk what to do. Please guide me.

P.S. there are so many other flaws like his social anxiety so he never talks to me on call, forgetfulness, his own set of insecurities due to his childhood trauma. I understand that, but how do i help him, he is not even willing so see how he too had a part in this breakup. He contacted my close friend who said he seems pissed off.

It was something straight out of a movie, the chemistry was crazy, you couldnt seperate us. The first 4-5mnths were awesome we'd hook up all the time, but things kinda got rough when i pushed to hang out and kinda wanted to be in a relationship. 

We met because our two best friends started dating, but in her first relationship she dated her cousins best friend and that didnt end well. So she said that she couldnt date me, but was happy to just hook up or if i wanted to hang out it would just be friends. I was naive at the time, i really liked this girl and wanted to get to know her more so i chose to kinda hang out with her, and we went back and forth, became bestfriends. But she'd always say she didnt wanna lead me on, but kissed me in the club all the time, flirted we'd hang out and shed give me signs but i never wanted to push it.

She used to do a bunch of jealousy bullshit also, by walking up to other guys getting in their faces. once she grinded on me, nearly kissed me, then walked over to a group of guys and got in their faces, fuck i was pissed that night, we ended up going home together anyway

Yea from then on things got pretty toxic, we were back and forth i did some really dumb shit too, made her cry on her birthday but we still bounced off each other. Until the day i told i was completely done with her and i couldn't talk to her anymore, i mean i said similar things in the past but this time idk it was different.

I tried talking to her again after it, like months after it's always hard cause i missed her and love her.. and yea didnt go so well, she talked a bit, i kinda realised she started dating around which she'd never done before. And i guess i was way too insure and jealous, trying to pry into her life she called it quits and said i don't think i can talk to you anymore. i respected her wishes and we didnt talk for over a 1yr, missed like hell, wanted to talk to her but didnt. Until i drunk text her on a nightout, she replied the next morning to my surpise enthusiastically.

But again i can see she's a different girl now, better in most ways like she's grown getting on with her life. She was unemployed around the first 2 the yrs met. it didn't bother, cause i believed in the person she could become, now she's got a decent job, new friends still dating around lol, and I'm still stuck on her. Like some times i feel shes flirting, most the time shes calling me a friend and when she brings up things that possibly could mean shes seeing someone, i ask her about it and she either blanks me or tells me to see other girls pretty much.. it sucks and hurts, i feel like she keeps me close now if things dont work out, but if they do she can blow me off, we are close in my eyes really good friends thats why its always so hard.

I feel like haven't changed much over the yrs same job, same friends, stuck on this girl. I have problems with so many things i know, i started seeing a counselor, and it's helping but i still don't know what to do. My friends all reckon i should blow her off again and tell how i fell and my psych said it hasnt worked in the past so why is gonna work now.

I love her and our relationship has been great until now. Yesterday, my girlfriend and I had our first argument and it was huge. My girlfriend reactivated her Facebook account, prior to that she had been off all social media (social media cleanse) for an entire year. She searched my name up and she went through my entire profile, pictures, posts I've shared, liked, and commented on, my friends, things my friends tagged me in, which pictures of them I liked/ commented etc...

She saw things she didn't like, for example comments under my female friends posts, calling them beautiful and using emoji's, the things they tagged me in, like going on castle dates. I tried to explain to her that this happened before we were in a relationship, yes some of them were made while seeing her but we weren't official yet. During our the time we were still getting to know each other we were pretty serious about getting into a relationship but we weren't exclusive. Also, i explained to my girlfriend that my female friend was trying to set me up with her friends but I politely declined and this was before she knew about her.

My girlfriend is not speaking to me and I find it utterly absurd. I apologized to her and told her that I was sorry if I hurt her in any way. Honestly I feel like she took this too far. I feel uneasy that she stalked my entire Facebook page, this did not sit right with me.

He’d been my best friend through the 1,5 year we’ve been together, and now I find it very hard to imagine and experiencing having to be alone again.

The reason I left him lies in how bad he had treated me through our time together. He had some anger issues which caused him to yell at me, and due to his mental health he was not able to be there and care for me when I needed him. It was always his problems first, and if I tried to open up on one of his “bad” days he’d yell, talk down to me, or straight ignore me. I tried multiple times explaining him what I needed in the relationship, but he always went back to his dismissive and careless behavior. My self esteem has gotten so bad during the relationship, and I find it hard to imagine having to date again or start over with someone new in general. 

The messed up thing is how much I regret ending things. I know how many times I’ve cried during the relationship, how many times I’ve felt like I was giving so much and getting nothing. Our sexlife was mediocre at best, he had terrible hygiene which is usually a no-go for me, and the most important part, he simply did not respect or care enough for me to treat me right. So why does it hurt so bad? I physically feel sick after ending things. We even tried discussing trying again, and in that conversation he insisted he would not promise me he’d never yell at me again, and he felt I dehumanized him for even asking. He blamed my communicating skills for his yelling (I shut down when we discussed feelings, as I was afraid to get yelled at again), and out of the blue dropped a big childhood trauma that he’d never told anyone.

So after all this mess, even though I’ve ended it for good, returned his things etc. why does it hurt so bad, that I want to run right back in to the lions den? Am I just a messed up person? And how do I heal from this messed up experience?

Attentive, loving, amazing. 

He had some mental health issues and had moved back into his parents house temporarily after a period of intense agoraphobia. His plan was to get his business going and move out asap. 

Over the 3 years, things have gotten progressively worse with his mental health. He drinks to excess, takes valium every day (while drinking) and has moved no closer to living and independent life with me. He had abandoned his plans for making an income and displays serious signs of extreme mental illness. Including hypochondria, some sort of intense victim mentality and a superiority complex (he thinks he super intelligent even though at 41 he lives at home and is financially dependent on his family).

He's promised to make changes for 3 years and he just keeps getting deeper into his mental health spirals. I've tried to help multiple times but I often become the person he blames for not giving him all of my time and attention (I'm a single parent and a company director. I just don't have time to give him).

He's been through 12 therapists in 12 months. The only one he thought was good enough was one he abused and the therapist had him committed to a mental facility for a mandatory 24 hour hold.

Today he was calling 911 because his mother was yelling at him. Police and EMS went to their home and left without taking action. Then his mother took his phone because he kept threatening to call 911 again. During this, he messaged me telling me to call the police immediately because his mother took his phone. I declined because...it's not a crime to take your sons phone when he's being erratic and calling 911 in a drunken stupor.

He then blew up at me and said I didn't come through for him when he needed me - I was at the grocery store at the time tending to real life. 

He seems to have lost the plot mentally and I can't be around it any longer. I'm not sure what to do to get him the help he needs. I'm not sure what his mental health issues are.

And my partner calls her dad every single day, which I don’t have a problem with. However, she doesn’t treat him very nicely/speaks to him in a very disrespectful manner and every time we go, she yells at him for hoarding and being disorganized. Her dad is an old 82 year old man who lives in a big house with a few students that he rents rooms to. It takes about 1.5 hours to drive there to visit him and my partner insists on going to visit him every couple of months and she always wants to stay overnight for at least 4-5 days. Sometimes I don’t want to go and just want to stay home. But my partner then puts me on a guilt trip saying how her dad is old and that if I don’t go, he might die (even though he seems to be healthy for his age). She’s been using this excuse for years and every time she wants to go, I am made to go along with her.

I realize that I have poor boundaries and usually just let her have her way in order to avoid an argument. But recently, I voiced again that I didn’t want to go with her every single time she wanted to go, and asked if it was okay if she could go without me this time and that I’ll go with her next time. It turned into a very long argument about how she just wants a partner that wants to visit her family with her, and apparently her parents don’t even want to see her if I don’t go with her. And how just because she doesn’t get along with my parents doesn’t mean I need to separate her from her parents. It became a huge deal and now I have given in once again and have to spend the 25th-30th sleeping over at her dads place with her. She won’t even compromise on length of time. I told her 3 days tops but she said that wasn’t long enough and if I only wanted to visit for 3 days, then she would have to bring her dad home with us so he can spend a few more days with us at our place. She absolutely refuses to go without me because in her words “why would I ever visit my parents without you? The purpose of going to see him is to go see him together”. 

So Reddit, what do I do now?

She got my superficial attention but I was in a long term relationship already (with the girl who would betray me with my ""bestfriend"" in the future LOL)
She add me on Instagram and from time to time (like every few weeks or months) She would texted me and Run off basically. Meanwhile I was single and I Started replying more to her texts but She always would Run away and ghost me for weeks or months. It was a cycle.
After 5 years of this She invited me to grab a beer and it was very good for both of us. But she didnt answered for like a week right after that day and I was like here we go again ghost time and She didnt like me. So ok byebye.

After a while somehow we were talking everyday (maybe because everytime I step back She would immediatly ""go after me"") but we met 2 more Times and same thing happened. At this time I was the King of the ghosts and I decided I had enough and told her Next time I would have to give up on knowing her Better and go with my life which She ignored completely and only answer to the not important parts of the conversation like everytime I tried to be a bit more frontal about the situation and the feelings envolved or not. 

After a lot while (lol) She texted me saying she always had a crush on me and now her therapyst encouraged her to fight her fears and admiting this was One of them Thats why She would always Run away.  At this time I am again a person, I feel the blood on my body and I'm no longer a ghost because now I understand some things. I sent her a picture of the christmas gifts I bought and never Gave her.

But unfortnately at the same time now I was very septycal about her actions and my foreing cousin, One of my best friends, which I didnt see for 5 years was staying in my house for 2months and no way She would be a priority.

Anyway she invited me to go to a quizz with her friends which I found disapropriate because I felt we first needed to be a bit more Alone after her confession to really see a bit of our compabitility once for all (Im not talking about kissing and touching) and thou we talked everyday I did not do efforrts to meet her until my cousin left.

When he left we went to a dinossaur Museum and it was the first time I felt we ""dated"" and there were chemistry. She ended up suggesting we go to drink on a bar after and we spended 12hours together. In the end I Gave her the ""christmas gifts"" and took her home. She texted me saying She liked a lot and
right after that again left me a few days on ghost. I get very anxious and now I took some Steps back because Im Also insecure and dont want to ""force"" her into liking me, she have to understand that by herself after all my signs or in a long Run it Will not work for me.

We got back to talking everyday but now I wanted some answers which it was dificult because She always ignored when I Open up a bit of what I feel about this. And She Said I never invited her to anything. I Reply with honesty and Also ensure her I wanted to meet her once again and only wanted to understand if She Also wanted that or not. No answer for that. Again. Either way I told her I was out of town but in 2 weeks we could meet and we kept talking everyday.

When I came back She suddenly invites me to go to a climate protest with her colleagues because ""She was helping the organization and was told to invite anyone who was interested"" which I replied I would love to go with her but under other circunstancies and if She want the Next day I could arrange everything just tell me if you can and want. No answer. I was fucking confused and wanted to talk to her once for all ALONE.

After 1 day she only told me was expecting me to go with her to the protest because few days ago I Said was interested in being more active in supporting this type of causes BUT no answer about the rest.

I now be a man and told her I was off, a lot of confusion and incompabitiliy and its Better we dont continue talking but She could count on me if She had any problem. because I doonly answered on the Next day talking about a dog who was adopted.
Sent her a 5min voice message being completely honest about everything and no reaction from her. 

And now I'm the One with the crush on her because I cant accept the fact I ruined everything with a girl who had a crush on me for years and she's probably gonne without actually having a conversation about all this.

I am originally from Scotland and I would like to travel back to Scotland for Christmas and my sister's birthday on the 23rd December.  I would then likely return to Germany on the 30th of December, which would mean a month away from my wife.  She is very upset at the idea of me being away for a whole month and doesn't think it is fair that I leave her for so long to go and spend some time with my sister.  

To provide some context, my sister has had some health issues of late and she is somewhat alone in dealing with said issues, as our parents and extended family are not reliable; emotional or otherwise.  My sister and I have a close bond, we are best friends, my wife finds this hard to understand, and says it's normal that siblings distance themselves from one another emotionally as they grow into adulthood.  

Furthermore, when I return to Germany on the 30th, I need to apply for a residency permit, after receiving the permit I will stay in Germany for the foreseeable future, returning to Scotland for birthdays, and special events, etc. - only a handful of times in the year.  I will start working which will mean I will have even less time to travel, my wife is also pregnant, with the baby due in April 2023.  

My wife has always becomes very emotional when I have left her to go back to Scotland in the past - as the uk is no longer in Europe, I can only spend 90/180 in Germany, so I have had no choice but to leave.  Sometimes she has even become emotional when I have left the house for a few hours at a time (which only happens very rarely without her).  

I am looking for some insight as to whether it is outrageous of me to want to go back to Scotland for a month.  I feel as though it is perfectly reasonable, as I am returning to visit my family, whom I will not be able to visit as easily in the future because of priorities which will occupy my time in the coming year.

I was her first love &amp; we fell really deep over eachother. We ended on goods term but we never stopped talking to eachother. We text pretty much everyday. 

Here’s where it gets good, so she’s a very attractive young women. She could get any guy she wants, literally anyone. She started going out to the club and partying every weekend soon after we broke up. Which is fine, but I figured she would have been drowned in dick or found someone new by now to the point where we don’t talk anymore. Which to my surprise hasn’t happened. 

To me, it’s obvious we still have love for eachother bc there is really no other reason we should still be talking.

But what’s her reason for still wanting to talk to me when she has all the options in the world???

I'll be honest. Growing up I resented her. She got everything I wanted. Got the attention, the items pretty much anything she wanted she got. She was never particularly nasty to me but I knew I was the black sheep of the family and just wanted people to love me. I definitely was worse to her than she was to me and I most likely caused grief in her younger years. 


Back in 2018 I was arrested for some bad shit that ended with child endangerment and 2 months in jail as well as being abandoned by most of my family which was very understandable since I was so toxic and hurt them deeply 


That kicked my ass into gear and is what helped me sober up and start trying to better my life. I've apologized to everyone and am trying to live my life every day as a better person and the only one that really doesn't talk to me is my sister which I understand. 



I'm now engaged and in a happy and healthy relationship and my relationship with most of my family is amazing I'm aware of my past and make no excuses for how I was because there aren't any excuses for it no matter what I thought at the time. 


People that know me now know and love me and don't give a crap about my past because they see who I am now. 


Last night at work I had a regular come in that I find out works with my sister.  First thing he says when he sees me is ""your sisters told me stories about you and where to look for your lovely mugshots"" and started ridiculing me about it.


I tried saying the usual "" yeah,  I was a piece of shit and just terrible to people I'm glad I was put in jail cause look at me now! Engaged and on my way to college for dietician studies!"" But he just blew over that and started talking about my arrests and what she's been telling him and it all just hurt... 


It made me realize that no matter how much I try to do better or be better that's all she's ever going to see and think of me.


I don't blame her for her resentment of me but that just made me realize that she really did choose to ignore my messages asking to see her or talk to her or meet up because she just doesn't see me as a good person. 


I'm at the point that I just don't want to try anymore and let her feel this way towards me.


I had to deal with a lot of therapy, harassment, death threats, being homeless, and jobless after everything I did and had to literally claw my way out of the shit hole I dug. 

6 months after my arrest I moved into my own 2 story house that I was solely responsible for everything with while working 60-70 hour weeks and keeping my head down while bettering myself before trying to get my family back. 


A year after I met my now fiancée (36m) and we moved in and my life has only gone up from there whereas my sister has struggled with a lot after she graduated  (all reasonable but unfortunately sad reasons) but some of which she caused herself through bad choices. I did help her out whenever she needed it like watching her child (not the one involved in the child endangerment) started trying to talk to her and build a bond and getting her things she asked me for before my last arrest and I thought our relationship was getting better. 
 

I still want her to do great in life but u just don't want to keep getting dragged down by my past that I've already suffered and tried to make amends for. 


She doesn't owe me forgiveness in any way but at this point I feel like I should just cut my losses and be happy that everyone else in my family besides her accepts me and basically tells me to shut up about my past because they see that isn't me anymore and shouldn't lose the rest of my life over it. 


Am i just reading too much into this?
 Could it just be something she thinks is funny to talk about and I should just let it go cause she might not see it the same way as me?
Is there anything I can do to build a relationship with her again even if it is slow moving?

She deserves whatever feelings she has towards me and feel as though trying to reach out more would do more harm than good at this point to her mental well being.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7588139,public,self,should I just accept that my sister will never see me as a good person?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yz94u0/should_i_just_accept_that_my_sister_will_never/,all_ads,6,

The relatives (literally everyone in the family) are generally nice to me, but I don't think they're nice people. They don't want to question their beliefs or listen to reasoning.

- believe that our country needs a dictator

It’s frustrating. Her going on a date after meeting me, her telling me about her date even though I said I don't want to hear about your dating life, her getting harassed. 
I don't know what to do. I still love her but even imagining her with another guy angers me let alone her telling me about it.
I tried to help her with the harassment but after that, I told her I don't want to stay in touch with you for a while.
Seeing her getting back to dating so fast and me being incapable of even thinking about other girls makes me feel hopeless, even tho I was the one that broke up with her and I still do believe it was the right decision.
I feel bad that I couldn't do much about her harassment. She doesn't want me to talk about this with the guy that harassed her.
Now I feel like a loser and I can't picture myself dating anyone any soon, I don't plan to date for a while, I want to focus on myself, but I feel uneasy and without confidence. Can someone with a similar experience, share their journey with me?
