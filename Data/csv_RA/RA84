These reactions can stem from misunderstandings, arguments or me talking back. He says I don’t know how to keep my mouth shut and I talk too much.

Want to get out of the agreement without drama or toxicity, but client would lose two books. 

I (22F) have worked in the entertainment industry for a while. An acquaintance I worked on a film with invited me to audition for another film, and I decided it would be my last one. I've worked on some large projects before then, and some big (non-film,) projects since. 

I got through several rounds of auditions for the film and beat out every actress in the region. 1.5 years later I was fired, and instead of ""thank you for your time, we've decided to go a different direction,"" it was over an hour of vicious bullshit. While working on the film, I started working on a book with the director, who got the art the same day I was bitched out. I was being abused at home and literally slept on a co worker I'd met once two years ago's couch to get to a rehearsal in the morning one time. Director was aware. The friend who recruited me to the film said my client said I was ""never meant to be permanent."" I was being abused at home and told I was going to go to film in Georgia the next month.

That was 2019-2020. 2021 I became homeless. It was really rough as a legally oprhaned college student to suddenly have to find housing for myself and my younger sibling. One of my family members, who other members purchased a family home for, threatened to kill us to get the house sold when the market went up. People will do anything for money, man. Well, a month into being homeless, I get the contract for the book deal, and it's not how it was presented to me at all. It even said he was just buying paintings I didn't do for the book that I was allowing him to do for the cover. I got that taken out, but had no other bargaining power if I wanted my paintings back when this was all over. I didn't even realize how bad the contract was until the second book. 

When I was homeless he asked me to do two more books. I turned in three illustration for te next and moved on to the other project work, which was a front cover and the formatting. My work load changed to a wrap and he tried to gaslight me that we had discussed a wrap. I haulted work, recognized this as a pattern of behavior, (for instance, I did a sketch per story on the last book, and when I turned in the approved sketches, he claimed two were missing,) and looked at the last contract. It was not at all the agreement I agreed to. Now, listen, you're better off making decisions drunk than homeless. I was told I would get money from merchandise, which is in the email containing the contract, but the contract itself says I ""may"" get paid for merchandise. That's not a simple mistake a grown adult makes and I can't simply go off his word like I was. He also lied about what an exclusive agreement was and continues to reassure me I have more rights than I do on paper, such as the right to exhibit my work. He has some work for the next book and I haven't been paid still, not to mention when I asked for a 3% royalty he reduced the whole payment by 60%. He went back on that when he realized I wasn't going to do another whole book for $150. Again, I was literally homeless at the time.

I met recently with him to get the physicals back and asked to get the contract clarified. It's so vague and obviously only focuses on f\*cking me over. I emphasized how this would benefit my client to have the contract clarified, such as if a publisher/distributor came along, he could clearly show he has the right to use the work. We decided we would each take two weeks to look at it and get the new agreement formed before January. A week later, he sends me an email that h's pushed the schedule up and will need it sooner. I let him know I'm still working on it. He sends another email with information opposite than what he said just one week earlier. I recognized this pattern of behavior--every time I might be able to make a choice, he turns things upside down. 

I started calling attorneys the next day. I meet with one in a few days to see how I can legally get out of the agreement. I want to ask to get out of it first. How should I approach this with my client? I'd like to do a mutual recession (I return money, he returns the work and rights). But, obviously he'd lose his first two books and wouldn't want to do that. But, it's not going to be a successful business venture. I don't think he'll be willing to hear me out, but, it might be worth a shot. I know that having my name attached to the project won't give him the benefits he was hoping for at this point (I had my 15 minutes of fame and still get stories written about me regularly), if I am not willing to promote the project for no money, which, I was asked to do. While I was homeless he literally asked me to go to events and sell the first book for him, which I have no royalty for. I just want out, but I'd like to do so in a way where I can break things off and they won't get toxic. I know he's a bad person but I hate confrontation. 

The book would be cool, but I never agreed to give up what I gave up, the process was traumatic, and it won't be good to be legally bound to this person for more than a decade. I'd have to box up my own paintings, which are self portraits, and pretend they don't exist the way this contract is written.

My family are so argumentative. 
My mom struggles with depression sometimes and can cause so much stress and arguments over little things.
My sister also struggles with these things.
Whilst my Dad isn't diagnosed with any of these things, he gets incredibly stressed and behaves in a similar way at times.


We are 4 adults now living at home. I have tons of my own things I'm dealing with, life, career, relationships, friendships etc and then come home to all the mess.
My dad is terrible with money, when either me or my sister owe him anything, he repeatedly mentions it and starts saying about the struggles of money and rising living costs etc. I agree with this, it's not easy, but he really doesn't help himself, there are hundreds of ways he could save a little money here and there. However he just snaps and starts bringing up personal insults if anyone suggests this.
He insults me about my career, my sister about not having a job, etc etc. Yet when he owes us money, it gets angry if we ask for it and brings up all the little things from years ago where he feels he should be owed money (like driving me to work years ago). I am constantly letting him off with money he owes me, as it's just not worth the hassle. I'm sure he owes me for things years ago still, but I just lose track of it over time.


My sister is going through a tough time with college and is struggling a bit with her mental health, so she can be really difficult to be around, or she just becomes really reclusive. She doesn't help herself for various reasons. People try to help, but she won't accept it. 
Now my sister and dad are getting into money arguments like I've had in the past. They owe each other things and it gets blown out of proportion, with arguing. It's the same as with me, he is terrible when he's owed anything, but when it's the other way, he's constantly asking for it back. Now she's claiming to be short of money and struggling until her next student loan. I personally think she should have got a part time job years ago, but no one ever agreed until recently.
When I finished college I had to start paying my parents rent, I was told that starts if I have a job or not. Whereas my sister has always been left of on this, until she gets a job.


Whilst my mom gets so angry over the smallest things, starts screaming about everything and then crying.


I'm so on edge whenever I'm at home, everyone's moods are changing constantly and I'm scared to say anything in case it starts an argument.
Most of the issues lately are about money, but I don't know what to do. My parents need to save money and stop wasting it on unnecessary things or overpaying on various bills, which they could easily move suppliers for example. If I say this, I just get screamed at.
My sister, I've offered to help her earn money or get a job, but she always has excuses as to why she can't apply for any. I've also offered to help my parents make money, but they just say they aren't interested.
At the same time I don't think either my parents or sister are in the worst place financially, they are not in a great place, but also not in a bad place - they just get along.



It's so difficult for me to be in such a stressful environment, but I have so many of my own issues going on that I can't move out just yet. I've been struggling at my job and having to find a new one, as my current workplace has toxic management and is getting me down (on top of all the home stress). I feel like I'm only just getting by each day at the moment, I've lost my motivation. I feel like I'm just surrounded by issues at work and at home. 
I don't have a partner or many friends either, so it can be isolating. Financially I'm doing okay. I've worked hard on my career for the last few years and also have a little side hustle. So whilst I'm in the toxic job, money luckily isn't a big issue to me. That might well change soon though, depending on what happens with my job.

The beginning of our relationship was pretty rocky as both our our situations were complex. We met at a party when we were both 17 and started talking from there. We got close over the coming months and I started to develop deep feelings for him. None of his actions within the first couple months moved me to believe he felt differently so I let myself allow my walls down. He was homeless constantly, a foster kid who was troublesome and could never stay in a home longer than two months. He was involved in gangs which I was aware of and thought I could look past given the fact that I was nearly 18 and had plans to move away for college. We had previously discussed this and he supported my dreams. Now my devotion to him may have been too premature. There were countless times I would give him rides, pick him up to spend the night at my parents house (I risked sneaking him in and got caught a handful of time). I also would do practically anything he asked as long as it was legal and not involved in anything criminal. 2 Months into the relationship I find out he is cheating on me through his side chick texting me. It took two whole days for her to confess and my heart was completely shattered. I had never been cheated on before and already struggled with attachment issues stemming from childhood trauma. Due to it being the beginning of our relationship and possibly my guilt of leaving him alone and homeless I regrettably took him back. Our relationship continues and he constantly worked to make sure I was okay and reconcile for cheating on me but the trust issues were far too imbedded in my subconscious. Eventually after about a year of dating I thought we’d just break it off when I left for college but he didn’t seem to want to let me go so I tried a shot at long distance. It was terrible due to him having poor communication skills and always assuming me presenting our relationship issues as me being unhappy with him. There was a lot of red flags I overlooked with him because I thought he loved me in the way I did him. He continued to treat me like shit, texting other women and having nudes in his phone he claimed “don’t know how they got there”. I stupidly forgave him again and even tried to get even by meeting up with another guy I previously had sexual relations with. I couldn’t even kiss this dude I felt such a heartwrenching guilt and couldn’t understand how my bf had the heart to do something like this. I left and apologized to the guy for wasting his time. Our relationship progressively got better as he worked on communication but his jealousy and possessiveness caused many other issues. I continued to do my own thing despite the relationships imperfection and eventually graduated with my BA. As I had previously mentioned he was involved  in some criminal shit and eventually ended up getting locked up 1 1/2 years of our relationship. Again I tried to leave but he sort of guilted me into staying as he has no family and no friends and I was the only one he could turn to. Things turned out way better than I anticipated. He began to take time to really learn to love me and work on us and I can say that I was actually really happy with him for the first time. He helped me with my anxiety, was patient and kind and seemingly changed for the better due to his incarceration. We had said we loved each other back n the first couple months of dating and I said it first. He didn’t reply just hugged me and a couple weeks later told me he loved me too. We had been doing so good, got to a point of amazing communication and our relationship has vastly improved. We used to fight atleast three times a week and now we only argue every couple months. He is now sentenced and I have been by his side for the last 3 years loyally, however my whole world is being questioned due to his actions yesterday. We were having a video visit similar to facetime for inmates and he told me he wanted to be honest with me always and confessed to me that he didn’t start loving me until he got locked up and left all the criminal shit he was in. He basically stated that he kept me around because I was a good woman with a sweet heart and he wanted to continue his family legacy by getting me pregnant and preserve his last name. I asked him why he wouldn’t just let me leave him all those times and he said it’s bc of tha above reason and the fact that he thought he would die or be jailed and didn’t want to make a connection. with me so I wouldn’t have to suffer. Basically he lied for 2 years about really loving me because he wanted to continue some bullshit legacy. As I type this out I realize i’m the idiot who allowed him to treat me like this and I should have left him long ago. He had me fooled and he called me today after dropping that bomb on me and wondered why I can barely speak to him. He thinks him being honest clears him of all wrongdoing and wants the relationship to continue. He will likely be out in about two years and I have already been waiting this long for him. I just feel like i’ve been getting played and all this love I thought I felt was my own. He has changed a lot and seems to be constantly devoting himself to me but this confession has skewed everything I now know. Do you think he is being true in his intentions to be with me or is he just playing me for a fool? I’ve made so many sacrifices for him and don’t want to end up in a unhappy marriage and I know he wants to be with me forever but after this confession I can’t help but feel like he’s only doing it for himself and not bc he actually loves me.

I, 21(M) met someone online 6 months ago, from a country a few thousand kilometers away. 

We became gaming buddies for a long time and spent most of our respective days playing games together, mostly by text at the beginning, it was a great time as i was (still is) through a dark period, that person also happened to be in the same boat, with mental health problems. It was really comfy to have someone to talk deep things with, far from my usual friends group.

At the time i didn't know that person was female, technically they are not, since they refer to themselves as agender &amp; asexual. They are of my age.

Nothing really changed once i learned that, i really was too focused on my own many problems and my last relationship dates back 4 years ago, i didn't think much of it and we kept talking as much and nothing changed one bit, at this point if we are not playing games together all day, we are talking by text. We became close for long distance friends as we related a lot of our relative problems.

Time passes and i notice that i'm becoming more and more careful of what i'm writing, what they write, and things like those. It's like i knew what i was going for, at the time one of my first thought when i noticed it was ""oh shit, i'm falling in love, this is not good at all."" So clearly i ended up falling in love, and i don't really like it, for many a few reasons. We have a lot of things in common, but i don't think when it comes to relationship we do.

Long distance relationship : they are into that, i'm not really, i understand why people do them but i know i'd struggle with them for many reasons.

Sexuality stuff : I'm a straight man, and at my best a bi-curious straight man, they are asexual, you could call that opposites.

And some other small other things but those are the big twos that makes me believe we are best staying friends, even if it pains me of course. I am still in fact very much in love and i hate that it is such an unlogical reaction for me since from the few things i described above, i shouldn't be, i like to believe i'm logical with relationships, all kind of them, and i know love is unlogical and nobody truly understands it, but shit, it pains me.

The biggest dealbreaker should be the long distance part, sadly my brain is greatly imaginative and since i have plans to move out of my country summer 2023 (to something completely unrelated) and they wish to leave their own country too, yeah, you connect the dots. Love-struck me won this war.

I think that's a good resume of the situation i could go on and on but that should be enough to understand, now to defuse it, that's where i need your help. What do i do ?

Do i share my feelings, risking to lose a good friend and worse be in a bad relationship ? 

Do i share them my exact train of thought on this situation risking it to be awkward, since my brain is stuck on ""i want it (i'm in love)"" / ""no you don't (logical)"" and it could affect our friendship and myself over time ?

Do i try to distance myself and kill my own feelings with time ? 

What would you guys do, any idea would help. I've never been confronted to such a thing and as a treat i also blame myself a lot for it. Keep in mind for the entire duration of it i've never flirted or hinted things, in fact i did the opposite and stated multiple times things that, in their part of the story, would clearly hint i'm not interested in such a relationship, nor would do such a relationship if it would happen. 

It's basically a battle of the logical vs the unlogical. Brings quite a bit of stress and anxiety, and i'd like ways to end it, i still care about the outcome but i'm feeling like it's taking a toll of me mentally, i'm writing it really factually but my brain doesn't always think like that, and it brings different pains.

And no, i don't really know what their feelings could be for me, either i'm horrible at reading hints, or there hasn't been any, or we both couldn't care less of a relationship right now. Maybe they are in the same boat as me, who knows. But this is not the point, i want to get rid of my feelings, please help with advices.

TL;DR : i'm very clearly in love with someone i can relate a lot, discuss a lot of subjects and spend a lot of time together, yet the logical part of me tells me this wouldn't work out as best as the dumb love-struck me imagines it, but i keep believing because i'm in love.

I didn’t give him an ultimatum or push anything. I just stated that the end goal was different for both us, so it’s best we remain cordial w/o sex. He actually responded and said he wanted a gf, and once he said that, I knew the big emphasis was “not with you.” He gave me some shitty reasons as to why he felt like he can’t be in a relationship with me. I’d rather just be told someone doesn’t like me then a list of untrue things.

It got to a point in the conversation where I was expressing my frustration about the lack of honesty, and it seems like all he did was rewrite my text messages and send them back to me? For example, I wrote “You kept trying to come back, even though you were aware of the boundaries” and his text message response was, “You kept coming back for what??” Even though I never came back after we would have a falling out, it was always the other way around.

I don’t think is gaslighting, i know that’s such a popular word but I don’t want to accuse someone of doing that, if that is not the case. Is there another name for this? When you’re sending messages or talking to someone, and they are just repeating what you said? I feel like he’s trying to make me seem crazy or like the bad guy, when it actually didn’t need to be a big issue, I just suggested we move forward, but cordially and not involving sex.

But I’m just scared. 

Just for some context I’m in a t4t relationship and both of us are autistic. We’ve been dating for over 8 months now and we’re semi-long distance. We meet up roughly once a month, however recently it’s been less frequent because of work + university. 

My partner is a very social person and talks a lot. They’re very romantic and touchy. Unfortunately I’m the complete opposite, my social battery is much much smaller and a lot of the time I just want to be on my own and do my own thing. And I’ve recently figured out I’m most likely aromantic because I really struggle with romantic stuff and especially expressing it. 

At the beginning of the relationship it was great and I didn’t really struggle with the romantic side of things. But as time has gone on it’s become more and more of a struggle. (My partner doesn’t know that I’m aromantic yet but I do plan on telling them soon). I’m really struggling to keep up with them romantically and I can already tell that I’m going to break their heart one day. Which really scares me. 

We’re both very involved in eachother’s friendship groups so if anything happens I don’t just lose the relationship but a lot of friendships too.

I don’t want it to sound like I’m just complaining about my partner and that we don’t get along or anything. We do really get along and everything, however I do feel like the relationship is draining me constantly. I’m not sure if that’s because of my partner being “high maintenance” or the myriad of mental health issues I’m currently struggling with or a bit of both.

My (30M) relationship (29F) seems to be at a real crossroads and I just need somewhere to vent and get some feedback. I’m also going to try and talk about my own flaws and make sure this isn’t just a one sided thing. 

We’ve been together for about 12 years. We had issues early as we did long distance for a little while. (About 1000 miles). Things also weren’t the most serious early on, it was more of a fling and messing around that turned into something more. 

We’ve kind of been at a stagnant state. I’ve never found a real legit career as I was chasing a new industry in an expensive state. It brought along a lot of challenges just for myself and progressing forward. She went to college and got a good job and has done well for herself as well as helping me along the way. She’s wanted a ring for years, understandably, but my money has  always held me back. We haven’t been able to afford a larger apartment which she’s so desperately wanted, but it has allowed us to do alot of traveling and going to national parks which is one of the things we really connect on. 

We’ve always had a good physical relationship but emotionally, I haven’t been there for awhile I don’t think. While doing distance (8 years ago) she got drunk and cheated on me, it sent her down a dark and sad path. She just started telling me all these things and feelings she had for other people, things she wanted. She was really messed up and had a bad chemical imbalance. I still think about that and think we should’ve just broken up then. I was in a new place, I think I could’ve just lived and learned about myself but we didn’t, we tried to make things work even after. (She was very attractive to me and with my rough childhood growing up, I didn’t think I’d find anyone better to be honest). 

Now we’re 12 years in, been in this small apartment for about 5 years and the last 3-6 months have been bad. My affection has really gone away; she tells me time and time again she wants more and I feel I try to do little things but it’s never enough and the way she gets onto me brings up old feelings of how my parents used to be. It feels like nagging. I get annoyed and very short quickly when I just feel like she won’t stop and even take a breather. She just hammers her thoughts and feelings over and over. She has bad anxiety, and we’ve talked and think she may have undiagnosed like ADHD or something because she hyper-fixates on things and has a short fuse. I’m much more relaxed and don’t know as well how to deal with the anxiety when it starts to show. It just feels like complaints about everything and I just don’t want her to like let every little thing bother her to where she can’t even enjoy anything. 

At the same time of this she has put on weight and I’m not as attracted to her as I used to be. I know that sounds shallow, but physical attraction for me has always been a big thing. Also being together for so long, I find myself yearning for other women. We live somewhere that there is no shortage of attractive women so it makes it hard for me to just focus on her. And like I’ve been with her for so long I just i don’t know, I feel im missing out on experiencing other women in this one life. (I have not been cheating or anything like that). 

The fighting recently has drained us but I think we’re so comfortable with one another as well as being together for so long, we are too scared to maybe end it. Even though it’s been miserable recently.  She doesn’t have a ton of friends and I’ve always been there through the worst, and I may not be financially able to stay here by myself. I’m not just staying for that, I still hold my own, I just wouldn’t be able to do as much without her and I recognize that. 

I’m not sure if we’re in love like I think we used to be. I’ve changed as I’ve grown into thinking like how do you just find one person and stay with them forever? It seems so unrealistic. But I see friends that date for a few months, a year and they are sure they want to be with this one person forever. But like I don’t want to be alone when I’m older, as well as I realize being 30, not sure how many people are just trying to have fun and flings and not be ready to settle down. I just feel I missed out on that being in a relationship this long during my 20s. 

Maybe im the problem/ asshole and because of how I’m feeling, maybe that should tell me. I just don’t know. If you want to call me an ass, that’s fine. This is Reddit, the internet, I don’t ask for everyone to be super nice in the replies but maybe just try and give me constructive criticism or something. I’d love to hear from people

So to start, I feel like I should provide some backstory for context:

\- My dad works full time from home, he wakes up just about everyday at 7am and works until 5 or 6pm. He doesn't really have a part in the house cleaning. Mainly on weekends, he'll so things such as yard work, or if my mom and I tell him he needs to clean something up, he does that ( dishes, bathroom, etc)

\- I'm a full time student and quit my part time job in May. My dad offered to give me a little spending money as long as I do most of the chores around the house (sweep, mop, dishes, things like that) to relieve my mom of some of her stress. I took up on the offer for a few months until I found another part time job which I started almost a month ago. So I no longer have the routine of waking up every morning, clean, start my work. I mainly just clean up after myself like wash my own dishes, clean my areas, etc. Basically, what I dirty, I clean up. Also, I stay in my room doing school work for most of the day so I really don't think I make huge messes in the family room/kitchen.

\- My mom also quit her part time job in May and does not work currently and just stays home all day. 

It's just us 3 living together at our house.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent events: 

Lately she's been having a really horrible attitude and has been so on edge with my dad and I. She'll come out to the living room/kitchen and get upset because ""the house is mess."" She does everything she used to do before I took my dad's offer. She complains that there's dirt everywhere when she sweeps because of our indoor dog, things are not in the right place, etc. She ""bad mouths"" my dad saying he's dirty/disgusting how can he live like this, cuss here and there and so on. (my mom never really cussed before so this is really out of her character imo). There's a lot more that I can probably think of, but like I said my mind is everywhere rn.

&amp;#x200B;

Today: 

Same string of events- she comes out, complains about the house being ""filthy."" My dad let my dog out to do his business and came to the door covered in grass. Since my mom had just cleaned the floor, I went out and tried to shake off as much grass as I could from my dog. No problem. Next thing you know I hear her complaining that ""there's grass everywhere, I just cleaned"" and asking who let our dog back inside. My dad said well just sweep it up and went back outside for yardwork. My mom then yelled ""WHOS GOING TO SWEEP IT UP? WHO?!"" 

So, I went to the kitchen where my mom was and I see like 5 pieces of grass. So I just swept it up. It's not a hard thing to do. But hearing her get after us everyday is just taking a toll on me. I don't want to do anything more than the bare minimum because of her attitude with us. Unfortunately, I snapped and said something like ""there's like 3 pieces of grass why are you having a heart attack???? it's not hard to just sweep it up really quick."" She started arguing saying that our dog came inside full of grass and which is untrue because I went outside and shook most of the grass off. I then said ""did you not see me go outside and clean him??"" (she was sitting right by the back door btw, so I'm not sure how she didn't see me?) She said she didn't see me and that we're inconsiderate of her all the time, and especially now because she had just finished cleaning. I then told her that when I took over house chores I didn't get mad her or my dad everyday, I can't control what our dog does outside but I went out there and cleaned him off. I seriously can't remember what else was said after that but it was really short and now here I am writing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has been, for a lack of a better term, a ""neat freak"" for as long as I can remember. And I feel like she's building up anger and overall just getting worse. My family has always believed she may have some type of OCD, but we don't know.

We met in high school so most of my high school friends know her, but I'm not in contact with many of them.

However, there is one friend who I'll call Luke with whom I still have a close friendship. In high school, he never had any girls, I think he didn't even talk to any of them. In college, he had some female friends, but nothing special so it happened that the only girl he was in contact with was my girlfriend.

When Luke first met my girlfriend, he kind of ignored her existence and he seemed anxious around her, not daring to talk. As years went by, he started to act more comfortable around her and talk more. He would even comfort her and give her advice if she was feeling bad like a friend would do and he would open up to her sometimes.

I was glad they got along because, in the beginning, it was awkward to have them together but later the atmosphere was more relaxed.

Now move on to the problem, a few months ago, when we got engaged to be precise, he started acting strange. When we are all together I sometimes catch him staring at her and when she looks at him, he turns away and seems embarrassed. He also started ignoring her again and being distant in general, but I didn't think much of it.

Yesterday, Luke and I were alone and he got a little drunk, which is not something he usually does and he has gotten emotional with me. After some deep talks, he started saying how lucky I am and how he wants to move somewhere far away where no one knows him and stay there for the rest of his life cut off from everyone. When I asked him why does he feel that way, he just shrugged it off and changed the topic. 

Now I'm a little confused, I don't know if his behavior is caused by my engagement and if so, why or if it is just a coincidence. Should I ask him why is he acting that way or leave it alone?

I’m hoping I can find some advice here! Or at least some assurance that I’m being too paranoid lol.

&amp;#x200B;

 I’m 27f. I have a three year old son. My husband passed unexpectedly a few months ago. We live in a somewhat small town so there are a lot of people who live around here who I either knew from growing up in this town, or I’m just like one degree separated from-like our neighbor, “Jake” (39m). Him and his family (wife and kids) live directly next door to me, we share a side yard and our backyards connect. I graduated with his younger brother and knew his family, sort of. When we moved in Jake’s wife invited us all over for dinner, they have a younger daughter who likes to dote over my son, they’re just an all around friendly family and we got on with them very well. 

&amp;#x200B;

The week after my husband passed everything went wrong. The power in our house blew for no reason and the power company had no idea why. It was the middle of the night so it was going to take them a while to come out and look at it but Jake was able to come over and fix it. A few days later my car wouldn’t start and again Jake was there to fix it. Then I got sick and him and his wife cooked for me until I felt more myself. Then after that it was just any time something went wrong or I needed a hand I would ask Jake for help (because of how close our houses are I usually see him or his wife or his kids a thousand times a day). 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I had a wedding to go to and I brought along my sister as my guest. The venue was in a different state in an area I was unfamiliar with. My sister doesn’t drive and uber isn’t a thing around here. The day before I was telling Jake how worried I was to drive there, and he told me that he knew the area and he’d drive us, hang around the town and get something to eat and hang out while we were at the wedding and then drive us home (we didn’t stay at the wedding all night, just until about 10pm). I turned on my location to share with him that night and I thought that I had turned it off but I guess I thought I was turning off sharing for him and actually turned it off for my mom or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is a few days ago my son and I randomly decided to sleep over my mother’s house. I have my phone on DND but it’s set that if someone calls multiple times the 2nd call will go through. I guess Jake had been texting and tried to call but it only went through when he called the 2nd time. When he called it was like 2AM and he had already texted a bunch of times, asking me if I was alright and why I wasn’t home, etc. I told him everything was fine and I had just decided to sleep over my moms, figuring he had just seen that my car wasn’t in the driveway and got concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I’m gardening in the backyard when Jake’s wife comes out and she’s really upset. She tells me that she thinks Jake is having an affair-she says he’s been getting more and more distant with her, they haven’t been spending as much ‘couples’ time together, and she said the nail in the coffin was that last night he had gone out at about 9PM and didn’t come back until after 2AM and he just told her he was out at a bar (which he doesn’t ever do). I just told her that I was really sorry she thought that and that if there was anything she needed to just ask me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now just a few hours ago I went out to get my mail and Jake was in his front yard doing yard work. We were talking and I mentioned that I had taken my son to a local park the other day and he was casually like “oh yeah i saw that you were there”.  I was kind of confused and I was like you saw us there? why didnt you say hi? And then he was like no I meant on the phone” but then he changed the subject REALLY quickly before I even fully realized what he meant.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn’t until I came inside that I realized he meant that he was watching my location on his phone. And I went back and checked and realized that I hadn’t shut it off I got kind of freaked out. That he could have been watching my location this entire time you know? I don’t know how often he checks it. And was he watching it that night I was over my mothers? But I don’t know if I’m being too paranoid  or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to confront him but I do want to know how long/often he's been checking my location, I guess because I didn't stop sharing it he thought I was okay with it but again I REALLY thought I had, I know there's nothing WRONG with him knowing my location but I just feel a little uncomfortable that he would almost like keep tabs on me?

&amp;#x200B;

But even now as I'm writing it out I kind of think I'm overreacting?

I'd like to make it clear that our relationship was in no way my choice or his when it first started out. I grew up in a very toxic and cult like environment. When I was 17 and him 27 we were set up to get married by our guardians.(My stepfather and his adoptive mother) Neither of us agreed with it but we didn't have a way to get out as we had both been abused an manipulated by those around us. I was too scared to disagree to fight it at the time because I knew I'd be starved, locked the basement for weeks or beaten. Overtime we became closer as friends and started our plan to get out of there with my siblings. I think it's important to know that he did save my life(I was stabbed when we tried to leave) and without him I would have died. Maybe that's why I didn't realize what was going on until much later, I literally trusted him with my life. I think it was that we had just bounded from the trauma on an unhealthy level and we just didn't know any kind of love or affection but what we got from one another, but our relationship ended up turning intimate. I admit I became very dependent on him and often had panic attacks when he wasn't around but as things went on I was constantly having panic attacks even when he was around.( I didn't want to disappoint him or be ungrateful for what he had done for my family and I) Overtime found that I hard started to become afraid of him especially when he started to yell our raise his hands at me. It wasn't until I started to get exposure to the world I realized he was mentally and physically abusing me and him overpowering me to have s*x without my consent was considered rape. When I had our twins ( a boy and girl both a year now) I felt I didn't have any way out and was scared to tell my friends and my siblings about what was happening. I felt that if I was just good and behaved he wouldn't harm them. I consider myself very lucky that those close to me realized what was going on and made me feel safe enough to confined in them. They helped me get out.

I've gotten therapy and feel I'm in a place of recovery and have even started dating my current partner. Their supported me through everything and never pushed me to talk to him. My twins are very happy and comfortable with them and so am I.

Last night however my ex showed up and wanted to see the twins(who were thankfully at my biological dad's house) and talk to me, my current partner wouldn't let him in but he ended up forcing his way anyways. My partner went to call my older brothers(one of which is a police officer) and the authorities to get him out. While I choose to stay in the living room and talk to him to deescalate the situation. I wasn't scared of him anymore, and I was ready to defend myself if I needed too. My partner only went into the other room because I told them too call the police.  My ex told me that he loved and cared about me and our kids and understood what he had done wrong to make me leave. That he had gotten help and wanted to be better. I simply told him that if this was true we might be able to figure something out but I wasn't going to let him be alone with them unsupervised. He admitted he didn't fully trust himself yet and felt it was the best option. At this point I started to regret telling my partner to call the police but that's when my ex started to advance and come closer to me telling me that he knew I stilled loved him and that when my partner was out of the picture we could be happy again, that he could remind me how much we loved each other. He even went as far as bringing up our abusers and said that we wouldn't have been set up to be married if they didn't know what was best for me. Not us, me. That's when he forcefully restrained me and kisses me. It scared me how strong he was compared to me even after I had gone through all of my self defense training. I couldn't get free until my partner came in and and forced him off. My partner and him were yelling at each other, I was too focused on running to the bathroom to throw up to hear what they said. I was in there for a half an hour crying and shaking and throwing up violently. It took two of my brothers my partner and a very nice female officer to calm me down. My ex was arrested and I'm still thinking about pressing charges. My partner thinks I should but I can't stop thinking about what he said, it made me feel like everything was a lie, that I never really escaped anything and that it was all some form of manipulation to get me in deeper so I couldn't escape. I'm scared that if he goes to jail I'll never get the answers I need. I don't know what to think and I'm not sure what to do and I just can't get over how my body reacted to what he did. I'm worried about sharing everything that I feel with my current partner, I don't want him to hate me.

We know each other from around 6 years. She also happens to be one of my relatives. So 6 years ago I moved to this house which was pretty close to her's, we started spending time with each other and in no time we became the best of friends. Almost everything between us was a match our eating preferences, music, humour, our thoughts were similar, it was as if a telepathy level thing going on.

We supported each other through everything and grew together all the way through our teenage. It was something very special for both of us. But I also knew that she wasn't ready for a relationship this soon. So one day around a year ago i shared this thing to one of our mutual close friend that I really love her and that I can't imagine my life without her.

So now this guy for some reason spills this out in front of her, and fortunately she had same feeling for me too. Then things went smooth we actually confronted each other and finally started dating. It was as if a dream come true for me. We both were happy and things went well.

But again somewhere i knew she didn't want this to happen this soon. Then one fine day after dating for like 2 months there comes the msge. She broke up and the reason she gave was that the one I already saw coming, she had some other priorities in her life and that she wants to focus on her career and think about this later in the future. Now I respected her thoughts didn't over react and was okay with it.

So now it's been 10 months since we broke up and things have been pretty rough between us. We barely spoke to each other. I did try to get her to talk about this but it didn't work and actually she also said a clear NO to me couple of times. But me being the one who understands her (and knowing she somewhere loves me deep down there) am still holding on to it. Now i am literally all confused as to what to do. Also she isn't ready to comit to anyone any time soon.

Need some advice as to what to do, should I wait for her or should I move on. But i really don't want to i really love her and also I know that she somewhere loves me too.

I'm really venting but would love some advice of what to do next.

Oct. 2nd my boyfriend(32M) and I(30F) went to a concert together. We were having a great time the entire time. We were both drinking and well drunk for the first time in a month or so having a lot of fun. I went out to get another drink and he asked if I was 'good' I said yes would you like a drink? He said yeah i want a white wine.  I've known this man and been by his side for over 2 years....never would I ever have guessed that would be his order. So I asked if he was sure? I jokingly asked if it was for the girls who were being sweet to him earlier. He flipped. It's normal for us to joke but apparently not this time. He told me he hated me that he was miserable with me and hated being around me. I tried to calm him down which worked for a half a second. Then he wanted to leave. We end up leaving we get back to his place and I have to pee. So I run in. He met me outside of the door after and told me to 'get my shit and leave' I said is this really what you want to do after 2 years? He screamed in my face to get out of his house. He slammed the door. He said I could either take the uber or he'd call the cops. I left.

Fast forward 10 days I hadn't talked to him at all during this. I had been miserable, sick to my stomach and alone. My brother and his wife had stayed the night with me once while they were in town. I had been puking on and off for the last couple days which I did once while they were there. I explained I was probably just upset about everything they told me to take a test. I did. I immediately drove to my  ex work and told him. (We work together so this has been even harder) we were very emotional he was very nice he had tried tk say sorry for how he acted but he didn't have a lot to say about it. He was also in complete shock about the announcement. He said we would figure things out and he needed to think after over an hour of talking in the parking lot.

A couple hours later he calls me spazzing out about how he found a place to do a blood test and we need to go do it right away. I said ok....I'm working but we could go  why the sudden change of tune. I already knew he had probably called his friend and his friend said he shoukd get some proof. So instead of going to the blood test somewhere random, I sent him 2 more pregnancy tests the next morning and the next week I got a blood test and sent him those. 
The day I sent the blood results he told me he wanted to he supportive but we shouldn't get back together because he wasn't happy in the relationship. I asked him to come over to talk after crying on the phone for a while asking him how can he be involved if he's not going to be around. He came over we talked for a few minutes about how his son would handle this. How this isn't what he wanted for his life and how he was really happy he could be here sitting with me. We hooked up...he left after saying it was awesome and that it was never an issue for us whatever. 
Next day I texted said I was glad he came he said he was confused and that it fucked his head up I said it was just as simple as what it was. 
He left for a trip to Vegas we were supposed to be going on together the next day.
No word while he was gone.
When he got back he texted once and asked how I was we had a really good maybe 2 hour window of texting.
Halloween rolled around and our company party was at his house (he's roommates with the boss so technically his roommates house) He was very happy to see me he said it several times and gave me a big hug.
He talked to me a couple times over the course of the night. When I was leaving I wanted to say bye to him so I told him I was leaving and asked if he wanted to walk me out he said ok. I walked down the driveway and asked how he was. His first words were 'I'm miserable. I'm really depressed and upset. But I'm just gonna keep drinking so I don't feel that' (he I'd very drunk at this point)
I told him I was sorry to hear that and tried to ask why but he was a mess. He walked me further and commented on how gorgeous I was, about how he wanted to be friends 'let's be friends' he kept saying I told him I didn't want that he said well let's be friends again. I told him we needed to talk soon because we haven't discussed much. He said yes I'll come over to talk. He told me several times he loved me, he kissed me on the forehead several times along with a few hugs and told me he would see me tomorrow. I said no you won't he said 'you never know'.. I obviously knew he was tanked and didn't take much of what he said to heart.
It's been almost 2 weeks since then....I haven't heard a word from him. He's been missing work, going out every night to party. I haven't heard anything from him at all or from anyone around him. There's a couple people at work who have told me where he is or what he's doing but I haven't asked. 
I just feel absolutely crazy. I feel like he doesn't believe me or he genuinely thinks he can run from life? I'm completely crushed and lost. He was my best friend..we got along for most everything i hated that he had a roommate adter 2 years of datingi thought it should be us living together.....
He's unrecognizable at this point... this isn't who he is. He's spiraling and he has several people around him enabling him. I'm lost on what to do. Every day I change my mind of wanting to scream at him or try to help him or just running myself. 
Any advice or similar situations or what the fuck I should do next... greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been dating since high school, so, forgive me if I sound like an alien here, I don't remember what's normal or what to do in a relationship, I'm basically relearning to walk.

We're LDR, been texting for multiple hours a day for about a month now. It quickly ramped up from when we first started speaking. We've been doing movie nights, playing games, and the chemistry is great via text but still pretty stilted/awkward during our voice calls.

I feel guilty, but I really want us to just ***chill out***. It's been like 4 weeks of this. I'm already sending good morning texts because there's an insecurity on her end about texting later in the day without one. We've been going back and forth every like... 5-15 minutes when I'm not working. It's exhausting.

Overcommunicating will totally deflate this relationship, make it not exciting, turn it into something routine and expected for us. I feel a strong connection when we talk about our past bad experiences, we bond over shared interests, like the same things, have the same intimate interests. **But I'm worried I'll get bored with how hard we're driving this thing.**

The eldest is from a previous marriage and the youngest is from my current partner. 

My partner's family is very well-off and kind. They have welcomed me and my eldest with open arms and no hesitation. They started buying gifts for my child as soon as I met them, which was very sweet. 

The issue is that both my partner and their family like to get gifts for the youngest one that don't compare to what the eldest receives. And I completely understand. They aren't really related and and don't have an obligation to get the eldest anything at all. But the youngest will get things like designer clothing, shoes, and expensive toys, while the oldest will get knock off clothing from Walmart. Or some times nothing at all.

And they notice it. Their other parent's family wants nothing to do with them. My ex spouse does not buy them anything either. I do not have extra funds for anything beyond bills. 

The eldest often brings up how they don't get equal gifts and I don't know what to say. Sometimes I will scramble to quickly buy an equivalent gift for them to avoid hurt feelings. I don't want to foster a sense of materialism, but I don't want them to feel rejected at such a young age. For example, for last year's Christmas the youngest received designer boots from the in laws. The oldest looked so hurt that they didn't get new boots as well that I went online and ordered some equivalent but less expensive ones. This strained my finances for months. I can't do it every time. 

What do I do? Do I tell my child that it's a fact of life since I don't have much money?

They're pretty out there in gen z culture I guess you could say. They're very aware of the issues in the world and very open-minded. 

When Jina was 13 they came out to me and my husband and their at the time five year old brother as bisexual. We were supportive and my husband was very caring and had a lot of questions, but overall supportive, which was surprising to me at least because he grew up in Southern Virginia and his family isn't very open-minded.

Which is why they still have no idea that Jina's gay. 

Fast forward to June of this year they came out again, but this time as lesbian and (re)introduced us to their girlfriend of six months which we were clueless about (Joel was more clueless than me I always thought they were a little too friendly), but again we were supportive nonetheless. Over dinner that same night, he had said something along the lines of ""You're always changing it up, (daughter's name) first bisexual and now fully gay what's next?"" He was joking around, but I could tell it was awkward and since my daughter's girlfriend was still there I didn't rag on him and we just continued eating. 

For the past few months, it's been okay. It hasn't been perfect. Joel still makes odd comments about their relationship which I blame on his family for making him that way, but it's never been anything completely off the rails, just awkward poor taste jokes. 

Things didn't get tense until my daughter told us over dinner that they wanted to be called they/them pronouns. I won't lie at the time I didn't completely understand why they'd wanted to change their pronouns, but I was fine with it and gave them the heads up that I might slip up because this is a new adjustment and Jina said it was okay. Joel on the other hand didn't seem so happy with the sudden change. 

A simple I don't understand would've cut it, but no he outright said he wouldn't do it. When Jina asked why he had said something like ""I've already sacrificed so much letting you be this way with (daughters girlfriends name) in my house and now you expect me to call you they? You're a girl, Jina, she."" This just started a large argument and it ended with Jina for the first time cursing at Joel nothing too harsh just a little ""fuck you."" and a door slam. 

When we were alone we continued the argument. Long story short a shit load of back and forth of why he wasn't willing to just try it, him saying he has been trying, me saying this is different and has nothing to do with her sexuality, him storming off, end of the story. 

Jina hasn't had dinner with us for a few days and it's been depressing seeing her empty seat and watching my son bring her food to her room upstairs. It hurts like hell because in my personal opinion I didn't understand the pronoun change either. I didn't get it. When I asked them about it they told me they don't align with being called she/her pronouns, but they don't want to be called he/him either they said they're somewhere in the middle I won't pretend to fully comprehend it, I still don't get it, but I've been doing mildly okay with the pronoun change. 

My husband on the other hand is indifferent to what they want to be referred to as, it's like he wants to upset them. For example, the other day my husband told my son he shouldn't bring ""her"" dinner but he shouted it while our son was halfway up the steps and stressed the ""her"" loudly I'm sure they heard it.

I don't know what to do about this. My daughter told me they ""hate"" Joel and Joel is brushing this off as a temper tantrum and keeps referring to them as she/her pronouns. We tried the sit-down and explain method, he left the room and tried a phone call to explain, but he hung up. 

My daughter is very upset over this and they keep crying and barely talk to Joel anymore, just their brother and me and they're always over they're girlfriend's house.

The brunt of it is my husband being a dick our kid is upset and I don't know how to go about this. I've tried to get him to just test the waters of calling Jina they and he said it once and then laughed after, I'm livid, like I said before I don't get it either, I'm willing to try even if I have more questions, but boy Joel is making this ten times harder than it should be.

Couple months back I got a promotion at work and with that come more responsibility, less time to spend with her and so on. She knew all that but pushed me to do it so we could achieve some of our goals quicker thanks to the good money bump that would give me. 

Fast forward to a month ago, she started complaining about having less time together but knew that since then nothing change (same amount of work was done not more, schedule was still the same etc.). We talked it out and she agreed that nothing changed and maybe she was just in need at that moment of more time together.

After that conversation I noticed a couple days after that she removed her messenger from our iPad and delete Facebook messenger. Didn’t think much of it at the time and didn’t care tbh. A couple more days after when we were both off work, she decided to go to the gym. The said gym session lasted almost 4hours… At that moment I started to question it since she usually takes maximum 1-2 hours. I asked her jokingly what took so long and she told me that she went to her friend(female with who she usually go train) to go see something at her appartement. I was like ok that’s fine and once again didn’t mind it.

3 days ago, for whatever reason, I checked my GF insta followers and following and found out she followed some dude and so did he. They both like each other photos and so on. I later found out later by questioning her that she met the dude at a party and they decided to met a week or to later to go to the gym together (the day she took 4 hours).

However, there was this one guy she was hanging out with and talking to throughout the night. She said they were joking around and teasing each other a bit. At the end of the night they were in a room and (by her own words) he said ""you drank my beer, how are you gonna repay me?"" And pushed her onto the bed. Another guy came in and told him to stop because she had a BF. They got in a fight. 

The thing that bothers me is that in my opinion you only joke like that when you're flirting with each other and I don't get why she was alone in a room with a bed when the party was in another room. And when I spoke to the guy I asked him why he got so upset as to start a fight (he didnt know I had talked to her) and he said it was nothing. Now he is her best friend's BF so it feels like they've told him to say nothing about it. I don't believe they did anything but it feels like if he didn't come in they would've.

She went on a student  exchange programme in Japan. She has been obsessed with Japan for a long  time. She said that she feels lonely there because she is the only  exchange student. Obviously, being a hot white girl in Japan she gets  constantly hit on by dudes on the street and invited for dinner, which  the dudes obviously intend as dates. I feel quite weirdly about this,  and have made it clear to her. She insists that she's just going for  these because she's lonely and for ""free food"". Moreover, due to her  obsession with Japan and wanting to go to Japan and whatnot, prior to  our relationship she started talking with a guy during the pandemic when  Tinder travel was free, and they kept semi-consistently talking since  then. She went for a day out with him, and they ended up missing the  last bus back to their city, and decided to wait for the first one in  the morning while having drinks. Later on, she realised she'll be too  tired to wait for it and the guy suggested that they go and get a hotel  for her. I called her to check whether she's alright and safe, and she  picked up the phone kind of weirdly stuttering initially and being  surprised that I called her, which is never the case and we always call  each other before going to bed. Turns out that the guy will also stay at  that hotel, although she said in a different room. As we have each  other on Apple locator, it also turns out that this is a love hotel. I  confronted her about this, and she apparently didn't know that this is a  love hotel, and that she doesn't know what they are like (she most  definitely does, as per her Japan obsession). She then got defensive  that if I don't trust her then I should f\*ck myself.

I don't know whether I can trust my gut instict, as I do find it difficult to trust people due to events in my past, but all of the above described feels wildly inappropriate to me and would never do this in a relationship myself. For context, she can be really accusative of infidelity with me, even though I never give reasons for that. (e.g. I was standing ""too close"" to a girl on a picture).

Today it got physical on both ends. 

I (22) have been in a relationship with my partner (25) for 11 months now and it started out amazing. They saved me from a severely abusive relationship and knew in advance what I was going to be dealing with after (ptsd, depression, severe anxiety, ect) and said they would be more than happy to help me through it. A couple months later we started dating and got engaged later on. Ive known them almost my whole life and considered them my best friend. I trusted them with my life. A few months ago we suffered a miscarriage and its been affecting us both differently. They work a lot more and actively seek out jobs that will leave me in the woods by myself at night when I need them most. Ive been laid in bed almost all day because the pain is just too much for be to deal with right now. When I tell them whats going on or what I need from them they either ignore my requests or laugh at my pain and that hurts me worse. In the last couple weeks, ive been getting out and doing what I can but I still have breakdowns so I know im not ready to get a job at this time. But being homeless and with little help, I cant get the mental help that I obviously need in order to get myself together again. Last week I was helping a friend get their tent insulated since its starting to get cold (got our first round of snow today) and halfway through i just started bawling. No clue why. He helped me back to our tent and got me settled while my partner was trying to boost for us. When my partner got back I was still crying and they said to ""suck it up. Youre not the one that was in jail and didnt get to even see him"". They make them going to jail for selling dr*gs(their idea mind you) seem like its my fault when I literally had no fking clue they were selling! Today, they yelled at me for waking up late after having a night full of nightmares because today marks 3 months since we lost our son and I snapped. I threw my drink at them as im begging them to stop yelling at me. They laid their hands on my for the first time and I broke. I took all the pent up rage and emotions ive kept bottled up for years out on them and I honestly feel like shit cause I did bust their nose but ive been nothing but loving and supportive while they've been nothing mentally and emotionally abusive, now physically. And I got called the abusive one. I love them to absolute death but I dont want to put myself through another abusive relationship when the last one almost killed me.

After about a year of dating, we pretty much take turns paying but I spent more on him than he did on me. I’m not normally the type that keeps a scoreboard but it’s hard to not notice his behavior.

My expenses on dating can hence range from $500-$1000 a month. I think what bothers me is that he occasionally will express how I need to make more money. He would joke about how I will need to support him so he can quit working. I don’t find it funny at all when he’s very clear that I would need to fat fire on my own. I feel pressured and drained. I also spend most of my time and energy pursuing his goals and interests. At this point, I feel like we aren’t a team and will never be. I expressed this to him and he would often reply with how I’m too emotional and have a fairytale idea of how relationship works.

You sound terrible!” 

And it's because he doesn't love me anymore and I know it deep down. He denies it whenever I try to talk to him, about the distance; and the quiet between us, but I remember what it was like to be loved by him and this isn't it. 

I think he's just staying with me because I'm convenient and easy, because I have been so scared of losing him that anything he wanted sexually all he had to do was say the word. And now even that is gone. I feel so alone. He talks to me like I'm no one at all. Like I'm a stranger at a bus stop, and it hurts so bad. I am doing a lot better mentally now, and I can see that I put up with things from him that I shouldn't have, his constant pressuring me for a threesome, his incessant need to make me understand that I'm just small and weak and stupid and that my anger and my opinions, mean nothing to him. That my taste in everything is fundamentally flawed and stupid, and that the only true purveyor of taste is himself.

I have met his family,  have flown out to see him,  more than once, and was looking to leave my own family to live near him, and I just cant do this. He doesn't love me; and I honestly think at this point he's barely tolerating me until he finds someone new. Unless he already has.

The final straw was realizing last night that we hadn't spoken since Halloween and that for the first year we were together we spoke every single day: maybe not crazy long conversations, but at least a hello. An I love you. And I have been on and off crying since then. I don't want him gone. I love him as much as I ever have, I love his temper and his smile, his incessant 90s jokes, and his awkward looks, I love the way he walks through life like it doesn't matter because I'm the kind of person, who lets things matter too much. I guess I just never expected to become one of the things that didn't matter to him.

I hope Im wrong. I hope that secretly, he's still as desperately in love as I am, but I doubt it.

She told me few days ago that she’s having a lot stress about going to med school, planning her life, reevaluating her priorities and wasn’t sure she wanted to continue seeing me because I wasn’t committing to her.

I told her that I take responsibility for this and that I saw her as a good partner the whole time and I shouldn’t have been dragging my feet. She appreciated the honesty but said she wants me alone for a while.

I think there is still some emotional attachment so my plan is the following:

1. Give her ~2 weeks to cool off.
2. Contact her and ask if she would be down to get dinner.
3. If she meets up then I will catch up with her and reiterate that I do want a serious relationship.
If she doesn’t meet up, I will buy flowers and write love songs … kidding I’d just move on.

I know there isn’t a rule that you need to be best friends with your SIL or even like your SIL but I still think you should treat people with respect. I wouldn’t be friends with my SIL outside of my relationship with my husband. I tried for so many years with her and now that my husband and I are done, she’s reaching out, putting in the bare minimum, and my MIL keeps mentioning all of us together for holidays. 

I have been with my husband (35) for six years. We have been friends for nearly 20 years. We have two children together. It’s such a great relationship. I have an amazing relationship with all of his family except my SIL. I didn’t know my SIL until I started dating my husband. When I met her she was cold towards me which hurt me. I tried to form a relationship with her. She was a bridesmaid in our wedding. When we went dress shopping she complained that she wasn’t my husband’s best man, didn’t agree with who was in our wedding party, and complained about the guest list. She couldn’t go to my bachelorette party but made that decision a few hours before our train left because she picked up a work shift the night before and would be too tired. I ended up covering her portion because I didn’t think that was fair to my other bridesmaids. She treated the wedding like a chore she didn’t want to do. When she posted pictures online she didn’t include me. “So happy for my brother”, “Going home to celebrate my brother’s wedding”, “had a great time at my brother’s wedding”. 

SIL is friends with my husbands ex girlfriend (fun fact, she was a bridesmaid in SILs wedding). My husband and this girl had a horrible relationship for many years and he does not want a friendship with her. I’m obviously not going to tell him to be friends with his ex girlfriend. It’s just a thing he mentioned to me at the beginning and that was it. Our life went on. In the last two years my SIL and MIL have become so close with the ex girlfriend, we will call her A. It’s not a problem with me. But how they handle it is what upset us. SIL ignored our daughter’s birthday party invitation three times. She didn’t even say happy birthday to her. Two weeks later she was at A’s baby’s 1st birthday party wearing a shirt about being an aunt and that A’s baby made her an aunt. This upset me and my husband immensely. 

Their involvement with A:

• When SIL posted online about A’s pregnancy two years ago she put that she will finally be an aunt. My husband and I have a 4 year old daughter.
• SIL and MIL went on a “family vacation” with A and her baby, her mom, and her MIL.
• A went for Thanksgiving last year. We couldn’t make it because it was the day before and we worked. Not only did A go but she ended up in the traditional family picture that was mailed out on the Christmas cards. (SIL refuses to spend holidays with her in laws because they had her husband’s ex girlfriend over 14 years ago).
• My MIL’s table centerpiece is the centerpiece from A’s baby shower.
• They had A over the day after Christmas to do a big gift exchange with her. When we were at MILs house she had so many presents under the tree for A, her husband, and their child. She is not like this with anyone except family.
• MIL has pictures of all of them and A’s baby hanging up on her walls.

Examples of how SIL is with me

• When I had boudoir photos done she complained to my MIL I posted the pictures online and left me a comment that as long as my husband is okay with it and I needed to be humble.She is a hip hop teacher that constantly posts in support for women cheering each other on. I have no clue why this got to her. 
• She ignores all forms of communication with me. She reads when I message her but never replies.
• When she found out I was upset about her ignoring our daughter’s birthday party she said she will take the hit and called me childish.
• When my husband asked her to try to have a relationship with me she said she isn’t going to force it. 
• Complained my husband only cares about me and our two kids.

After that I stopped. I stopped reaching out. I stopped going over when she was in town. I stopped with any gifts for Christmas, birthdays. She never got us anything so that was easy. I never heard from her after I had our baby which became the final straw.

All of a sudden since this summer she randomly will text. She reaches out to our daughter. Reached out to us for our birthdays. I’ve been around her twice and though our communication is limited she isn’t as cold. 

I don’t want a relationship with her. To deal with her ways for years and for her to have a change of heart is not my idea of a solid foundation for a relationship. She has never apologized. She has never acknowledged how she was towards me. She has pushed me to a point I’ve never been with a person before. I don’t know if she notices the change and realizes how much she took me for granted. I am not interested.

Maybe some day in the future but definitely not now. How do people move forward in these situations? I literally don’t think of her until she reaches out.

She has started to really voice her concerns regarding a lot of my behaviours. We went for a holiday and when I when she was about to cum I said “cum for me babe”, and then she came but stopped really quickly and said “I just had a thought that you’ve said that to so many girls, do we even do anything new for you?” I tried reassuring her saying that every experience is new to me with her because I have never felt like this before for anyone. I tried cuddling her and then she told me to roll over and go to sleep. So I did as I was so tired and then she got up and went to a spare room and I could hear her crying.

The next day she got up me for not letting her drive - we were in my car, it was 10pm and we had a 3 hour drive and I wasn’t comfortable with her driving my car at night.

She got up me last night because I finished work at 10pm and had to go to mine to get clothes and toiletry bag before going to hers. She said “I wish you would just plan your time with me better.”

I bought her food the other night and she didn’t eat it because I got a different meal because the shop was closed that she wanted so I surprised her with one of her other favourite meals.

Last night when I got into bed she said “what’s the point of you even coming over?” Because I got to her place late.

I had a chocolate from her fridge last night and she said “can you stop eating all my food.”

She went and saw a friend the other night - I waited in the car with a backpack packed ready to go to hers when she finished (said she was almost done at 9:30 but then didn’t hear from her until midnight. I told her that I was excited to see her and she said that she  thought I was already at her house. I said no and I didn’t want to intrude on her time with her friend and rush her to leave. She said “you didn’t tell me you wanted to see me.” I told her how I’d had packed a bag and was wanting to see her. She said that was just an excuse and if I wanted to I should have told her and it “would be nice for you to voice your wants, all my friends can do it so why can’t you?”

When I saw him my heart skipped a beat, but trying to play it cool I approached the relationship with only friendship in mind. He ended up being kind and funny. He would stare at me from across the room, leave his group of friends just to talk with me and the TEASING? Well time goes by and I don't see him at my shift. I decided to try and look for his IG. When I clicked on his profile I saw a whole highlight dedicated to his GIRLFRIEND. I was so shocked. I tried my best to get over my feelings. But after a week I had to get some answers, so I texted him on Snap. I told him how I thought my feelings were mutual but I'm aware of his girlfriend, I made sure to mention that I thought she was pretty and how I think they should stay together. He left me on ""seen"". Even worse? He didn't add me back as a friend !

So a few weeks pass and I see him in the CITY with his GIRLFRIEND and he nods his head to my sister and I (my sister knows nothing about this). I just stood there and said ""hi"". Next day I see him at WORK? We had a few shallow interactions, but I guess I'm just too real to ignore the fat elephant in the room so I was pissed and ended up flirting with his friend in front of him. After this he wouldn't look at me at all lol. The next shift I saw him, I ended up knocking over his coffee. I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. I decided that I would re-make the coffee and when I gave it to him he smiled and said ""thanks I appreciate that"". I didn't even reply I just wheezed and left. When the day was over I was walking home with my sis and he drove past with his friends, he started pulling faces. And we just stared at each other. It felt nice, but at the back of my mind I was thinking of his girlfriend. Recently it was his bday, I say happy birthday on Snap again. He replies with ""thanks that means a lot"" and I reply with the ""ok"" hand emoji. He STILL didn't add me back. 

I was so confident he only had eyes for me, I need to know. Even if he stays with his girlfriend afterward, I feel like I'm owed it! Why won't he just tell me he doesn't like me? It makes me feel like I have a chance I've given him many opportunities to tell me so?

When I first met him, I realized that he is outspoken and he does have opinions that are different than mine. I didn’t mind it because it was good to be open minded and to hear opposing point of views.

With his outspokenness, it can come off somewhat crude (I may not be using this word properly). He is a huge car enthusiast and he loves driving. Because he likes driving so much, he behaves like a Highway patrol officer and expects people to drive like him. For instance, when he sees someone driving like a maniac and that person is a lady, he’ll say something along the lines “of course it’s a lady. Watch where you’re going fatty. You just can’t wait to get home to stuff your face” If he says stuff like this, I’ll tell him to stop it and it’s mean. I’m okay with him being mad at another driver if they are driving obnoxiously but I don’t like that he adds those extra comments about their appearance. He said he was joking and I shouldn’t take it seriously. I’ll get mad about it and that I’m too sensitive when he’s just joking. 

Most recently, we were on the phone on his way home from work. He called me to chat about my day. While we were on the phone, there was a driver in a Jeep that was driving really fast. I was telling him about my new job and all of a sudden he said “this stupid Jeep, I hope he gets into a car crash and dies of slow and painful death. He’s putting all of the other drivers in danger and I hope he gets trapped inside his car” 
I told him that it was really mean to say and that he shouldn’t wish dead on other people. He doubled down and say stuff about God punishing those who are bad in the Bible. I know he’s not religious and I am. I told him God also teaches about forgiveness. To that he respond that some people deserve the punishment they receive. So i told him “you can have your opinion and say stuff like that but just don’t say it in front of me. Because I don’t like hearing it and you know I get sensitive when you say stuff like that”. I tried to change the subject because we were not going to see eye to eye on this subject but the conversation was already sour.

How does one move past being so entirely betrayed by the person who promised they would be your life partner regardless of what happened? How do I begin to cope with the fact that she cheated *in order* to cause me enough pain to let her be free of me.


She says she cheated because she was so completely unhappy. And so angry with me for my own depression and withdrawal from her. We also had major intimacy issues. We both have emotional and sexual traumas from past partners and childhood events. This lead us both to being sexually unsatisfied for most of the relationship.


I know you cannot justify cheating in any case. At least I tell myself that even knowing that I caused my own share of damage and hurt to her.

I feel like it's coming from a place of insecurity as well as attraction/ chemistry. 

The person I have a crush on is a former co-worker and now I reach out whenever I want advice. We rarely see each other and there's a chance that the crush will fade on its own with more time apart. But it's been a while and I keep reaching out to my crush. I know I should just be disciplined and stop talking to my crush, but my crush reminds me of people I've been rejected by before... maybe that's why I want my crushes attention/ validation. I've been thinking of asking my crush if they were ever attracted to me or just telling them how I feel. Maybe it would just pull me into reality and bring closure to whatever insecurities could be behind these feelings... yeah I know I'm overthinking this so help me out hahaha

This is my first very healthy relationship maybe ever… all of my other relationships were full of drama and anxiety.  While after 3 years and living together the honeymoon stage is definitely over and things naturally feel more routine, I’m still very grateful to be with my boyfriend and I love him.  This is why I’m confused with how I’m feeling right now… I haven’t experienced anything like this in a long time and I don’t know how to make it stop.  I work with someone who is not my manager, but in a much more senior role than me.  This guy is genuinely one of the nicest people I’ve ever encountered in the workplace, especially for being as important as he is as work.  Just radishes positive energy.  Our past relationship has been strictly professional, but hes still very friendly (stops by to say hi, remembers things about my personal life I’ve mentioned, texts me to say thank you when I’ve helped with a project). I’ve always really liked him as a person but this past week I’ve been feeling different.  We attended a work conference with a bunch of people from the office in a different city. We had a big cocktail reception one night and started chatting a lot and I felt myself getting flirty which I don’t usually do! The whole group went out and we ended up just chatting most of the time and then after everyone left we kept chatting at another bar until 230am! We talked about everything from work to politics to religion and our personal lives. The more I learned about him the more positive I felt about him. The next day we texted about the previous night and then basically a similar situation happened the following night - we were just drawn to talking to each other most all night and went to another bar by ourselves to keep taking. This guy is very friendly but I feel like he was feeling it too (complimented me a few times, asking me a million questions about myself, etc).  We got back a few nights ago from trip and I can’t stop thinking about him.  I found that I wasn’t even excited to see my boyfriend when I got home bc of how I’m feeling. Mind you- nothing can happen here not only bc I’m in a relationship and work, but this guy is married.  Nothing happened physically but the emotional connection I felt is taking over my thoughts and since nothing can come of it, I need advice on how to get over this feeling and how to proceed.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7530467,public,self,How do you get rid of an unwanted crush on coworker?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytiqyx/how_do_you_get_rid_of_an_unwanted_crush_on/,all_ads,6,,,,

That same year most of his friends turned 21 too and they eventually all ended up drinking. I would join them as well and our movie nights gradually just became drinking nights. Since then, I can’t really remember too many weekends where we didn’t drink. Most of them are out of town but during summer and every other weekend or so they’re here, and typically we’d all get together just to drink. 

We spent maybe 3 or 4 days this summer doing an activity that wasn’t drinking (kayaking or something similar by my suggestion) but half the time got back together to drink after. Every holiday, we drink. For the last 8 months, I’ve only drank with them about 4/5 times because I’m getting sick of it personally, then was unable due to new medications. I don’t like being around them when they’re drunk so lately I’ve been avoiding them on weekends. I’ve told my boyfriend a few times that I’d like if we could do stuff that isn’t drinking, then suggest we do a couple things and we’d sometimes do them then they get together to drink after. He knows I don’t like drinking much anymore either, but even when it’s just the two of us hanging out he wants to make everything we do into a drinking game. 

I just feel like there are other, better things to do, not to mention how much money he’s spending on alcohol. He’s fine dropping $50 or so a week on alcohol at bars, plus a bottle of vodka before the bar to pregame, but when I ask him if he wants to buy a game we can play together or spend around the same amount to do an activity together, he says it’s too expensive. 

It’s just the same thing every weekend and I don’t love being around them when they’re drunk. It’s just kind of embarrassing and a little annoying when I’m totally sober so I avoid them, but then my boyfriend and I just don’t see each other. I’ve been trying to make it so him and I spend Sundays together, but that’s only happened twice in the last 5 weeks, usually because he’s tired on Sundays. I feel like his priorities are kind of obvious. I don’t know how to mention this to him in a constructive way, or if I even should? I keep trying to ask him to give me other suggestions for things we can do but he never does. Would I be too controlling if I ask him to reduce the drinking to 2 or 3 weekends a month instead of 4? 

TLDR: boyfriend and friends drink every weekend, I don’t like being around them when they’re drunk so we don’t spend much time together anymore.
