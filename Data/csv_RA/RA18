I am also from Romania but living in the uk since 2018 and come to visit my home country every summer as i live been a student ever since i moved, now being in university. i have always had a lot of luck when it came to Romanian girls from Romania and not so much when trying to hook up in the uk, my body count being over 20 with the majority of them being Romanian. 

i have never wanted a relationship until the summer or 2021 when i met this girl in Romania that was named Dora (20F). Dora was the ex of one of my best friends from Romania (i asked my mate if he s fine with me fucking her as that was all i really wanted at that point and he said he didn't mind) . We've been chatting for a couple months prior to my visit for the summer. she was extremely good looking but i knew she was a player as she left my mate for someone else and broke his heart the year prior but i didn t really care about it as all i wanted was a shag. RIGHT???

Well, it turned out not to be just that as after a couple nights and cute dates together i actually started to like her, at which point we decided to be a couple even though i felt bad and ashamed of betraying him like that. after a couple weeks of being with her, i started to get bored and try my luck with other girls at the same time, which worked as a couple days after, i had this girl over named Cristina (20F) who has been my best girl-friend at that time for a while and who was a virgin and who i lied that i wasn't with Dora anymore  just so i could get to fuck her, and, surprisingly it worked.

The day after, i was left with the choice of telling her the truth or breaking up with Dora. Right?????????? 

Well, what i did instead was to get in a relationship with Cristina as well as with Dora for the following two weeks in which i was juggling them both at the same time in which i cheated on them both with each other and with two other girls that were into me. after a while i realised it wasn't gonna work forever and chose between them and so i picked Cristina as it did look better in all my friend's eyes and i felt was more ethical as i just took her virginity.

Oh, i think i should also mention i do a lot of mdma and party like an actual Alien when i m in Romania, sometimes having 4-5 days of partying with no sleep and food.

One week after the choice i made i was on one of these benders and came by Dora in the club where i told her i loved her and wanted to get back with her, which i did the next day, leaving Cristina absolutely heartbroken and most of my mates hating me as they were all friends with Cristina as well.

Following this, i have had a great rest of the year with Dora, getting her to meet my parents and having my first serious relationship ever even though it was a long distance one. fast forward to this summer, so the summer of 2022, me and Dora were in Romania when she went to a 3 day long party i didn't want her going to as i was jealous of some guy at that party and i was not invited. She went anyways.

That made me want to get back at her so i messaged Cristina again after a whole year in which i thought she hated me and took the gamble to ask her to come over.. and she did come. after being with Cristina for that night i realised i wanted her instead so i broke up with Dora and accused her of cheating on me just so i didn't have to admit what i did. following this, i am still with Cristina as for right now, almost 5 months later. i have cheated on her with 2 different girls in these 5 months and i feel really bad both for what i did to Dora and what i m doing to Cristina right now as i am certain they both loved/love me with their whole hearts and all i m doing is being an absolute knobhead..

i m trying to figure out why i keep taking this kind of decisions and i have come to the the conclusion that i am fucked in the head and i keep chasing the buzz i get from cheating because of all the drugs i have done throughout my almost 7 years of frequent use, or just fucked in the head because that's how i am. either way, i don't know what is wrong with me and why i keep feeling bored and want to ruin things that go so well and are so beautiful just because i m bored. i don't wanna loose this relationship as well and i want to improve but i don't understand why i feel like ruining it all. is it cause it makes me feel good about myself? cause it makes me feel superior? anyone have any advice or has been through something similar before?
how do i stop myself from wanting to cheat?

It's just the incident that lead to our current problem.  

I love giving blowjobs, hate getting cum in my mouth. My boyfriend knows this. We were long distance until recently so I've given him many blowjobs, but only 2 to completetion (because we usually follow up with sex). The first time, I had a UTI. So sex was off the table. I gave him a bj instead. He told me he was gonna cum, I pulled away. Fine. 

The second time was last week. We hadn't had sex in a few days due to exhaustion from me moving, and he wanted a blowjob. I was kind of iffy about it because I was still tired and he made a comment about how he'd have to resort to masturbating then. I didn't like that remark. It had only been like 3 days. But anyway, I thought about it and decided his satisfaction was important, so I surprised him with a blowjob during his work meeting (we WFH, he was muted). He didn't make any noise the whole time (he usually does) and gave no indication he was going to cum. He usually doesn't cum that fast, so I had no idea he was about to. He pushed his dick into my mouth further and came. I realized what was happening and pulled away. I was not happy. I was upset that he knows I dont like that and he didn't give me any warning at all. He said he felt bad and apologized and it's that he had trouble concentrating on several things at once so forgot to warn me. I eventually let it go a couple of hours later.  

One thing about me, if I don't want intercourse, but we're horny, I'll still want to at least give a blowjob to completion. That leaves me satisfied personally. And the guy loves it of course. They warn me, they cum, I clean them up. Done deal. 

I'm on a very painful period, so i don't want intercourse, but I did want to give him a blowjob. But since that ^ incident, he's adamant that he never wants a blowjob to completion again. And I find that ridiculous and unfair. He's shown he's capable of warning me he's about to cum during a blowjob. He says he doesn't wanna have to worry about that, so just no more blowjobs. Which sucks for ME TOO because I love giving them. I told him ""Do you think it's okay to just cum in a girl's mouth without warning?"" And he looks at me and says ""Sorry, my ex loved when that happened.""  

Obviously this is just my biased view of the interaction, but the way he said it sounded so smug and vitriolic and like he was throwing it in my face. And now i feel like the no blowjobs thing is MY fault because ""well if only you enjoyed me cumming in your mouth without warning you"".  I felt disgusted and hurt and just ended the conversation.  

Can I get some thoughts on this?

She encourages me to give up on this and “find better uses of your time.” 

But I can’t give up on them because then I’m admitting I’m a failure; I failed to change them, I failed to get them to see how hateful they are, and that’s my fault because I’m the only person on their life who could even have a possible chance of getting them to change. Like, we’re SUPPOSED to change people and get them to see reason, and if I can’t even do that, if I can’t correct people and get them to see things the right way, then what good am I?

I’ve explained this to my mother. Basically her response is:

- it’s narcissistic of me to assume I have all the answers 
- it’s narcissistic of me to assume it’s my job to change people
- she told me to reevaluate how deeply I care about being correct and that I should not care what others think of me in general unless they’re people who actually care about me

My mother than asked why I care so much, to which I responded that if everyone is able to love and accept each other, then I’ll never have to think negatively of myself again. She told me I need to go see a therapist. I reminded her that bigotry isn’t fair, that It’s not fair that people will hate me for no reason over things I can’t control, saying she just doesn’t understand what it’s like be hated over things you can’t control because that’s not something she ever has to deal with.

Im new here, and am looking for advice. 

I really would like to describe it as short as possible, but I would like to tell you about everything that I have a problem with. 

I will use made-up names.


(For information, i am 16 years old and have have my love life for about 5 years now.)

If you're not interested in my past, just in my problem, go down to the ""second year of high school"". 

So sit back, grab a cup of nice tea and enjoy reading.
------

Primary school: 

--
Sixth grade:

Let's start here in the sixth grade. 
I never thought of loving anyone other than my parents and family before, I was just too young for that (which is obvious, I was a kid). 
I had more important things, and my ""cool boys"" team. 

On one lunch break there was no place for me, so I was forced to sit with the girls. That's how I met Olivia. She was in a class one above me.

Despite rumors in my class that I ""chose to form a relationship with the opposite sex"" (which wasn't obvious to the young kids), I decided to continue the friendship, i was curious what a relationship with someone other than a boy looks like.

--
Seventh grade: 

We started talking to each other more often, going for walks in the park, etc. 

Our relationship developing. 
Our conversations were pleasant, I could tell her about everything.

In this year Oliwia left primery school.

--
Eighth grade: 
Our situation was complicated because we only meeting outside of school.

At the beginning of the school year, I started feeling something for her. our conversations weren't what they used to be. And guess what happened? 

I was scared of forming a relationship with her, I thought to myself ""it can't be her, our conversations are so weird"". 

She was the one who asked all sorts of questions, looked me in the eye, and smiled at every joke, her waist was amazing, she was beautiful. (remember this- we come back to it)

However, I was afraid of relationships, so we started seeing each other less and less. 

( I recently realized this:)
I didn't know how to explain it to her that
I didn't want to lose her but I wanted to stay friends, but I believe we both (not only me) started to have feelings for each other. 


------
High school: 

--
First class: 
Oliwia moved out of the city where im living, so I managed to get rid of my feelings for her. But the fact that I limited contact with her last year remained, and we talked on the phone and wrote sms to each other.

From time to time she was coming back to my city, and always wanted to meet me irl, but I wasn't sure about the idea, I haven't seen her for months.

 So I was afraid of two things: 
- Returning to feeling something for her
- Meetings after a long time 

Unfortunately i was so scared, in that class, I started to ghost her, and I broke off contact with her completely... 

And that wasn't what I wanted, but I didn't know how to deal with that situation, I haven't told anyone about it. (And no one still knows about it)

I'd like to apologize to her for that. But I don't think it's possible to reconnect, I don't even want to know if I want to. Here her story ends. 

-
But my story doesn't end here, more problems arose. 

I decided to look for a girlfriend (for real this time). 
I was in a class with only two girls (so there was little choice), one of them blocked me on mes right after a week, and she already had a boyfriend, she didn't seem nice or too pretty, so I wasn't sad. 

But there was still another girl. 

I decided to talk to her, after all, what did I have to lose, and so I wanted to make friends. 

Unlike the first girl, she accepted me.
Her name (let's say) is Roxana.

Already at the beginning, Roxana looked like she wasn't closed to people at all. 
Interestingly, after a year, it turned out that she gained a lot of friends. 

I was supposed to be one of them. 
Mostly, I teased her a bit, and asked her for simple things, like ""How was your day?"". 

I was mostly the one starting the conversation, but I didn't mind. 

--
Second semester of the first school year:

Roxana, when I asked her if she wanted to go out somewhere, she said no (maybe it was too early to do that), in sms conversations, she replied with short messages, on and sometimes ""hahah"". 

Most of the time she said she had to finish conversations because of something, And not to ask me about her love life because her boyfriend is next to her (next lie - on facebook her status is as single). 

For a moment I forgot that I was supposed to meet the girl of my dreams. 

--
Summer before second grade:
During the holidays I decided to invite Roxana to a simple hang-out, she proposed that she would take her friend with her (Karen- LOL). I agreed.  

The meeting was quite nice, even if I spoke a little less. 

Then I started feeling something for her.


A week before Karen's birthday Roxana blocked me on mes, she claimed I was talking too much. (which was a pure lie, that's how i feel).

Her friend invited me to her birthday party, Roxana was there too. it was pretty cool party.

(I am still in contact with her friend, but I do not intend to form a relationship with her, she is not attractive to me). 

There is not much time left until the beginning of the second school year. 

--
Second year of high school: 
""AH **, HERE WE GO AGAIN""

At the beginning of the school year I managed to force unblock on messenger, but our conversations are the same.

She doesn't want to go out with me, she says she has a lot to study, she gives no other excuse. Although a bit less lies. 

I'm desperate because she's quiet around me, not like other people. She looks like she's with me because she's just nice to me. 

She has a lot of male friends, and I don't know if she has a boyfriend, or if one of her out-of-class friends are e.g. just Brother. 

She seems to be nicer to me lately, and she stares at me in class. 
(however, her behavior changes frequently to me)

She even asked me for my work files, I think she told me 3 times that they just disappeared even though I said it's ok. 

But she's not looking for an opportunity to be with me. 

I'm thinking of getting rid of this relationship, but I don't want to make the same mistake again.

I (18m) have been dating this girl (18f) for more than 7 months now and I do love her, and she loves me. We have a very deep emotional bond and we are really close. We overcame many arguments and we're still together. We're just drawn by each other. I would consider our relationship nontoxic for the most part. The problem arises with, possibly, my lack of communication. I am a people pleaser and have a hard time expressing my needs and I avoid conflict. Like I get annoyed by things in the moment but my brain turns autopilot on and just keeps quiet about it, and most of the time I don't bring it up ever, or if I do, there are all the other things from before. My gf is in no way responsible for my behavior because I've been like this forever, and she's really understanding about it and motivates me every single time to speak my mind freely and she's very loving and caring about it. I express my needs, likes, and dislikes, in waves. A ""wave"" every few months. Or a tsunami... I am not aggressive but my girlfriend likely sees me as such because she's overwhelmed by all the things I kept bottled up in myself. 

Recently I had one of these ""waves"". I didn't tell everything that's on my mind. But I hope I will. 

My problems with her are:

* she's addicted to social media and her phone. Really addicted. She's also addicted to validation on social media since before we met she posted herself on either a story or a regular post every 3 days, which is a lot imo. I am rather insecure about her needing this much external validation. I mentioned to her actually and she cut back on posting every week or so, and recently deleted instagram, tiktok and bereal. (I don't use these). I feel as though she is eventually going to return to them or secretly use them. 
* she doesn't have goals. She's got no interests really besides social media. We're going off to college soon and she doesn't really know what to do in life. She hasn't really expressed anything she'd like to do as a job... 
* she has many guy friends. Half of her friends are guys. Most of which are gay. But I still feel like maybe It's a way to still receive male attention. To be fair, she had all of them before we met. I've recently become conscious of the fact that she kissed one of her gay male friends before we met. ""Just to practice"" with her words, her female friend also kissed him. 
* she eats really badly. She likely has an eating disorder. She's very skinny and I try to help her eat healthily but her diet involves a lot of sugar and chocolate sweets.

What tipped my glass was that she refused to let me check her phone. I lack trust, I know. But that's because of a few little of her lies I caught her in. So she refused because she ""feels anxious when someone checks her phone because her mom used to check her phone when she was little"". Also, she said she doesn't let anyone, not just me, go thru her phone.

  
Any advice would be appreciated. I've been thinking of a breakup lately, but then I scold myself for giving up on her... I can give further context if needed. Please ask any questions. I plan on showing her this post because I suppose it's easier to express my need to random Redditors...

My wife F(27) and myself M(27) have been going through it for a little over a year now. And I’m at my breaking point. We’ve been together for five and married for three (four in December). Anyways i don’t even know how to begin and I’m sorry if this is semi fractured because honestly I’m just lost rn. 
A year ago i was working a minimum of 12 hour days, maintaining a gym schedule, taking her out (what i thought was an appropriate amount) and doing about 80% of the house hold chores. She hasn’t been working since Covid kicked off and i was okay with that because i made enough money to get us by fairly comfortably without her needing too. 

I knew she was unhappy with where we were and i wanted to get her closer to family so i went to a month long course in July, passed and was able to move us to the East coast. Within about 5 hours of her family, and forty hours from mine. She’s also basically refused to build a relationship with my family (which is not a large family). 

When we finally got settled into our new home i thought things would be great, i started working far less and got a decent pay increase but things only got worse. She stopped helping me completely around the house and spent most of her time on TikTok, or online shopping. She all but stopped speaking to me at home but would leave and immediately call me and get mad if i didn’t want to be on the phone (i also work in a secure gov building and can’t bring my phone/smartwatch inside). As our issues grew i did everything i could to please her and make her happy and give her everything she wanted but nothing ever worked. I started going to therapy for myself and my counselor suggested couples therapy. My wife absolutely refused, she told me that she settled when she married me and she was absolutely not going to “bend to my will and go to therapy” because she obviously did not need it. 
She’s never satisfied with anything i do, i can’t cook, clean, or even drive the way she likes. She says she doesn’t want kids (i honestly don’t know if I’d like to have kids with her at this point) but i saw old texts she’d sent to her ex while we were dating talking telling him her goal was to be a stay at home mom. 
We only have one car and she throws a fit when i need it and she can’t drive me back and forth. I’m about to come into a large amount of money and i want to pay off our debts with it, purchase a home, and get a second car. She doesn’t want any of that. She says she doesn’t want to be tied to this area because of a house and was comfortable staying in an apartment for the foreseeable future. We’ll be in this area for a minimum of 13 years so that just doesn’t make sense to me. 
I’m tired of her talking to her friends and mother about how awful i am and how i do so little. I make it a point to plan dates at least twice a month and i would love to do more but with the single income it’s incredibly difficult, i haven’t been able to do anything for myself in so long and it hurts. 
I guess I’m just rambling so I’ll cut this a little short. If anyone needs anything more let me know i guess. 
I’m just hurt, I’ve broken myself for her time and again. It makes me shake thinking of divorce but I’m so close to the brink.

He’s smart, funny, attractive, and very dedicated to his future. He’s worked really hard to save his money and find his footing in his career, and has been future-focused since I’ve known him, including letting me know that he wants to marry me since just a few months into our relationship. My family loves him and his loves me, and on paper we have an ideal situation. The only issue is a persisting feeling of isolation that I feel within the relationship. 
We have different love languages and communication styles (for me the biggest are words of affirmation and physical touch while his are acts of service and quality time) so it has been a bit of a challenge to learn how to communicate since the beginning. However, I spend so much of my time thinking about him and his needs, and reaching out to check in with him, whereas I feel like I don’t receive the same consideration. He’s very career focused right now which I totally support, but I no longer feel like a priority. After a busy day, he wants to unwind by playing games on his phone or watching tv, and we can go weeks without sharing any kind of intimacy. I need to feel considered and thought of, and the constant rejection of being brushed off when I try to reach out for connection is really wearing me down. 
When I’ve tried discussing this with him, he gets frustrated saying “I don’t know what you want from me” and I get tongue tied trying to explain myself. How can I communicate my needs better, or is this an area where I should learn to self soothe?

We’ve had some amazing times as well as some bumps in the road.

He has 2 daughters K(13) &amp; L(11). I met them both 4 months ago &amp; they are both super awesome chicks! Funny, beautiful and talented. Immediately L &amp; clicked because I swear she’s a younger version of me. On Mondays &amp; Tuesdays, L would have her dad (B) drop her off and pick her up from her play lessons and I would ride along and the 3 of us would cut up, make terrible “yo mamma” jokes &amp; overall have a blast. If/when I couldn’t ride along, she would be upset that she didn’t know if/when she would see me again since “you’ve had a lot of terrible girlfriends and I really like K. Please don’t screw this one up.”

About a month ago, one of her play classes was cancelled so we had an hour to kill and all came back to my house.

L loves horror movies/stories so I introduced her to Mr. Ballen &amp; we started watching one of my favorites while B went outside to smoke.

I’m sitting on the couch &amp; L has her back leaning up against my shoulder while she kicked her feet out the other direction.

I have a sister, several nieces and a ton of gal-pals and nothing was abnormal or weird. Just typical chilling on the couch stuff. No I didn’t have my arm around her nor was I even touching her. She was simply leaning her back on my shoulder.

I have a 13 year old son and this was normal, even for him.

Well B came in from smoking and immediately started giving me the evil eye. I was wondering what was wrong, never thinking he thought there was something inappropriate going on between me and his 11 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER! L &amp; I finished watching the episode all while B would look at us like we were 2 teenagers.

It makes me sick that I’m even writing this.

Shortly after the stink eye began, the episode ended and it was time to go.

I pulled B aside and asked him what was wrong and he said “oh nothing” in that way like he just caught me cheating or something.

After we dropped L off (who never knew there was now a rift between her dad &amp; I), I broke down.

I asked him straight out if he thought I would ever harm L or any child in any way.

He explained it away that he was just an overprotective dad and that L is impressionable and wanted to protect her.

I don’t have daughters, only a son so I told him I was sorry, even though the whole accusation really broke my heart &amp; nothing more was said. We continued to ride along to take her to her lessons and even went to her play last weekend!

FF to yesterday. We are at his folks lake house for early Thanksgiving 2 hours early and it’s a gorgeous day.

L &amp; K are restless and want to go on an adventure. I asked B to grab my walking shoes out of the car (I was wearing heels) &amp; suggested we all go on a walk in the wooded/beach area by the water. B got my shoes, we all announced we were going for a walk in the woods &amp; took off. B didn't express interest when we asked him to come as he was chatting with his folks. K ended up wearing my heels and it was super funny watching her stumble around in the woods with them on. She actually hiked a good distance in them!

Mind you this is right next to the house &amp; since all the leaves have fallen, you can see the whole area where we are. It wasn’t a day hike or anything.

K tapped out after a bit though and turned back towards the house.

L was way far ahead and alone so I followed her and we ended up by the water (you can literally see us from the house, so this is a short “hike”) &amp; had a great time taking pics, looking at the cool rocks &amp; moss &amp; overall having a koombaya moment when we hear B call out. We both are excited he decided to join us (seriously we were only gone for 10 mins at this point) when he yells at us from the cliff above for not answering him the first 2 times he called out. We didn’t hear him, &amp; I told him I was sorry but he should come down and hang out with us.

He simply turned around and walked away! Leaving L &amp; us alone and confused. I told her we should head back up so I could sort this out &amp; we did immediately.

I asked him wtf &amp; he said he was scared when he couldn’t find us. I then asked why did he ignore us and walk away instead of joining us and having a beautiful moment.

He said because “I know how you are (meaning I’ve slept with women) &amp; was upset you 2 were alone together, not answering me”.

So here I am, devastated that for the second time in my life, I’m being accused of pretty much having pedo tendencies, stuck 2 hours away from home at his PARRENTS lake house, on Thanksgiving Sunday.

I told him if he really thought I would ever harm L or any child, why the fuck didn’t he come join us? Why walk away? Why stay with someone who you think may harm your child?

I told him we would talk about it later and went inside and acted like all was well. He even apologized and pawed at me the rest of our time there &amp; I just put on a fake smile and went with it. I was heartbroken and in shock.

Once we got back home last night, he kept trying to initiate sex and act like everything was fine and I just sat on the couch trying to find words.

I told him it was over.

I won’t be with someone that thinks I would harm a child.

I also won’t be with someone that dates someone that they think would harm their child!

THE FUCK?!?

I told him there really wasn’t anything left to talk about and he went through all the stages of grief right before my eyes in about an hour.

I just sat there in stunned silence.

All the love I had for him went away the moment I realized he was accusing me for the second time.

To be clear, no one in this story, including the girls has ever been a victim of grooming, R(word) or M(word). Not even I nor B nor anyone on either side of the family so it is unclear (other then his alcohol consumption) where this is coming from.

I let him stay the night and told him he could get his things out in the morning since it was late and he was drunk.

This morning he acted like everything was normal and asked if he could come back tonight all while my skin was crawling and I couldn’t wait for him to leave.

It’s 11am and I am day drinking writing this post (I never day drink but shole the fuck am today). I want to call B's mom as well as L’s mom and explain why I won’t be in their life anymore (we all get along really well so cutting ties really sucks) but not sure if I should.

How the fuck do you tell someone you’ve been implicated in having inappropriate contact with a member of their family?!?

THE FUCK?!?

I’m more angry that the man I was with actually thought I may harm his kid and did nothing in the “moment”. TWICE then anything else.

Why not protect her ?

Ugh I don’t know what to do.

I plan on gathering his things and telling him I never want to see him again.

I love him very much. 

My (25f) boyfriend (26m) met each other seven years ago and have been dating on and off since then (we met right before he went off for college and tried long distance but it was difficult, thus the on/off). He moved back home in 2018, we moved into our first apartment in 2020 and bought a house in 2021. Notably, we also got a dog a few months after we bought our house. He works full time from home as an engineer, and I work full time in person as a social worker. 

Overall, I love him with all my heart and he is one of the kindest, smartest, and trustworthy people I have ever met. However, I do feel like there is a disconnect between us sometimes and a lot of our issues come out to “roommate issues.” Before he and I first got together, we decided I would do the cleaning and he would do the cooking, because he likes cooking, and I don’t like cooking/don’t mind cleaning. On average, he cooks 1-2x/week and I clean up the house at least every Monday (and oftentimes during the week) because I have Mondays off. In my mind, cleaning and “picking up” are different. You have to pick up in order to get to the point where you can clean. I shouldn’t have to pick up after my partner who is a grown man. My partner doesn’t disagree with that and doesn’t think it’s my responsibility to pick up for him, but the bottom line is he just doesn’t consistently pick up after himself without prompting or guidance. 

When we first moved into our apartment it was the worst. Clothes were regularly strewn everywhere but the hamper, coffee table was constantly used as a “holding area” for anything he didn’t feel like putting away or didn’t know where to put. Also, any time he cooked, the kitchen would look like a nightmare afterwards. Dishes were not put away (or even next to the sink, a compromise I begged for multiple times), food remnants all over the counter/stove/cabinets. I swear to god I couldn’t be that messy if I tried. I literally would have the kitchen sparkling clean and he would use it once, and it would be back to being messy again. There are other things like this (hair stubble in the sink, multiple pairs of shoes right inside of the front door, etc.) that also got on my nerves. 

I tried to talk with him about it many times, but the conversations always turned to fight and he was always very defensive when I tried to broach the subject. I also tried to express how much the mess and clutter affected my mental health, as someone with depression during COVID isolation, but at the time he told me that’s on me and it shouldn’t bother me (he has since recanted this statement and acknowledged that this is valid). Initially I tried to bring things up in a calm, clear, and civil manner but after months of being given lip service with little to no improvement, I admit that I may not have always been very graceful in my delivery. I could get sarcastic and sometimes mean, and I’m sure my tone wasn’t always polite. I still get like that sometimes, especially when I feel like I’m yelling my concerns into an empty canyon. I’m not proud of letting my irritation/anxiety rear its head in that way. 

When we moved into our house last year, as one might imagine, all of those problems got worse. There is so much more maintenance and cleaning that goes into a house, also yardwork. It’s not a big house, about 1800 square feet, 3BR/3BA. There are more “holding spaces” for items that have no clear place to be put away, and stuff is just everywhere. I feel like any space I clear off/clean quickly accrues more stuff. Our bedroom floor pretty much always has his dirty clothes on it, and don’t get me started on his hamper. He will fill his hamper, then go to do laundry, then he will leave it in the dryer for a week. This leaves him with no hamper upstairs meaning the dirty clothes are just in a pile in the corner of the room. This is not only annoying to look at but a concern having a lab who can get into socks etc. Also, there have been a few times where he forgets his clothes in the washing machine and has to wash again (and sometimes again!) because of mold. Also, having a dog means more mess. Toys everywhere, hair everywhere, etc. Obviously these things are not my partners fault but I feel like picking it up mostly falls on me. To be fair, my partner does most of the dog walking and picking up poop in the yard.

Now, my partner is much less defensive when I ask him to pick up after himself, which is great. He has come a long way in that regard which I’m sure was difficult and I’m proud of him for that. He has gotten better at picking up after himself, but I feel like there are always things he misses, plus he doesn’t do it frequently enough. He’s not picking up after himself on a daily basis, more like once a week. And as I said before, he’s messy. I really do not want to have to manage him picking up after himself, even though he is less defensive. It forces me into the position of needing to always nag him about his stuff which is almost demeaning if that makes sense? It’s a huge turn off too, to be honest. 

He will be the first to tell you that I’m not perfect, either. Of course I’m not. I leave stuff out sometimes. But it’s put away within a day or two. If I cook or use the kitchen, the dishes are away and the counter is mostly clean. I use the “holding areas” too, but I actually use them as temporary holding areas and not the designated island of misfit toys. His stuff will be there for 5 plus days. I feel like I’m more messy because he is, too - if the house is going to be cluttered anyways, why the fuck would I bother? If he picked up after himself consistently I would do the same because then I could actually enjoy a clean house. With this being said, the vast majority of messes and clutter are his doing.

He has asked me to give him the benefit of the doubt (“I was going to get to that”) but my patience can only last so long. I don’t know how any logical person would give him the benefit of the doubt. He has told me that he has improved, which is true. He is quick to point out that I am not perfect and I am trying to hold him to a perfect standard. But I feel like I’m not. Maybe my standards are too high? But the way I look at it, he ends up picking all his stuff up anyways, just in a much more distressing and annoying way than if he did it on his own. I’ve pointed out that It’s the same amount of work, just distributed in a way that is more consistent, more respectful, and less distressing to me. He claims that there are many things he doesn’t notice (especially the kitchen being messy) which I think is the dumbest excuse ever. It’s not like I expect everything to be perfect 100% of the time, but I would be thrilled with some more consistent personal accountability and initiative. I wouldn’t mind stuff being messy if I could trust that he would get to it within a day or two, but I just can’t at this point. 

I am in therapy and have talked with my therapist about this. It helps, but as most therapist will tell you, you can only control what you can. I feel like I have three options: accept messy house, accept role of nagging mother, or pick up after him. My partner isn’t in therapy, but I think it might help because I think he’s dealing with anxiety/depression/ADHD or some mixture. He’s had therapy in the past but doesn’t see the need for it now. I bring it up sometimes but he gets defensive. 

So, Reddit, any tips or advice? Are my standards too high? I really love him and have seen him grow so much, and I want to be with him for the rest of my life.

Anyway. At first I thought she was joking when she told me we are breaking up in the middle of the night (the night when she came at 9PM), after she went straight to sleep, and I think I woke her up when I went to bed, and I know she is sleep talking sometimes so I didn't give it a solid thought.

I am a busy person in general, I like to do things and keep myself busy with anything and I tended to neglect my relationship with her, but never to a point where I didn't speak with her. I tended to her needs and usually listened to her when she needed that, I feel like I did a minimum to keep the relationship going. And now treating this with a high priority clearly made us a lot happier, but she keeps telling me she wants back with her parents. Which is a bad idea because of her busy schedule as well, she can't just move back as fast as she wants and still meet the schedules from her workplace and college. I feel like shit because I want things to work with her, she is stating that she doesn't want to deal with me, and she still lingers in my apartment and still being lovey-dovey with me giving me a false sense of hope.

So I (19) been seeing/sleeping with this man (26m) for 4 months. We aren’t exclusive nor in a relationship but I would say we have something together and he always told me that if things aren’t working out, he would be an adult and tell me instead of ghosting me. And I have no doubts about that. 

But on Friday we chatted for a tiny bit and that was also the last time he read my message to him. Then he went MIA and I’m scared that something bad might have happened. He hasn’t been active on anything for the entire weekend, his Snapchat score hasn’t gone up at all, hasn’t blocked me or removed me from anything, hasn’t posted anything, viewed anything. Absolutely nothing. 

This behavior is unusual for him because he always views my stories, even if he can’t reply in a few seconds he either does get back to me or at least opens them. 

I thought maybe he needs some space or is just enjoying his weekend but I don’t know, maybe I’m just paranoid but I can’t help but have this feeling that something bad happened.

When we have sex, he finishes too early as most of the time he cannot control it. He told me that this has not happened before, and it’s only with me. The fact is, I never have time enough to have an orgasm when we have sex, so I always finish masturbating, which is something completely odd for me.

At some point we had an argument because I asked him why he puts likes on bikini pictures of girls from dating Apps, that he used to talk to before we met, and he told me it has no meaning. 
Well, as I don’t see him putting likes on pictures of men in underwear/swimsuit, I told him it does definitely have a meaning.  
That’s when he hit me up with: 
-  “Maybe I masturbate to that, do you think I have not masturbated to other girls after we were together? I’m sorry but I did.”
And then he followed to accuse me of thinking about other men “too” when I masturbate, because I don’t manage to have an orgasm when we have sex. (When actually the reason is because I need more time to get there). 

I feel betrayed somehow because I hate the idea of knowing my partner pleasures himself thinking about other women when I’m not around (he didn’t say he masturbates to porn, which I could understand, because I watch it too sometimes) he said “to other girls”, like those are girls that he knows in real life. 


(Even though I can watch porn sometimes, it is just for picturing those scenes with my partners)

I’m a demisexual and it has teared me apart to the point I no longer feel attracted to him, even though I do love him. It is hard for me to feel like I’m not the only one he likes. 

Besides, even though I have a very low self-esteem, I’m a very pretty and attractive woman, cute face and an amazing athletic body, I have a lot of guys on my feet worshiping me for years. Exes that would be on my door if I just call and so on.. 
My bf doesn’t take care of himself and a lot of people say I’m out of his league, including himself. 

During our relationship, there has been occasions where I was jealous and he has imposed to me that he can and is allowed to talk to other women and that we have to trust each other blind-fully.

Few weeks ago, a friend invited me to a sex party and he was pissed that I decided to go with her to an “orgy”. But I did anyway because at the end of the day:
I think I’m also allowed to talk to other guys
I guess I’m also allowed to masturbate thinking about other guys
And after all, he has to trust me blind-fully. 

By the way, nothing happened in the party I really just went there to “support” my friend in the first hour so she wouldn’t be alone and she could drink (the party was 150km away from our home and someone sober had to drive &gt; me), in fact, after she got hooked up with someone in the party, I left and went to the car and chilled alone there for the rest of the night.


I don’t know if what I’m feeling is right or wrong, or if it’s valid or not. I just know I can’t take it. I feel very put down and turned off.
Me and my bf have already spoken about all of this, however what is said is said and I simply cant get over this masturbating thing he said, I think at this point I would rather be with other guys that are like dogs on my feet and make me feel more wanted than he does(?) I’m very used to having boyfriends that were also completely obsessed with me. 

Note 1: I’m 100% sure my boyfriend has never cheated on me and he is, on the other hand, very supportive, my best friend, respectful and caring, he puts a lot of effort into our relationship too.
Note 2: before anyone comes to recommend me to, I’m already doing therapy.

This semester he met a new friend(18F, now 19) in college and started frequently talking about her and spending more with her between, in, and after classes. Due to past experiences of being cheated on, I expressed to him my worries and fears regarding this new friendship. I told him that I genuinely want him to have healthy platonic friendships, I just need a sense of security knowing that I won't be replaced or abandoned. I needed to know that it will always be just friendship and nothing more. He reassured me that she won't be a problem and that no matter what happens he always wants me in the end. He knows I have an anxious attachment style that I am working on turning into a secure one, so this reassurance meant the absolute world to me. It wasn't easy, but I chose to trust him.

 As the semester goes on, he begins spending more and more time with her. He becomes more secretive, distant, and inattentive with me. He used to come home and have plenty of time to do everything he wanted to get done. Now he comes home hours late and blames ME for not having the time to do homework or go to the gym. He starts hiding things and thinking that I'm too dumb to notice (ex. not texting her back when I'm in the room, tilting his phone away when he opens it, etc). This makes me extremely uncomfortable and begins to worry me so I bring it up and all I get is ""Why can't you just trust me? This is so annoying. We're just talking"". Not exactly validated, I set my worries aside and continue to trust him. With time, I work through it myself and get to a point where I am finally okay. I finally overcame that insecurity and I can genuinely trust my partner and feel good as we both have wonderful platonic friendships. Our relationship is going well. We love and support each other in all that we do.  
 Eventually he decides to bring up to me the fact that he has indeed developed feelings for this friend and he now wants to be with her romantically, *while* still being with me. Because she's never really dated (or kissed anyone for that matter) he wants her to develop healthy relationships, he tells me. I asked why *we* can't just be a healthy example as we support her in developing good relationships, as good friends do? He says that's not an option because he has DID. He continues with reassuring me that he still wants me now and always and in the end, while basically asking for permission to cheat on me. Swearing that he'd never even consider leaving me. He said that if the situation were reversed (if I wanted to be with another guy while still with my partner) he would absolutely not stand for it and leave me, so it is highly an ego thing because it is a girl. Yet he doesn't want me to leave. He expects me to shatter my boundaries and let him have a girlfriend in college while also having one at home. I'm not okay with this.. He tried to faced me with an ultimatum saying it's either both of you or none of you (which is contradictory in it's own way). He expects me to be open to this, but he won't be open to any idea I bring up. I even expressed the fact that I can be open to a relationship like that in the future if we start it with that intention and do it together. This is uncomfortable because this entire situation betrayed the trust that I placed into him and really ended up hurting us both. I asked that we take some time to think and work through this together in a healthy way that doesn't end up tearing us apart. 

 I do want him to have friends. I genuinely do. I just want them to be real, healthy friendships. It's one thing to have a crush, and I understand that, those happen and pass all the time. But it crosses lines when you start feeling the need for more out of the friendship. I understand having feelings like this. I've been in the situation before, but when you love and respect your partner, it shouldn't even be an option to act upon such temporary feelings. Happy long term relationship &gt; pretty new shiny. I understand that he cares about her, but why can't he care about her as a FRIEND? As a sibling, if you will. I have friends just like that. I truly love them and I want them to be happy, but I love them platonically. It doesn't have to cross the line of romance. **Not all good relationships have to be romantic.** Let the crush pass and develop healthy lifelong friendships with people. Focus on your academics, focus on your relationship, focus on yourself.

 With this expressed, I asked him to try to make efforts to distance himself from this friendship by not taking more classes together next semester, so it has a chance to return to something healthy and platonic. I told him I felt really shitty for asking this and I didn't want to, but I couldn't think of anything better at the time. Rather that discussing it with me in any way or suggesting anything else, he shut down and decided to message her the following day saying that he's being asked to step away from the friendship. I didn't want him to cut it off like *this*. I wanted him to get through the rest of this semester and simply talk to his friend less as time went on. Spend the winter break at home together with me and family and return to next semester feeling refreshed and ready. I expressed that, but since we didn't discuss it before he chose to act so rashly, he is now incredibly mad at me. Saying he can't get past this situation. Saying he feels stuck. Blaming me for everything that has gone wrong in his life. Saying I manifested all this by being worried in the first place.

 I understand he's hurt and upset right now, but I really am trying my damn hardest to go about this in a healthy way. I am doing my best to communicate and be present and understanding. I'm respecting his boundaries and giving him space when he asks for it. I'm giving it time because he always comes back around to me and I have faith in that. I know he still loves me and doesn't want to lose me. I still trust in the reassurance that he gave me. I know we can get through this and come out stronger and happier than ever before. This is really shitty and difficult in the moment, but it's not the end of us. We need advice on how to actually work through this issue, rather than sweeping it under the rug and settling down with unspoken feelings that turn to resentment. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** My partner has a crush on his new friend and instead of letting that pass and focusing on his academics, relationship, and life, he insists on me letting him ""be with her for a while"". After several conversations of mutually trying to work through this out, I proposed he take a step back from the friendship because the semester is ending soon anyway, and letting the friendship return to a healthy platonic level. Rather than discussing it with me in any way, he messages his friend the following day saying that he's being asked to distance himself. It has been three days since and he has been incredibly upset and distant with me 90% of this time.

It is a project that is partially self-funded by P, and part of the funding comes from a couple of different investors. I don't want to talk about what kind of project it is for privacy reasons. 

I have been in a big role in this project, and practically I have been onboard since the conception of the idea. Initially my fee was supposed to 4-5k, and P said that I would be paid more once the project was completed and out there. Months ago, he wrote my fee down in the budget as 2k saying it was a ""placeholder"" and that I would get more eventually. This is a small amount of money, but like I said, P is very established, and this project will look good on my CV.

The whole spring and summer I spent a lot of time working on the project, including most weekends.

Now we're nearing the end of the project. P has increased the fee of a couple of other people working on the project but has kept my fee as 2k. When put in perspective, I'm the person who has earned the least of all the people working on the project, and I am one of the most senior members of the team. For example, some young assistants who have been working on the project only short term (a total of 2-4 days) have made 200/day.  I feel that this amount does not reflect the amount of work I've done for the project. 

At the same time, I find it difficult to talk with P about my payment. He is someone with a short temper and can be very arrogant. He can put people on their s\*itlist, and like I said, he is very influential and recognised person in his field. 

I don't want to sell myself cheap, but I don't know how and with what words to bring up the subject that my fee is way too small. I'm a person who usually avoids conflict - this a characteristic I'm trying hard to get rid of.

My friend and I have known each other for almost 2 years know. We're very close and I really love her 

I just want to point out that she's kind of insecure about herself 

Few months ago she started talking to a guy who is also my brother's friend and at first everything went well....they had the feeling and all the rest 

Some shit happened in her life and last year was really hard for her. Her life just got messed up because of some mistakes she made and she lost plenty of people she considered close( almost family) 

So when she was talking to my brother's friend I was happy to see her happy again but everything just got ruined when my brother told me that his friend used to say that my friend is ugly 

At first I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to ruin the little happiness my friend had so I kept quiet ( I thought that was in the past and that Maybe he had change his mind since he was treating my friend very well and even telling her that she was beautiful ) 

So last week my brother was on the phone with the guy and it happened that I was in the room when his friend called my friend ugly. My brother then asked him why would he go for a girl he finds ugly...he denied the fact that he was flirting with my friend and said that he wasn't interested in her 

I tried to defend my friend and him and my brother just laughed at me for being so ""vexed"" when they weren't talking about me ( my brother has never find my friend beautiful but he has never said that she's ugly....at least not in front of me) 

So today I decided to tell her the truth and she almost cried when I told her what this guy has been saying about her. She was sad the entire day and couldn't stop asking me question about this ( e.g Am I really that ugly?) 

Now she confronted the guy and he's denying the fact that he called her ugly. He's blaming everything on my brother saying that he's the one who calls her ugly

I find myself getting annoyed that they attend these family gatherings, something I feel like is an opportunity for family to get closer and build my relationship with my BFs family.

We are all ages 25-27. 

My friend gave me edible which I took without asking how strong it was which was a huge mistake. That and three glasses of wine I had already just to calm my social anxiety hit all at once right after dinner while we all chilled in the living room. So I couldn’t just get up and leave until I was sober enough to drive. 

My friends talk about sex…a lot. They are constantly sharing stories or showing each other pictures of their partners genitals, make sex jokes in public. Stuff I’m both not interested in and make it known makes me wildly uncomfortable. They ask me details about my own sex life knowing It’ll make me feel embarrassed. Last night was no different, but I’ve been friends with my friend who was hosting for years, so I can usually take an evening of it every now and then. 

Well, at some point in the night, they (my friend, her female and male friends and her boyfriend all started talking very sexually, which eventually to progressed to taking nudes of each other? They all started to completely ignore the fact that I was even there and carried on whatever foreplay they were doing. I wanted to leave so badly the more it progressed. At one point someone asked me how I was doing and I said “doing good, just almost sober enough to head out” to which my friend replied “yea, Why the fuck are you still here” and laughed to make sure I knew it was a joke. They all got up and went into my friends bedroom to take nudes and whatever else. I just got up, packed up the chairs I brought and stayed outside in my car for another couple hours until I could drive back. 

I’m not trying to “kink shame” people should do whatever they want between consenting adults. It’s just, I’ve made it very known that stuff makes me uncomfortable. Why invite me if that was the intention? My friend made it very clear with her actions that she was trying to set a specific mood once they guys came over. I have autism, maybe it’s my fault that I didn’t pick up on the vibe sooner? I don’t know. 

Either way, I felt like an outcast in middle school or something. No one had anything to do with me once I made it clear I wasn’t into sexual conversations/ actions. I felt so lonely and so unwanted in a simple social situation.

So I (20f) have been in a relationship with, let's call him X (20m) for about 5 months. We've known each other for 5 years and within those 5 years have been together 3 times before but it didn't work out those times because I had commitment issues (I didn't cheat or anything, I was just terrified of commitment and still am). The third time we were together however, we broke up because we weren't communicating with each other very well and I was generally unhappy with us having soooo many arguments and the last argument we had, I ended it. 
Now, in this relationship, everything has been good so far but I've noticed some minor things such as my style has changed, I'm more self conscious, some stuff he says gets me annoyed and rubs me the wrong way. For example, my style is very y2k mixed with cottage core and sometimes dopamine dressing which is a lot of bright and pastel colours and lately I've found myself dressing in a lot of dark, black clothing because he dosen't really like those styles and because he prefers dark, ""normal"" colours and clothing. He also tells me not to wear makeup (all I wear is bb cream, concealer, mascara, powder and my lip combo) because ""I don't need it"" and I understand I don't and I've told him that I just like to wear it but he always continues saying I don't need it. I've tried explaining to him in a way he can understand but he just shoots it down and comes back with saying the same thing, ""I don't need it"" and it makes me extremely self conscious on how I look and dress around him. 
Another example that comes to the top of my mind is we've just started easing our way into more spicy talks, so every now and then I would send him a pic of me, if you know what I mean, but the thing is he started requesting them more often and it kind of felt like he was begging for them? I don't really know how to describe it but the point it at first I would send them when I wanted to then it felt like I was sending them when he wanted them but now I just don't send them anymore because I've lost all want to send him anything. Now, those are just a few examples but there are more which I don't really want to dive into since it'll make this post a bit too long. I also don't want to break up with him because I love him and our families are close. So I decided to come to reddit to ask for advice, I've never used this app before so please excuse my writing.

But now he does that to me when our eyes meet and it just drives my heart nuts. I habitually bring sweets everywhere and give it to my friends because we work out a lot. But yesterday he brought a bag full of sweets and randomly threw me a candy and just walked away. And he let me hold onto his warm coffee and drink it because I told him I was cold. 

Despite it all he is a really likeable and everyone is so fond of him. And I have a feeling that he likes someones else. He's always around her and to be fair they look great together. I am trying to not get too attached to him since I'm a senior so I'm graduating pretty soon.

However him, myself and 7 other people are going on a trip next week. It's most likely the last time that I would see him before I graduate, so I'm not too sure if I should make a move or just let him be and see how it goes.

Basically I was friends with this guy at first and I started to catch feelings and we ended up calling and texting like crazy and telling each other very personal things. So at first I was like “oh cool we’re so close we’re telling each other things we’ve never told anyone else” kinda thing where I feel special because we humans always like to think we’re special. So the day after we have a long talk it’s just quiet and then today I get a text saying he wants to talk about something. Turned out a mutual friend was texting him and asking if there was something between us to which he responded “no we’re friends” and came to the realization he should check with me saying he’d be really worried if he was leading me on so I was like “haha nah we’re friends” and lied… He has some bad relationship trauma and about not meaning to lead people on and stuff and it’s because he’s not good at picking up signals but it stung a bit  since I couldn’t tell the truth. It was done partly to defend myself but also him. I still want to be friends and try to tell myself I’m happy with what he thinks right now but I just don’t know if I really am. Last thing I want to do though is admit I caught feelings and it explode spectacularly in our faces though and he runs away from the relationship because he thinks he’s hurting me. But honestly I’m not 100% sure if he’s positive we’re just totally friends either, cuz he let some really personal stuff slip, maybe I’m over shooting it but he admitted stuff to me he’s said he’s only ever admitted to one other important person. I don’t want to lose him and he’s not a jerk for just being himself, so he’s never lead me on since we never confirmed we were anything under than friends before comments start blaming him for what happened.

But during her birthday, I dont know what came up but I confess to her about my feeling, and she told me that she knew it all along because the way I act and the way I stare towards her and my sudden change of behavior towards her. But during that time I also have a guy friend who has a feeling for her, and really wants to pursue her. So after my confession, nothing happens or no progress at all because i don't know how to act or what to do in that situation. Until such time before our graduation she told me that she really doesn't have the same feelings towards me, but she didn't want us to end our friendship, so we still become friends, however alot changes. Because after we've graduated weve go separate ways during our senior high years. During 11th grade we still do chat and check on each other, there are times that she would ask for my help for her assignments and such, and we still continue talking to our favorite shows. 12th grade were still in contact and she invited me in her debut and I become one of the 18 roses, but i discover during that time she already have a guy which she has interest on, but they are still not together. So during that time I go back to my place again, as a friend. And I think maybe I am just a friend type of a guy.

And during gatherings together with my old classmates we act awkward, it is very hard to approach to her and vice versa, but in online we seems like very close. We talk late at night sometimes video call and sometimes we watch film together online. Then she told me that she will be leaving and will be going to Australia to finish her study, i was amazed and the same time shocked, but i totally support her in her goals and dream in life. Now we still talk and video call sometimes but due to time difference it became very hard for us to contact sometimes, may be because of our schedules too.

I’ve (22M) been in a relationship with this woman (22F) for about 4 years. We were super close and I lived with her. We’ve had a somewhat turbulent relationship, where when things were good they were really good and vice versa. Earlier this year we subtly broke things off after some really bad arguments, and we’ve been on and off ever since. We would still text, hangout every once and even go on dates, but pretty much doing our own thing between that. 

And now

I went on a work gig out of the country for about 2 weeks. When I came back I noticed that she was acting a bit different. Not really enthusiastic to see me as she would always be the one who  would hit me up first and whatnot. She also mentioned she got another job that has her there until 3am. Ive seen her social medias posts through a friend which pretty much shows her stripping. She has talked about being a stripper before and she is a model for rap videos so her friend group is kinda inclined towards that lifestyle. I have nothing against that kind of work but personally I just don’t think that means I have to be comfortable with that myself.

I know she still wants to be with me and I could see her stopping as she told me she wanted to work on things but at this point I’m just feeling really conflicted. During our break I’ve been working on my job experience, finishing books and going back to school and it just sucks she decided to go do something she wasn’t even comfortable telling me about. We’ve been talking to other people but we recently (about a months ago) talked about working on things as we identified obstacles that caused problems for us which aren’t there anymore. She told me she wanted me in her life. I just don’t get why she would do that after a productive conversation.

She wanted to wait to finish talking about everything until I wasn’t so busy with work and I passed my finals which made sense, but now I’m not too sure that’s why she wanted to wait. It feels like she wants the perks of having a boyfriend while still being single. She talks about doing an OF, hanging out with celebrities that I’m not comfortable with, and other stuff I’m just not into, yet she’s so persistent at keeping me around and expects me to make her my priority. I admit that she’d drop everything or leave from anywhere to see me but why do things that I’m clearly uncomfortable with when we just talked about getting back together? I’m going to talk to her about it tonight but I just don’t know how to not come off angry or basically give her an ultimatum although that’s what lm thinking I have to do. Is this even worth the trouble? 

Sorry for the rant, just conflicted.

I was debating posting here but I just needed some opinions/advice.

Basically, me and my girlfriend started dating in April 2022, we just hit our 6 months. We moved pretty fast, we met on a dating app and hit it off right away and hung out a lot and then started dating a month later. We went on a trip out of the country for 10 days only a month into our relationship &amp; it was great. We have a lot of fun together and we balance each other out. Whenever we get into small fights, we always communicate well and resolve it together. Also, I want to mention this is my first relationship. She’s a really great girlfriend and I can tell she really loves me and wants a future with me. She goes above and beyond for me and is super compassionate, it's just this one thing that weighs heavily on me especially right now.

So here it is:

Before meeting me, she was in a 3 year relationship, they were on and off for a while but officially broke up in december 2021. She told me how it was an unhealthy relationship and there are things he did to her that were inexcusable. When we first started talking, he would come up a decent amount in passing convo. For example, if i suggest “let's go eat here”, it would be a response like “oh me and my ex ate there it's good.” That's just a general example, I didn’t think anything of it because I understand that she shared a life with another guy for 3 years, they've been through a lot together so I get it. As time went on, I heard it less and less but she still brought it up from time to time, but only in passing conversation and I already kind of got used to it (I did express my concerns about hearing about it a decent amount so she stopped doing it as much). Also, she was seeing a therapist about her breakup before meeting me.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, we woke up Saturday morning and she told me she wants to call her ex-boyfriend just to get closure. I found it weird that we’ve already been dating for 6 months and now she wants to get closure, but I feel like I'm a pretty understanding person &amp; I never want to stop someone from doing something they feel they need to. I told her that yes It might make me feel a bit uncomfortable but I am confident in our relationship so do what you gotta do. The conversation basically ended with “we’ll talk about it more.” At this point, she still wasn’t 100% sure if she was going to do it.

Okay so, after that convo, she didn’t bring it up again and I kind of dismissed it as: “she is still debating if she wants to do it, she’ll let me know.” So the week following that Saturday, I believe it was a Wednesday, she kind of just stopped responding to me during the day for a couple hours. We usually message a lot during the day so I found it really odd but my mind didn't race to any conclusions because she never gave me a reason to. So about 2 or 3 hours go by and I get a voice memo saying “Hey, I finally did it, I called my ex, he wanted me to come by and pick up the rest of my stuff that's been at his house so I am on my way now.” That made my heart sink. I listened to the voice memo like 4 times because I couldn't believe it. It’s not that I thought anything would happen, it's just how fast everything happened, it went from us discussing it on Saturday even though I told her she should call him if she really wants to get closure and kinda close that chapter but she never really told me that she would, it was just something she was thinking about. She told me that she went to pick up her stuff and then they just sat in her car and caught up. One thing I want to add is that she told me they really bond over music. She said he got her into music and now she plays guitar and watches a lot of singers on instagram. This will be relevant later.

Anyways, I kind of start being dry over text to her because it hurts and also, I try to process situations instead of just getting mad and just saying things. So I kinda just took an hour to think about it and kind of process it. It really rubbed me the wrong way but I do trust her and I know she wouldn’t do anything. So anyways, we talked it out over the phone later that evening &amp; she told me that she got the closure she needed and he even tried to kiss her but she told him no lol. She reassured me that she got her closure &amp; she got her stuff back. So we figured it out and we were good.

But now that she reconnected with him to get closure, he messages her almost everyday saying “good morning” and other things like that, just kind of harmless messages. She told me about the messages right away &amp; showed me that she doesn't respond to them even though and told him that she has a boyfriend. I didn’t really ask and I would've never known he was messaging her if she didn't show me, so i was appreciative of that.

So fast forward to last week, I believe it was Wednesday again. She goes dark again, randomly stops responding to me for 2 hours. I found it suspicious because her last text was that she was done at the gym and going home to shower, so its not like she had some plans that would distract her from messaging me. So for the first hour, I didn’t really realize, but then because the situation from the week before was so fresh, thoughts started coming into my mind, “did she go see him again”? “are they talking on the phone right now”? Anyways, she ended up responding to me, she was being a little dry. Usually when she’s dry, it's because I did something wrong lol, but I know I didn't do anything. So I was working till 9pm that evening and we had plans to meet up, which we did. I picked her up and we went for a drive. 

Now, I'm going to skim through this part. My girlfriend has bad anxiety. I am someone who, as far as I know, has never dealt with anxiety or had a family member with anxiety. Her ex-boyfriend knew how to deal with her anxiety because he also had it. I’ve always tried to help when she had some anxiety attacks and I am always there for her when she calls or anything. 

Anyways, we meet up and I can tell when she did something wrong or something that I may not agree with. She tells me that today her anxiety was very bad and it was affecting her and she told me she felt like she had no choice so she called her ex so he could calm her down. Now, I kind of already expected this as I mentioned how my mind was wandering and I had a feeling something fishy happened but I wanted to be wrong. She told me that I don’t know how to calm her down and he’s been doing it for years so when i ask her “what does he do to calm you down so i can learn and be there for you”, she tells me she doesnt know how he does it, he just reassures her and that's exactly what I do, I guess i’ve only known her for 6 months and he dated her for 3 years. But anyways, we talked it out, she told me that from now on, she will call me for her anxiety and we will learn how to help her. 

Okay so this brings us to yesterday. We hung out the whole weekend and it was fun. Last night I came over to her house for dinner. We were in her room before dinner started and she was showing me a producer she found on instagram, as i mentioned her ex really got her into music. So as we’re watching, a text comes up from her ex. I see the name and then I look at her and I ask her what he said because I didn't read the actual message. She pulled up the convo and on Saturday, he messaged her to go to some show in a different state than us. She responded 24hrs later saying she couldn't but the problem was that, i saw that she sent him the same instagram producer she was showing me. She sent him the producers profile, no message with it. I asked her whats going on, before it was just him messaging you and you dont respond, now you’re sending him messages.

She went on to explain to me that, like i mentioned, he really got her into music and they share that passion and also how when they met up, he told her he started his own label and she really liked that and I just felt uncomfortable and I really didn’t know what to say. What also bothered me is that she said something along the lines of “oh i dont understand why society doesnt normalize being on good terms with your ex, like messaging them once in a while and seeing how they are.” Basically how this ended was that she asked me if I wanted her to cut off her ex completely and block him from text messages (she already blocked him everywhere else when they broke up). I told her i have no idea, because on one hand, yea i would like that, but on the other hand, I want her to want to block him, but I don’t like telling ppl what do and I kind of just wanted her to want to block him for the sake of our relationship &amp; i think she does. She apologized many times and decided she will not message him whatsoever and only come to me and teach me how to help her with her anxiety.

So yea reddit, i’m not even sure what i'm asking for here, I just don’t want to constantly worry about them communicating and if she's talking to him behind my back but any input at all would help me a lot because I don’t really have anyone I can go to and I guess i just want to know what you guys would do in this situation.

He broke up with me the first time because I was afraid of being in love with him because of something he did in the beginning. 
During the first 8 months he was the sweetest and kindest person I’ve ever known. I was very controlling and I never got over what he did to me, so I did love him so much but I was somewhat resentful unconsciously

  When we got back together I did gave him my 100 percent, I was sweet, kind, and even payed most of our dates together to help him save money for a new computer he was trying to buy. But he was somewhat always tired, and bored being with me, lacking enthusiasm and effort. 

  He did not respond  nice most of the time, couldn’t empathize with me, and didn’t even wanted to listen to me. I stayed 1.5 months asking him to change, and he made it all my problem saying I was to sensitive and that I shouldn’t take things personally because he’s just stressed about his own life. 

I decided to break up because I couldn’t handle it anymore. He said he tried everything and to be fair, he did try putting some effort in treating me better and attempted to listen and spend time with me,  he did went to the psychologist, but there still something that made him defensive about every little comment I said.

When we broke up he told me he was dealing with a lot of things in his life, he has no idea of how to progress in his career and he felt stuck. And that he needed to be alone to make big changes in his life. That he was on a Vortex, because he just found out thanks to me that he had mommy issues. I told him that I felt certain resentment towards me due to past hurt and he didn’t deny it, he said he loved me but that he doesn’t know how to work that out because he already tried.

   I offered time off to work himself out but he said that in his head it was over. He offered me to be his friends and he propose us to distance for a while. I really love him and I wish I had a chance to be with the old him, but I know everything is too broken. He asked me to go out in December and he said he won’t disappear entirely from my life and offered my his friendship, saying that he wants to be there for me at least as a friend; but that I shouldn’t wait for him, I should move on because he wants me to be happy. 

Do you think he will ever regret it? I wish he could work himself out and give us a chance but if he doesn’t .. Would it a good idea to stay friends after breaking some contact?

I say almost because although we've been on a few lunch dates, we aren't exclusive yet. 

I met him when I was 19 during university. I was stressed with my calculus as I'm not good with math. I guess it was easy to see I was stressed because he came up to my table and asked if I wanted help. I was thankful, and after he left, I began having a crush on him. I saw him again a few times, and we introduced ourselves. He took a long break before beginning university because he had to help raise his half-siblings. That explained his age. We both realized that we shared the same interests, and he continued to help me with my classes. When I turned 20, I tried telling him that I liked him. But he never noticed my advances. After a while, I just blurted it out to him as I couldn't hold onto it anymore. He took it really well, and this past year we've been going really slow forming our relationship. And now I'm just waiting for him to ask me out to be his girlfriend.

So, now to my family.

I don't know how but my relatives, sister, and brother heard that I was seeing someone. As I never dated before, they're excited for me to bring him over for my cousin's wedding. I know my family, and I know they have an opinion on age gap relationships. A cousin of mine dated a guy older in the past, which led to accusations flying around. Now because he is nine years older than me, and I'm afraid they will say he's using me or that the situation with the cousin is the same. I don't think they would believe me if I told them that I was the one who pursued him, not the other way around. Now I can say that I'm an adult and I can do whatever I want, but I know someone will say ""you're 21, but you met when you were 19"".

He's had conversations with him before about this, and he's seemingly understanding, but I worry MH comes off as frazzled and upset and doesn't properly get his points across. SM also does a poor job of disciplining and delegating to the other lower managers and associates, and as a result, some jobs get done badly or wrong, and my husband ends up either having to do it completely or over their shoulder.

He's always had a really good work ethic and takes pride in doing a good job, he doesn't want to ""slack off"" (I tell him refusing to do his manager's work is not slacking off), but the pressure of it is starting to get to him. 

Aside from the boss, it's the best location he's ever worked at, and he knows there are a lot of things there he's happy with. I'm worried he's close to snapping and just walking out, so I wanted to see if anyone had any good tips for learning how to just let work...be work, and some good conversation tips for him and myself to talk about this together. We've spoken about it before also, but it's not really an easy topic to broach without coming off as insensitive. I had and quit a job I hated last year and I know if he had just told me, ""oh just stop worrying so much, it'll be fine"" I would have wept. He was supportive of me finding a new job and quitting, but the key is that I found a new job before I quit. We're very fortunate in the sense that we live a comfortable, halfway stress-free life finances-wise, but we are also people who within a month of losing an income would be struggling.

It just sucks because he likes the company and wants to move up into corporate eventually, or at least out of the store level, but I know this is tough on him because he isn't good at taking a step back and accepting that if his boss doesn't want to do his own job duties then they just won't get down, and that shouldn't be his problem.

So much has happened in this time. 

My boyfriend has a 14 year old son who he has full physical custody of. The reason he has custody is because 2 years ago he wanted to live with him, he would talk about how terrible his mother is and how she uses severe punishment but honestly it’s because he did not like that he actually had rules. He thought my partners house would be different but when he realized he actually has rules and can’t do what ever he wanted he started to do the same thing he did with his mother.

So as soon as I arrived home from the hospital still healing and trying to navigate taking care of a newborn. Stepson decided he wants to live with his mother now. I told my partner he needs to let him stay because forcing him to come back would be a lot of stress in the household that I don’t think I can handle.

At first he was going to let him stay. When they came to get his things his mother called me a bitch (I’ve never spoken to this woman) on my front porch when she could see I was holding my 1 week old baby. 

My boyfriend changed his mind a few days later and made stepson come back to live here because he did not want to pay child support, or wanted to be able to “negotiate” the payments. We argued about this, he would yell and scream at me while I was holding out son saying none of this is his fault. Stepson has been known to throw severe manic fits that last for hours so my boyfriend called Chileans hospital incase he had to have him committed. 

A week or so later we got these crazy serving paper letters for court where stepson is claiming he is mentally abused and subjected to unnecessary punishment. (None if it true) did not surprise me though he did the same thing with his mother. 

It’s been 4 months of stepson living here. He has thrown fits, made my life hell. Suddenly he told my boyfriend he wants to live here now because he made friends at school. 

My boyfriend said he doesn’t regret bring him back even though all the drama and stress it has caused. He will still yell in front of the baby if I bring it up. He doesn’t seem to actually care about me. He still complains about his baby mama and things stepson does and I literally don’t want to hear it anymore, I don’t care. 

He gets cheap rent because we rent a house from my parents he pays $275 a month. My parents are going to be watching the baby when I go back to work and I created a list of things he will need and asked him to send me half the money he bitched and said he can’t give me that much ($150) but will give his son $40 to go with his friends and then buy a PS5. He has this way of making me feel sorry for him and talking his way out of things, but he’s later I realize it.

Okay so, after that convo, she didn’t bring it up again and I kind of dismissed it as: “she is still debating if she wants to do it, she’ll let me know.” So the week following that Saturday, I believe it was a Wednesday, she kind of just stopped responding to me during the day for a couple hours. We usually message a lot during the day so I found it really odd but my mind didn't race to any conclusions because she never gave me a reason to. So about 2 or 3 hours go by and I get a voice memo saying “Hey, I finally did it, I called my ex, he wanted me to come by and pick up the rest of my stuff that's been at his house so I am on my way now.” That made my heart sink. I listened to the voice memo like 4 times because I couldn't believe it. It’s not that I thought anything would happen, it's just how fast everything happened, it went from us discussing it on Saturday even though I told her she should call him if she really wants to get closure and kinda close that chapter but she never really told me that she would, it was just something she was thinking about. She told me that she went to pick up her stuff and then they just sat in her car and caught up. One thing I want to add is that she told me they really bond over music. She said he got her into music and now she plays guitar and watches a lot of singers on instagram. This will be relevant later.

Anyways, I kind of start being dry over text to her because it hurts and also, I try to process situations instead of just getting mad and just saying things. So I kinda just took an hour to think about it and kind of process it. It really rubbed me the wrong way but I do trust her and I know she wouldn’t do anything. So anyways, we talked it out over the phone later that evening &amp; she told me that she got the closure she needed and he even tried to kiss her but she told him no lol. She reassured me that she got her closure &amp; she got her stuff back. So we figured it out and we were good.

But now that she reconnected with him to get closure, he messages her almost everyday saying “good morning” and other things like that, just kind of harmless messages. She told me about the messages right away &amp; showed me that she doesn't respond to them even though and told him that she has a boyfriend. I didn’t really ask and I would've never known he was messaging her if she didn't show me, so i was appreciative of that.

So fast forward to last week, I believe it was Wednesday again. She goes dark again, randomly stops responding to me for 2 hours. I found it suspicious because her last text was that she was done at the gym and going home to shower, so its not like she had some plans that would distract her from messaging me. So for the first hour, I didn’t really realize, but then because the situation from the week before was so fresh, thoughts started coming into my mind, “did she go see him again”? “are they talking on the phone right now”? Anyways, she ended up responding to me, she was being a little dry. Usually when she’s dry, it's because I did something wrong lol, but I know I didn't do anything. So I was working till 9pm that evening and we had plans to meet up, which we did. I picked her up and we went for a drive. 

Now, I'm going to skim through this part. My girlfriend has bad anxiety. I am someone who, as far as I know, has never dealt with anxiety or had a family member with anxiety. Her ex-boyfriend knew how to deal with her anxiety because he also had it. I’ve always tried to help when she had some anxiety attacks and I am always there for her when she calls or anything. 

Anyways, we meet up and I can tell when she did something wrong or something that I may not agree with. She tells me that today her anxiety was very bad and it was affecting her and she told me she felt like she had no choice so she called her ex so he could calm her down. Now, I kind of already expected this as I mentioned how my mind was wandering and I had a feeling something fishy happened but I wanted to be wrong. She told me that I don’t know how to calm her down and he’s been doing it for years so when i ask her “what does he do to calm you down so i can learn and be there for you”, she tells me she doesnt know how he does it, he just reassures her and that's exactly what I do, I guess i’ve only known her for 6 months and he dated her for 3 years. But anyways, we talked it out, she told me that from now on, she will call me for her anxiety and we will learn how to help her. 

Okay so this brings us to yesterday. We hung out the whole weekend and it was fun. Last night I came over to her house for dinner. We were in her room before dinner started and she was showing me a producer she found on instagram, as i mentioned her ex really got her into music. So as we’re watching, a text comes up from her ex. I see the name and then I look at her and I ask her what he said because I didn't read the actual message. She pulled up the convo and on Saturday, he messaged her to go to some show in a different state than us. She responded 24hrs later saying she couldn't but the problem was that, i saw that she sent him the same instagram producer she was showing me. She sent him the producers profile, no message with it. I asked her whats going on, before it was just him messaging you and you dont respond, now you’re sending him messages.

She went on to explain to me that, like i mentioned, he really got her into music and they share that passion and also how when they met up, he told her he started his own label and she really liked that and I just felt uncomfortable and I really didn’t know what to say. What also bothered me is that she said something along the lines of “oh i dont understand why society doesnt normalize being on good terms with your ex, like messaging them once in a while and seeing how they are.” Basically how this ended was that she asked me if I wanted her to cut off her ex completely and block him from text messages (she already blocked him everywhere else when they broke up). I told her i have no idea, because on one hand, yea i would like that, but on the other hand, I want her to want to block him, but I don’t like telling ppl what do and I kind of just wanted her to want to block him for the sake of our relationship &amp; i think she does. She apologized many times and decided she will not message him whatsoever and only come to me and teach me how to help her with her anxiety.

So yea reddit, i’m not even sure what i'm asking for here, I just don’t want to constantly worry about them communicating and if she's talking to him behind my back but any input at all would help me a lot because I don’t really have anyone I can go to and I guess i just want to know what you guys would do in this situation.

We live together and are talking about engagement and marriage. About 2 years ago (around 1 year into our relationship) I was abruptly pulled off my oral birth control due to my migraines, causing me to be too high risk for oral hormonal birth control. So then we had to figure out a new BC method. The obvious choice was an IUD. So I got the copper IUD and it was horrible. I basically had a period for 6 months straight with very few day or two breaks in between. This obviously affected our sex life. But regardless, one day I was period free and he was really horny so he ate me out. After he just finished, he looked up at me at me and said i tasted different. We transitioned into sex and that was that. I felt kind of awkward about it but it just seemed like a one off comment. Figured it was probably related to my unending bleeding and that he was just thinking aloud. But then he never went down on me again for a year. Eventually I was fed up with the bleeding and changed my BC again. After a 3 month transition period, I stopped having periods all together. So I figured once he felt comfortable that this weird period thing was gone, our sex life (including oral) would resume as normal. But he never offered it again and never did it when I said I wanted it. He’d just sort of change subjects and I’m not one to ask for things multiple times so I’d just drop it. And that made me feel horrible. He never said it was directly linked to that one time but it seemed obvious that it was. Like something changed that one time because of my taste. Prior to this event, he talked about how much he loved it and how he’d offer relatively frequently. In the past year months he’s done it two or three times and has offered a few more times that I’ve turned down. I just found I can’t enjoy it at all because I just feel so anxious. 

So I brought it up finally recently and said did this one time change things. And he basically said yes it did and that he was worried for my “health” when he said it. Which to me was ridiculous. He knew I was bleeding constantly and my hormones were all over the place from my birth control. It shouldn’t be a surprise I tasted different. I had started spiraling about why he liked to do it to his exes and never to me. Because surely this one event 2 years ago wasn’t enough to make him never go down on me again. After all that I didn’t want him touching me intimately at all for awhile. But now that I’ve gotten over that hump, I have come to the conviction that I just won’t let him go down on me ever again. Which I’m sure he won’t complain too much about anyways. I just need to feel like I need to have more control in this situation. I need to know it’s just off the table so I’m not left wondering. 

I brought it up once and I think he interpreted it as a “don’t go down on me during this session” not a never go down on me again. How do I best communicate this decision to him without making it seem like I’m starting a fight?

So like the title says my ex and I broke up about a month ago just because of long distance complications. She’s the one who broke it off with me but it was generally consensual.

A couple weeks go by and I’m doing fine mentally with the breakup and I was generally happy. My ex was making continuous attempts to get back together after she realized life without me I guess and I kept denying them.

She is coming back in town for Thanksgiving break and said she wanted to talk in person and I said I didn’t want to do that(just because I didn’t want to have any I guess setbacks in my healing from the breakup). She kept saying she had things to tell me but I didn’t really care at that point and then finally over text she admits she cheated on me a week before she broke up with me.

She said she did it because she was frustrated with long distance and very drunk so she couldn’t really control it. But the fact that she said she was mad at us was a factor makes me think it wasn’t entirely non-consensual. 

She now says she’s doing really bad mentally(she’s always had mental problems that I’ve dealt with) and needs to talk in person to get over all of this. 

I just really don’t want to do that especially now that I learned the news that she cheated on me.

We were good friends when we worked together, but have barely talked to each other since. The only real contact we have with each other is our Snapchat streaks. When we worked together, we talked about being each other's bridesmaids, but that was when we were actually friends. When she got engaged some time last year and posted it on Snapchat, I congratulated her on a direct snap message, and she messaged me back asking me to be her bridesmaid. I was hesitant because we barely knew each other anymore and hadn't had a real conversation or seen each other in years, but I said yes. Like a year has gone by and they're getting married at the end of April. I haven't heard much about the wedding at all besides the wedding date, the venue location, and wedding colors. I haven't heard about an engagement party if she had one, a bridal shower, or bachelorette party if she's having one. I won't know a single person there besides her kind of. She has 3 other bridesmaids and I don't know/haven't met any of them. I bought my bridesmaid dress online because the only requirement was that it was her wedding color, she had no preference what it looked like. I have seen her once since we've worked together, and that was to meet her fiancé. He was a really kind person like her, and they seem like a cute pair. I had a Halloween party and invited the couple, but it was a short notice invite and they said they couldn't come, but suggested we meet up sometime again, she, her fiancé, my boyfriend and myself. That hasn't happened yet. She and her fiancé have more complicated schedules while my boyfriend and I work 9-5 Monday-Friday, so I said I'd let her say when they were available.

I’ve only had 2 ex boyfriends and both were extremely toxic. In both relationships I was absolutely love bombed, given attention 24/7 and it was suffocating. I wasn’t allowed to do anything without them being there. I gave up my hobbies and activities since they demanded all of my attention. For both relationships I was supposed to be in call with them for hours. When I wake up, come back home from school and sometimes even go to sleep in call. 

For example; the first boyfriend was pissed off when he found out I love gaming because it isn’t something he likes to do and doesn’t want my attention to be diverted elsewhere so I dropped gaming for him. After we broke up and I got with my second boyfriend, he was into gaming but I wasn’t allowed to play with anyone else. 

I am so used to someone begging for my attention, good or bad, and always being there. I know it’s something extremely bad but it’s what I’m used to. I’m currently in my first healthy relationship, it’s only been 5 months but I could tell it won’t be the same. I haven’t dated anyone in 4 years after my second breakup. Here’s where the problem comes; I’m not used to this. I’m not used to someone not being completely obsessed with me that this doesn’t feel like love. He has his own hobbies, activities and friends. A whole life. He takes hours to text back because he’s busy with university projects/tests, doesn’t use his phone when he’s out with friends but would generally text me where he’s going and keeps me updated, we barely call since I sleep very early or am busy throughout the day and he doesn’t expect me to drop what I’m doing for him. He doesn’t require 100% of my attention nor beg for it. We go to the same university but don’t drop our friends to hang out with each other but do take some time to chat up in the hallways or go out for lunch. Sometimes I wouldn’t see him for a month because it’s either he’s busy or I’m busy. I know a month sounds very long; I live in a middle eastern country so going out with a guy alone is already a risky thing to do and when we do it, it’s very discreet. But fuck I want to see him 24/7, have him talk to me all the time, call me, just give me attention and it’s not healthy for him or me. 

How do I fix this? I don’t want to ruin such a good relationship. I’ve never been happier but I also have never been sadder. It doesn’t feel like love because I’m not used to it. I know he loves me a lot. He says it. But I can’t stop my overthinking and I feel like shit most days because I don’t get the attention I’m used to. Please help me. It hurts knowing I could self sabotage this whole relationship for my selfish needs, it’s me being needy. We already got in a fight over this and he told me what I’m asking for is overwhelming and stressful. We overcame the issue but I can’t stop thinking about how much I could be affecting him negatively. I want to make him happy and show him that I appreciate him no matter what.

Beyond sad to be precise. Insecure, angry, and hopeless are only a few words that can describe the prison I call my relationship. He cheats on me consistently and has made it clear since we’ve gotten together he doesn’t actually care about me. Don’t ask me why I wasted my time trying to make our relationship work or why I was okay with having a baby with him because I don’t know. When we got together I was in a hard time of my life, the first two weeks were really great before he showed me why I should leave and I showed him how dedicated and persistent I can really be. Fast forward to a year and a half later, we have a 3 month old son and are living in a place together. Although that hasn’t changed anything other than making his actions hurt me worse which has resulted in nasty arguments I never want my son around. I want him to be shown what true love looks like, I want to show him how you treat others if you respect them and mainly how to show himself respect always. I will never be ready to end this relationship but I’m ready to be able to breathe, to love myself again and to put my focus where it needs to be which is on my son of course. So far it’s been me focused on my family, trying to keep us together but I know I can’t do that anymore. I want to leave and focus on my son but I’m worried I’ll just end up sad and crying constantly, laying down and to depressed to do what I need to do like changing baby, cleaning his bottles, waking up to feed him and to feed myself and clean my house and give him a good environment. Im sad now but afraid of him getting mad at me so it makes me stay awake and taking care of things. If I’m worried about handling the basics how can I handle the rest like teaching him how to eat, talk, walk and building his senses and playing with him? I want nothing but the best but I don’t know how to do it. Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR: My boyfriend isn’t good to me and I want to leave to focus on my baby and I but I’m afraid. I don’t know how to leave, I don’t know how to keep myself alive enough to take care of my baby and I after he’s gone.

I have been going for this girl for months, and I thought things were going really well. We would hang out often, and we made each other happy (probably). Eventually, I left the group chat with a group of friends and heard about everything they thought about me. I have since cut ties from most of them, and i was feeling better. There has been a little history with people in our little group separate peoplee) liking her, but I was the only one who made it anywhere as far as I know. I am afraid of having sex as it only leads to bad things in my experience. I just want to be with her, but this shattered me.

Anyways
A few nights ago, we were having normal conversations. we were talking about the snow and our favorite seasons. We disagreed on the best, but it's not that deep. At one point, i just told her, ""You looked really good today,"" and then she just told me to stop and said it was too much. Then suddenly, the conversation turned into accusations, her saying I only want sex from her etc. It was apparently a long-term thing, but i didn't make changes as this was not communicated to me. When i said I would make changes to make him feel better, she said I wouldn't and have never done it. Then she brought up a day where I thought I was just doing cute gestures (playing with her hair and other things) she said she told me to stop multiple times but I don't recall any of them. I only remember that she was smiling and was giggly and playful. The only time she said stop was more of a ""stawwp"" than like actually telling me to stop. Apparently, I can't take a hint that was invisible to my eyes. It is just chewing me up on a deep level. I want to be with her deeply, but these past few days have been grueling. I know that I don't want that from her, but i also don't know how to put it into words without her assuming I'm lying or being manipulative. I just want her to be happy, but I'm now fearing that that may not be with me. It's scary to me because it's coming from nowhere, and it's extreme. It only gets worse with the fact she ghosted me afterward, and It feels like I can't do anything about it, and it's all over. This is all hurting more than anyone will believe.i feel like I've lost everyone and everything. I mean, i really have, but im just being dramatic. I'll take any words tbh.
