The girlfriend believes love demands sacrifice and feels I should be the one to make this sacrifice. 

I hear her and try my best to understand her but I feel that there's no reason to feel this way and expressing this is tantamount to invalidating her feelings. She only has issue with this one friend despite having other friends that are girls. She says I'm selfish and trying to control what she thinks and feels but won't hear my perspective explained.

Some background abt me, I had absolutely no experience prior to this which means I never even kissed before. Physical Touch is my main love language. Also I can be a bit slow to notice so bear with me… so lets start bcs this is gonna be rlly long.

I (22f) lost my virginity to fake-name Tom (29m) who I matched on a dating app. We didn’t really text a lot and just set up a date to meet up quite fast (I dont enjoy texting either so I’m grateful for this). Thankfully we actually really hit it off immediately. We ordered some to go casual dinner and found a pretty empty but well-lit place nearby and just sat side by side eating and talking. The seat was not so big so we had to stick hip-to-hip from the beginning. Quite soon after we finished out food, we just kept talking and things  started to get touchy-feely which I really dont mind at all. We held hands, he had his hand on my waist, he smells my hair and neck, and then we moved to a nearby public space which was really dark but you could see the surrounding area lights. Then we started cuddling - i think- and at one point we started kissing. Then he asked me if I wanted to go to his place to play something we both liked. So I said sure (after all I was really enjoying the date and at this point I was ready and didn’t really care if I lost my virginity). 

We got to his place and we talked about what we’re searching for in the dating app. In which I responded I’m not sure but definitely not just a DTF kinda thing. He responded by saying he’s not a relationship guy but a casual lover guy and that he’s not gonna restrict me from meeting others because he does as well. Ok I understood this and am okay with this so we just continued the night. We basically ended up having sex and cuddled a bit after. Then he said we’ll wash up and then send me home. At this point I was hoping to spend the night cuddling or smth but I also didn’t want to overstep and ask to stay the night because if he smh said no that would be rlly embarrassing. So we showered separately, me first then him after while I waited in his room. And when he finished we talked a bit more before he took out his phone to order an uber for me but it was ridiculously expensive so I just said I would just walk home since I only lived 15-20mins away and the area we live is super safe. And so he walked me down and I walked home.

Now I told a guy friend about my situation and how I hoped to be asked to stay the night but  never did and my friend said I was dumb because there were obvious signs that he wanted me to stay the night. He said that a guy wouldn’t rlly offer to both shower at his place and wouldn’t cuddle after sex if he rlly didn’t want me to stay the night. But bcs I went along with his suggestion to send me home after shower, he prolly think I dont want to spend the night and didn’t want to overstep by asking. 

At this point I also knew that theres no future in this and I also let go of any emotional attachment to Tom, fully expecting and accepting that this is prolly a one-night-stand. (This is bcs I tried asking him out for a movie twice and after hours he didnt reply so I unsent them). Then the next week came and he just casually texted me if I’m free that night (im not) and then another week came and same thing (again not free I was out of the country). In which he responded “ok see you when u come back”.

Now my confusion are;
Did he really show he wanted me to spend the night? 
Should I meet him again next time he ask?
Can I ask him if I can spend the night? How?
Would a guy ask a girl to meet again if the sex was bad?

I'm posting here seeking advice for a situation that I have never really wrapped my head around. I met N in late 2020– he was my cousin J's best friend, and he began to come over to my family's house a lot. I started to like him, but had been planning an out of state move, and he didn't seem receptive, so nothing went anywhere. I moved out early 2021 and came back home sometime around May. My move didn't work out and I felt pretty depressed. I was reunited with N again, and we spent a ton of time together with my family. My feelings for him grew, and I felt like he liked me too. My family went on a houseboat trip sometime in July, where N met my younger sister A (20F). She had a boyfriend, and I remember speaking to J's sister (33F) after the trip who asked me if N and A were dating. Later, N drunkenly confessed to me that he wanted to date A, but that her boyfriend didn't like him so they had to stop talking. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, N and I began a casual relationship. We slept together every weekend for months on end and kept it a secret. I began to fall in love with him, but it was clear that he never wanted me. A would come to visit periodically, and every time she did, her and N would be close as ever. He ended things with me last October and told me he didn't want a relationship, and I was heartbroken for months. After the ordeal, I had to continue seeing him and act as if nothing happened. Slowly but surely, I moved on, went to therapy, started an amazing job. Then, eleven months later, he reached out to me. We went on our very first date last Friday, and we went back to his place. It felt amazing, and I was so happy. But I knew how N felt, and I knew I couldn't do this to myself again. So, I ended things for good this time, and blocked him before he could respond. Now, I am utterly heartbroken, having found myself in the same mental state as when he left me last year. A knows about everything as my other sister M (20F) told her everything, and my relationship with A has always been rocky so I feel like she plays on that every time we have been around N in the same room. So, RA, how can I move past this?

She is 31 but youthful looking, beautiful &amp; athletic (abs). She loves exercise, playing the piano, watching football, writing and baking for family &amp; friends - her cakes look amazing actually. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her. In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously.

She went to two very good universities so she is intelligent. She is currently an elementary school tutor and hasn't really had much of a career as she's still figuring things out. At present she works 20 hours per work tutoring in school, 1 hour every two weeks doing radio reporting, 2 hours a week doing sports writing and 1 hour private tuition... so this is about 23 hours per week. Therefore she is working part time. She comes from a wealthy family but she's down to earth. However I feel as though she isn't as motivated to do well in life as she has her family's money to fall back on - she only has $27k saved up, doesn't own a car and relies on her parents a lot (still lives at home although it's a huge house).

I'm a bit worried as she's been complaining about things that are affecting her work and, as her current contract ends in about 8 weeks time, she is looking to take a break from work for a bit then. She suffers with anxiety which impacts her breathing. She tells me her breathing is the worst it has been - she often struggles to catch her breath and she has a constant trapped sensation in her throat. She claims that at work she feels she is constantly trying to breathe especially as her school is quite warm - it's worse in hotter temperatures and she has to plan her outfits around this (she can't wear polo necks as she feels more suffocated or thick jumpers etc).

First of all, I (28f) am in a happy 4 year relationship with my boyfriend (26m) and just a few weeks ago we were happy talking about marriage and a future with kids and there was no doubt for me that this soon was going to happen. We ne er really had any significant problems or fights.

2 months ago I got a new coworker and we were getting along pretty well from the start - no second thoughts about this since I was happy to have him supporting me in a project which I had to run alone for 2 years and finally I had a team partner. He is married and has a daughter.
We work from different locations so usually we were on zoom and over time our zoom calls got longer and longer and besides work topics we started to more and more add in private topics. I did not notice what was going on until he came to my location and we were able to catch up in person. I noticed I was extremely nervous and excited and enjoyed being around him so much. Nothing in particular happened but our contact intensified more after that. First thing in the morning has been texting each other ever since even though no work topic was going on. This was initiated from both his and my side. It seems like we are mutually drawn to each other and always when there was no contact I missed him like crazy. Slowly this started sinking in for me...
This week we again by coincidence found out we were in the same work location and decided we would gather some colleagues to have dinner all together. End of story was that all the others left on short notice and - again not intentionally planned - we ended up together just us 2. I was nervous af but it was the best evening I have had in years. We talked for approx. 4 h and it was so smooth and easy and even the deepest topics were so comfortable to touch with him. I started noticing that this level of depth might have been missing in my current relationship because the dinner evening instead of (what I hoped) destroying my projection made me fall even deeper in love. And I am saying it like this since it does not feel like just a crush at all.
I somehow sense that he feels this same way but we are both in relationships and I by NO means want to neither destroy my relationship nor do I want to destroy a happy little family on his side.

I have no idea what to do about it. I know I should talk to my current partner and we should try to find a way to work our way through this hardship and then eventually it might pass...? But I know it would deeply hurt him and he is kinda insecure a out himself. It would destroy him.

First i am sorry for my english. I cant speak well but i hope i can explain my problems. I [28/M] have a gf [34/F] for 3,5 years. I was a master degree student. In summer, in my holiday i visited my family. In my family house i was bored and i wanted to learn english. I downloaded an application. You can find native speakers in that application. And i was talking with a few persons. Then i met a woman. And we started to talk. We liked each other. And we started to talk everyday. I was falling in love. I was feeling different with her. Before her, i would joke my friends who chat and having relationship online but it happened to me. Anyways we were talking everyday. We were bf/gf. But she was living other side of earth. Totally different culture, different religions, different lifestyle.  I and my gf arent religious but our families are a little bit religious. She is older than me. And the biggest problem is her child. I dont have problem with her child, even i like her child but it may be problem for my family. Anyways we were keeping talk in whatsapp. I graduated from master degree and i came to live my family house because pandemia started and i couldnt find job. Thats why i was helping my dad's job. In these process i was very afraid and sad. Because my gf will visit me. And how could i handle? How could i hide? If my parents learn?
She bought a ticket to come my country. I was nervous. And i couldnt hide more and i told to my mom. I have a gf who is foreigner and elder and having son. I was surprised because she didnt scold me. She said first meet her and see how she is. Then i decided my anciety was not necessary. A few days later she mentioned to my dad. And he knew that i have a gf but he hasnt known her to have a child. They supported me. My father is close mind. In his culture, couple cant sleep same house etc. You can imagine how he is. But he didnt say anything bad to me. He gave me money and took me to airport. And i have finally met my gf. We went a few cities of my country. We had holiday. Lots travels. And my mom said come our house and let us meet her. Now we are in parents house. She is laying down in same bed with me. In my culture it is wrong but my dad didnt say anything. He is in another room. But i cant stop thinking about future. 
We decided to continue. I want to marry with her. She wants too. But her child cant come to here. And she has to go to see her child every year. It will cost too much. I should earn much. If i work far from my family, i have to find a company to work. I can survive with that wage but we cant pay her tickets bla bla. But if i live in my family town, i can do my own job. I can earn more but i am afraid. Because family town is small place and lots gossip. I dont like this place but i think i can earn money more in here. I dont know how to handle. 
And a week later she will go to her country. I asked ""what will happen to your child?"". She said i will talk with my mom and find a solution. 
I feel like stucked. I cant decided for anything. I dont want what i want. I only know i want her. I matched with her much. I really want her in rest of my life. But i dont know where to live.

Basically, I have been dating this really sweet guy (18m) for nearly 6 months. I have to say, I love him a lot, he's a great person. But 2 months ago he started to become very distant. We'd just occasionally text and it didn't really give me any sort of romantic satisfaction. He said he's struggling mentally and he's sorry for being distant and not giving me enough attention. He said he wants to change for me but he didn't change at all.

One day he texted me and said that he needs a break, that he feels like I'm a burden to him and that he just needs space. I felt terrible, I was really scared and just overall panicking. I love this man! I didn't want it to end.

The next day in the evening, he finally texted me. I was so happy, but it was completely different than I expected. He told me that he feels like we need to break up. He said he doesn't feel in love anymore. I asked him to think about it and he decided that he won't break up. Because he doesn't want to hurt me. Meanwhile I was shaking and crying so much, it was unreal to me. The days after that I tried to communicate that I didn't like this whole situation and that we need to work it out. But he doesn't seem to be much of a communication person so we just acted like nothing happened.

Time after that felt normal as always, but he was again not doing much for the relationship and continued being dry. At first I didn't want to start a fight with him so I just let it happen and tried to be as positive as possible. But he started to ""forget"" to reply to me while just playing video games. When I called him out on that he said that he was busy and that I need to give him space. 

Everyday in our relationship just became sadder and sadder. He'd go to sleep without saying goodnight or leave me on read and say that he fell asleep. I do understand that and I'm not mad at him for falling asleep, but he already told me that he has no sleep schedule and has no interest in fixing it. He also has other mental problems like eating disorders which he also doesn't want to fix.

Recently I started to connect more with other people in hope to find friends who I could talk to, when he doesn't reply to me again. So I started to talk to some people and they made me feel extremely happy. They gave me compliments and attention and I genuinely felt great. But that also made me realize how much our relationship was lacking. He'd never give me compliments or make me feel good like that and it made me feel terrible. 

I always would give him compliments, make him feel loved and accepted about his insecurities and just genuinely make him feel confident whenever I could. But I never get anything like that back.

For example, I also have some mental problems and I talked about it with some of my friends and they made me feel so accepted, I really started crying out of joy. He never made me feel like that, whenever I'd talk about my problems he would brush it off and start taking about something completely different. One time I had a relapse and told him that I need his help, that I'm having a relapse and that I'm scared and panicking. His reply was ""ok💀""....

But I never stopped loving him, I tried to be accepting and a good girlfriend. I gave him tips on how to improve his mental health, all the information I had just so he'd know where to start improving, but he'd always say that he doesn't need that and that he will be fine.

He obviously isn't fine but I really don't want to break up with him. Whenever he tells me that he loves me I start forgiving him. A few days ago he said that he's really extremely sorry for how he made me feel and that he loves me so much. I stupidly said that he never ever hurt me at all and that he's the best. Only a few moments after that I realized how stupid that was of me. I always tend to be a people pleaser but I didn't think it could be that bad.

This relationship is just making me feel unbalanced and unhappy. I told him the bits of this truth and he said he will try his best. 

But right now I'm again crying over him. He said he's not sure if he is over his ex and it's just making me so angry, I want to scream and cry out so loudly that he would finally hear me. He left me on read again because he probably passed out from sleep deprivation. I tried to be calm and accepting but I feel so hopeless at this moment. Why is this so complicated, why does he always end up hurting me like this? I'm not even sure if I want to talk about it because he said his ex is a bad topic to talk about.

I'd never initiate an argument with her once, no matter how much something annoyed me I was frightened that the next argument would lead to her leaving so never brought anything up - which obviously tells me I got extremely anxiously attached at times as I showed other symptoms of that too. I'd always apologise and take accountability no matter if I intended to start an argument or not or if I even felt like what I'd done warranted an argument, it felt like screaming underwater at times though - no matter what I said she would disregard as if I never said it and tell me something else.

The relief I felt when we'd make up was like heaven because I was constantly worried that this is the end and this happened 4/5 times (all within the first 5 weeks by the way), I never realised I had this abandonment issue and if I did I would've clarified it to her early on and start working on it asap. We never actually met one on one but seen each other out clubbing on several occasions before and after we admitted we liked each other, she cancelled the two dates last minute we planned and avoided rescheduling for the entire time so I came to the conclusion recently that I was potentially a rebound as she would still speak to her ex's and talked about them 2/3 times within the first few weeks. Or does she possibly just have an avoidant attachment style?

I ended up feeling like I was being needy for trying to schedule something with her as she always had an excuse, for context we seen each other three times since we started speaking - all from me walking her home from a Saturday night out clubbing (not together, we were out with separate friend groups and ran into each other) as she lives a 1 minute walk from me. Every time I'd bring up meeting each other it would be ignored until I ask again where I get a maybe or something along those lines, yet I brought it up CONSTANTLY I felt it was necessary I see her so I can properly open up about myself and where I want this to go between us - I couldn't do this over Snapchat as you get about 100 words ffs.. I couldn't have made it any clearer. I don't feel it is unreasonable to expect a date within 8 weeks, after she said the night we admitted we liked each other ""you should've messaged me earlier, asked me on a date you know?""..

The last week we spoke she went away for a weekend trip and didn't reply for over 24 hours but was still posting things all over social media, it set my overthinking off like mad so I asked for reassurance (as i was actually intending on asking if she wants to move forward with each other and ask again if she wants to organise something between us) and she cut things off as she thought I was second guessing her and stonewalled me after we argued &amp; I apologised in the morning. Again, it is entirely my own fault for being so anxious and it's something I'm working on but I feel like it's necessary I bring this up as this is how it ended between us. I asked to talk about it with her, or give me a few days as my anxiety was bad but she cut me off and said she was going to ignore me from here on out.

We spoke for 8 weeks, and haven't spoke for 7 weeks now. Almost completely no-contact, she slowly removed me from all socials but we have seen each other twice whilst clubbing, didn't speak or anything. Why am I still not over this, despite realising how toxic it was between us (from both of us btw, but in different ways) and no longer as attracted to her as I once was? I don't know if I did fall in love or not, I didn't see anyone else the way I seen her and genuinely wanted to give her everything for how understanding she seemed of my confidence issues. Every hour of every day since I've overthought about this, what I could've done in every situation etc. I thought I was over it until these last few days where it's like I'm back to square one.

I've vaguely read up on a trauma bond but I feel like that's pretty extreme, but also feel it might make sense? The closest I felt was when we made up after arguing, which happened regularly, is there any potential that was intermittent reinforcement? The only time she said she wanted to see me was after we made up, and its the need I made clear every week, but obviously she ended up cancelling last minute anyway. I feel like that's clutching at straws but because of my attachment issues was everything maybe emphasised a bit more?

Any idea why I'm feeling the way I do still? Just missing the closeness we had at times after the bad, missing having someone to talk to every hour? I know it won't work and the same issues will arise if I did attempt to reach out and had success, that's why I won't and will continue to work on myself but part of me deep down still believes had I seen her things might've been plain sailing.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7574660,public,self,Missing a toxic relationship and how to get over it?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxzald/missing_a_toxic_relationship_and_how_to_get_over/,all_ads,6,,

I saw a picture of her at the pre wedding even and she shows up golfing wearing a shirt that says Victoria secret on it. Ew. He never responds and they’re not friends like that and she knows it. She’s his sisters friend. And they know all about the problems I’ve had with his sister. She’s humiliated me publicly, spread lies and attacked me. She even pushed me in a corner drunk and felt me up because I have big boobs. I have been sexually assaulted more than once. They’re all extremely selfish and practice no self control. Now my boyfriend just lost a cousin this troll knew and she texted him at 7 in the morning on veterans day saying I heard you loss so and so if you need anything please reach out I love you guys with a heart. It pisses me off she even used a death as an excuse to contact him. I lost my dad brother grandma and just recently my uncle. What the hell do I say back to this troll?

At the party his girlfriend spent nearly all the time with me and my best friend while he was going around dancing and talking to other people.

While I was living at home last year, my  parents caught wind that I was dating someone new. Went on a camping trip with my brother and our friends and I brought my (then) new boyfriend on the trip too. While camping, everyone took mushrooms provided by my boyfriend (he grows them). A couple friend also bought microdoses from him. My brother (27) included, took them too. Now during this time my brother had been rekindling his relationship with my parents who he works with daily. My parents (60’s) asked him who went on the camping trip and he told them about my boyfriend (at the time this was new and we were in the early stages of dating). 
He also told them that everyone on the camping trip bought mushrooms from my boyfriend and took them- leaving out the fact that he took them too. My brother is unaware that I know this information and I found out through a mutual friend. 
Because of this, my parents refuse to meet my boyfriend. Before I moved out, they accused me of being with a drug dealer, put me on the spot by seeing if I would lie to them about taking mushrooms and asked if I was doing drugs and what I was doing with a drug dealer. It is now a year later and I feel like my boyfriend didn’t get a fair chance. Personally I don’t have a problem with mushrooms although my parents do so now their impression is just that he is a drug dealer. They have zero interest in meeting him and we have progressed to the point in our relationship where my boyfriend is asking to meet them. He is aware they have no interest and i believe if they got the opportunity to meet him they’d actually like him as a person. He wants me to offer to have them over at my place for dinner to which I already know they will say no. I feel like I’m in the middle of trying to still maintain a friendly relationship with my parents and then feeling bad when I spend time with them knowing they’ll never accept my boyfriend. It actually makes me want to not deal with them in general, the holidays are coming up and I feel bad leaving my boyfriend behind to spend time with my parents who don’t accept him without meeting him.

I 39m was with Jennifer for over 5 years before our breakup. We talked about starting a family and getting married eventually. We loved each other and we even promised that if one of us cheated we'd stay together anyway.


Well two years ago while on a business trip I got pretty lonely and met Aliya (19f). I met Aliya while attending one of my meetings as she was doing an unpaid internship.

Well things got hot and heavy between me and Aliya and we ended up having s*x.


Obviously I didn't love Aliya, I just found her attractive. She smiled at me and would flirt with me after meetings, bring me coffee, touch my shoulders.


After we had sex I decided not to tell Jen because I didn't trust she wouldn't freak out. 3 weeks after I slept with Aliya she told me she was pregnant. I told Aliya to lose my number and to never contact me again since I used a r*bber I didn't believe I could have gotten her pregnant. Plus all of the baby trapping posts I've read about golddiggers.


Well since the company Aliya was interning at is a sister company to mine, she was able to look up my address and get a court ordered dna test.


The results came back positive and I found out I have a daughter, chloe. Well Jen freaked out and broke my phone after she found out that I'd had s*x with another woman.


I tried to calm her down but she wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. I explained it wasn't my fault that I find younger women more attractive, which was a big mistake now looking back.


Jen scratched ""sc*mbag"" into the paint job on my new car and threw my belongings on the side of the road to get water damaged.


I gave Jen a few weeks to come to terms with the situation and told her I really need her support in this situation. She laughed at me and told me I destroyed our relationship, which I thought was unfair.


I tried to contact Jen multiple times but she refused to answer, meanwhile I was struggling to raise our daughter alone, I needed Jen to handle the sleepless nights as the lack of sleep was straining my job but Jen ignored me.


So I decided to go to Jen's house to talk about the situation. But a naked guy in a pair of MY shorts answered the door.


I instantly got p*ssed, while I was struggling and not getting any sleep, Jen was sleeping around like a common wh*re. I lied and told the guy he should get tested since Jen has g*nital h*rpes and left.


Later Jen blew up my phone and I asked if she was finally going to contribute child support since I've taken care of Chloe and paid for babysitters since she was born, but she just blew up on me, calling me a cheater and a loser and saying she'd get a restraining order if I ever showed up at her house again.


Now I'm considering telling Jen's parents about the situation because I can't continue without any sleep honestly. Why won't Jennifer step up and be a mother to Chloe?. Should I contact Jen's parents about this?.

She is 31 but youthful looking, beautiful &amp; athletic (abs). She loves exercise, playing the piano, watching football, writing and baking for family &amp; friends - her cakes look amazing actually. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her. In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously.

She went to two very good universities so she is intelligent. She is currently an elementary school tutor and hasn't really had much of a career as she's still figuring things out. At present she works 20 hours per work tutoring in school, 1 hour every two weeks doing radio reporting, 2 hours a week doing sports writing and 1 hour private tuition... so this is about 23 hours per week. Therefore she is working part time. She comes from a wealthy family but she's down to earth. However I feel as though she isn't as motivated to do well in life as she has her family's money to fall back on - she only has $27k saved up, doesn't own a car and relies on her parents a lot (still lives at home although it's a huge house).

I'm a bit worried as she's been complaining about things that are affecting her work and, as her current contract ends in about 8 weeks time, she is looking to take a break from work for a bit then. She suffers with anxiety which impacts her breathing. She tells me her breathing is the worst it has been - she often struggles to catch her breath and she has a constant trapped sensation in her throat. She claims that at work she feels she is constantly trying to breathe especially as her school is quite warm - it's worse in hotter temperatures and she has to plan her outfits around this (she can't wear polo necks as she feels more suffocated or thick jumpers etc).

She's meant to be running the London marathon next year and whilst she is motivated to do it, and I think she will, she isn't doing much training the last few weeks. Running usually helps to ease her anxiety but I've noticed she hasn't been watching her diet as much recently and has been out running a bit less.

(she is also a introvert)... but I feel i am always driving the hanging out, suggestions, texting and even showing affection. I thought it was supposed to be two sided and not one.

Also on the app our conversation completed disappeared which made me question things like did she unmatched me or delete her profile since she wanted to focus on us? (from above its hard to see that she wants to focus on us)

I plan on having another talk after the Holiday but i also don't want to rush her and want her to be ready on her own time.. (is this something to still pursue or does it seem like she just wants more to be friends?) do i keep looking or just be patient with this person and go slow?

Also, any recommendations on how to keep conversation and topics idea flowing? I sometimes feel we repeat a lot of our conversations and want to find other stuff to talk about but don't know how... kind of want some help on how to keep this relationship fun and active and not dry.

p.s. i can supply more info if needed... she also ""claims"" she is a horrible texter and in person is better but doesn't really ask questions about me so I feel I'm talking a lot about my self... I know she says she's a introvert but idk if that is a poor excuse....

I want to keep this as short and simple ; earlier this year I started talking to this guy and within a couple days of talking, the conversations started to become sexual and we would sext (weird thing is he knows what I look like (facial looks) but I don’t know what he looks like). During this, the cycle started where he would message me, disappear, message me, disappear, and it just continues. I tried messaging him during the time where he “disappears” but he would leave me on read so I just stopped putting in effort to reach out. Sometimes he reached out multiple times in a week, sometimes he reached out past one week and I never really thought much of it other than he was just horny but wanted no attachments and I was fine with that. This was until he deleted me a couple months back.

I was of course a bit hurt cause we obviously connected but I just thought he was no longer interested so I deleted him back. Then a month later out of the blue he messaged me. He messaged me asking why I deleted him (🙄) and that he missed me. He wanted me to add him back and I was hesitant at first but I thought to give him a second chance (and I missed him too). Then we started talking and he started to tell me that he and wanted to be with me and that he even loves me, that he’s “fallen” for me, etc. After all of this and a couple days of talking, the cycle started again. At this point it’s becoming very personal and it makes me feel some type of way.

This girl started hanging out at the bar with my main friend circle about a year ago we get along great when we're always flirting back and forth with each other and when we talk sometimes feels like we're the only ones in the room.  When I finally had the courage to ask her out it turned out she had a boyfriend, I was sad but decided to play it cool but keep a little distance. About a month ago when we're all hanging out late after the bar closes and she tells me that she just broke up with her bf (outside of turning me down she's never talked about him) I didn't wanna seem too egar and didn't wanna be a rebound so I decided to give her some time before asking her out again or anything.  Last Thursday  she texted me saying to come to the bar when I'm done at work because she needs to talk to me, it was a busy night and I was tired so I decided to go home.  The next day I ended up going to the bar and when I see her she tells me that this other girl we both know has been saying that we slept together asked if I knew anything about it.  I told I had no idea and this was the first I'm hearing of it, once I convinced her it wasn't she still asked if I had any idea why she'd say that.  I told her how the other girl hits on me pretty hard when she's sloppy drunk and is probably just jealous because I don't go for it.  She told me she was upset saying even if we did sleep together it's no one's business wich I totally agree with.  

My question is this where should I go from here??
She still flirts with me was even playing with my hair the night she told me about all this, I'm just really confused and don't know where to go from here I feel like maybe this other girl might have hurt my chances and that maybe I should just move on but idk.

It was like 3 pm and I was gone for an hour and a half and my phone was off.

I got home and she was upset, I could tell and asked why, she said nothing.

I let it go for a while but then pressed and she said ""I feel like you weren't being entirely honest with me about where you went just now""

I made the mistake of doubling down and said ""I just needed to get out of the house, I was going to the hardware store but my friend Jason called and I ended up talking to him""

I'm not a good lier, so it was awkward for a while, and she was like ""I still don't think you're telling the truth""

I said, ""fine I went to go get a massage, and I didn't want to tell you because we just got into an argument about money and you're taking leave at a 30% pay cut and I didn't want to be a hypocrite""

Her: ""I don't care that you got a massage why would you lie about that?""

Me: ""It sounds really stupid now that I say it out loud but I just didn't want to tell you, I'm sorry""

I was like ""I don't like what you're implying, at a certain point there's nothing more I can say""

This is both of our first relationships, and we have been working through issues for about 4 months now and nothing is getting better.

She is very codependent and bullies me or fights me every time I want to spend some time with family or Friends and a lot of our relationship is an emotional roller coaster because of her getting upset with me if I don’t drive half an hour to see her at 11pm when she is sad or if I go spend a day with my mom. I used to drive to her all the time and help her through her emotional episodes, but I noticed they only happen when I am trying to have some time away from her and I don’t feel that my wants or needs are respected even tho I’ve communicated them countless times. I just wanted 2-3 times a week of personal time without me caring for her everyday. I buy all her food and other items and she doesn’t have a debit card so I usually have to buy everything. 

Despite all of this, I feel sexually unfulfilled as I feel my needs are not met and she has no desire to do anything besides regular sex when I am into handjob/blowjobs etc. she always gets angry at me and insults me or never respects my desire to spend a day or two alone or with family when I have told her that is very important for me. I feel that our relationship dynamic is me giving and giving while being worried about messing up and setting her off. She doesn’t work, but this is because of her diabetes and if she reports income above a certain threshold, she is removed from the state insurance so she can’t work. I can’t blame her for this but on top of this she doesn’t see friends often either and usually just cries in her room when she does not see me. I even would quit days of work and take a smaller pay check to do something she wants me to do and recently she had to leave her weekly volunteer program for school 30 min early and told me that she is done sacrificing her time for me like that after I was late to our movie she left early to see, even tho I made it up by taking her to dinner and paying for her visit to the store next door.

Our relationship has been rocky because of my anxiety. But lately it’s been good (I think) and the last he told me is that he ultimately wants to be happy with me and work things out with me. 

I’m pretty sure he has been hooking up with people throughout our relationship. I’ll say I know this because I’ve gone through his phone and seen that he uses Snap, has paid people for sexual favors while I’ve been out of town, has screenshotted tinder profiles that offer hookups and sensual massages, has an active tinder profile with photos I’ve taken of him, has some recent tinder matches. One year ago we got in a conflict cuz I thought we were exclusive but found out he was dating two other people. He agreed it was wrong and ultimately “chose” me. But the hooking up (one night stands, things that can’t be easily traced) have apparently continued. 

He has previously “jokingly” (testing the waters) said we should open the relationship or have threesomes (FFM ofc), but I don’t think he’d go through the actual trouble of doing that above board (cuz it’s messier ofc and possibly cuz he gets off on the secrecy) and wouldn’t feel comfortable with me hooking up with other people (he’ll insecurely tease me sometimes that he hopes I don’t have a secret boyfriend.  This was prob because I downloaded tinder one time in retaliation and he saw the app on my phone, so I’m sure he’s insecure but idk how to say that I haven’t met up with anyone (the truth) and have him believe me).

Clearly there are some trust issues here but for the most part, despite the rockiness of the relationship, we are committed to each other, have a lease together, take care of and support each other in the day to day, I spend holidays with his family, and it’s a committed relationship that I know he can’t have with any of these other women without completely upending his life by ending things with me. Idk if I can open up the relationship or have a threesome with him because I am insecure which makes me sorta possessive of him as a partner, but clearly he is not satisfied with having just me and has found a way to meet his needs without me getting too much in the way. He has talked with me before about our sex life not being exactly what he wants, that I don’t initiate or top enough to his liking, but I think we have since improved our sex life through dialogue and care for each other and spicing things up. But he definitely has a higher sex drive than me. 

I did confront him once about the dating apps and Snap and sex workers he’s indulging in and he said “I don’t have anything to hide” and that that is his “private life.”  Obviously I was in the wrong too cuz I went through his phone to find this out. But I think he has a secrecy kink stemming from some sort of sexual shame. 

It seems like yes our trust is shaky and that no matter what he will never be satisfied with just me. He will find ways to get his needs me with or without my consent. I don’t think this happens often, because we spend a lot of our time together and because he is very busy with work and school, but seems like he will always indulge in this here and there whether or not I confront him about it. And that if I confront him about it he will be vague and maintain secrecy. I’ve sort of accepted that I can’t fully meet his sexual needs. I don’t know whether to accept it as part of our relationship and just keep doing me and what I think is right, or confront him knowing he won’t ever be honest with me. I know people here will tell me to break up but I really value our relationship aside from this and I know that I play an indispensable part in his life, and I will probably choose to accept this. As I mentioned, I’ve considered retaliating and getting on dating apps or hooking up with people myself, but I’m just not interested in doing all that. I want to stay in the relationship but also to accept that this is just who he is and what he needs to do to get his sexual needs met and that it’s not going to change. It’s not even necessarily personal. It doesn’t even interfere with the commitment he has to me—just makes me sad and insecure.

This post might be a long one, please bear with me.

I'm a young man, this is my first real relationship. We met almost a year ago, and become exclusive around the 2-3 month mark. It was amazing, until it all came to a screeching halt around 1 month after that. For around 1-2 months she was acting odd and I had a bad gut feeling about her.

We hung out one Sunday and I was going to be very busy with work for a few days and told her I wouldn't be able to hang out the next few days because of it. I was laying on my back on her bed, while she was sitting on top of me. She received a message on her phone which was right next to me, and flipped the phone to it's back. I didn't react to this or say anything. Ever since we first started hanging out, she was always angling her phone away from me no matter who she was texting or talking to so keep that in mind. At this point she still seemed very much into me and I didn't feel like anything was off about her.

However, the next few days after that I didn't hear anything from her until I reached out 4 days later, and we hung out. She wasn't acting weird but it felt like she wasn't as interested as before. It got better as we were hanging out and we hooked up. Next day we hung out again after work, but this time while we were having sex I stopped because she was too tired and clearly wasn't feeling it, and we went to sleep. Next morning, I initiated again and while I was starting up it she was looking around the room as if she wanted to get away and felt uncomfortable by my touch somehow. We ended up having sex anyway but it was just weird. Up until this point in our relationship she had not once declined sex. She was always into it and loved it. Next day after that she started some argument about something minor but I didn't feed into it and it quickly fizzled out. The next part is where it gets interesting.

Next day while we were out drinking with some friends, and she was fairly drunk. I posted a story on my Instgram. While I was chilling by myself, she leaned over on me and started touching my phone, which I didn't stop, and she started scrolling through the views and commenting on the amount of girls that were watching it. I may have overreacted, but I know that once a spouse starts looking through you phone, often times they're the guilty ones themselves. Therefore I took her outside to the balcony, and told her to unlock her phone. She immediately got defensive and kind of disrespectful, saying things like 'What do you think is on my phone?' 'LOL' and things like that. At this point we're outside and she was looking around for her phone, but then she said it was inside. I let it go and a few minutes later we spoke again and I said if you want we can do it your way, and we can start looking through each others phones. She denied it and said she doesn't want that. She said she doesn't care what I do on my phone and who I text, and I said I don't care what you do either and we left it at that, but I still wasn't content with the situation. When we came back home after things had settled down she denied sex again, fair enough.

There was another get together again the next day, and now I'm paying extra attention to how she is with her phone.  I was feeling pretty tense and she took notice and was asking me what was wrong but I told her nothing multiple times and she kind of backed off from me for a little while. At this point she was still kind of angling her phone away from me so I couldn't see who she's texting. She posted a nice picture of herself to her Instagram. At one point she was on my lap and opened an Instagram messsage from a family memeber, and I remember she was tightly holding her hand around the phone as well as her fingers, as if to stop me from doing something with it, even though I wasn't planning on doing anything. After we read the message together, she swiped back to her inbox but quickly exited to the main menu before I could see anything. I said nothing still.

That night we slept together and I went to work the next day. At this point I was considering to call her to meet up, sit down together and go through her phone together, but she ended up calling me first, and when I said that we need to meet up and talk about something, she thought I was going to break up with her so I ended up just saying it over the phone instead. She was calm and denied being up to anything, was not defensive or anything. That was that. However, the next night she was acting off and was spamming me with nudes which she knows, the reason it seemd off to me was because it was a lot of them, like she was overcompensating. We had a date planned for the next evening, and I got the same vibe on the date. She was all over me from the get go, very touchy feely etc. It seemed genuine enough though. She had now changed her phone lockscreen to a picture of us kissing. She also told me that her best friend which I'd only met twice had cheated on her boyfriend several times.

The next day, she went on a  one night trip to a city 2-3 hours away in our neighboring country to stay with some family members and also to get some special hair treatment. I know that she stayed with them, I saw the pictures and she also told her aunt about me there. I know this because a few weeks later all 3 of us spoke on the phone while I was with her and her aunt said Hi to me and said my name so I know that's true. However when she came back she seemed a little different somehow. She came back on a Sunday, and we agreed to go on a date on Tuesday. **Take note of this: She got her period on that Sunday.**

Monday morning she texts me, cancelling our date because of some work event. It was optional, but I suggested she come over Monday instead. When she came that Monday, something was off with her. She seemed a little bit nervous and wasn't making much eye contact for the first few minutes. We talked about the phone thing a bit later and we went through each others phones together, but obviously at that point any proof would've been deleted seeing as we talked about it just a few days before. We were walking to the store to buy some groceries and at some point the topic of cheating came up, and I said something like 'Cheating is probably the worst thing you can do to someone in a relationship' and I remember she started looking down on the ground and said 'Yeah...' in an unusually low tone of voice. After that while waiting for the bus she was standing close to me but wasn't really looking me in my eye and once again I got the feeling that something was wrong, like she was hiding something from me. 

Next morning I said that she should come to my house after the work event, and she hesitantly said 'Yeah I might' or something like that. We texted a little bit later that night, I requested a sexy picture while she was there to which she complied, then after that I didn't hear anything, nor did I reach out. We had agreed that I would go to her house a few days later. During those few days it was crickets except when she called me quickly the night before and asked me what I wanted to eat at her place the day before. The day of, we both had the whole day off. She texted me when I'm coming over, so I called her up and let her know I'd be there at 2 PM. She seemed to be in a good mood and all was fine. I arrived like 40 minutes earlier and when I called her she somehow seemed pissed that I called her on the phone instead of just using the doorbell. I remember when I entered she just seemed disconnected. The look of admiration and love that was usually there was gone from her eyes. This part here is what is stuck in my mind. I went to the bathroom, and when I got out, she was sitting on the edge of her bed with har back facing me, but I could tell she was on her phone. I was maybe 7 meters away at this point. As I got closer, she suddenly, very quickly and abruptly, locked her phone in a hurry and dropped it very quickly on her nightstand. I asked a bit loudly, 'Who are you texting?' and she jumped to her back on the bad, hesitated, then said 'My mom!'. She had a guilty look on her face, and she walked to the bathroom and called me jealous. Why would I be jealous of her mom?

The bedsheets she had on had some drops of blood on them from previous times we've had sex during her period, but I noticed that there was an extra drop of blood than the last time. I can't say 100% for sure that it was actually blood as it might have been a shade different, but it looked like it.

We hung out the next 4 days. On the 5th day, I texted her on the way to the gym because I had left my water bottle at her place. I needed it, so I called her 10 minutes later when she didn't respond. She didn't pick up the phone, but called me 15 minutes later, and she said she sounded like she was panicked, saying she was in the shower. We live very close to one another, and she lives within walking distance from the gym, like 10 minutes. She offered to walk from her house to the gym with the water bottle, which to me seemed a little odd but whatever. I was on my way to the gym at this point but I said I'll come and get it and said I'll meet you outside. When I got there I was feeling tense and suspicious but I said nothing. When I met her there was again something off with her. She had a weird vibe to her again and seemed nervous. At first I thought she might be responding to my energy seeing as I was tense, but usually if I'm off she always just asks me what's wrong instead of acting weird. She said she was gonna go to the store to buy dinner, and offered to cook for me as well while I was in the gym. I said OK and I went back an hour later. At first everything seemed normal, except while we were eating out of nowhere she got annoyed with me for something random. I thought she was just hungry or something but she wasn't like this before we ate, just while eating. Like she was just pissed off for no apparent reason. After we ate, everything settled down and it was as normal. 

During this time period of one month, she kissed me diffently. It was more like pecking instead of deep kisses like before. We still had sex every time we hung out. At one point during a great date, we were sitting in my car, and she was leaning on me, facing me. I randomly asked her while looking in her eye if she cheated on me. She immediately broke eye contact, said 'No'. In a falling tone of voice. I asked her again, this time she held eyecontact but sat back in her seat and said in a question like way, 'No?' then she asked me if I cheated on her. I noticed during these days that she had changed her notification settings on only Instagram so where you can't see who sent you a message or the content unless you unlock the phone. It wasn't like that before.

A few days later we had a tiny argument in the morning before I left her place for work, and she was a litle disrespectful. She texted me afterwards apologizing for it, I said it was no big deal and that it's fine. Then later that evening while I was in the gym, she randomly called me at 10 PM and apologized for the same thing again. She didn't invite me over or anything, nor did I ask. She said she was going to bed. I told her to text me later tonight. She texted me 1,5 hours later and I called her on facetime. Again whil talking, I randomly asked her again, and I got the same cues as last time. She broke eye contact again, and said 'No' in the same way. I asked again 15-20 seconds later, exactly the same cues this time.

In my mind I tried desperately to justify her, but I knew deep down somewhere that something was up. It's now months later. Any time the topic of cheating comes up or if I talk about cheating, she will immediately break eye contact and seem a little bit uncomfortable. Just a few days ago I said 'I'm so glad I have a loyal girl like you' and she said 'Yeah..' in a low voice again.

This post ended up a lot longer than I thought it would but here we are. I love this girl and I wanted to marry her but the more I think about it the worse it looks. I have had the passcode to her phone for the last 5 months but I've never found anything. While she was acting the most suspicious in the examples I mentioned above I didn't have access.

A friend of mine thinks it all looks pretty bad too but there is no evidence besides her body language and maybe the blood drops. Even that I asked her at one point if she ever leaks out of her panties while on her period which she denied ever happening so it can't have been that.

I spoke with my daughter the next evening after she came home from work, her boyfriend was at the house at the time (he was over for dinner and had picked her up). I pulled her aside for a couple of minutes and let her know what happened. She was surprised, because she's already had this talk with her boyfriend. 

She said she'd handle it and left. A little while later, I called them in for dinner. After she finished eating, she confronted him. I'm paraphrasing because she told a story, but this is basically what she said:

""So my dad told me what you said, and I wanted to wait until after dinner to bring it up. I didn't have a good childhood. My biological father treated my mom horribly, and after she left him he never contacted me again. Her next big relationship was worse. It seemed fine on the outside, but there was a lot of emotional abuse and controlling behavior, I was caught up in it too.

Then this guy came along. I was obviously skeptical at first, he looked like trouble to me. He was making my mom happy, but I was an icy bitch to him because bad men were all I'd ever known. He asked me questions for over a year trying to get to know me and I shut him out.

One day when I was reading, he asked what book it was. I didn't even answer him, I just lifted it up so he could see the cover. It was Island of Shipwrecks in the Unwanteds series. He said ""that looks pretty cool, what's it about?"" and for the millionth time I didn't answer.

Maybe two weeks later, he asked me if I was finished with the book. I said ""Yeah, why?"" And he said ""Well I read the other 5, I thought you might let me borrow it so I can catch up and we can talk about it."" I thought he was lying through his teeth, so I asked him questions about plot points and characters. Not a single wrong answer. I went to my room and got the book for him.

It's kind of a dumb story, but you have to understand something: my dad is the first man who was ever nice to me and I gave him plenty of reasons not to be. He was patient and thoughtful and never pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I will always be grateful for that.

Bottom line is that I love my dad, and the only people who have a say in our relationship is us. If you feel threatened because we're close, that's not going away. Ever. I like you. I have fun with you. But if you think I'll change my relationship with my dad for you, then you've made a mistake. If you're too insecure to handle the fact that I'm close to MY DAD, this isn't going to work out.

If you can handle it, I would love to have you around. Otherwise...""

He kind of interrupted her here and said ""It's not just  because you're close, I get that he's been good to you and your mom and that's great, but have you seen the guy?"" [Referencing this comment for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvsrxd/my_34m_stepdaughter_19f_are_very_close_her/iwijdhs/) 

""Yes? What about it?""

""It just makes it really weird for me, I don't know how to explain it other than that. You're way closer to your dad than anyone I've ever met and it's a little creepy when you take into account he looks like he could be a 'what are you doing stepdaughter' guy.""

""Look there's apparently 2 people at this table (for context, it was the two of them, my wife, and myself at the table) who think my dad is fuckable and it's really weird that you're one of them. Choosing time is over, the door is that way. Do not call or text me anymore.""

So that's pretty much how it went down. After he left,  she cried for a few hours in her room. When she finally came out it was around midnight or so, and she sat next to me on the couch. I asked her if she was worried this would be a constant problem, and if she wasn't comfortable with how things are I can understand and respect that. 

She hugged me very tightly and just replied ""don't be dumb."" So I guess everything is alright. 

I also thought it was kind of funny (disrespectful, but funny) that she had this big story planned out (I got some RomCom vibes from it personally, but it was her first boyfriend so she has no experience having big talks) and the guy just completely disregarded it.

**Recap:**

In short, our relationship had issues because I was looking for a long-term commitment, and she was unsure of what she wanted even after 3+ months of dating. We were very close, and spent a ton of time together. We were basically a couple, and things started falling apart towards the end, like with the commitment and exclusivity things. There were other things too, like the fact that she talked to her ex a lot, was getting over a past fling, and had texted a guy in a way that seemed a little strange.

The thread got a huge response here, with most (like 99%) of people saying to end the relationship. Most of the people I talked to in real life said either the same, or to give her an ultimatum. In the end, that's what I did.

**What Happened After:**

She came by my place maybe a week after I made that post, and we made small talk for a bit (How've you been? How was your trip? etc.) When she asked me how I was, I just said ""good"" and laid it all out there for her. I wasn't really trying to give her any more of myself if it was just going to end anyway.

I told her that I understand she's still getting over the fling she had, but after 3 months, I needed exclusivity at the very least, and that, in the future, I'm looking for some sort of long-term commitment. If that's not what she's looking for, that's fine, but that's what I need in order to make this work. Additionally, I said that I was okay with her talking to her ex, but some things cross the line, specifically going on a road trip with him. 

As I said this, I saw the emotion drain from her face. What used to be more-or-less smiling turned into a blank, expressionless stare.

After I said what I had to say, she basically said that she wasn't looking for anything long-term with me. Which is a little weird, because for months she had been saying that she didn't know what she wanted. I think she was just saying that as an excuse to break up. In fact, I think me ""laying down my demands"" was what really destroyed things for her. In hindsight, I feel like I stood my ground, but maybe I was too harsh, asking for too much.

Afterwards, I basically I asked her if we were good, she said yes, and I walked her out. Gave her a hug and said ""See ya"". I just wanted her gone as soon as possible because I knew it was over.

**What's Happened Since:**

It's been about two months now, and I'm miserable. Things are going well in my life, but I'm plagued by a deep loneliness in my day-to-day life. I can't sleep. I try to move on, but the thoughts and memories of our relationship haunt me when I lay down at night. I've been on a few dates with others since the break-up, but there's never really a connection, and the energy it takes to pursue women seems like too much for me to take. In all honestly, I think I compare them to my ex. 

For a while, I told myself that this is normal in a breakup. Things are shitty for a while until you start to move on. It doesn't help that this was the first ""real"" relationship I had been in. It also doesn't help that I decided to wane off my antidepressants the same week I broke up with her. I'm not sure why I did that, to be honest. Maybe I just wanted to actually feel the emotions associated with a break-up.

**The Dilemma:**

That brings me to today. It seems like every day I consider messaging her and seeing if we can get back together. I don't want to jump head-first into it, but potentially trying dating again with less commitment and just seeing where things go. Maybe the time we've spent apart will make us more thankful for each other's presence. Maybe this period of time will have allowed her to move on from her ex-fling. 

I don't know what the right move is. It seems like most would say it's a bad idea trying to get back together with an ex, but the alternative is killing me.

Let's call her S. I was a senior at the time while she was a freshman. Fast forward to this past spring and I begin to develop feelings for her. With graduation only a couple months out, I decided that if I wanted to ask her out I should do it before it was too late. Towards the end of us hanging out one day when we were about to say our goodbyes, I decided to ask her if she would like to go on a date, and she initially said yes. She later send a longwinded text saying she was honored I asked her, she didn't know if it was a good idea for her to date at the time since she hadn't been in a good place mentally, and she also didn't know what she'd do with me leaving as she was already struggling with that. I told her I understood and was completely fine remaining friends and we were good with that.

A couple weeks later, S told me that she had decided that she wanted to give it a try, to my excitement. The next month or so was so blissful. We went on several dates, shared our first kiss, and it seemed to be going well. I was falling in love with her more and more every day. However, towards the very end of the semester around graduation, we planned to have a talk about our relationship. She told me that she didn't think that it was going to work out because of the distance (I was moving 3.5 hours away from where she was), the fact that I was entering a new stage of my life, and that she still needed to figure some things out about herself. I was distraught and thought that we would be able to work through those things but respected what she said and we decided to stop dating and just remain friends. I knew that this was a possibility that I had to prepare myself for but it still stung for the next few months.

We had loose contact during the summer but nothing too frequent, mostly because I was trying to give her space and allow myself to move on. I started a job at an engineering firm and have been loving it, and it gave me something else to focus on. Once the semester started back up, I started visiting my friends back at college over the weekend once or twice a month, including S. I stay with someone else that I had became good friends with over the course of several years who himself is graduating this upcoming spring. He is also good friends with her as well, so we all do a lot of things together.

After I started coming back to visit, her and I have had more frequent contact, whether that's scheduling calls with each other, playing games online, or just keeping our Snapchat streak up. I've appreciated being able to spend time with her like this. However, over the past month or so, I've started to realize more and more that I still have strong feelings for her, and I'm not sure what to do about them. I don't want to ruin our friendship by stopping being friends so I can get over her, but it's hard to not want to ask her if she wants to try again.

I've asked two close friends who also know her on their opinions on what I should do. The first one is the guy that I previously mentioned (I'm going to refer to him as C). He said that I should have a talk with her and let her know how I feel and see how she reacts to that. The second friend, whom I am going to refer to as H, is the same age as me and have been close friends since our sophomore year. She made the point that she knows how much herself has changed since she was a sophomore and how different she is today. She said that I shouldn't say never, but that I should seriously consider just moving on from S, since she said that S was most likely going to change a good bit over the next couple years and didn't think that getting back into a relationship with her was a good idea.

I've been torn on what to do, so I thought I would post this here and see if anyone had any useful advice or suggestions, or if they had been in a similar situation how it turned out. I do really want to be with her, but if it's not meant to be then I know I have to accept that.

We’ve started arguing more frequently, mostly with me doing things differently like cleaning at 1am or not doing things he wants to do at a certain time. I’d have long depressive episodes where i would be bed ridden and he complains, i try to explain why and i also explain that i’m in the middle of receiving help with anxiety and depression. As of yet i can’t hold down a job because of Social anxiety, getting panic attacks very often which is also one of the reasons for the arguments. 

Today was bad though, after i repeatedly kept on telling him to go away and i need space he never listens making my episodes of anger much worse. I’m not diagnosed with bipolar but i would describe this episode as a similar intensity of a meltdown of bipolar. I needed space because i don’t know what i would do and he wouldn’t give me space he just keeps asking questions, blaming me and tried to get into a room which i barricaded to give myself space. 

I am not a stable person, i overreact even though i don’t mean to. I’m thinking about ending the relationship because it’s not right for both of us.

It also doesn’t help that he doesn’t fully speak English so it makes conversation a little harder between us.

So far all green flags. I have told my friends that I think this guy is the one.   


All that changed after snapchat pulled up memories from ""5 years ago"" and it was a picture of me cuddling next to a guy whom I was hooking up with at the time. No nudity, he saw it for a second but that was about it. I was embarassed he didn't say anything else about it.   


Later that day he then starts asking me about the people I have dated in the past saying he is just curious and that understanding my past helps me better understand the woman I am today. I have already given him bits and pieces but basically, after college I didn't really get into long term relationships. I had these weird situation-ships / flings. There were periods where I just wanted guys to hook up with but then there were times I would try to get into relationships but I would often go for guys who guys weren't long term relationship material, and guys who weren't into me but just wanted attention and sex. It wasn't until when I hit 29 that I was like okay I need to really date with a purpose.  


I gave him a brief description then he is like do you mind showing me some photos of what your situation-ships were like? I said that it was weird and I don't feel comfortable, he then says that it feels like I am hiding stuff and that when the snapchat notification came up I acted too nervous like I had something to hide. And he ends up convincing me I show him just some Instagrams of the last couple guys, I had not liked their recent pics and I wasn't following some of them.   


He then asks me if I have dated any Indian guys (we are both Indian). I am like yes, I have. And then he is like not just going on dates were any of my fwb were ever Indian. And I was like that is such a weird question but no. Then he is like oh okay. And then just drops the conversations.   


A day ago he then tells me that he is worried about bringing people over to his family for thanksgiving cause his parents are old. We finally have this talk and he says that he has second thoughts about our relationship, and he thinks that White guys are my actual type and that I am only with him because I wasn't able to actually date the type of guy I really wanted long term not just hook up and that he is the fallback plan. I told him a 1000x times that he is my first choice but he starts saying that our relationship isn't very sexual and that he feels like its because he is not White and I have all these boundaries with him. I am like you never had a problem with our sexlife until we had this conversation.  


Now I don't know what to do, my boyfriend seems like he is torpedoing this relationship and I can't put together why. Like we were so good so happy, his friends, his family all have liked me so far. What can I do to snap him out of his insecurity?

As the title says. Husband (30s) and I (30s) have been together 10+ yrs, married for 5. We goofily compete over small things, all in good fun. One of our competitions is over who gives the better present. Winner is the better gift giver, and element of surprise and showmanship is a part of the consideration. We’re always trying to find something the other person wouldn’t immediately guess, and there’s a lot of friendly teasing involved. 

This year my birthday present was a little late due to shipping issues. I was teasing him that I must not have a present, it doesn’t exist, he must be pretending to have gotten me something, I’ll win the competition etc. He’d just roll his eyes and say, very confidently, that he’d gotten me a great present. He’s not full of hot air; he’s a WAY better gift giver than I and can remember things I like better than I can sometimes. In contrast, I’m not always the best gift giver. I admit to phoning it in a few times over the years, but for us, “phoning it in” means directly asking him what he wants and then buying that, as opposed to going with a  grand surprise. 

We share a hobby, but our interest in it comes from two different angles. I’d describe it as—if we both liked cars, he likes classic cars and I like sports cars. Technically different, with plenty of overlap.

Tonight my husband showed me my present, with a lot of fanfare. And…it was on the “classic car” side. Like, very classic car. In fact, it was something that he had specifically mentioned wanting for himself for a while. In the past, I’d always responded to mention of this item with mild interest but not much more than that.

When he showed me the gift, I thought he was pulling my leg. Or that he was going to pull a switcheroo. When he asked if I loved it, I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want to be dishonest to him, but I also don’t want to hurt his feelings. I could tell that this was genuinely something he thought I’d love, but…it’s something he’s loved, not me. 

Since I’m terrible at responding in these types of situations, and I know he expected a full-blown ‘wow I LOVE it’ type reaction, I told him honestly and as gently as possible: “Babe, this is something you’ve always wanted. Not me.” I also told him I am happy all the same, I want him to be happy, and I’m grateful that he thought of me and got me a gift, and I’m sorry that I couldn’t give him the reaction he wanted. He was clearly disappointed and trying not to let it show. A little later he joked that he had to let me win the competition every once in a while, and I joked back. He laughed, and it seems like we went back to normal but I think he’s still a little bummed. 

I feel terrible. For both of us, the excitement from the other person getting their present is better than the present received, and surely it’d have been worse to lie and pretend I loved it. I’m sure I also effed up the whole conversation after getting the present, too. 

How can I make amends and show that I appreciate him? Everything I can think of gives vibes like I’m “forgiving him” for getting me a “bad present,” which is not the way I want him to feel. He genuinely thought this was something I’d be ecstatic for, and I love that he goes so above and beyond for me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7574399,public,self,I reacted wrong to my husband’s bday present to me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxy9ox/i_reacted_wrong_to_my_husbands_bday_present_to_me/,all_ads,6,,

She is 31 but youthful looking, beautiful &amp; athletic (abs). She loves exercise, playing the piano, watching football, writing and baking for family &amp; friends - her cakes look amazing actually. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her. In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously.

She went to two very good universities so she is intelligent. She is currently an elementary school tutor and hasn't really had much of a career as she's still figuring things out. At present she works 20 hours per work tutoring in school, 1 hour every two weeks doing radio reporting, 2 hours a week doing sports writing and 1 hour private tuition... so this is about 23 hours per week. Therefore she is working part time. She comes from a wealthy family but she's down to earth. However I feel as though she isn't as motivated to do well in life as she has her family's money to fall back on - she only has $27k saved up, doesn't own a car and relies on her parents a lot (still lives at home although it's a huge house).

I'm a bit worried as she's been complaining about things that are affecting her work and, as her current contract ends in about 8 weeks time, she is looking to take a break from work for a bit then. She suffers with anxiety which impacts her breathing. She tells me her breathing is the worst it has been - she often struggles to catch her breath and she has a constant trapped sensation in her throat. She claims that at work she feels she is constantly trying to breathe especially as her school is quite warm - it's worse in hotter temperatures and she has to plan her outfits around this (she can't wear polo necks as she feels more suffocated or thick jumpers etc).

She's meant to be running the London marathon next year and whilst she is motivated to do it, and I think she will, she isn't doing much training the last few weeks. Running usually helps to ease her anxiety but I've noticed she hasn't been watching her diet as much recently and has been out running a bit less.

I (26m) have been dating (23f) for about 3 years. Shes great, cooks for me, cleans the house, takes care of me, very affection hungry. I work 55 hours a week in car sales. But she has no friends. She works from home, does college classes from home, and only talks to people when we go out with my friends. She has alot of mom issues, which makes her have problems making female friends. She over thinks things and goes to the worst possible senario, I think its a fear of people leaving because her mom left. She is very introverted and is very reliant on me to expose her to social interactions. We have alot of trust and she is very attached, but its more of a strong clingy attachment. We started dating when I got out of the military (5yrs in) and I havent been with more than 5-6 chicks. I just cannot stop this urge that I want to give her up, because I feel like I havent experienced all of the options out there, and I feel like it would open me up socially even more.

On the surface, everything seems great.  We have a wonderful 4 year old son and a beautiful house in a great location.  We both have good jobs and, in general, we don’t argue/fight very often.  Despite all of this, I’m not very happy with our marriage for several reasons:

1. My wife rarely takes initiative around the house.  I do almost all the cooking and cleaning along with any kind of maintenance work the house requires.  My wife basically comes home, plays on her phone, spends time with our son and sleeps.  Her job requires longer hours than mine so for a long time, I was happy to handle most of the home stuff so she could spend more time with our son.  Lately, however, I’ve been feeling unappreciated.
2. Our sex life is pretty bland and infrequent and the intimacy between us has dwindled significantly.  It’s not that i have a super high sex drive but my wife seems to have a super low one.  As it is, we have sex once every 4-6 weeks.  No amount of daily back rubs, foreplay or any other magic I can conjure up has had a lasting impact on this.  I don’t badger her about it and basically let her decide when it happens.  I tried in the past to initiate but found it would frustrate me and make me resentful when I would regularly get turned down.  I’ve had open conversations with her about feeling unsatisfied and sometimes it improves for a short span but it always inevitably reverts back to before. 
3. She generally displays a lack of consideration for my feelings.  This isn’t really a new development but it’s always bothered me.  Small things like letting me know when she’ll be home from work so dinner isn’t sitting cold for 30 minutes rarely happen.  She’ll go out with friends for the night and not tell me she’s crashing at a friend’s house instead of coming home. To be clear, I’m not worried about my wife cheating.  I just like to know when I can expect her home.

In summary, it just feels like I give a lot in the relationship and that it’s not really reciprocated.  My wife honestly seems to prioritize her own happiness and satisfaction over others and isn’t the type to sacrifice anything for others.  My son seems to be the only exception to this.  

I realize that all of this might make it sound very simple that I should go my own way but it’s not that easy for me.

1. I do love my wife.  I really enjoy hanging out with her.  She has a fantastic sense of humor.  She’s intelligent and clever.  She’s a wonderful mother.  I think I had hoped she would grow more as a person and become more selfless as she got older.  Unfortunately, it seems like it’s very much ingrained in her personality.  
2. My son.  He’s my everything.  I couldn’t imagine only being able to see him half the time.  Maybe that will change when he’s an annoying teenager but right now, I value my time with him more than anything in the world.  It would break my heart to become a part-time parent.
3. Our life.  The house.  The pets.  The lifestyle we can provide for our son and ourselves as a unit.  I’m terrified to walk away from all we’ve built together.

I feel like I’m kind of stuck.  I either stick it out and find a way to cope with the inequity in our relationship in order to maintain the status quo.  Or we split and I risk being more unhappy than I am right now.  I think that’s what makes it so difficult for me.  I’m not even unhappy right now on the whole.  I want more from my marriage but I’m very happy with our son and our life.  I worry the alternative might be worse.  Any suggestions?  Thoughts?  Experiences?

I don't live on their income; I have a full-time job, and live paycheque to paycheque. I don't really have designated bills, I just pay up when they need it. My father doesn't want me spending too much on expenses so I can save money for graduate school. However, something always comes up.

Phil is hard of seeing (particularly small screens, like phones), and hard of hearing; so he struggles with doing a lot of bookkeeping. As such, Jill does most of the bookkeeping, including finances. She has gone through Phil's phone before, asked me for money for a bill that my father said didn't exist or was paid, and even text me with my father's phone asking for money pretending to be him. Before they even got married, Jill cheated on Phil, and gambled their money away.

Jill also has a large, high-maintainence dog that she expects Phil (who doesn't genuinely want the dog) and I to help look after. No one walks him. She doesn't keep an eye on what he gets into in the backyard, so the dog currently has an ear infection and diarrhea (the latter being very common with him). When we try to hold Jill accountable for anything, she shifts blame, talks down to you, raises her voice, cries victim, etcetera.

Phil seems to be too invested in his relationship with Jill to do what's best for the 3 of us (giving into a narcissist is not good for the narcissist's well-being). On top of that, I rarely get a chance to speak with my father alone. I'm afraid if I text my father about this, or share some articles on narcissists with him, she will find it on his phone (he is technologically illiterate, so doesn't know how to hide or delete things). I am autistic, which Jill knows, so she exploits my sensitivity to loud, sudden, high pitch sounds (like yelling). What do I do from here? She does whatever she can to keep control of us.

I made friends with many of the people I worked with (both younger, the same age and older than me) and there's a group of us that hang out. I connected with 18f after about a year of working together. Although we are friends and equals, I think of her as a younger sister in a lot of ways. She was raised by a single mother and her father was a drug addict. Her mother has had problems with money over the years so they've moved a lot, and moved to my town due to 18f being s\*\*\*\*\*\*\* assaulted. 18f is very vulnerable and comes to me often for advice on things. Her family was made homeless a month or so ago so she now lives with her boyfriend. I've been there for her, offering comfort and help as I've done throughout our friendship.

18f is quite a difficult person and doesn't have many friends - in fact, I'm pretty much her only genuine friend. She seems to fall out with people a lot, and she pushes away the people in the friendship group. She doesn't like coming out with me when I meet my other friends and says she feels uncomfortable, but when certain people are there she completely blanks me and excludes me. It doesn't upset me really as I'm very confident in social situations, but I find it very odd. If its just the two of us I feel like I see her genuine personality and we get on very well. She's very funny, kind and sensitive, although she puts on a front sometimes. She's also very mature for her age in some ways. However, she can also be selfish, mean and cold. She can be very abrasive and doesn't always care about hurting the feelings of others. She will sometimes go completely cold on me and not speak to me for a day or two for absolutely no reason that I can decipher.

I see a lot of redeeming features in her. She is very vulnerable and I feel like she needs guidance and companionship. I find it difficult to tell if the friendship is genuine from her side, and whether there is any point investing my time in the relationship. I'm not the hot and cold type - if you're my friend, you're my friend. Although I have a lot of love for her, I have friends my own age that don't play games like this.
