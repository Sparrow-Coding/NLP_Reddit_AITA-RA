His ex was my in game friend i didn't knew he had a gf. Then we started playing together. After 1 month i stopped playing with them. I thought they doesn't play anymore. But then i came to know that mf guy broke up with her. Then me and the girl started talking on Instagram after 7 days she gave me her phone number. Then we started chatting on WhatsApp. Then we created a really good bond with each other talking everyday playing games with her etc. Then i started to develop love for her it was increasing day by day i thought i should not say it but i told her that i love her iam a really shy kind of a person in front of girls this was the first girl i truly loved. Then she told me she loved her ex sooo much she isn't in the state of loving someone again rn. She got betrayed by 2 guys both left her and leave her alone in sadness. The 2nd guy she had in her life she truly loved him. But that mf left her. Then she told me she now want to focus on her career and her family. She told me that she is afraid that the damage feels permanent. I want to do so much for her anything for her. I say love u to her almost every day she always replies with a smile. She told me feels good to be loved by me she feels comfortable around me she want me to stay with her forever but she isn't in the state of loving me rn. Although we developed sexual attraction towards each other. She loves what i do i love what she do. Then we started to share pics she started first she thought i didn't had any interest first but then we started talking and now we r here. Although she said she never thought she would develop these types of feelings for someone again. She is so much emotionally attached with me. She said she can live without sexual things (and i know she isn't a lustful girl she values emotions first) she wants to be emotionally attached with the person first. She has a lot of family problems she is sacrificing herself for the family. We talk almost 3 hours on video call every day watch movies online together play games etc. And she loves mature guys which iam actually opposite tho. And another thing i love herr sooooo muchhh. Iam so confused guys sometimes i feel like she loves me but doesn't wanna say it rn and sometimes i feel like it's she doesn't love me.

 Now what i want to know is 1. She loves me or not or she is hiding?. 2 if we are sexually attracted towards each other then why she doesn't loves me because a person develops these feelings for whom he / she loves right. 3 what could i do to develop those feelings in her is there anyway or just give her time?

I regret doing this, but I went through his phone (I have never done this to him before) and found out he's been telling a close female friend of his that he doesn't understand why I keep coming around. He also continues to say he broke up with me a while back, and said I was a master manipulator. They also made fun of a serious medical I have that gets worse with extreme stress and anxiety.

I just want to preface by saying that I have a lot of trauma surrounding sex and especially my nether region. My bf and I have been together about 4 months.. we were trying to have sexy time and he accidentally missed and stuck it so far into the wrong hole. (Which in and of itself I know it’s not his fault). I was literally bleeding and could hardly even sit. But what he did the next day just kind of set me over the edge. He woke up the morning after and asked for sex &amp; when I told him I wasn’t comfortable with it (as I was still in agonizing pain) he begged and begged and begged. All.Day. I told him how much pain I was in and he just said “we can take it slow” as if that stops the pain. I just feel like a sex toy at this point as he always throws “blue balls” or the fact that we haven’t had sex in a couple days in my face. I do love him but this is not the first time something like this has happened and I’m just at a loss for what to do. It’s sending me further into my depression that I worked so hard to get out. If I brought up breaking up or had the same damn conversation I always have with him, he’d just guilt me into forgetting about it. I’m so mentally and physically drained, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My wife and I have been having some issues in our relationship recently. We have been married for almost 2 years on January first. Now we got married pretty young her(19) and me (22) and now she is 21 and I’m 24. Honestly I’m surprised we have made it this far but that’s not the point. I seriously love this woman and would do anything for her but I’m not sure what to do with this situation. 

So it all started about a month before we were supposed to get married and she was freaking out not sure if we should go through with it. Especially with her being so young and all. We came to the decision that we would move forward since we both love each other. So fast forward about four months later and she’s going through the same thing again. She’s really uncertain if this was a good decision and she is worried she’s going to be missing out on a lot of things that others her age will be doing like going to college and dating as well as really establishing who she is as a person. Which is really understandable. But again after talking and arguing and all that we continue. 

So again about 6-7 months later this all happens again and again 6-7 months later. We ended up moving away from where her family lives and across the country and it’s pretty stressful and overwhelming which causes this to come up again. And she wants to try being separated (we have to bedrooms so I would stay in one and she would stay in the other) while still being married. At this point though I am kind of living in this constant state of not knowing if and when she is going to bring up getting divorced and splitting up, bring up just getting divorced because I’m tired of not really feeling enough (I know this is kind of immature but I was scared). And we talk and stuff and decide to separate and stay in different rooms. 

Over the course of the next week we kind of  to get divorced(rash I know but wait) without doing couples therapy. After talking more over the next week we decide to maybe try an open marriage but we talked about not really dating anyone for a little while till we get used to this. Then this guy she knew growing up reached out randomly to her. (They hooked up a few times before we met) and talked about how it would be fine if she met up with him when we went back home for Christmas. I had also reached out to a girl I had hooked up with before but we are just friends now. Talking about this whole situation. Well she ended up getting a dating app a few days ago and started talking to a few guys. Which was fine with me. But she would continue to do so when we would cuddle on the rare occasion which really bothered me. And yesterday she went out with a friend for a girls day and ended up meeting up with this guy without telling me and hooked up with him twice last night. Came home and didn’t say anything and cuddled with me in my room. And continued to talk with him while in my arms. At this point I’m pretty uncomfortable and turn over. I explain that I would prefer that when we are cuddling she be in the moment with me. She misunderstands and gets upset and goes to her room. 

So today she gets home from work and I’m asleep on my room. And she doesn’t say anything just leaves. I assume she went to go see him so I ask where she went and she just responds with “out”. I just say okay and say have fun and be safe. I did not know she had hooked up with him yet. (Again we only decided on an open marriage a few days ago) so I was not expecting it. I ended up hurting myself while home alone. ( passed out and hit my head, not on purpose obviously) so I text her and let her know. She’s worried and asks if I want her to come home. I tell her no because I don’t want to ruin her night. She ends up coming home around 9:40 ish on her way home I text her saying that for the future I want to make sure we are practicing safe sex if we are hooking up with others now that we are open kinda. And that I would prefer to know if she is hooking up with people. She responds and says she hooked up with this guy twice the night before and once tonight. And I honestly feel really betrayed. 

I know we are technically in an open marriage but I wasn’t expecting this. 
I feel so hurt, a lot because she was being really secretive and lying when I would ask what she’s up to. 

Not sure what to do. I’m trying to decide if I want to go ahead and get divorced or try and figure this out.

I have been talking to this girl for about six months now. She has been great (sometimes) but I would be lying if I said that she was giving me everything I need. We both work at a pizza shop and are in college and some of her closest friends work there and have worked there for a while as delivery drivers and servers, and it was my first job (not at the location that I am at now, but I moved to this location when I went to college and worked my way up to manager AFTER we started talking, so there's NOT a weird power dynamic thing at play). My friends and her friends are now one, and her and her friends are some of the most important people in the world to me, and I can confidently say that she would say the same about me and my friends. I don't know if I am just needy, or what, but I need more from her.

Like I said, I see her almost everyday either at work or hanging out with her friends. So rarely is that just the two of us and that really hurts sometimes. I know that we are both busy with class and work and get so much exposure to each other but quality time is my love language, and many times when I am hanging out with her and her friends (who she has had since age 10 or so) I feel like I am third wheeling (needless to say, not exactly quality time) since I have known her and them for only a year now. Not that she just neglects me when we are all together, but you know, I still have friends that I have had for that long so I can understand that that's extremely tough competition for attention, so I try my best to be understanding. We hang out just the two of us I would say twice every 3 weeks. We are exclusive and have had that conversation extensively so I feel pretty secure, despite being cheated on with my last relationship. The reason why we aren't literally dating is because she says that she does not like who she is right now and does not want to hurt me. My argument is that we are pretty much dating already, and I love her for who she is currently not for some idealized version of her where she has everything figured out. We say I love you, have sex, flirt, go on cute dates, she will even call me her boyfriend at times. She also struggles with anxiety and mental health issues. I try to be there for her the best I can but her way of dealing with her mental health is closing herself off.

This really hurts me because I am needy and need a lot of affirmation, I know that she does not mean to hurt me by this, but is just trying to do what is best for her, which I try my best to respect. Unfortunately, this does not change the fact that when this happens I do get hurt. We have both recognized this and agreed to try a break, however that did not last long. After the conversation that we went on a break she soon after started flirting with me when I was trying to be plutonic, then, ended up having a conversation that a break isn't what either of us wanted, and that she would try to be more responsive to my needs (quality time) than she was, and since then, she has been getting better, however, I still need a little more. I love her a lot, and I love every second I get with her. I am starting to feel a bit trapped though because our lives are already so interconnected. We already tried stopping our ""relationship"" and I did not have the self control to push down my feelings for her, and neither did she. I just don't know what to do.

Every single potential reason for holding off on marriage, I've either tried to do something to quell his concern and help him figure out a solution, or is something entirely out of my control. He said that he felt behind in his career, so I helped him fix his resume and sent him at least 5 job listings a week. He said that he's worried about the cost of a wedding, so I opened up an investment account for us to slowly contribute to and build up a savings. He said that he was worried that our families would never get along or that we'd never see eye to eye about what kind of wedding that we'd want. But our families still haven't formally met and he's never actually given us a fair chance to talk about a wedding to decide on what we'd want. All of that to say that we've exhausted almost every scenario in the book by this point. 

We've gone through almost two years of couples therapy and have learned to communicate a bit better but are still in the same place on the prospect of marriage (in that he's just still not ready and doesn't know when he will be). My parents and even our couples' therapist have suggested that maybe it's just time to call it quits. But he INSISTS that he's loves me and can imagine marrying me, just not right now. And that he needs to figure himself out and do something about his waning self worth and bad mental health but he wants to stay with me and ""will always be here"". He's since started his own individual therapy and is currently thinking about getting on meds to potentially help him ""keep his problems from seeping more into the relationship"".

So here comes the reason why I've been debating a break: Untangling our lives would be incredibly hard, as we have a big shared group of friends, an apartment, and a dog together. But he clearly needs to work on himself and as an added layer of complication, I've been thinking a lot about myself and have been wanting to explore more of my queer identity (haven't yet had experience with a woman but have started to think about things more). I definitely still think that he is my person and that I can see myself still marrying him down the line. But the uncertainty of everything is just driving me absolutely insane and I cannot seem to make a concrete decision. 

So, is it worth it to take time apart for both of us to figure our sh*t out? Or do we just break up a decade long relationship for both of our sakes.

My first relationship lasted 3 years. It was a messy breakup due to college/distance breaking us up. I was very happy, but in retrospect it was a pretty toxic relationship. Lots of pettiness and jealousy, but at the end of the day there were a lot of good aspects to it and I was happy, we both were.

Then I spent the following 4 years alone, pretty scared of starting a new relationship. Part of it was my confidence hitting rock bottom. During COVID I gained lots of weight and just didn’t feel attractive. But part of it was also that I was scared of starting a new relationship because of fear that it wouldn’t be as good. The first phase of my only relationship had become my blueprint. And if this new relationship didn’t follow that blueprint, then it wasn’t going to follow the same trajectory? Something like that. This 4 year break was fine. I learned to be with myself and I grew a lot (not just in size). I’m glad didn’t hop into another relationship immediately after.

Now I’m at a good place. I lost all my weight and I feel like I’m at a better place than before, mentally too. I started talking to a girl I was really into, and now we’re in a relationship. But it feels really different. She’s way more shy than my first, the whole dynamic is different, this girl is way more independent, not toxic at all.

Something feels off, though. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m truly dissatisfied, or if it’s because it’s a new relationship, or I’m too used to a toxic relationship that I’m just bored? Maybe I’m subconsciously still making the first relationship the “ideal”.

The reality is that this new girl is pretty different than the last, but I’m still into her. I told myself I’d give this a chance, and that maybe in a few months I’ll have an answer. I’ve communicated this to her as well because I don’t want to lead her on. She said it’s better to give it a chance than to never have tried it out in the first place. Do you guys have any thoughts or advice? Maybe you’ve dealt with something similar in the past?

Originally he joined my friendship group as a co-worker of multiple people in my group. We didn't know his past and have been hanging out with him for about 6 years. A few years ago he mentioned a few things about his past that led us to do some investigation into him which resulted in use finding images of him at a whitesupremist march with convicted neonazis holding stormfront flags and posing with them dressed in KKK outfits. Obviously we were appalled and shocked about this. Myself and the two others that were aware of this discussed how we would proceed with this information. We decided that since he was 18 at the time of the photographs and he hadn't shown any sign of such beliefs during the time we'd known him we wouldn't bring it up and instead be observant of him and his behaviour and call him out if he ever exhibited those beliefs so that others wouldn't think it was acceptable. I brought it up with him a few years ago and he told me that he does not hold such views anymore and that he was groomed from 14 to be that way. As I've gotten to know him, we have investigated life from a similar spiritual, scientific and philosophical lens and I have grown quite fond of him. The problem is I'm mixed race and also somewhat of an anarchist which doesn't align with his past.

Later on he came to me saying that he had just woken up and had a morning accident.This morning I could not take it anymore so I took his phone when he was asleep which I have never done before and check around.

We eventually shared social medias but we don’t share as much of a connection out of work.

I’ll be honest and say that out of all of the time we’ve spent working together this is the most me and her have interacted, we would text each other if we were going on our breaks, we would mess around around whenever we saw each other, she even came down to help me down in the area that I was working in just to see me. There was also a lot of what I already described our interactions to be like from before happening as well.

I'll TL;DR: Sister in law (also currently renting from and living with her) feels I owe her favors (why, I don't know) and because I stand up against her and her spoiling of her adult son, I'm treated badly. Please help. (Better TL;DR @ bottom)

My sister in law (45F) is married to my brother (22M...yeah) and treats him badly, and is very controlling of him/uses him as a pawn against others. Her son from a previous marriage (20M) and me (19F) and my boyfriend (22M) live with them. Me and my boyfriend were kicked out in June because our previous landlord was forced to move back into his rent house when his girlfriend died. Facing homelessness, me and boyfriend moved in with SIL at her offer. She charges us only $400 total a month to live here. I think this is a contributing factor to the treatment I'm about to describe. 

I have been struggling to keep a job lately due to severe depression (but I have been paying rent in full and on time, conserving water like I was asked to after the water bill went up, and in general keeping the cost of my living here down) and as time has gone on, SIL seems to resent me more and more. She makes comments in front of other people that imply I do nothing but sleep all day, nags me about chores that I ALWAYS complete, appreciates very little that I contribute (cleaning, cooking) and generally acts rude towards me. I think that it bothers her that she has a full time job and cannot be ""carefree"" unemployed like me. *Note: unemployment is highly stressful. 

One day she came to me with this request: I take her son to work at 11:30pm everyday for two weeks, because she does not want to stay up that late to take him (she works mon-fri early mornings). Despite her saying I could think on it, it was clear through her wording that she feels I should accept with no quarrel. She did in fact offer to pay for my gas, I should add. Considering her general disrespect towards me and a few other past incidences that are too long for this post where she got incredibly mad at me for things that she had actually got wrong or weren't my fault, I didn't feel like she deserved my help. 

I need to add here: SIL's son does not have a driver's license or car at 20 years old due to sheer laziness that is allowed by his mom, who takes him everywhere. He is autistic (which affected him alot when he was young but is to the point of effective non-existence now) and she has an idea that he is incapable of doing things on his own, like learning to drive, keeping a job, applying for jobs etc. despite this being blatantly untrue. He takes advantage of this and stays lazy. SIL says she won't teach him to drive because his car insurance will be too high for her son to pay for due to part time jobs (untrue: all my friends work part time jobs and afford their insurance, even though it is expensive because it is called being an adult where relying on your parents is not an option...) and she doesn't want to have to pay for what her son cannot cover. She also says a car note would be too expensive for him (buy a used car? I saved $3,000 with a part time job in HS in case I had to buy my own). There is no excuse here in my opinion.

When she asked me to take her son to work, I told her it was too late at night for me and that I'd think about it (I honestly had no intention of saying yes). This made her very angry, and she just abruptly stopped talking to everyone in the room and refused to respond when I thanked her for some dinner that was bought. As a side note, I hate that she asks people serious questions in front of others, it is very embarrassing and I feel put on the spot/pressured to accept her asinine requests lest I be judged. By this point I was so angry. She constantly disrespects me, implies I owe her favors because, in her eyes, I'm an unemployed lazy piece of shit, and embarasses me in front of other people including my boyfriend. Fuck her lmao. I didn't do anything to deserve this. There was no way I was doing her that favor. And I didn't.

SIL's son ended up quitting that job (like he does every job after a short stint - and yet she resents me for doing a much less severe version of this) because he hated it anyways and had no way to attend those shifts. Now he's unemployed and looking for a job at a certain retailer. SIL keeps mentioning to me how much her son wants this new job but that they won't reply back: implying this is my fault without saying it. This past week, the son asked where I donate plasma (I do this for extra money) and about the process. I told him and got an account set up for him, all very kindly. 

Originally, SIL's son was gonna go to the plasma donation on his own, but SIL asked if I would take him with when I go next. I agreed. It would cost me nothing, except a little extra time for him to get registered (I have plenty of time lol). I told her son of the plan and we agreed. Today however, after getting home from an interview (I got the job!!) I come to find out he went with the friend without telling me and was currently at the center. SIL told me. She tells a story that another bill came up and he wanted to donate twice this week before Thanksgiving to pay it. Hastily, I call him because of this: if he scans in a referral code during registration, I get a free $50. 

He did not pick up the phone, nor answer or open my text with the referral code. The $50 never hit my account. It cost him nothing but a few seconds to open that text and he didn't do it. I was gonna give him $20 of it, not to mention drive him there, to the atm and the bank all for free and on my time, also that wouldve been a favor to SIL who doesn't deserve favors. Me and the son are barely acquantinces toom. My only guess it that he or via tampering by SIL is mad at me for not taking him to the job. 

Can someone please tell me what I can do in this situation? I'm not currently able to move out (we are saving up). SIL targets me and treats my boyfriend (who has a full time job but contributes next to nothing to the house functioning) very nicely and never complains about him. SIL is known for manipulative behavior, gossip, exaggeration and being overly judgmental. She also is the only person who can ever be correct. The son is just lazy and kind of annoying, but he's never caused me any undo harm or anything. This is mainly about SIL. I hate this. 

TL;DR: My sister in law and landlord feels I owe her favors and treats me badly because I struggle with employment (due to illness). I pay rent in full and on time and do everything I can to save her money. She asked me to help her with an issue with her spoiled adult son (issue caused by a combo of their laziness) and I refused due to multiple episodes of disrespect. They both seem to resent me now and blame me for the son being unemployed.

I met him at 21, started “dating” him when he was 23 nd we’ve been dating for 3 years(he’s now 26).


At the beginning of our relationship, while he was casually going out with me, he was hooking up with his ex, I knew this and didnt mind.  As things got more serious with us, he stopped seeing her, but I was afraid of getting serious so I told him I wanted to remain casual, he started hooking up with her again. We went back and forth for the first year of our relationship, but finally decided to date officially at the beginning of 2021, but by then her ex had already become a part of his life again, he liked hanging out with her and talking sexually with her. This caused trouble between us and it made me extremely jealous, to the point where we almost broke up but he told me he’d choose me over her, and stopped talking with her.


Our relationship finally became stable somewhat, we’d go out with his friends, we’d stay at each other’s houses and met each other’s parents, and with that stability, a routine, it became a bit boring, specially our sex life. I tried talking to him about it but he’d tell me it was either his work stressing him out, a medicine that gave him low libido, etc. After a while I asked him if he felt like I was pressuring him too much about the topic, he told me to not worry about it, which only made me worry more and I did smth I regret doing.


I went through his phone and read that he was talking with his ex again, about how she was the best sex he’d ever had, how he’s been able to condition me into picking up her old habits, how hot and pornographic their sex was, never mundane or boring(this felt like a jab at our sex life) how they sometimes could not contain themselves of how much they wanted each other.

He told me this to inform me he was done with her, but he didnt tell me about the other gnarly details(I understand why, I dont think I was supposed to find that piece of info out).

On the one hand, Im glad he told me that he was somewhat done with her(he misses their friendship) but at the same time, I feel like he’s settling for me, like I’m the safer bet and he’d prefer having a boring stable life with me than a rocky one with her, which ultimately he could also improve if he were to try again with her.


I just feel like Im a replacement for her, the fact that he’s tried to condition me into her old sexual habits, he’s told me they discovered sex together so it only makes sense he seeks for that, but it just sucks, to be having sex and be thinking “is this how she used to do it, and thats why he’s getting off?”

The thing with B is that he’s my best friend and living together is easy. But that’s not enough. He seems stunted in a childlike mentality. He’s a collector and has spent thousands in figures and such but he doesn’t just collect, he opens them out of the box and plays with them too. Which like whatever, but he gives stuffed animals and toys more attention than me physically and it just weirds me out frankly and is starting to make me resentful. 

When we first started dating the sex was constant and amazing. Now it’s infrequent, boring, and predictable. We hardly make out, and not to be obscene but I am a very passionate and intense lover and he’s clumsy and not confident. I give oral every time just as foreplay, he used to always do it and now, never. I have asked several times for weeks and never, always excuses. My libido is also very high and he just wouldn’t notice if I was withholding. I HATE looking at porn, now I have to a lot. He never looks at it because he just isn’t sexual anymore. 

And I hate for this even to be a factor but I am not an unattractive woman, I get attention everywhere I go. I’m also not a cheater though and rebuff every advance but to turn men down constantly and come home and your partner is cuddling the squishmallow you bought them and not you? 

This seems very one sided. Last night I was practically holding back tears at the thought of our relationship and he was saying stuff like you’re my soulmate and I want to be with you forever. It’s not like that isn’t what I want but no conversation ever changes anything and I’m deeply hurt. I refuse to even change in front of him anymore because the way he doesn’t even glance at my body is so painful and is ruining my self esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context if you care enough or are bored. I actually enjoyed writing this, so fuck it, I'll leave it here. TL;DR at the bottom:

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 2017 I had just finished my first relationship of 8 months (we were 21F and 23M), which wasn't great or interesting. So basically, I did the obvious: I downloaded Tinder! I ended up using it for less than 2 weeks because I matched with my second GF (18F at the time, I was 23) and we ended up in a relationship that lasted for more than 4 years. Last year we broke up. Actually, she broke up with me, which made me so miserable. So miserable that I only had the strength to move on 1 year later (a.k.a. 2 months ago). Guess what I did when I felt ready? I downloaded Tinder, ofc!

&amp;#x200B;

So here is where I need your help. I'm dating this girl that I matched on Tinder once again. We have lots of things in our favor: she's as much of a gamer as I am, we live relatively close, she ended a relationship recently as well, we're in the same phase in life (uni + work), apparently we both are physically attracted to each other and the conversation goes smoothly.

&amp;#x200B;

However, she's a livestreamer. She streams on twitch and has a small-to-medium channel I'd say (between 1k and 2k followers), and she's beautiful. Honestly, the obvious dozens of dudes that go there to hit on her or try to look badass don't bother me that much. I truly think it's pretty pathetic. To be fair, I'm not even much of a twitch watcher myself, so I rarely watch her. At first, I'd lurk her livestream, so I could get to know her better and be more prepared for a date, but now I do it once in a blue moon.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I identified is that I feel like she receives so much attention online. There's so many people coming and asking her how's her day, how beautiful she is, how good she plays, how funny is her joke is, how intelligent she is for getting an A in that test, that I'm struggling to deliver more and maybe take the ""relationship"" (we went out to eat a couple of times and kissed/make out. That's it, if you're curious) a step further.

&amp;#x200B;

I really like her, I think we have a lot in common, and we get along well. Also, I must say, that no, she's not an attention wh\*\*e, twitch th\*t or anything like that. She truly enjoys playing games, I don't think I ever saw her body on livestream, she doesn't feed the extreme annoying/disgusting dudes with attention and no, I don't want to change her. I want to be more interesting to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, but I can't ask for any specific advice here, I just feel like we have gone past the phase that we'd know each other so, so fast, and specially for her, I feel like I'm not that interesting. Sending her memes? Forget it, she's seen it all. New shit released that you have to pay to get early access? Someone handed her a key already. Other dialogues that made me feel this way to better picture what I mean:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Yo have you watched the new episode of the show we both watch? Imma watch it later""

Her: ""Oh.. Yeah, we talked about it on the livestream. They said it's not that good"". (not in a mean way)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh, have I told you I got the complete (insert random manga series here) physical manga collection?""

Her: ""Really?? That's really cool! We were talking about it yesterday, X dude from my guild has like a whole room full of mangas, you should talk to him""

&amp;#x200B;

Extra points:

\- I'm different from the guys she talks online, but I happen to have similar interests. Oh, and by the way, I know I'm referring to them as ""dudes/guys"" but of course she also has some female friends/viewers. It's just that they are 1% of them.

\- Tbh I'm not a wealthy guy, I don't particular enjoy talking about uni or work with anyone, I'm also a very introverted person, which means I don't like leaving my house very much, specially for crowded places/events. I always thought my biggest strength was being a lovely and affectionate guy, that is really fun to spend time with, has random and cool interests (specially for a nerdy partner), respects boundaries and wants a relationship with someone that I consider high enough in my standard to build a family with.

\- Obviously I don't want to lie/pretend/manipulate or anything. I want ideas of how I can circumvent this situation like a normal human being;

\- Again, I won't try to change or tell her not to talk with whoever she wants about anything she desires.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

I (27M) am dating a girl (26F) that livestreams gameplay, and we have a lot in common, but I feel like her interest in things we both have are mostly satisfied by her viewers/online friends. I need help to fill in the blanks of her interests to try and get more interested on me (the good ol' love game).",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7611518,public,self,I (27M) am dating a girl (26F) that livestreams on twitch - and I don't feel I bring enough to the table,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1l5b2/i_27m_am_dating_a_girl_26f_that_livestreams_on/,all_ads,6,,,

This is my first post ever &amp; im a little nervous so bare with me! There is this guy I’ve had a crush on for over a year (we’re both now seniors in college M&amp;F 22). We have some of the same friends but really hit it off at a party and he eventually asked me out to be his date at a college event. We had the best time and had a spark (or at least I thought we did) but I didn’t want to do anything further because I didn’t want to start anything that wasn’t somewhat serious since our friends would likely find out. He was always really nice the rest of last year and even introduced to his family when they came in but never asked me to anything else or never hinted at anything further so I cut myself off from him as much as I could (brief hugs, polite conversations ect.). For additional context I knew from my friends he apparently wasn’t looking for anything serious but we never talked about it. This semester I hadn’t seen him till 2 weeks ago (I was honestly avoiding him) and he saw me across the room and beelined it to me. He was extra sweet and kept playfully poking me in front of everyone but what shook me was he kept saying over and over “you know I would never hurt you right” (he was VERY drunk) and it just kind of stuck with me (in a good and bad way) the past couple of days. I’m pretty much over him but I was just wondering (from random strangers:)) what does he want from me? There’s a lot missing from the story but I guess I just want to know should I talk to him about it or should I just let it go? We’re going to be at a party after break and I’m just not sure if I should open all of it up. The guy barely texts me but every time he sees me then he’s with me the whole night but never asks to take anything further. I thought we were now just friends but after he kept saying that I’m not so sure how to approach him when I see him. Maybe I’m being naive but I can’t stop thinking about it and I don’t want to go down the crush rabbit hole again.

My (29F) husband (29M) bought me an exercise bike for my 30th birthday. I had specifically asked him about a month before my birthday “hey I’ve realized the older I get, the more I appreciate experiences over things. I’d really like an experience for my birthday, like a weekend trip, rather than any thing this year.” Only other context is that I have gained about 20 lbs in the last year and I have expressed to him that I want to lose that weight. However, I have been working with a personal trainer since August, and I already work out more than him. A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about what we’d add to our home gym we are creating, and my husband had asked me if I’d ever be ok with a knock-off peloton. I told him yes, and that was an honest answer. Of course that conversation had nothing to do with my birthday, and was very much about how we could build a gym for our mutual benefit down the line.

My husband loves to online window shop, to the point it seems like an unhealthy fixation at times. I think he globbed on to my comment that I’d like a knock-off peloton for our gym and that was the more fun, gadget-y gift for him to shop for, rather than to build an experience for us like I asked.

When he revealed the bike to me, I was crushed. I was already feeling unheard and ignored in our relationship. Now there’s this big object in our garage that is a physical reminder of that feeling.

I talked to him about it and he says he feels bad, but I don’t think he gets it. I feel like my husband doesn’t get me and who I am as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex (Lets call her Lex) and I Had been together for about 3 and a half years.

We knew each other for a couple years before we started to see each other. We were together for about 6 months before becoming official. The day we became official, out of nowhere she says ""So, for all intents and purposes, maybe we should be boyfriend and girlfriend"" Happily, I agreed. We both had some turbulent relationships in the past. And I never want to rush, or pressure anyone I date into being ""official"". 

For the most part, we were happy together. Had allot of good times. And I was lucky to have a partner through the pandemic. But there were many red flags, almost immediately that I chose to ignore. I have had trust issues from past relationships, and really wanted this relationship to work. 

Almost immediately Lex had requested that we keep our relationship status off social media. She had her reasons, that seemed to make sense at the time (I honestly forget the exact wording, but it was along the lines of ""its not really anyone's business anyways"". But I respected that, and obliged. A month after we were exclusive, on new years eve I had to work. Lex had gone to a bar with some friends to bring in the new year. We met up when I was out of work. She told me that at midnight, she had kissed a friend of hers at midnight (that was in a poly relationship). I felt bummed out, but if it was innocent I can move past that. A few months later, a friend of mine had brought up the placement of her Claude ring. (For those of you that don't know, its a ring that is worn often indicating your relationship status) Hers was worn in a way that would indicate she was single. I had Brought this up to Lex one day. And she immediately got upset. Saying that she was offended that people were talking about her, and its no ones business what jewelry she wears. She said that it was stuck on, and couldn't take it off. I offered to help her remove it, and replace it with a new one. The conversation was quickly derailed with an emotional charged rant about other people talking about her. I dropped it after that. I trusted that this was not intentional, and moved on from the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the pandemic began, we were generally homebody's. Lex was laid off, and I worked. We spend weekends together and had a really good time just hanging out. After a few months, I really wanted to do something nice for the both of us. Maybe go stay at an air Bnb for a weekend. Lex really did not like this idea. Stating that it wouldn't be safe. We don't know how clean these places are and someone could have been sick that was previously staying there. I brought up this idea a few more times over a span of 6 months, and Lex did not seem to be interested in the idea of it. One day I called Lex up to say hi, and see if she wanted to hangout. She had told me she was on an Amtrak, heading out of state to see a girlfriend of hers that was visiting family. (Just for a bit of background, Lex doesn't even like public transport on a good day, never mind the middle of a pandemic) I was bewildered by this. For her to spontaneously take a trip like this was very out of character of her.  But again, I tried not to let my trust issues get the best of me. So I told her to enjoy her time, and be safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So over the past year, I have not been doing so well mentally. Last year, my dog developed an extremely aggressive form of cancer. Within a month I had to put him to sleep. It was both mentally, and financially draining. A couple weeks leading up to when I knew I had to put him down, Lex had accepted a job offer. And to celebrate, she was going to stay with her cousin across country. The day she was going to fly out, I knew I had to get to the vet and say goodbye to my buddy. I told Lex the morning off what was going on. She said she was sorry she could not be there with me, and flew out a few hours after I had the appointment. Now I do not fault her for flying out that day. But she would only be gone 5 days. And I would see her as soon as she got back. I was an emotional wreck for the next few days, and got really sick from respiratory bronchitis . But at least she would be back soon, and I could have a shoulder to cry on. So the day before she was going to fly back, there was some bad weather coming into where she was staying. Her flight got canceled and she got a voucher to reschedule. Not a big deal. Shit happens. But rather than getting the next flight back, she decided to stay for 10 extra days. Perhaps I was being selfish in feeling this way, but I was really bummed out. If the roles were reversed, I would try to get back as soon as I could. But whatever. I understood to a point. 

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple days before she was going to fly back, her cousin invited her to a big party. Later that night I got a phone call from her. I looked at the phone, and was happy to see she was calling even though she was supposed to be at a party having fun. Not even a minute into the phone call she asked me if I would be alright with her going home with another girl she met at the party. Now, under normal circumstances, I might not feel as fucked up about this. But our sex life had not been very good over the past few months. Coupled with the fact I was both physically and emotionally drained. I kind of staggered with my response, but ultimately I told her that I wanted her to have fun. What she told me the next day was she did not go through with it, and she was really drunk. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later, a good friend of mine reached out and told me a reliable source had overheard that Lex was cheating on me, for quite some time. I reached out to the source of these accusations. I was extremely reluctant to believe any of this at first. Our relationship had never been better at this time. We were very happy together. We were making plans to move in with each other. And our sex life was very consistent. At one point, she told me ""I don't know if you know this, but I'm kind of obsessed with you"". Which I had never been told before without feeling weird.

&amp;#x200B;

The source was her old room mates that really did not like Lex. Like, grown women pulling middle school stunts and really went out of their way to make Lex upset (I saw the text messages between her, and her former room mates and it was kind of crazy for anyone in their mid 30's to be acting the way they were). But I spoke with one of them that I still was on good terms with. This one room mate told me that Lex had a couple different guys stay over and slept in her bed. Which, I was still reluctant to believe. But what really caught my attention was that Lex, had taken an Amtrak one weekend to see a guy a couple states away. After that, I was not so reluctant to believe what I had been told.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later I confronted Lex about this. She got very upset, stating that she did not like people talking about her and immediately asked me where I had heard this from. I would not tell her, and said it didn't matter and I wanted to hear the truth. It took several times of me asking who these guys were by name. After some time, she admitted to going to see this friend i a couple states over. Stating she did not want to tell me she was going to see this guy. She told me that they had a very complicated relationship, but he was someone she could always confide in. This guy was someone who had helped her though some very hard times in her life, and that nothing had happened between them. But she also did not tell me that they had met up a number of times over the course of our relationship. After a while of asking about the other guys I was told about, she eventually fessed up to having sex with someone else within a month of us becoming exclusive. This came to a shock to me, because it was not anything I had heard from her former room mate.

&amp;#x200B;

I was crushed to say the least. But after several hours of talking, and the longest relationship either of us had been in, I did not want to let her go. I know almost everyone reading this thinks I'm a complete fool, and admittedly I am. But like I said, up to this point our relationship had never been better. And when you love someone, and feel extremely comfortable with them, the thought of starting over is almost impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few months, our relationship was not quite the same. But it was still good. Back in July a good friend of mine was getting married. It was a very casual affair. No need to get dressed up, just a backyard wedding with no need to make a big production of it on our end. I mentioned this to Lex about a month before. But the week before the wedding I brought it up again. She immediately took issue with going with me. Stating that it was inconsiderate of them to have a wedding the weekend of 4th of July. And started making excuses as to why she couldn't go. One of them really stuck out to me. She had to make a fruit salad for a party she was going to the next day (A party I was not invited to). I got pretty bummed out, and for the next few days just didn't really engage with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekend following the wedding, we were at my place. Had dinner, Had a few too many drinks and were getting ready to take a shower together and started getting intimate. Out of nowhere, with the flip of a switch as she was on top of me she started crying. Saying she felt like she was going through the motions. That she felt like I was bringing her down. And maybe this isn't working out. You can imagine the shock I was feeling, going from about to get laid to what is going on?? We talked for about a half hour, and I was just at a loss for words. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks had gone by, and I made plans to drop off some stuff she left at my house. We talked for a while. I really wanted to make sense of the reasons why. She left this very open to, maybe we just need time to work on ourselves. Maybe it will work out in the future. Maybe it will not. Hours went by, and before you knew it, midnight had approached and I stayed the night. It felt weird, but I was really missing her and just wanted to feel normal for a little bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next couple months, we began to talk more and more. And before you knew it, we were hanging out consistently. Not having a conversation about anything, I did not feel like we were officially back together. But she expressed that it seemed like we were. I told Lex that we needed to have an actual conversation about this, and we still had allot to work on before I was willing to be in a relationship again,

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings us to present day. Since Halloween, we have not been talking daily. Or really much at all. The week before Halloween she had been looking for costumes. It wasn't until a few days before the weekend that I asked her what her plans were. She told me ""I told you I was going to a Halloween party with some people I grew up with on Friday"" Which, I have no recollection of. I told her that should be really fun. I did not want to impose, so I didn't come right out and ask her why I wasn't invited. But also, sometimes you just need some time without your partner to do things. I also work Saturdays, so I knew that I would likely not see her until Sunday at the very least. The weekend had come and gone. I reached out to Lex on Sunday, and didn't hear back until Monday. I'm not the jealous, or possessive type of person, so I chalked it up to she had a long weekend. I have had those too, so whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, I was a little bummed and just in my own head about the past weekend. We didn't really talk. And saw each other briefly when I picked her up from work and drove her to run some errands. The following Friday, I texted her to see what she was doing for the night. I didn't hear back from her until later in the day. She told me that it was her best friends birthday weekend. And her friend had a whole weekend of partying planned out. Again, the first I had heard about this. But we also hadn't talked too much the week leading up. They were going to be going to a bar down the street from where I live for a night of dancing and drinking. But Lex said she wasn't really feeling up for going out all night, and that she was going to leave by 11 and come to my place after. 11 o'clock came and went. I texted Lex, and called once with no answer. I was kind of pissed if I'm completely honest, partially because I got no response, but also I wasn't invited to even come get a drink before they went to the dance party. I didn't hear back from her until the next day. All she said was ""Hey, I'm so sorry"". I told her its cool, I kind of expected that she would get carried away and might not make it over. Later that day she texted and asked if I was going to be working that night (Which she knows I was), I said yes and that was the last I heard from her until Sunday night. I honestly didn't want to talk to her I was so upset.

&amp;#x200B;

later in the week, I stopped by her work on Wednesday to drop something off she needed for the week. I really was not too talkative. But she was talking at me about her weekend, and how it was a blur and all that. She told me she had a short week due to the holiday, and that she had Friday off. So the next day (Thursday) I found out I was not working Friday. I texted Lex to see if she wanted to go out later that night. I only got a few responses back. She was going to a concert down the street from me. I asked her if she wanted to meet up after, or even get a drink before the show. I got no response back after that. The next day she apologized for not getting back to me, and said she didn't know what time she would be getting out of the show and didn't want me to wait up. At this point, I just said fuck it. I needed a couple days to really cool down from that one. I spent the weekend stewing about this, and planned to meet up with her on Monday and ask her if there was anything going on that I should know about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday comes around. I pick her up, and we had gone to the grocery store to get stuff to make dinner. I was pretty quiet the whole night. But after a couple hours, I had convinced myself to see how the night shakes out. Feel her out, and give her one last chance. The whole night, nothing about her seemed unusual. I got very drunk by the end of the night. I was definitely trying to suppress my anxiety with alcohol. By 1 am, right before we were going to head to bed she said something. She said that maybe we should take some time to work on ourselves. I was almost in disbelief that this was happening again. But I also spent the whole weekend ready to walk away if there was something going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of us having a enough to drink, and it being late. The conversation went nowhere. At this point it was 4am. And she still intended on staying the night. I told her I was going to sleep on the couch downstairs, and she begged me to stay in bed. The next morning, she got ready for work and told that it was not her intention for the night before to end up the way it did.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent the past few days feeling completely hollow. Being in my own head, I'm almost positive that she has been seeing other people. I still love this girl. But I know that I can not go back to that relationship. If someone had told me what I just told you guys, Id think I'm an idiot for ignoring all the red flags and trying to make something this toxic work. The minute that I found out she cheated, whether if it was physical, or emotional. I should have walked away. But when you find someone you love, and feel so comfortable with. Its hard to think about starting over. 

&amp;#x200B;

We spoke briefly earlier the other day, and both agreed that we need to meet up and talk. Part of me needs the closure. And part of me wants to know what has been going on. At this point, I don't owe her anything, and should probably just block her number and walk away. But the not knowing part will eat me up.  After 3 and a half years with someone that you truly do love, its not always easy to just disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, I know this was a bit of a rant. And part of this is me trying to work it all out in my head. The other part is the shame of being judged by friends and family for being such a fool. But I want to hear from those of you that have had similar experiences. I want to hear from anyone that has another perspective on this. I know I'm an idiot, was too trusting and probably need to seek therapy after this. I don't want to be jaded, or make anyone else jaded. But relationships are not always easy. And thats life.

As the title says, I just broke up with my GF a couple of hours ago and my brain is going all kinds of crazy right now. I knew it had to be done, but I still feel terrible about it, and don't know how or if I'll find a way to cope about it.

For context we met when I was almost done with my undergrad degree and she was starting hers. Now I am finishing my MSc and she is past the half mark of her undergrad. Ultimately my romantic feelings for her started to fade away, and I was started to feel like I was using her to fill the friendship void I've had most of my life (only had a couple of friends through HS - College, now even less than a couple, virtually zero).

There were some stuff that I probably should have taken more seriously when discussing compatibility, for example having children. When we talked about it, I would said I wasn't in the place to have children right now, but I would like to in the future. She would say she doesn't want to have kids, but sometimes would switch her answer to ""we'll see in the future"" after seeing me bummed out about her response.

Apart from growing distant (I'm not going to the university as frequently as before), lately we would see each other only once or twice a month, with sexual relationships happening only around once every 2 months or 2 months and a half. And, to be clear, I am not blaming her for any of this distancing.

A few days ago we were talking about being independent and travelling as you grew older. I mentioned that I would like to eventually have a business of my own, even a family business, and go around places not having to worry much about working for someone else. She on the other hand mentioned she would prefer to be settled in a single place and have the ""safety"" of working for someone else. This made me realize that not only we were growing apart, we had different views of the future, so I ended things.

I have gone completely no contact as of right now and intend to keep it going. But I don't know how will I cope with the fact of losing the only constant person in my life (besides family), even telling my mom (which liked my GF a lot) feels like a terrible thing to do. Like I mentioned before, I virtually have no friends (either moved out of town or we stopped talking), I have no hobbies, I'm finishing grad school so I have a lot of down time and I'm simply walking around in circles.

I’m dying in CRINGE! Almost a year ago I met a guy on bumble when I was probably in the most vulnerable state I’ve ever been in. I wasn’t physically attracted to him at all, but he felt safe in a way. He seemed nice, too nice.. but I was a mess and just thought he was nice because he wanted to pray with me. 

To make a long story short. Things didn’t last too long, but they got emotional and at first I felt I lost someone great. Then I learned he lied about his age (said he was 28 when he was 34), he lied about his height (he was 5’6.5 and it said 5’11”), he lied about his job (said he worked in law and was a college professor and he ended up being a Christian high school teacher), and lied about his background and said his family was rich (no where close)…  

I was creeped out from the beginning when I looked at who he followed on Instagram and it was all barely legal half naked butt girls (I’m in my 30s). I actually asked him about it immediately, and he said that they were all his former students and he was not into those type of girls. What a joke. Because I was so vulnerable and he kept quoting the Bible, I just believed him. 

Thankfully, I dodged that… but I wrote an article about this guy, didn’t mention who he was, but I wrote about how I dated a liar. I know he read it because he ended up deleting things on his Instagram that would lead to his age and unfollowed a bunch of these girls. He also started a blog and tried to copy mine. I write about culture, religion, and art. I cringe every time I think about how I let that guy quote the Bible to me, it’s always those guys who virtue signal that are the worst. He’s a high school teacher and some other girls he followed were 18 that were clearly not his students. I truly believe he might be a possible p*do… that’s how creeped out I am.

In my gut I know something was wrong with him. Unfortunately, I live on a very busy street where you can see if my lights are on and see through window driving by. He lives 25 min away, and sometimes I feel this guys energy and I think he drives by. He’s really creepy and I don’t say that lightly. 

Tonight I was on Bumble and he popped up. I quickly tried to scroll down to go to the very bottom where you can block someone, but my finger was a little bit sticky, and I accidentally swiped RIGHT!!! I screamed immediately and flipped out because I don’t want any communication with this guy. 

He pays for Bumble so within a few minutes, he saw that I swiped right and matched with me. At that time I was on the phone with my best friend screaming and freaking out about this when we matched. In less than two seconds I blocked him. The fact that this guy even thinks that he could be in my orbit, blows my mind. The fact that this guy isn’t ashamed of himself is just insane. If I did what he did, I would bury my head in shame, and make sure I never saw the person I lied to you again. I’m not trying to sound stuck up, but I am way out of this guy’s league. WAY! On every level.

I’m so upset and feel complete cringe because I know this guy is going to think that I’m trying to communicate with him. I just worry he’s going to stalk me. when I first wrote the article, I checked his Instagram, and I saw that he would go hang around near where I lived. He literally would go to places right next-door to my apartment. I felt so creeped out for the longest time but I have felt pretty good lately. So this whole thing really is just awful and cringe. Thankfully, I never slept with him, but I got close and I just wanna puke every time I think about it. I actually even rearranged my bedroom because I didn’t want this creep’s energy to know how I slept.

For the last 2 years or so he was spending about 3-4 nights a week at my place, so we had/have plenty of experience sleeping together.

Sleeping with him wasn’t always bad but at some point I started to dread it. He’s a hot sleeper which means AC on full blast no matter the season. I really wouldn’t mind this except he also kicks the covers off of both of us because he is *still* hot (and I had a window AC so my room would be literally 55 degrees). He thrashes around, kicks me and my small dog, loves to sleep like a starfish. It’s really something. 

I’ve spent the last couple of years dealing with this and honestly I’d learned to live with it. But now there is something new- he cannot sleep without ASMR. I’m not shaming anyone for liking ASMR or needing it to sleep, but I find it extremely creepy. He doesn’t want to fall asleep with earbuds in, understandable as they’re not comfortable, but needs it to sleep. Which means it gets played out loud. I’ve told him I really don’t like it, but he just turns to the other side and plays it anyway. I woke up to it the other night and had an effing heart attack.

I just feel like when it comes to sleeping we are too incompatible. I love him so much, but I honestly hate living with him for this reason alone. I can love it all day until it’s time to sleep. I miss the nights where he would go home and I’d get good sleep again. And now with this ASMR stuff… like I really thought things couldn’t get worse.

I'm really having a hard time trying to communicate with her involving emotions and every time we fight I'm always quiet on my part. And that's it the cycle keeps going and going until I got frustrated and take it personally.   


We started talking again a month ago, and we made a deal to be more open and honest. I had assumed this would be simple, but it wasn't. I don't know what I can do to offer her the communication she wants because I really have no other options. Every time we have a serious discussion, I'll keep quiet out of fear that it might happen again.  


For example, when we were out on a date and I forgot to set up a game that I believed was fixed, she became frustrated and we argued when I thought she was angry with me but was actually upset about the situation. And I apologized and she didn't accept my apology about it and she's saying she always leads up the conversation and me being the quiet one always.  


I realize recently that I can root my problem thru the violence here in our house that's why I don't want to talk about how I feel because it might jeopardize the mood or ""kill the mood"".

She’s made excuses for a friend of hers flirting with her after I said it made me uncomfortable. The next day she said she wanted to go on a break. I reluctantly agreed but stated I would not be able to talk to her in the same way or possibly at all if I was being left to not know what’s happening.

She’s always been adamant that she would want me in her life whether as a friend or a partner but it’s got to the point for me where it would hurt too much to just go back to being friends so I would have to cut off contact if we did split. 

We then had a fairly long discussion about it and ourselves in which she said she wants the break to work on herself but I said that could still be done in the relationship. It got onto our mental health and I mentioned how I have felt extremely suicidal for a while now which is why I haven’t been able to focus on her mental health as much as she would like me too. I am still making the effort to ask her but she just keeps so much from me. As soon as I said about my state she seemed to make a complete u-turn and say we could keep the relationship going. 

It’s been a couple days since this happened and she just feels more distant than ever. She’s started watching porn (nothing against this btw) which she was always so against for the first 2 years of us being together. I’ve noticed she’s been looking through her exes profiles too and caught glimpses of messages to her friends saying she is still unsure what’s happening and just rolling with it now. 

I don’t want our relationship to be held purely by her guilt of how it’s making me feel cause it’s so disingenuous and honestly feels worse than being alone as it feels she doesn’t want to be near me.

The moment I have entered into the institute, he had been having crush on me. And I like him back. I asked my friends who have been in the institute longer, and they said that I am the first person in the school who he likes. 

So he initiated conversations, and we discovered that we like almost the same thing, yet we are our own different persons. We even shared our secrets. We will be entering in the same institute and course (after the current preparatory). He even told me that ""we both are the only ones who understand each other."" And me, and my friends caught him many times staring at me since the day I entered the institute. 

Fast forward 3-4 weeks later since I enter the preparatory institute, he confessed to me and I confessed back. He then proceeded to kiss me (was my first kiss). It was for like 2 nights. Then suddenly the night after - he stopped. I asked him why, he said that because he was not ready for a serious relationship, and then he friendzone me. He himself wasn't sure how to explain it as he couldn't put in into words, but he said something that ""I thought there was something between us. So let's just be friends.""

I think it's pretty unfair to judge it like that when it's not even been a month. But oh well I respect his decision for now. Could it be he's confused of his own feelings and that he's actually isn't ready for a serious relationship? Will it be sparked? Cause we're only 19.

Intro/ i have a bachelors degree in kinesiology. I have been interested in going back to school for nursing for a few years. But always on the fence about it. In fact, I was accepted to a school in Charleston last year but I deferred it to next fall (2023) because I was so unsure about the commitment/ cost/ moving across the country. 
I live in California, and have been dating the most amazing man for a year now. He owns a business, a house, and wants to settle down in the next few years. He wants to support me in all my dreams and I know he would want me to go after them even if it meant heartbreak for him. 
I have always wanted to be a mom and settle down, and have felt like that’s my greater purpose. But I also want to be able to be independent and have a great career. 

If I was single, I would probably move across the country to go to school because I would have nothing else going for me in California. 
But I think this guy is the one.. and good, healthy love is so hard to find. 

Nursing has always attracted me, but it’s also been something that I haven’t been so passionate about- or else I would have gone back to school for it and not have this dilemma.

I know I wouldn’t be able to do ldr across country for 2.5 years and he is very settled into California by owning his business there.

No kids and we don't plan on having any. When we first started dating, I didn't really play video games much, although BEFORE we started dating I played a decent amount.   


For the most part I'm not a super social person. I have a few friends but I mostly just talk to them in a group chat, and basically all of my social life involves my gf, or my brother/friends through gaming. We've been dating 4 years and are engaged.  


She was working out of town the last few months, kind of a week-on, week-off type deal, so when she was out of town I would play games with my brother/friends, and when she was home I would just spend time with her. Playing video games for me is the main way I socialize since most of my friends and family live out of town, but we can still play games together and talk/catch up. My brother and I have an especially close bond and we play together a lot. He has a few friends as well, but it's kind of the same deal as me (most of his socialization is with me over video games).  


Just to clarify, I make sure my fiancee and I have days to ourselves. I do a decent amount of things to keep our relationship close, I try and do small things for her pretty regularly because she likes them (like back rubs and foot rubs), and I like making her feel good, but lately she stopped working the week-on, week-off job so she's been home 24/7 (it's temporary. Her job fluctuates so she works different shifts. We both make decent money and an income disparity is not an issue).  


Before anyone asks, I've talked to her about it and she understands that a lot of my social life involves gaming, but I also know it still annoys her. I think part of it is because I keep her up sometimes when she's trying to sleep, because we live in a small Airbnb (in the process of moving to a permanent apartment). Once we have a permanent place to live I intend on soundproofing the room I set up so she can't hear me talking. I also try to be as quiet as possible while we're in the Airbnb and in general when I game and she's sleeping.  


I also work from home so I see her all the time.  


I also just want to add that I've been on Reddit long enough to know that people will say I should dump her. I'm definitely, 100% not going to do that. Aside from some minor issues (that most relationships have) we get along very well. She is a wonderful person and although we have a couple of issues, no relationship is perfect, but we both try to work on them and have pretty good communication.  


**I guess mainly what I'm looking for is some suggestions on whether or not I'm gaming too much, as well as some suggestions on things other people have tried to reduce friction that gaming causes relationships? I know I'm not the only one who's experienced something like this, so I'm looking to hear from other people about their situations and what kind of compromises they agreed on with their partners.**

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to note, she sometimes games with me, although it depends on what's going on in our lives. Sometimes we all play together and game until 4AM, and sometimes she does her own thing and I do mine.  


I game about 1-3 hours about 4-5 nights a week, and usually when she goes to bed, so we can spend the day together.

She told me she didn't feel like I appreciated her enough at times, and I think she just wanted to spend more time with me. In the first year and a half I spent pretty much every day with her.

Come Saturday, same thing but this time she opened up a little about what’s been going on which is mental health issues. Of course, I 100% understood because I have my own mental health problems as well and I understand that some people prefer to keep to themselves when they’re having an episode. We talked until 4 in the morning that Saturday. 

Sunday, we didn’t talk at all. I texted her in the morning to wish her a good day and she didn’t answer until midnight again, but I didn’t see that until that Monday morning because I fell asleep earlier than usual. Either way, texted her Monday morning, she didn’t answer at all but she has been active on social media which at least let’s me know she’s alive. 

Now, I have let her know that I worry for her because I know how it can get with mental health, but all she’s said was that she appreciated the concern. I don’t know if I should give her the space that I feel like she might be asking for or if I should text or call to just check up. 

Or maybe she may just no longer want to talk to me? I overthink these things a lot.
