She's an extremely conservative person who expects her man to have the same ideologies as her. She expects me not to have my own stance or opinion. I am the typical fun, outgoing college guy with a bunch of guy and girl-friends. My family never restricted me from doing the things I enjoy, they let me go out and do whatever tf I want. But ever since I got into this relationship she's been controlling me in every possible manner. She hates it when I go talk to my girlfriends, she hates it even when a random girl approaches me and she downplays the things I am passionate about. Whenever I was assigned by my college to do speeches or anchor for events (I love participating in stuff like that), she says I'm doing it to show off among people and that I'm desperate for attention. She makes me feel guilty for doing the things I love, for going out, for having friends and literally everything. 

The situation is unbearable and most people would've fled earlier. When we weren't fighting the way she loved me was something anyone would've asked for. For a hopeless romanticlike myself her love was straight out of a fairytale and I was addicted to it. But she would constantly call me out and make me feel worthless most of the time. I was insecure way before I met her and was healing from my past traumas myself, but ever since this relationship started, things have been going downhill. My anxiety and insecurities have sky rocketed and I am starting to constantly question my worth. I have been putting up with her because her insults have somewhat made me desensitized towards them. She once slapped and tried to choke me for having a discussion about a film with a girl from our film review group. I love her no matter what she says about me, no matter how much she abuses me but deep down inside I know it's taking a toll on my mental health and I needs a way out. I was deeply unhappy with this relationship.

Over a month ago, I met a girl who was the drummer (I am obsessed with music bands and always wanted to join one) of a band that had done a music show at my college. I thought she was kinda cute and followed her on her social media account. She started messaging me and we became quite good friends. I wasn't interested in her in a romantic manner or anything. My girl hates it when I spend time on social media and she becomes paranoid every time my active status comes up, but I barely chat with anyone - I just watch reels and share memes 24/7. A couple of days ago, out of paranoia, she forced me to share my password with her and she read every single one of my chats with my friends. She broke it off with me because she thinks I have something going on with this ""drummer girl"". The thing is that I barely even talked to her, but she thought so because our chat seemed to suggest such themes. We are done for real now but i can't seem to get over her. I kept begging her to stay in contact with me but she abuses me with words even more.

I know the difference between toxic and healthy relationships. I'm very much aware of what's bad and what's good in a relationship. I'm the go-to friend everyone runs to for solace when they're undergoing some sort of distress. But I can't myself implement a single piece of advice that I pass on to my friends because I am too madly in love with my gaslighting girlfriend. Also she's over a decade older so I do not know if our age and generation gap play a role in her forceful nature.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7526924,public,self,Classic example of toxic romance.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yt74er/classic_example_of_toxic_romance/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I was a very weird kid in high school, and like most weird kids, was judged by very specific types of people. 

I’m in my 2nd year of college, and made most of my friends here essentially by default in a freshman-group thing the school put us in. I think I was desperate, and much too riddled with anxiety to do think about what I was doing. These girls are kind and loving and caring- but they’re the exact type of person that made my life hell in high school. 

I also have pretty severe mental health issues- schizophrenia and intense panic disorder. These girls, as freakishly sweet as they are, are THE MOST normal, levelheaded, healthy people I’ve ever met. I can’t even believe they actually exist, I thought people like them only existed in movies. Compared to them, I’m batshit insane. I can’t help but feel even more crazy when I’m around them, because I’m surrounded by so much calm. 

They’re so loving, and they don’t judge me. They do nice things for me when I’m down, and they try their best- but they are so far from being capable of understanding me that I think our friendship is doing more harm than good. I think they pity me. And admittedly, sometimes I catch them reflecting the behavior of those girls in high school (gossiping about others, obsession with boys, etc) and it boils my blood to an impractical degree. 

Long story short- I need out. I want to stay friends with every single one of them, I just can’t be IN the group anymore. Right now I’m in deep.

I told him I wasn't interested in having fun to which he said ""same"" and asked if I was still interested in hanging out and said because I'm sexy. 

I told him that I wasn't looking for whatever he had in mind. He then said he wanted something long term and that he wanted to go to a cafe to meet. I asked for his socials and he said he didn't have any which tends to be a 9/10 lie especially when he isn't an older guy or old fashion in any way.

He met my my mum over coffee/lunch middle of the year (Mum came to visit me) and I've mentioned a couple of times I'd like to meet his Dad; but the answer is always very non-commital and he kinda just jokes about it not being a great idea. He says his Dad is very protective of him and has the attitude of *""no one is ever good enough for his son""* and that his Dad  will *""find something he doesn't like about me""* and that could put strain on things for us (apparently this happened with his ex and his Dad kept going on about the thing he didn't like about her).

I've tried raising the issue a couple of times gently, as it's importnant to me to feel like my partner is proud of me and wants me to meet his family, but it's always a no...which makes me doubt how serious he is about this long term. If we were less than 12 months in sure...but 2 years feels like a long time to not be introduced.

I've tried to be understanding about his concerns, but at the same time it worries me that he would let himself/the relationship be influenced by his Dad's thoughts on me when the relationship has been going well for 2 years already, or that his Dad possibly *""having an issue with something about me""* could affect him to such an extent that the relationship could be put in jepordy (his family is from Southeast Europe so perhaps this is a bigger issue than I realise?

I tell this to my boyfriend right away and he said ""well yay, you and me, party at my place friday night"" and i agreed but said i want to sleep early. Friday comes and i asked him what he wants to do tonight and he said ""well i want to go outside with my friends and drink kind of"" knowing full well i cant stand the cold and i would probably get sick if i stay for too long.

Nobody else could hang out because they already had plans so i stayed at home alone bawling my eyes out because i think that my boyfriend doesnt think i'm ""fun"" anymore cause i dont drink anymore(almost 4 months), and he sent me a picture of himself at almost 8am coming back home.

We kept talking after that and we got drunk again another night. We had sex about 3 times.

Now ever since we’ve had sex, I feel so scared and pressured by her and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what this is, am I ready or am I just scared to let someone else in?

I feel like I’m making my own relationship with my bf turn to shit.

We moved in together around 4 months ago, during these 4 months there has been a regular problem for me, which I have brought up a couple of times since it made me sad. Basically my bf is a gamer, and not the kind who plays 1 to 2 hours and that’s it. He comes home from work and plays until I call him for diner, then goes back to his game. In total he plays I would say a minimum of 3 to 4 hours everyday, unless he is off work, then he plays most of the day. He doesn’t go to sleep with me a lot.

This makes me sad because I feel neglected, and like we don’t ever do anything together. We just have sex when he decides to go to sleep with me. I mean I would even be happy to just do the dishes with him.

As I’ve said, I brought up the problem multiple times but have seen no significant change.

And recently I feel like I’ve been shitty to him, I think he’s seen how sad I am, so he’s tried to ask me if I want to watch a movie with him or if I want help but I just feel so sad and lonely that I end up saying no, I just cook, do the dishes, the laundry, shower and go to bed because it just feels better to sleep than keep on asking him to please pay attention to me, or to wait for him to do so. 

But obviously it results in less connection. 

The other day I knew he was talking with his friend on discord about me but I couldn’t hear about what. So (and I know I shouldn’t have done this) I logued into his computer to see if he was talking about me with his discord friends, and I’ve found stuff that hurt me.

In one conversation which dates from a day I was not in a good mood because again.. gaming, he said that he couldn’t ever relax because of me. And his friend just replied with ‘’make her some dishes to wash’’

I’m not trying to blame him I just feel hurt because all I do is try to connect with him.

I feel like I’ve lost myself in the relationship, I want to find myself again, so as not to only feel whole when we do stuff together. And for the sake of having a healthy relationship. Do you have any advice for this? Should I pick up an activity that I go to alone ?

I said that I will never raise my kids there (as in from birth to late teenage ages). 

When i say this he gets very debate-y and says that there’s more opportunities in America for children and if you live in a good enough neighbourhood then you won’t have to worry about (mass) shootings. Im aware that if you were to try and exempt yourself from shootings in America you would have to live in a very good neighbourhood which would, I assume, cost a lot of money. I also think that if my children want to achieve something then they should be able to do so whether they live in the US or the UK. 

For me, I aspire to work in finance and I don’t believe that there’s a reason for me to move to the US to achieve that dream. There are many UK finance corporations which could help me achieve my dreams and tying my hopes to the US for “better opportunities” would be counterproductive. 

Since we both feel so strongly about our decisions I’m not sure how to feel. I’m not sure if this is going to be a ultimatum sort of argument later down the line in our relationship but it feels like it, and makes it hard to live in the present with that looming over my head.

In this few years that I stayed in another coty I made sure to go home at least in holidays, but things happened and my mom was forced to go in another country for very serious health problems.

This will sound very wrong but with her being thousands of kilometers away I had the best period of my life. I did what I wanted with my money, payed my rent in a small but cozy one room apartment. Life for me was very good and I enjoyed it very much with her out of the picture.

This was my very first ever relationship and yeah maybe I did some mistakes made some stupid choices, but those are my things and I will not regret what I did wrong I am finally living my life and learning.

Now my mom got back even if her health problems didn't got better but she really wanted to come back home and make her dream house in the countryside.

Now we get to the problem, since she came back she is getting back in her mother role and expectats me to do whatever she want to.
As I said before the salary at my job is not amazing but I am happy with it for now, I am able to do many things, but not for her she want me to have more as fast as possible and for this it means to come back home find something there and help her all the time.

Everything that I did while she was gone is bad and stupid and she will get back in her role to set me straight on the good path because every other path then hers is wrong. And I disappointed her so much because she send me there to learn and make myself a good carrier and I took all this things that she is not approving.

As a side note, my mom is very controlling and agresive, her style of educating me was by beating me and punishing me, she did it so much that I started to hate everyone and even myself. I can really say she is a very typically christian, antivaxx, conspiracy Karen.

She is really pushing me to the edge by saying over and over again that I have to get back that I am a disappointment and I need to help her. And if I try to say something she will start to scream and shout and my body goes numb and I start to have a panic attack that I am trying to hold it because if she will see it she will tell me that I am just spoiled and can handle anything.

So my(22f) two best friends, Frizz(24m) and Olive(22f) are engaged. They have been together for 5 years, live together, and have a cat. They were just the matron of honor and best man in my husband(24m) and I’s wedding this spring. Frizz and my husband have been friends since diapers and Olive and I met in the fifth grade. A few days ago we found out something and it’s eating me alive. 

The night before the wedding, my husband and I had a ton of people at our house, bridal party and friends and family. When we were ready to go to sleep, the bridesmaids and I were sleeping at my sister’s house, and my husband and his boys stayed at our house. 

My husband told me later, after our wedding and honeymoon, that when they were all getting ready for bed, Frizz decided to leave and go sleep at his house. Frizz and Olive live 2 minutes down the road, so it wasn’t a big deal but my husband was still weirded out and disappointed that he was leaving. 

What my husband didn’t put together was he was leaving at the same time as our friend, Sam(24m).

Sam was at our place a few days ago and told us that at my house the night before our wedding, Frizz kept texting him and asking him to stay the night with the guys at my house. Sam said no, he felt weird because it would be all the groomsmen and him and he didn’t want to step on anyone’s toes. So when Sam left, Frizz was right behind him. Frizz asked Sam to come over to his house, and Sam said yeah sure.

Now’s probably the time for context; Frizz and Olive are both bisexual and open to poly relationships TOGETHER. The two have been with other people multiple times and it’s all chill. (Olive and I are the type of BFFs who tell each other everything, so it’s not too wild that I know this). But they’re NOT in an open relationship independently.

Sam and Frizz when back to Frizz’s and the two of them got tipsy and screwed around. And Olive was with me and the gals at my sister’s house. And Olive has very strict boundaries for this type of stuff, so the fact that she seemed so unbothered and happy that night makes me think she might not know.

Biological father is now severely disabled, cannot speak, cannot move etc. the biological fathers family are evil and are not allowed any contact with the child.

This is not a positive person to be in the child’s life and his family are not positive people either.

Okay so this is about my current boyfriend, but to make this understandable I will start a bit before I got together with him. 

In 2019 I meet my ex-boyfriend, this relationship broke of in early 2022. I had had many issues with him, but the top ones being him acting controlling and really negatively sett towards my friends. The reason this relationship broke of though, was because in summer 2021 my mother got really sick, so meeting up was hard. I should mention that I live in Germany while my ex lived in England. The way he treated me and acted when my mother got sick and I needed more time with my family is ultimately what ruined that relationship. Anyways it was while I was together with my ex I meet my current boyfriend. 
My current boyfriend, let’s call him jack, did at one point tell me he was interested. I did of course shut him down, since I at the time was really happy in my relationship with my ex. But when all of my issues with my ex became to much, and I started falling more and more out of love with him, I started seeing jack in a different light. I would never cheat on anyone, but there were feeling that started to develop while I was still in a relationship. When I in the end broke up with my ex, it really didn’t take long for me and jack to get together.

Now I am having some real issues feeling the way I used to about jack. I care a lot about jack, I did so even before we got together. I have had many issues with my relationship with him. First of he lives in The US, so it’s really difficult to meet up with him. I have only done that once, and at the moment neither of us is in a position where we can tell when next we will meet. Second is we argue a lot, I have issues that I bring up and he always promises to work on them, but he never actually does. I know he cares about me, he does a lot of things different for me than he would for others, but it feels for me that how he treats me is more like a close friend.

A few weeks ago I went to a concert with a group of friends, obviously jack wasn’t there since he lives to far away. But I had a lot of fun, and realised that I would like to do stuff like that more often. But the first thing that crossed my mind was that I can’t do stuff like this since I need to save money so I can hang out with jack. That thought made me really sad. I feel like I might have rushed into things with jack, I worry that I with everything that was going on with my mother and my ex ran towards someone I cared about and started something I don’t actually want. Before me and jack got together, when he told me he liked me, I remember talking to a friend about it after. What I had said at the time was something like “I don’t know what to do, I don’t think that even if I was single getting together with jack would be a good idea. He isn’t exactly my type and we fight a lot” 
On the other hand though, when I meet up with jack we did have a lot of fun together.

I hope you can help me with my inner conflict :) 

Me (32f) and my bf (37) are together for 6 months now. I had a very healthy relationship of 7 years before and ended it because there was no love, only friendship left, but my last ex (3 years) was quite toxic (tbh, I'm afraid i was just as bad for him as he was for me)

My current bf is wonderful - caring, loving, sweet and also very independent - I guess one might call him alpha in the best sense of the word. He is not afraid to make himself vulnerable, he cares deeply about me and he also mentioned a few times that he likes my independence. He always mentions how important good communication is and how he wants to be with me forever (honeymoon olé). Nonetheless, he has enough experience with women (mostly long relationships) to act very laid-back and relaxed, which makes me feel safe around him. Moreover, he is so fucking attractive and used to women's attention that he was a bit irritated at the beginning as I would not try to get him into a relationship.

Our only conflict until now was a situation where he did not inform me about his plans on Sunday (we see each other only about 1-2 days of the weekend, but he badly wants me to move in) and, as a consequence, I demanded to sleep alone that evening. He was very bothered and the next day I told him that it would have been nice to communicate his plans to me since I was surprised, but in a bad way (is there an English word for this? :). He agreed, explained himself, apologized and all was fine. This might be important later.

I have to add that I've always been a bit afraid of being clingy, so I hold myself back and actually every guy I've been with told me that sometimes I come off as rather cold, mainly when it comes to initiate texting or asking for dates (I rarely do both of them, but always show and tell him that I am very happy to see/hear him). the rest of the time I am quite sweet and cuddly :) I also really love to surprise him (be it culinaric, make little gifts or in a NSFW-way) and always show him compassion/interest etc. when it comes to personal topics.  

Finally, the current situation (hope my monster paragraphs did not shock u):

\- usually, we see each other on Friday evening and Sat evening + Sunday (depends on our work schedule). This Sunday, I am busy with other things, which I told him last weekend. 

\- Yesterday he texted me a bunch of kiss-emoijs + ILY, to which I responded in the same way. End of conversation. As far as I know him, he'll call me about 8 today (Sat) and asks when he should pick me up.

I am not sure whether this is 

\- a normal development in a relationship (as u might guess, in the beginning he sent me love-paragraphs, made sure that we could see each other etc;) or

\- a potential red flag since the new relationship energy is wearing off and he takes me for granted or

\- him falling out of love or

\- waaaay too many complicated thoughts in my head :)

I am very afraid of ending in another toxic rs where I try to find explanations for a behaviour that I simply should not accept so I would be very happy to hear your opinions.

PS: Sure, I could talk to him. But he knows the issue and I do not really bother having to tell someone multiple times that an aspect of their behaviour makes me feel uncomfortable. (While I am writing this, a little voice in my head is asking whether my uncomfortableness is an issue that only has to do with myself and therefore should not be his responsibility. You see, I'm confused as f\*\*k)

I've been 7 years in relationship with a guy. We were often in long distance. Those 7 years were good, nothing to complain about until 6 months before breakup, when I found out he was looking for women for fun. He pretended that it wasn't true and then since that time we spent less time together (he was constantly busy). After 6 months he just disappeared and then when he came back, he broke up with me and told me he had other girlfriend for months. He tried to have regular contact with me for 4 years after breakup, even if I was avoiding him, he tried to contact me again. For those 4 years I rarely let him talk to me because he was usually trying to convince me for fun, he tried to be friendly but then he was constantly lying (that's when you realise he changed his versions of relationship with other girlfriend and other things!), and it ended up he was aggressive to me (with words). Exactly 2 years ago he got married, and this year he got divorced. He still tries to talk to me, explain everything, that he was confused and unsure if I wanted him for real, even if I always reassured him about it. He also told me that he had other women between relationship with me and her. Seems he maybe cheated on her? For those 4 years I never met anyone to be with. What you guys think about that? I have thoughts that he might be just manipulating me again. Lot of things are unexplained by him, he's not willing to tell me truth. He wanted to meet me and explain everything but I feel unsure. I'm worried about feelings come back to me, on the other hand I only want the truth. I think I deserve it. Even if I'm alone for 4 years, I probably would prefer being alone than with someone who might be not serious about me and do the same thing he did to me in past (cheating, aggression).

And so far everything has been absolutely great . I was super happy and pretty much in love with him, as was he with me. However I woke up this morning to a random DM on Instagram from a girl saying I shouldn’t trust my boyfriend and that he is a serial cheater that used her. She sent me proof that they were dating and text messages but these were all dated from a month before we met. 

She is also adamant that there was an overlap between her and him breaking up and me and him dating. She took a screenshot of her call history between them on the phone to each other at the beginning of our relationship saying they were having emotional conversations about getting back together but said that’s the only proof she has currently. I comment a lot on my boyfriends posts so I guess she may have stalked him to find me? 

I confronted him who accused her of lying, first he said he didn’t know who she was. Then he said he vaguely remembers her but that they were merely a fling that only met a few times. I am starting to panic because I seem to have terrible luck when it comes to dating (see my previous history… sigh) and I tend to trust too easily. He says she’s just bitter because he ended their casual fling. 

Then he said she only has proof they spoke on the phone after me and his relationship started because he was telling her to leave him alone and that she is crazy (but there’s at least 4 separate convos one more than 10 mins long!) Then he admitted they had a heart to heart where he apologised for how he treated her but that was it. 

He said he didn’t want me to worry or get put off by him because of a crazy ex fling which is why he didn’t tell me at the time, and just blocked her after. She is begging me not to block her on Instagram and saying she’s gonna find more proof. He has told me to block her if trust him and want us to work.

So I spend 5 days every week in the office, and come home late, so I don't have time for my hobbies, no time to hang out with friends, and of course no time to hang out with her. In contrast, she is busy only 2 days a week, and the other days she is free.

So this means that my only free days of the week are saturday and sunday.

There are a lot of important people that i love in my life, like relatives, friends, and her, so the weekend is the only time i can workout for a couple of hours and see these important people.

I usually see only her on these two days, but sometimes I also see these other people in the morning or the evening, and when I do, I only spend with her a full day, and an afternoon, which to me seems like a lot of time, but she gets so insanely mad, and starts thinking that I'm an asshole, and that I don't want to see her, when the only thing I'm trying to do is spend time with the people I love.

It hurts a lot when she does this, I've been trying my absolute hardest to be, although not perfect, a good boyfriend, and she treats me like I'm the biggest jerk on the planet.

I honestly don't know what to do, I just want to make her happy, but it seems that I'm failing. 

I don't want to hurt her, and I dont want her to hurt me either... and I also don't want to give up on all my friends and connections that I have with other people to fully dedicate time to her, it doesn't seem fair.

And since I don't want to hurt her, I've been thinking that maybe she deserves someone else, that can give her the attention she needs, instead of me, but just thinking about this hurts.

He is very calm and  peaceful and kind, I am more artistic, curious, clumsy, people say unusual and often exploding of energy and quirkiness. We are both introverts and passionate and hardworking :) I am F26 European in process of becoming a professional and he (34y/o) is already one and is from Korea. I was diagnosed with aspergers some time ago- I didn't get the chance to say this yet and don't want to make it a big deal either.

We met every day this week and we seem to really enjoy it. We hold hands and kiss. 

He so far seems to have the characteristics I could potentially love a lot, which I find quite scary at this moment. Yes it is scary to see so much potential. Exciting too.  And so yesterday, we had the following conversation-

He asked me if I think our energies levels are ok long-term because I do so many things and said that he might not be able to cope up with my life (e.g. i have social meetings in the evenings sometimes and a lot of activities). He said he is a simple man and needs to get enough sleep in the evenings to work well. I replied with something like: we cannot know if we don't try and that my tempo will slow down a bit after a formation and that I don't think we have to do all things together (e.g. he said he needs rest after work and cannot do gym like me but prefers to do later etc. (i don't know why he said this because i thought we do this separate and so i told). I said his calm nature is what I prefer/like  and aim towards in my partner and he was very pleased with the answer. I told him i was very hurt recently and he told me he wont break my heart which came off very genuine and it probably is! =D

He told me if I have anything to say about anything about us or not knowing in the future I can of course ask him and I said i will think about it. I have questions I cannot say but I do feel confused inside a lot, since I have trouble putting it in words but.. i want to keep myself safe and calm you know? I would love to spend time with him and be his girlfriend (not even sure he wants this at this point?). So what im asking is.. what matters to ask? How to understand this inside and ask right questions, or, how to go about this?

Now that this has worn off a bit (and I act like I am in love around him because I am overflown by feelings for him) i wonder whether he wanted to let me go or what this is.

Alright, so this is a different guy, not the owner of the account.
(He's allowed me to post this since my family knows about my other account.)

We're a normal Indian family, and my dad has done fucking everything he can do to keep us safe and comfortable in this life. He's gone to hell to keep us comfortable, and it hurts me that my mom is taking advantage of the situation.

About a half year ago when we were returning from abroad, I was sitting in the terminal when my mum went to the toilet. I already knew something was fishy when I saw the number of our AC mechanic in here frequently contacted section in WhatsApp when I was sharing a pic with my dad.

Conveniently enough, the guy has set disappearing msgs but the ones my mum had sent recently were there. The guy has spoken in a ""way too friendly"" manner, and my mum was responding in the same way. He was asking, ""How's the kid and your mother?"", and I was fucking shocked to find a stranger calling me his kid.

I took photos and then wiped evidence of me finding this chat.

Fast forward half a year later to now, I've been seeing more proof, like the guy's address in her Notes app and more texts, though none were sexual.

And a few minutes before this post, she was speaking very quietly on the phone, and when I asked who it was, she did everything but show her phone, and when I asked her to convey a message to the person (the "" person"" she was talking to was apparently her friend, and a mother of my friend.), which was not rude at all, but she acted like it was. 

Please advise, my dad would be reduced to the point of self harm if he heard about this and I really love my dad.

Anyway, tradie friend, TF, attempted to kiss me about a year ago. I panicked, backed away, and didn't speak to him for months. I thought he had got the picture. We got back on speaking terms and he helped with a few jobs again. Recently he's made a couple of innuendos in his messages which initially I ignored then shut down. 
Thing is, I don't have many friends. And if it's just banter then that's fine, I make those kind of jokes with other friends - male/female/coupled up et al.

 If it's more than that then I just can't, for multiple reasons, including his poor wife (I don't know her at all). I guess I'm asking, if it's possible he is just being a friend because he wants more?  So no matter what I'm going to lose a friend?

my partner and I have been together for 11 years. During those years, many things happened and officially, we are really only a couple by name. We bought a house together, and we live together but there is no more intimacy or anything. Basically, we are roommates that look like a couple to the outside world. I would have liked to have it another way but honestly, because of practical reasons we keep it that way. He says he loves me, but I don't. Usually, we get along pretty well. We do things together and go out together. 

However, there is one situation that always makes us stumble. Whenever there is alcohol involved, there is some danger that things might get explosive. He loves to drink alcohol and would drink beers all day long if he could, but luckily generally doesn't. When we go out, I usually urge him to drink slowly because it's incredibly embarrassing when he's drunk. He makes a complete ass out of himself (falling over, getting clingy to people who don't want any of that, keeps telling the same story over and over and generally just being a pain in the ass) or finds ways to hurt himself. I get very on edge when he drinks a lot, so I keep asking him to slow down. But he keeps saying things like ""But I'm not drinking that much, I just had a water!"" or ""I'm not planning to get drunk tonight, don't worry!"" and basically keeps telling me to stop whining, while he keeps drinking. 

Yesterday, we visited a beer festival with friends (yeah, I don't know why I believed it would work out... I like tasting beers and wanted to see our friends, so I went). I was a little sceptical at first because he was downing vitamin water drinks and cooked lunch with ingredients ""that should help against the alcohol"", such as asparagus, which supposedly protects the liver. Things like that. I told him I was worried about how he was preparing himself to be drunk. He told me not to be worried and said he had to work the day after. He just wanted to prepare a good meal and have a good time. 

Later that afternoon we arrive at the festival. Another reason why I'm a dumb shit: the festival has an entrance fee and you can drink as much as you like, it's all included. It starts at 3pm, by 5pm, he'd been tasting many beers and was starting to sound drunk. I tell him he sounds like he's getting drunk, urge him to slow down, have some water. For the first time ever, he says: ""You are right, I'll slow down"". I was pretty amazed, calmed myself down, believed things would be alright. However, anytime I looked at him, he had another beer in his hand. He continues drinking. I have a pretty big issue with anxiety. I am usually very anxious but more so in busy environments, and when I feel problems with him coming on. My anxiety starts going through the roof and I plead with him to stop drinking, he starts to argue with me. Says he's not drunk at all, says he said he would slow down and he did, says I'm the problem because I drink too much and get worked up. Anxiety goes up another level. I can't deal with it anymore. I am in a crowded room, in an argument that doesn't go anywhere. It's always him defending himself, trying to make me look like the nagging wife because he just wants to have a beer in peace. I feel it's going to go badly. I get overwhelmed, with the crowd, with the issue at hand. My way of dealing with that probably isn't the best way but I need to calm down, need to remove myself from the situation. I run off. This is where it completely goes to shit. He keeps running after me, keeps asking me why I make a big deal out of him having a beer. I can't handle the discussion because I know it will lead nowhere. But, he keeps coming after me and won't leave me alone. Won't let me calm down. Whenever he catches up to me, he keeps ranting about how I'm the one who's drunk (I'd had maybe half a glass), and how I always make a big issue out of nothing. I beg him to stop, beg him to go back to our friends, beg him to leave me alone and let me calm down. He says he doesn't want to leave me alone, because he loves me. He wants to make sure I'll be OK so he will stay with me. But the discussion continues. This is where I completely lose it. We are in the middle of the street, I start shouting at him, telling him to fuck off and leave me alone. But he keeps following me. People in the street at staring at us but I just need him to leave me alone. I feel anger boiling up inside me and I feel myself boiling over. I absolutely need some time to cool off and gather my thoughts, I need time to calm down but I am not getting it. I just keep shouting at him to leave me alone, people in the street staring at me and no one helps... At these times, I wish someone would tell him to back off, but no one does. I will shamefully admit that in the past, I have reacted to this situation in a shameful way: I would hit him out of pure anger, out of pure rage. I don't want that to happen but when I see red, my anger gets the best of me. That's why I need to remove myself, why I need to be able to breathe and cool down. 

I was so close yesterday to hitting him but I didn't. Is it sad to say that makes me proud? I don't want to be the kind of person who hits others... That is not who I am. I never act that way around anyone, except for him when he tortures me like that.. Instead, I ran. He ran after me, but since he wasn't all that clear in the head, I ran round some corners and hid in a building and finally got away from him. 
Finally, relief. I stood and stared, not really knowing what to do.
I walked through the city for an hour, calmed down and met up with him again to go home (he didn't go back to the beer festival either, thankfully). We don't talk about it again because that would just rekindle the argument. He says he doesn't drink too much, I don't agree.

One: I know we are bad for eachother and should break up. But we can't. So lets get that out of the way.

During this time, 2 have been spent actually living together and 3 (ongoing) have been spent long distance as I am in grad school some 900 miles away. 

Ultimately, in the early stages of our relationship my girlfriend admitted to emotionally cheating with her ex and it took a good 1.5-2 months before we finally got to a good place (idk why I stuck with it but that’s usually how I am). Anyway, things are good for awhile and then we go long distance. Occasionally she flies to me and then I also go back home. But while distanced her roommate who became recently single decided to have some friends from HS over to their apartment. One of these people is my GF ex (not the one she was emotionally cheating with) and typically my GF has this huge act of being livid at this dudes presence. But this time she decided to hang out with them all and then gaslighted me about being toxic for saying she pulled a 180 in the way she acted. I felt it was disrespectful to display one thing, then do another despite knowing my feelings after battling like hell over similar circumstances at the beginning of the relationship.

Overall, I felt disrespected because she harps on me like crazy for having to work with another woman (I don’t find her attractive/wouldn’t consider risking my position anyway). I’m too old for this stuff and it’s extremely taxing on my mental health to feel like I can’t work without there being a problem.

Posting this on a throwaway account.

I spent this Halloween visiting a bunch of friends I lived a good distance from, they were some of the closest friends I had and some of the few I felt comfortable starting to open up to emotionally. One of them specifically I was really looking forward to seeing, since a month prior she asked me if I wanted to go on a date while I was there with them.

Overall the trip went well, the weekend after Halloween some of us went up to Dollywood in Tennessee to spend the Saturday before I went home. 

While we were there we briefly split up, as some of us wanted to check out the fair area while a few of us wanted to ride the eagle for a second time. While we split up there was a miscommunication of tone over text, which upset the fair area group a bit, and fucked with my anxiety.

For context, that morning I was already dealing with some anxiety regarding the date we went on, the two of us had very different ways of communicating our emotions and that caused me to worry she was having second thoughts or was more or less indifferent to my being there, despite what she’d said to me before I arrived.

I talked with one of my friends about it, and she was able to talk me through it and was able to help me calm my nerves a bit, almost immediately after this we decided to go back up to the bird show area where they had gone to talk with them about the miscommunication and disagreement. At this point I wasn’t really upset about the disagreement and was more Just in the process of settling my nerves and hoping everything would get resolved

We met up with them, and my friend, both on my request and her own initiative, saying she was going to anyway, took the lead in the conversation. She’s a very direct and confrontational person so she was the better choice for communicating this.

I didn’t really speak up during the conversation except for two notable points. I mentioned that the miscommunication (the friend I went on a date on, let’s call her E, said she’d rather go on the eagle 3 times than do one of the less intense rides a single time) was mostly caused by being said over text and not in person, I later on tried to find middle ground between the two groups and said “hey there are also other things we can do together while we’re here” which seemed generally agreed by everyone and helped wrap up the conversation

We wound up splitting off a second time since the more confrontational friend (let’s call her N) felt like the conversation wasn’t very productive, and that E had more or less said “you’re wrong, we’re not, sorry” which even I somewhat agreed with at the time, and was one of the reasons I tried to find middle ground. She turned to me as we were leaving and noted she felt like I had taken E’s side there, which I apologized for and clarified that I was just trying to find middle ground and resolve the issue for everyone.

After we split up again, two groups of 4, the argument picked back up over Snapchat as N was still upset, by this point I was more or less fine with everything and wasn’t upset, and I even said to them “hey the miscommunication fucked with my anxiety a bit, but I’m good now, I’m not upset”

N’s girlfriend suggested we meet up for dippin’ dots near one of the rides, mostly to settle the issue and move on, two of the 4 in the group I was in, being me and one of the others, agreed and split off to meet back up with group 1.

We got there, talked about the situation and how things escalated to this point so fast, and then went back to find N and the other friend and resolve everything.

The conversation wound up being really productive and the whole issue seemed over. We were all fine for the rest of the day.

I drove back home on Sunday, by this point we were all pretty socially drained so we didn’t really talk much for a couple of days, which worried me at first but I just reminded myself that if I was tired, they probably were too.

Now comes Tuesday, I’ve been home for about 2 days now and I get a message from E stating N and her felt like I just let N take the brunt of the argument, and understated how upset I was In a way that made N feel manipulated and used. They said I should’ve communicated I wasn’t super upset and that it just fucked with my anxiety, rather than staying quiet outside for speaking only twice.

Looking back I completely understand how that comes across as being manipulative, so I tried to apologize to them, explain that it wasn’t my intention to let N take the full weight of the argument, and try to resolve everything. 

First I responded to E’s message, then I sent a message to N’s girlfriend, and then N almost right after.

After I messaged N I got a message from her girlfriend that she appreciated the apology, but that I shouldn’t say anything to N just yet by this point I’d *already* done that, and was already feeling pretty stressed and panicked, so I made the stupid decision of deleting the message I sent to N, figuring I’d just send it again later at a better time.

This did not go well.

She completely blew up at me, saying I was a manipulative, lying piece of shit. That I was pretending to be someone I’m not, that I used her for my own gains. And generally just that I’m a shitty person overall that she no longer respected.

At this point, I figured I needed to make absolutely sure my understanding of events was as clear as it could be, so I wrote down an organized detailing of events, only writing what I was ABSOLUTELY sure happened. I sent this to E, in hopes it would help clarify where I was coming from.

I wake up the next morning and get a message from E stating that her, N, and all of the others felt they no longer wanted to associate with me, saying I “casually lied to them” and that what I intended to do doesn’t matter.

All of this because I didn’t chime in during the conversation and say “hey just for the record my biggest issue in this whole thing was anxiety I’m mostly good” like 10 minutes earlier than I did.

It baffles me because not only do these people know me, know about my anxiety issues, and have been nothing but understanding about it up until now. But also that they go out of their way to look at everything I said in the worst light they could, assuming the worst when the truth is so much simpler than that.

E also said they couldn’t trust my apologies were genuine remorse and not just me trying to make them not upset anymore, but the way I see it, isn’t the goal of a genuine apology to own up to what you did wrong, with the goal of resolving the argument and making things right? Should the best result of an apology not be the one where nobody is upset anymore?

It feels like they just didn’t want me around anymore so they found a good reason to justify blindsiding me.

I saw that it's because of vaginismus which is caused by fear or anxiety on sex. Me and my BF's first time is when it first happened. We did it in a motel and I had fear of hidden cameras so I tensed up during sex which made it painful. Our next times were also done in a motel so I started associating painful sex with motels and, in the end, started associating pain with my partner. My anxiety grew bigger and bigger and the pain and anxiety got worse each time.

We started doing it in my apartment because I thought the motel is the reason but now, instead of fear of hidden cameras, I have fear of sex in general. I tense up and feel extreme pain even with one finger. It's really affecting my confidence and our relationship.

I’ve written down some points to flush out why I feel I need to end things. Would be good to get some feedback or to see if anything sounds too harsh as I don’t want to make this more painful than it already is.

I’ve message her to say we need to have a convo about our relationship and how I’m feeling, she’s an intelligent person so will know what’s coming when we meet.

My reasons:

It’s clear to me you have way stronger feelings than I do.
I feel like I should be feeling more than I do at this point. It makes me feel guilty after we see each other. Almost like I’m unintentionally leading you on. It’s not like I don’t want these feelings to develop, I’ve been giving it time but it’s just not happening for me and the longer it goes on the more unfair it is too you. 

(Unsure about this bit)* When it feels off when we kiss I think it’s gone too far now and I don’t see the feelings I have for you developing further.
-
I remember when we first started seeing each other, I said to not put too much thought to us*(can add context for you guys if needed)*I think now that was a shit idea, it was a mistake for me to do that. When I do put thought to it, I feel like we want different things in the long run. I was honest with you about going back and forth about like wanting children n all that but I see that’s such an important thing for you and it just may not be for me. 
-
I think you deserve someone better, someone that can actually support you when you having a rough time at work and all that.. I’m just not that person, I’m not emotional enough and have to much on my late at work to deal with it n support you in that way. You should be with someone that can. * (This feels horrible to say but I should be honest right??)

I’ve lost 75 pounds since she was born but it’s still a long process for me to try and get even close to my pre pregnancy body. I thought I had learned to embrace my new p.p body but after this I feel so insecure.
My bf and I were sitting at the park talking about random stuff. I can’t remember how exactly we got onto the body conversation, but he ended up telling me that he’s actually someone who prefers big scrumpdiddilydumptious bootays (not his exact words) and then he told me that my butt is really weird. I am someone who is a bit top heavy and I don’t exactly have the biggest dumpy back there. I used to be really into weightlifting and had built it up some but had gotten depressed so I gained a lot of weight. (This was before we got together) After gaining weight I don’t have much of an arch in my back but the middle and bottom of my butt is pretty full so it kind of looks like a j from the side. However I had accepted that and have been working on it for my own self confidence and my bf always hyped me up and never made comments about my body so I wasn’t too worried about him not being attracted to me. After that comment, now I’m starting to be really insecure about it. After that comment he’s also started to comment on my P.P body when he never did before and it’s really making the little bit of self esteem I worked up these past three months take a nose dive. He never says anything good about my body, it’s always about how dark my areolas got after having the baby or how my stomach is full of stretch marks and feels like play do. 
I know I shouldn’t be basing my self esteem on what someone else thinks but it’s really affecting me and he doesn’t understand why. He says that if I commented on his body it wouldn’t hurt his feelings so he doesn’t understand why it’s hurting mine. How do I explain to him that making comments like that especially after my body has changed so much after the baby hurts me? I tend to ramble and not explain things clearly so it’s really hard for me to get my point across clearly.

My gf and I have been together for 8 years. Generally speaking, we both agree that our relationship was mostly happy throughout this time. Occasionally we talked about the idea of opening up our relationship but never fully agreed on this. Thus, our mutual consent was that we are/were not living in an open relationship.

She was very unhappy about her job status for the last 3 years or so. Her salary was bad and she was extremely anxious that she would never find a good job. A couple of months ago change came about. She found a new job that she liked with a much higher salary. Soon after, her behavior started to change a lot. She was extremely occupied with her work, going to company events, on business trips and neglecting her normal interests. It was a bit like a switch was flipped and she was extroverted instead of shy. Also I had the feeling that she became more distant towards me.

Two months ago, she said she had to go on another business trip overnight. I was growing skeptical and told her, that the details she was giving me do not add up. Nonetheless, she went there and told me on the next day that she was having an affair with her colleague/manager over the previous ~2 months. That hit me hard. I'll spare you the details. She is terribly sorry about everything that happened. I do have access to all her devices and she is not going to any business events anymore. Of course, she broke it off with her affair right away but they still have contact through work on a daily basis. They don't work in the same city, so the contact is only remotely. It is possible that she will switch roles in the company within the next couple of months so that she won't have to work with him anymore but for me that work situation - as it is now - is unbearable. Leaving this job altogether is not really an option to her. Obviously, I considered leaving our relationship, yet we both decided to work it through. There are good days and bad days. What has happened is a heavy burden. However, our outlook is mostly positive. I realize that working through this issue, trusting her again and forgiving her will take a long time.

However, I'm not sure how I should feel about her colleague and his wife. The guy is a liar and I'm 99% sure he did not tell her. I have a lot of confidential information on his wife. Stuff that he told my girlfriend. Also, through my gf's devices I theoretically have tons of proof that he had cheated. Should I tell his wife? I mean after all, she has a right to know that she is potentially wasting her life. Morally I'd say it's the right thing to do. How would you go about this? I have found several email addresses of her and social media profiles. My girlfriend thinks it's a bad idea. Still, she said she can't stop me if I wanted to do this. For me, I'm not afraid of any form of retaliation from him. The guy is a slob. Unfortunately, it is possible that there will be consequences for my gf's job.

The break up dragged over a couple of months and was definitely very tough on both of us. 

Fast forward to now and I am finally in a better place where I feel ready to date and let people be closer in my life after a couple of summer flings...

I travel a lot for work and recently I met two different girls in different cities when I was working ( long haul flight distance away). I'll call one girl RE(27) the other SP(30). 
I met RE first on an app and we hit it off over two dates, we texted a lot and then saw each other again three weeks later when we happened to cross paths in a different city. We spent some days together then and once again had a great time and she invited me to stay with her when I had a week off, four weeks later. 

I met SP between the two times I met RE in a bar. We once again got on really well and immediately hit it off. We have more in common in terms of music taste etc..after two days together in her city we crossed paths again a few weeks later in another country and spent another four terrific days together. 

I went and spent my week off with RE and it was a really amazing time. She showed me her local area, I met her friends and her sister and we travelled to other locations as she had taken the week off to hang out with me. We spent the week being incredibly couple like and it was immediately very comfortable with her. RE came out of a long distance relationship 2 years ago and has said that she currently is not in a space where she would be able to have a dedicated long distance relationship however she said that she would like to continue to see me whenever we can and that her door is always open to come and stay with her. Leading to invite me to stay with her for a month throughout January. 

Over the time that has passed I've stayed in close contact with SP and she has invited me to stay with her in the time off I have leading up to Christmas and I'm going to take her up on the offer. 

I guess I'm really looking for advice on what I should do after Christmas? SP has said that she likes me a lot and would want to be in an exclusive relationship, which is the kind of relationship I think I would prefer.  I felt like me and RE were however a really great match and we were both very sad when it came time for me to leave. 
My heart is telling me that I should go back to RE in January and spend the month and see if anything changes between us in that she would want a more serious relationship together. My head is telling me I should put more energy into SP rather than RE. Pinning my hopes on RE changing their mind after we spend a month together seems  like it would be a foolish decision when I can tell already that after a month with her I'm almost certainly going to become very attached and probably end up upsetting myself.

Due to the nature of my work I'm almost only ever going to be in long distance relationships, for the foreseeable future anyway.

I recently moved into my first apartment with my teenage sister after getting her out of an abusive household. Originally I was supposed to be roommates with my friend and my sister was going to move in too but a few weeks before I found my apartment my friend told me she didn’t want to move in together because we traumatize each other. Now I disagree with the traumatize part because I didn’t cause the trauma we are survivors of a mass shooting and I didn’t walk in the building with a gun. One day we got into an argument and I said I don’t think we should be friend anymore and I apologized and I truly did not mean it but I know it hurt her. I have abandonment issues and not long after the shooting another “friend” blocked me and I have this fear that it will happen again and honestly I’m still hurt by the way that friendship ended.  Now after I said what I said we made up but not really and we got into another argument  recently where she told me i didn’t care about her and I’m selfish because I couldn’t keep the cats. Now I have to explain the cat situation, she and her ex rescued 2 girl kittens and a boy kitten, and we each got a cat and the boy is mine. A few months after we got the cats she told me her ex is abusive and she has made comments about being scared he’ll hit her, but at the same time she gives him rides and spends time with him like they’re buddies then also told me she’s thinking about moving in with him and was annoyed when I kept stressing how that makes no sense and it’s not okay. The cats were living with me since my friend and her ex don’t have a place yet. I want nothing to do with an abuser and refuse to talk to her ex. At first the cat living arrangement was okay but my boy started to try to mate with his sister and it’s hard for me to separate them so I told her I can’t keep them anymore and she said she had a safe place but she wasn’t being honest with me. Fast forward to a few days ago we have another argument and she says I don’t give a fuck about her and I’m a bad friend because I know her living situation and I made her keep the cats and I’m wishy washy because i changed my mind about watching them while she goes out of town for 2 weeks and I changed my mind because I’m not watching a cat when I don’t talk to the owner and trying to separate them will be hard and stress me out. I know I do need to work on some insecurities and past trauma that affect every relationship in my life, but I do care about her and I want to be friend but now we’re not talking and I’m not sure what I can do to make this better and if we’re even friends anymore.

This has come out of left field to me and been very difficult.  The reasons for the breakup are pretty typical (not putting in the effort, not making her feel special, not meeting her emotional/supportive needs).  I've done some soul searching and hit therapy up and I can definitely see my part here and a lot of it stems from some relationship trauma we had a few years back and building walls and not taking them down or adjusting as the relationship environment changed.

I want to show her that I can change, that these things she's asking for are easily solvable with open communication and building a plan to address them.  But....she's not open to that and has essentially closed her heart to me (although there have been moments I see cracks in that position as we co-habitate).  I know I should move on for her sake and mine, but I'm having a real hard time letting go.  I know all I can really do is work on me and it's better that I give her space and not beg, but if I do that I feel like I'm validating her claims that I can't change and meet those needs that were unmet until now and reinforcing the breakup.  

How do I give her space while showing her I still care and can change and want to change but I can't execute without her participation?

This made grandpa mad because she hardly supervised my mom, refused to help her with schoolwork or do anything at all. Because they are divorced, Grandpa drove for hours to see my mom as much as he could. Lack of supervision played a part in my mom's out of control teenage behavior. 

I hardly know my father. My mom got her own place. She was loving and fun but raising me was very hard for her. My Grandpa helped us move closer. The only reason we didn't live with him is because she was a bit irresponsible and hard headed.

When I was 12, I started walking to my Grandparents home. I loved it there. 

First I spent the night. Then a few days. Then a whole summer. My Grandpa asked mom if she would let me come live with them and she agreed. I think she was relieved. 

My life changed. I still saw my mom everyday after work. My grades improved. I can say they doted on me. We had movie nights with popcorn and sheet forts and everything. 

When Grandma Nancy found out I was being bullied ( I have hooded eyes and being fat as a kid, my eyes looked puffy, so they called me Benicio. I was also regularly beaten), she raised up a huge  stink. She created a mess and she made it count. Until then, she took shit from the moms in school because they didn't like her. My Grandma is very pretty and is blessed with a naturally athletic physique. Growing up, my school mates and some of the dads seemed to find her pretty. She was also considerably younger than the average grandma. Added to this, she's black, so some people resented her for her upscale job. She put up with all kinds of shit until I came home with bruises. Grandma Nancy compromised, even her appearance, to avoid ruffling feathers. She stopped wearing jeans and sleeveless shirts because the men at school were shamelessly eyeing her. She never wore anything that showed her legs or skin, and she hardly wore makeup.  Grandpa didn't agree but she said I didn't need the drama.

Grandma Nancy raised such a hell that the school superintendent got involved. She threatened to pull the entire school district down and created a hostile environment for workers working jobs at her company. They left me alone. I don't think they messed with her again, either. 

I went to college and have been in and out of my state of origin. Three years ago, I took a job out of state and have been visiting my folks very regularly. 

I recently got engaged after a 1.5 years together. I love her ( f34) intensely.  She knows everything about me. She knows my family background and everything about my grandparents. 

We never had the chance of creating an in person meeting with my family because of her schedule. It happened 5 months ago and to say it was underwhelming is an understatement. 

For background, my fiancee is a beautiful woman. Background also, my grandma looks considerably younger. That's it. It's that simple. My grandma may be stunning, but she doesn't seek or need attention from anyone. She and grandpa are very happy together.

My fiancee had seen her in pictures before. The energy was amicable when I introduced them on the phone.

The minute we started going out and my grandma visibly attracted attention, my Fiancee's attitude did a 360 degree change. I thought she was just weirded out. Sadly, it went from looking serious to having a sour demeanor. I never said anything until we got back home. After this, our arguments have multiplied. My grandmother is my primary motherly figure. I'm not gonna not see her because my fiancee is uncomfortable.

She exploded during an argument because I made it clear that she's now messing with my family. She's not interested in going to their house for Xmas ( while I'll spend NYE with hers folks). She's gotten very competitive in regards to comparing her own looks to other women. She wanted to get fillers but I said she can do what she wants but I don't find that attractive and I'm afraid they'll mess with her face. My grandma has long hair, so my fiancee went to get extensions. 

Our last argument was particularly painful. She used something very personal that I shared to attack my relationship with my grandparents. 

I told her that when I was about 12-13, my grandpa scolded me for eating an entire bucket of chocolate fudge ( I was a chubby kid).  I was mad and decided to hide from him. I just wanted him to ""feel bad"" if he searched for me and couldn't find me. I went inside the closet at the guest room. Nothing happened. I ended up falling asleep and woke up to my grandparents making out in the bedroom.  they thought I was in my bedroom. All I can remember was my grandpa being in hot water over something and acting really freaky and being really needy towards my grandmother.  I could understand make up sex as an adult, but as kid, it was super embarrassing. They didn't do it all the way but there was some crotch grabbing and other stuff. Now my fiancee is using that against me. I didn't even tell my grandparents. 

I've dated women of different ethnic backgrounds. I did have a couple black and mixed black girlfriends. The first time my fiancee  made a remark was when she said she's sure I dated black women in the past because my grandma got me aroused. For clarification, I've never had any type of disgusting or inappropriate feelings towards my grandmother. The fact that she yelled at me and said ""go lick your Granny's p*ssy"" only because I told her her jealousy is getting out of control and this is monstrously. It hurts so much. I called her trash and I felt instantly horrible afterwards. I feel emotionally weak and shut down from this. She doesn't acknowledge that what she said is in the classification of incest. 

Tbh, nothing out of the ordinary happened between them while we visited. My grandma is my grandma. She may be seen as ""hot"" by other people who like to make a fuzz but I grew up seeing her doing ""mother things"" for me, like wearing frumpy pajamas to match mine and wearing my grandpa's old t-shirts for messy cooking projects.  She never spared hugs and kisses for me and the fact that the woman I wanted to spend a life with is doing this is awfully unkind.

We've never had ex gf issues. I was single four months before we met. This jealousy is painful for me and right now, I'm developing a terrible resentment.

I've decided to end the relationship. It's been too long and I don't think there's any type of counseling that will repair the damage. 

I have zero experience breaking an engagement. I'm petrified. If she said all that she said because she's upset that my grandmother draws too much attention, I don't know how she's gonna react when she learns we are done.

Please, I need advice on this. I wasn't to keep things compassionate and I can surely say what I need to say but I'm concerned about her possible reaction.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7526546,public,self,My Fiancee Shows Horrible Sexual Jealousy Behavior Towards My Grandmother,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yt5itu/my_fiancee_shows_horrible_sexual_jealousy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Me (20) and this girl (19) had a great start. In the first month we saw each other every couple of days and communicated most of the time. We did a lot of stuff and we both really enjoyed the time we spent with each other.

Since almost two weeks she seemed a bit more distant. We didn’t meet up that often anymore, we did not text that often etc.. It seemed like she was losing interest so I asked her what the deal is. She said that she’s still healing from her past relationship and doesn’t wanna get to attached to me therefore things shouldn’t move so fast between us. Another point was that she has a lot of stuff to do because of college and because she’s moving at the end of the month.

At this point we haven’t met up for some weeks now and we barely communicate with each other. I really like her and would love to spend more time with her but I don’t know if all this is worth it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7526536,public,self,She says she’s still healing from her past relationship.

We have always had our own issues with the relationship at times but have always managed to get through them but lately I have just felt really drained by our relationship. 

For the past few months I’ve felt like she doesn’t listen to me, we keep getting into arguments over everything it seems, she gets mad at me over little things and then will get upset and throws a tantrum over it and lastly our sex life has just not been the best for me. 

We also have very busy schedules that conflict with each other. I’m the one who always has to arrange everything, pick her up, plan the day etc and it’s all just becoming a lot. 

I remember a time when she was the one person who could make me feel better and I could talk to her about anything but now I feel like she’s the biggest cause of stress in my life. 

It’s not all on her I could definitely improve as well and there’s things she probably feels the same about but due to these circumstances I’ve really been thinking about breaking up with her because I don’t feel the way I used to and don’t think I’ll ever get what I want/need from the relationship.  

I still love her though and want to do everything to make it work, I was planning on asking her for a break so we can both have some time and space but have heard that breaks can often make things worse.
