I’m just gonna jump straight into this. I (19F) have been dating (19M) for about 6 months now. Our relationship has always been a bit rocky since I’m very introverted and he’s pretty much the opposite. He has always known that I enjoy my time alone, and have always appreciated it. It was fine until late last month. he started being noisy about where I always am, who I’m with, what am I doing, and why, every hour with my phone blowing up. Hanging out with a friend? “You could’ve been hanging out with me”. Yes, I do hang out with him at least once a week or even twice. But it has been so frequent that I can’t keep up. I get tired of socializing with people for a while. He started texting my best friend (21F) He always comes to her when there’s an issue, or he just wants to speak badly about me I guess. My bestie has always told him to either end it or talk about it but he refuses to do so. Wait did I mention that he has a folder of me denying to hang out with him with screenshots on why I can’t / or don't want to? My Bestie told me about this and has seen it. Why the heck have a folder of me denying why I don’t want to hang out or can’t? This is so ridiculous to me and I simply don’t even know how to feel anymore. He has even denied or gotten mad at me when I have plans with friends (he’s always welcome to tag along). I got notice of this so-called folder just 2 nights ago. It feels like I can’t even say no anymore. I’m sad and angry at all of this. Feels like all of my boundaries have been over-crossed at once. He has told my bestie that he plans to use it against me someday, or just shove it in my face just to prove “it’s not fair”. he thinks he’s being treated as a best friend cause I don’t do x, y, and z, I can’t hang out with people 24/7 I can’t speak to someone 24/7, and sometimes I even need different interactions. He said, “I am all you need for social interaction”. I’ve made this clear numerous times that I like being alone, and sometimes I just don’t want to hang out or perhaps want to hang out with friends. It makes me angry knowing there’s a folder with my excuses. I simply don’t even know what to do anymore. There are so many feelings I’m feeling right now. Whenever I see a text from him, I get reminded of the folder.

Ok so let me try my best to explain.

I would never consider myself gay or even bi.

Up until recently I wouldnt really see myself being with a guy unless there really was a connection.

That was until I met a boy named Cal at my school, he was really sweet to me every time we saw each other, but I never really viewed him as a dating partner until recently.

I could tell he was gay ever since I met him, he has a deep lisp, and accent that most people would assosiate with homosexuals.

It all started around October when he started coming to school in feminen looking clothing and wearing lots of makeup.

The thing was he didnt look like a guy dressing up as a girl, he looked like a hot blond headed cheerleader. When he started dressing like that I actually noticed that I started getting attracted to him. I was already interested in being his friend since we had a lot in common and acted alike.

So one day I went up to him and asked him for his number, he simply asked me (are you interested in me), to which I responded (yeah kinda), he said before he gives me the number he wants a more direct answer, but I looked over my shoulder and told him that other people were in the hallway.

After I walked to the bus, I immediately heard kids calling me gay, the f slur, and many other things on the bus.

Apparently the boy I asked out is not very popular at school either and if I go through with this my popularity will probably be lowered to his level.

I think the title doesn't really explain the situation, but I'll try to explain it. I like this guy, a match from Bumble. Agreed to FWB kind of relationship because he and I both were coming of romantic relationships and felt like that was the way to go. The difference is, I was sure of the break up with my ex boyfriend but he was in this ""let's take some time and space to work on ourselves and then try again"" with a friend of his. They never made it official though. 
And all of that was fine, until he started texting everyday, introduced me to his friends, made love and kissed like a BF would, and it confused the hell out of me. I broke the FWB relationship because I saw him texting his friend the morning after I slept over one time, and it hit me, I started liking him a lot but he's still waiting to get back to her. It just didn't have a future, at all. It would never evolve from there.
I guess I just don't understand why some people seem to think like they can't work on themselves while being with the other person. Or even like, if someone comes into your life and likes you for the person you are at the moment, you're still going to hang on to the possibility of something with someone that wanted space from you in the first place? Hell, or even go ahead and fill your need for closeness with person A while person B reaches out to you when they see fit, like you're some kind of back up plan? Is this more common to happen on men?

\#1. The prototypical Chad and ""Chadlite"", a man with genetic advantages, i.e. height, bone structure (broad shoulders, strong jawline), race, low hairline, etc. If a man possesses these physical characteristics, he can afford to be scrawny (although ottermode is preferred) or even out of shape (""dad bod""). He can also get away with being a little shy and socially awkward. A woman will make these allowances because he's hawt and good breeding material.

\#2. A dangerous and roguish persona aka ""the badboy"". Their profile is marked by impulsiveness, high-extraversion, low-agreeableness, low-empathy and hypermasculinity. They are not necessarily goodlooking, although at times they can be unconventionally attractive. They are possessed of superficial charm and excel at manipulating female emotions. Woman from all walks of life are suckers for badboys. They often ignore the red flags and make a calculated risk to date men like this, despite the risk of abusiveness. Of course, women will deny this but what women say they want is at odds with what they truly desire. 

\#3. Betabux. A normie with a good job and stable income. Women settle for these guys, particularly later in life when they've been pumped and dumped too many times by #1 &amp; #2. Badboys typically don't make for the best providers, after all. The majority of relationships will fall into this category

A combination of the above would be ideal. That's a woman's ultimate fantasy (e.g. Fifty Shades of Grey) but it's not realistic. For that reason, a woman's tastes will fall into one of the above, depending on her priorities and situation. If you do not fall into at least one of these categories, you will struggle to ever have a girlfriend.

First, my parents got me a gift card so I could get a slice of cake for my birthday and maybe lunch while I'm at work. The place is right next to my workplace. My husband decides to make this my  birthday dinner and wants to use the gift card for it. Fine I guess. My parents' gift wasn't supposed to be that, but I don't mind. What does bother me is when he says I shouldn't order any drinks here because he doesn't want to pay for them. I tell him that I don't want to feel guilty for wanting a drink, but he says that it's not fair to him.

We get to the restaurant and he immediately orders a drink for himself. Confused, I ask him if he changed his mind. He says that he needed something after waiting so long to be seated (20 mins). I order one too and he says nothing. Dinner is nice and I can't complain.

On the way home he stops at the grocery store and asks me to buy us something to celebrate. He has me buy him a 6 pack, our lunches for the week, and something for myself.

Two days later we're getting ready to go to a concert (my actual birthday) he got me tickets for. He doesn't like the band, but I really love them. As we're getting ready I ask him to help me with the back of my dress and he says no. I think he's joking at first, and ask again. He says he doesn't want too and I have to change into something else. I'd been planning my outfit for weeks. I was upset about this and we ended up spending the concert away from each other. I was by myself, bought my own drink, and spent the whole time alone.

He tells me that he met some new people at the show and had a good time and that it was my fault that I was upset about something so stupid. 

The next day he acts like nothing happened and makes a really nice dinner for my birthday when I get home. I tell him that I'm tired of him upsetting me and then putting in an effort after he's already gone out of his way to make me upset. 

He does this often. The big argument/let down followed by something nice after the occasion has passed. 

He calls me ungrateful and this turns into a full blown yelling argument. 

This man literally packs up the dinner and brings it to his friend's house to have with him instead.

He also says that he's selling the tickets he bought for an upcoming show.

I wrote him a letter the next day outlining why I was upset and how his actions hurt me. His reply was that I bring all of the misery onto myself and that he had no intention of changing how he did things.

I've been on a work trip the last few days following this incident. I'm coming home tomorrow and the idea of having to make dinner for him when I get home tomorrow is just so upsetting after everything.

I go all out for every holiday, birthday, and anniversary for him.

I work full-time. I bought us a house. I do most of the household chores and pay for about 2/3 of expenses. I just don't know if I want to continue with this relationship.

Last night I was made aware that my husband’s ex-wife made a post  and apparently made some extremely hateful comments. These posts were basically about how my stepdaughter (6) is excited to have a new younger sibling, and she (exwife) is having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that regardless of if she likes it or not, we are going to be a blended family.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time my stepdaughter came home from visitation at her mother’s house (my husband has primary custody, her mother has her for slightly less than half the time) she was extremely upset, and wouldn’t tell us why, she would just begin crying at random times. Finally while we were putting her to bed she admitted to us that her mother had reprimanded her for talking about her future sibling. I guess she had asked her mother if the baby was going to with her when she went over and instead of simply saying no, her mother went on a tirade against me, my husband, and the baby. 

&amp;#x200B;

She claims that my husband and I ‘promised’ my stepdaughter the baby could have sleepovers at her house.  I never promised her anything like that. I told her that when her sibling got older we could talk about sleepovers, but when she is still a baby she can’t have sleepovers. I did tell her that we might be able to go on vacations together if her mother was agreeable to it, but this was never an actual solid plan, I never said “We will definitely do this”, but one day she was looking at photos from our recent beach vacation and she asked if one day her mother could come with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

My younger sister, who is on this forum constantly found the post last night and recognized the situation, and sent it to me and my husband. He sent her a message and told her to take it down, and by the time we woke up she had taken it down, but she apparently posted somewhere else. Apparently on both of these posts she made spiteful comments regarding me, my husband, and our baby.  I only have one screenshot of one of her comments (one where she apparently says she would like to throw my unborn child into a dumpster) before she began deleting her comments. I think she got concerned by a comment someone said about how my husband could use the post and her subsequent comments as evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the tip of the iceberg of things she has done that has made us concerned about her. My stepdaughter has come back a few times saying things that her mother has told her that are completely inappropriate for a six year old to be hearing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello i am a 24Mm  and my GF 22F have reached a really bad point in our 3 years relationship

I get depression and anxiety episodes, most of the time i can control them with the help of my therapist and other times it is really sever and affect my behavior and my daily life

She already knows all of that and when i get a really bad episode i notice her in every way possible that i am not feeling well, unstable, having a really bad time etc

She is always supportive and tells me that she will be on my side and support me, 2-3 days later while i am still suffering she changes, she starts to get into arguments with me and tells me how she is uncomfortable because of the way I behave and at the end the same thing happens, she makes me feel like i am entitled to the way i feel and that my feelings doesn’t matter at all and that I can’t have a safe place with her 

One year ago that happened i broke up with her I couldn’t take it anymore, she only treats me well when she is in the mood, when she is upset about something like her coffee she treats me like shit and when i am having a rough time she never actually supports or try to make me feel better

We got back together because I can’t live without her, i changed so much to be able to make her happy, I always support her and be there for her, when she is upset about anything i am always there for her and try to make her feel better and laugh

3 days ago i got a really bad episode and in the morning for no reason she started a big fight with me, knowing so well i was on anti depressants and having the worst time of my life, the fight was about how i am putting pressure on her and how she always supports me but I don’t see that, i left and in the night i talked to her again telling her how hurtful she was and it was my first time crying in the past 7 years, and i cried like a little boy for half an hour, she didn’t apologize and started another fight about how I always maker her feel bad and that she is the one who causes the problems

I am still hurt and i really don’t feel safe with her anymore, but i really love her and i want to be with her, but i never felt that she loves me since we got back together, i never believed her when she told me that she loved me, i feel like I can’t be vulnerable with her at all

For the past 2 years, I dated a sweet lady who has a successful local shop and connects with me on an emotional level. The one issue that is growing each month is my relationship with her 14 year old son.

I remembered when my mom died of an accidental overdose of sleeping medication and I was initially against any new mother. Over time though, me and my future stepmother grew closer and we are still very close today. I wanted to give him all the time in the world to warm up to my presence. I had talks that I didn't want to replace his father.

And yet her son says antisemitic things about my religion and tells me he wishes I didn't marry her. She doesn't condone this at all but he has been kicked out by at least 3 different therapists.

Things ended I thought he hated. I couldn’t get over him (I think I’m in love with him). Started a relationship thing with a guy on my floor. Ran into guy #1 at a party and kissed him. My life is a mess I don’t know how to handle this situauton without losing half my friends 

The actually story is really complicated but I’ll try to make it as short as possible and clarify anything as needed. 

For context I’m a first year in college. 6 day at the college I meet this guy and we hit it off. The chemistry is absolutely amazing, like out of this world. We start hanging out everyday etc. He does very clearly tell me he’s emotionally unavailable and that he’s still hung up on his ex. I don’t really care because I’m generally an emotionally unavailable person. 

Anyways this keeps going for a while. I will note that I did have some issues with him essentially making statements about me as a person and acting like he knew more then me about me. Also we’re still seeing other people on the side. 

This part is kind of complicated but I essentially “figure out” (or so I thought) that him and his ex got back together. I still liked him and he knew that and I was pissed that he wouldn’t mention it to me so I could move on. I blew up on him. And it wasn’t me yelling at him or anything. No no. My deranged ass decided to compile all the evidence that he’d gotten back with his ex and make a poster out of it and present it to him. After I did that we did not talk for like 3 weeks. 

Now in those 3 weeks I end up starting thins with this guy on my floor. He’s absolutely perfect and treats me wonderfully. I haven’t had a single issue with him and he’s heads over heels for me. We go exclusive (yeah it was rushed and I should’ve waited) but during all this I can’t fucking get the first guy out of my head. I miss him everyday and I just can’t let go. I’ve never been one to have a hard time with breakups. Usually I’ll be upset for like 3-7 days after and then I’m good as new. 

Now the grand finale of this saga is that I went to a party last night with the guy from my floor and 2 other friends. At the party someone tells me “oh I just saw [first guys name]”. I ditch the guy from my floor and track down the first guy. My intent here is to just apologize and see if he hates me and try to figure out wtf actually happened. Also note: before this I had downed 4 shots in one go, had a seltzer, and another shot. I’m relatively thin so I was absolutely hammered. I find the first guy and I apologize and he’s 100% not upset at me and says he missed me. He kisses me and I can’t stop myself from kissing him back.

He was charming and lovebombing at first. He told me he had taken photos of me without me looking, cause he adored me and wished we could be together. I gave him a chance but asked to take it slow as I had just come out of a relation. First, he was okay but then the disrespect started. He left me alone sitting and waiting for him, went to sit by his friends, didnt bother inviting me over and when I left slamming the door he said I made it a big deal and none of his friends like me. It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he d say sorry and start with the love words. Then, he cancelled a date after promising for a match with guys, last minute and said sorry when I got mad. He then proceeded staying with another girl at work, she was new, and more of his type as Im quite introverted. I felt not enough, he would treat her similar as me, doing same actions, even being there for her at the middle of the night helping her with car issues, while he d tell me he would be there for me , but words and actions didnt match. Lastly, I asked him for some time away as it wasnt working, so he basically questioned me about my friends, and asked for photos of a guy friend I have. I told him thats possesive and he stopped talking for a whole month until I accepted I made a mistake offending him and I was sorry. Even that , he said he was angry at me and I had to wait for his forgiveness.

He charms almost anyone and I look like the bad person, although I think I did nothing wrong. He was saying he was always used by women and blamed me for withdrawing my love. I was just scared and wanted him to make things right. I told him twice I did love him , but wouldnt mention it often. We then texted in the middle of the night and I told him I had always loved him, but his actions made me back off, he treated me like crap, gave the silent treatment for a month and was punishing me , in order to beg. I cried that night and in the morning he hadnt bothered to send any text of apology , so blocked him but then after 2 months unblocked to phone him and say I miss him. He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late. Lastly, he flirted with another woman in front of me, avoids me, and pretends to be really happy at work as if I dont exist. I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye. He told me I blocked and unblocked him and he never did it to me (I was hurt and broken) and that I would tell him not to text me at work or kiss me at my office (it was because i wanted to be professional and not gossiped) and he would not take no for an answer.

He leaves every office Im at, but checks all my stories, stares at me. I finally reached out and asked to meet to have a talk in person and not text and he said he d be out of town at weekend, so I told him I would only take 30'min but he said ""another day"". What does he want from me? Has he ever loved me? Or is it my fault because I wasted his time? I took him back several times as he would bring gifts, say he couldnt help losing me, now barely looks at me and is avoidant. We only text regarding work and he replies , but doesnt initiate. I dont get it, he wanted me to love him and I do, and then blames me. 

What do I do now? Im dating sb else now but still think of him(he knows) and Im hurting a lot as I wanted closure or confrontation but he just left without anything, looks like he doesnt give a f and keeps hanging out with other women. Also, his friends throw words to me or want to check my reaction. They even question me cheating or sth, as I moved on to my best friend after 3 months (the guy Im dating after telling him everything) and he loves me so much as well as Im taking my time to heal my heart. It feels so bad, my ex had work in my office yesterday so I had to avoid eye look. What do I do? Do i isolate myself? Im looking for a new job.

So my bf and i have been together for about 5.5 years. We started dating in high school, he was my first everything, we lost our virginities to each other, something i felt was so uncommon nowadays and made our relationship that much more special. he was different than any other guy i had met and our relationship instantly felt otherworldly. we were so in love, we were best friends, i could do everything and nothing with him and still be the happiest girl in the world. these feelings have never faded over the last few years, he moved to a different state after graduation which has been a tough strain on our relationship, but we have been navigating it pretty well and we were both happy. He has never given me a reason not to trust him, so i never felt the need to question anything hes said. we have always been openly honest with each other which is something i value very much. last night i asked him if there is anything he hadnt told me in these last few years of dating. he confessed to me that before we started dating he had sex with another girl. (despite telling me for years i was his first) this absolutely shattered me. i am absolutely heartbroken, destroyed. i understand he was/is young and stupid but i was convinced he was different. he says he never had the heart to tell me, he says hes growing and thats why he wanted to tell me and i want to forgive him because everyone deserves to have a second chance but im so unsure. he lied to me for 5.5 years, i feel so stupid. im not even upset at the fact that i wasnt his first, but i dont get why he had to lie about it. he hid it from me this whole time and i dont know if i can trust anything anymore. i dont really know what to do, i dont know if this is fixable, i still adore him and thats what hurts so much about this. if anyone can offer some advice or a different perspective, i think i could really use it. i dont know if i am overreacting, its still very fresh so im not sure",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7527952,public,self,My boyfriend (21m) of 5 years has been lying to me (21f) this whole time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytaw4g/my_boyfriend_21m_of_5_years_has_been_lying_to_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He went silent. We were on a call when I said that. He's been different since then. He most probably cried, because I saw his eyes on voice call after that, he went to bed without food.

Me and wife 37 and 36, got married around 2 months ago. Before getting married we both said we wanted kids.   


However, due to increase in expenses we had to spend some savings to cover increased bills.   
Our wedding was a little bit more than estimated.   


I work 2 jobs, a full time job which is quite secure. But then a part time evening job which I only work when there is hours available. The company I work for is saying there is going to be less hours available.  


For the last month or so I've been telling wife I want to make sure we have some savings incase anything happens to my job, or if we have any additional expenses, so should save for 6 - 9 more months before having kids.   


But she is really concerned that we are getting too old, thinks there may be complication with the birth, or may be too old to raise the child etc if we keep delaying.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR, me and wife both wanted kids before marrying a few months ago. However, due to increased living costs, overspending on wedding, risk of less hours at work etc, think we should save for several months so we have a financial safety net.

So basically, I've had (18M) this online friend for a year (19F)from Germany I talk to all the time, but she has gone through many hardships his leads her to cut herself often, which has been happening less, thanks to me talking her out of it a lot. She also smokes or drinks to escape this reality as well (very clingy as well). 


The worst part is she found a guy from Ireland who also suffers from a lot of trauma and does similar stuff as a coping mechanic. They started talking, and she liked it, which I was happy for her about since she has no one. But now, what she told me about what the Irish guy said makes me afraid. The guy said, “he wanted to get drunk and fuck a blank and off himself after.” And this was enough to make her want him badly and think she should do the same. Im glad she's happy she found someone but as a friend, im worried this guy would get her killed. I know im her friend but im not sure if I have the right to take away someone’s happiness.

But, this year, we started talking again, and became really close. Last weekend, we hooked up (and he said at that moment he had romantic feelings) but the next day he told me that he was confused about his feelings. He said that he doesn’t know if he sees me as just a friend or as something more. He also said he’s emotionally unavailable right now due to having deep romantic feelings towards someone else. But, when asked if he sees us in a relationship in the future, he said yes and that when we hang out more, he might develop more romantic feelings towards me than the other person. 
At the end, we just decided to be friends because he doesn’t want to lose me as one, and to put our romantic feelings aside. but I’m not sure if I can do that given his mixed feelings, and my own romantic feelings for him.

I remembered when my mom died of an accidental overdose of sleeping medication and I was initially against any new mother. Over time though, me and my future stepmother grew closer and we are still very close today. I wanted to give him all the time in the world to warm up to my presence. I had talks that I didn't want to replace his father.

And yet her son says antisemitic things about my religion and tells me he wishes I didn't marry her. She doesn't condone this at all but he has been kicked out by at least 3 different therapists.

I figured that since we will be using all furniture I bought he would contribute in some way but after a comment he made today he's spending it on something else. He earns a lot more money than me and lately I've been struggling with my bills (due to UK economy) and I've been looking for a second job as I only have £300 left over every month even when I only pay the minimum on my commitments and I need to get food and petrol eith that.

I (22F) recently matched with a guy (26M) on a dating app. I’m not in the market for a short term fling. I am looking for a long term relationship, as clearly stated in my profile. 

I have already dated slightly older men simply because I’m always the youngest in room, having graduated and finished college quite early as well as starting my career quite young. This guy is really the dream for me. Handsome, hard-working, makes me feel spontaneous and happy and is quite well off.

So far we have been on two dates over two weeks, both on the weekend since he is busy with work. Both times he suggested I come over to watch a movie and hang out at his place afterwards or the days after. Now I am no psychologist, but I’m pretty sure he what to do more. I let him know on the first date that h-u is not on the table with me and he still said he wanted to see me. 

After getting an invitation after the second date again, I declined saying it’s too soon for me, to which he replied “you know I can’t do this forever”. Now I feel bad.

""When a girl comes on the TV naked and he doesn't look away"" or something along the lines and the clip is of a couple laying in bed and then the dude points to the TV and smiles (probably to indicate there a naked girl) and she get up and punches him
so I sent him this video and I said ""see im not the only one"" cause I don't like it when he looks at other girls bodies. Like I said, I know everyone has different opinions about this, but to me personally, and I have told him this a million times before, I like to be the only girl in his eyes. I should be the only girl he wants to look at in that type of way. Thats the type of love I want. 

so he then responded with 
""That’s not me tho I just be watching the movie and u be tripping ain’t my fault you insecure over a movie I don’t be pointing stuff out like him""
...like damn??? That wasn't even the point of the video sir. I then hit him back with 
""damn why would u say that I don't think anyone would want their significant other looking at someone else naked .""
He doesn't respond. He texts me the morning after saying good morning. I don't respond because he didn't reply to what I said. So then I post on my Instagram story something I saw, he got mad i posted it though. It says, ""me waking up one day realizing the right person won't make me question if they care about me and I won't have to ask or beg to have my basic needs met""
He calls me a few minutes after I post this and he is MAD. he says why didn't you respond to my text, why would you post that, I know it was directed at me, etc. I said I was gonna text you I didn't know what to say cause you didn't even reply to what I said yet. He said fuck u don't text me back

We've been together almost a year now and I know she's been through a lot which is why I didn't drop her, the only thing I told her was to either hit the contact number on WhatsApp up to see if it was actually him and get closure or get over it with the possibility that he could be dead. I had the same struggle for years after I stopped talking to her when we were about 17 because she had serious issues with self harm to the point where if I wasn't there she would hurt herself. 

Overall she's been doing better and has been clean for about a year now and that's all I ask; is that she tries to get better as much as she can. 

I told her I'm concerned it's going to get between us and she bounced it back on me by saying ""it's not fair"" quite frankly I didn't care and I went on to thinking how I wouldn't be surprised if she pushed me to being done with her and it would only save us both time with that attitude.

I was in relationship with a guy whom I met in the last year of my high school. After talking for 6 months, we started dating. Everything was good and perfect, we understood each other well. But before going to college, he broke up with me without any reason. I couldn't take this well because it wasy first relationship. When he told he wanted to break up with me, I kept on denying it a d wanted him to give it a try. His girl best friend texted me anonymously on insta and said many mean things to me. I was heartbroken. (My ex knew that this girl liked him, and told me that even he was unaware of this (insta msg) . But he understood that this girl was his best friend . He stopped talking to both of us. But since they had mutual group they became friends again. But he didn't like that girl, but was still friends with her. ) 

Then after some days he came back to me, saying that he was wrong and did it because he was worried if he could handle long distance or not. Then again everything was fine. But after some months he started to ignore my calls and text and hardly used to reply. We broke up again on December 2018.

He texted me again on September 2019 . Saying that he was sorry for he did that time. Though I didn't forgive him. He told me that I was his ""happy place"" , and he regrets a lot for ruining our relationship. He told me that he broke with me the last time because his academics were fucked up and he had other issues. 

I didn't forgive him though cause I went through a lot because of him. His other friends were in my college. And I knew I was the topic of joke in front of them. 
I asked my ex a simple question that does he still feel the same for me, to which he said that he doesn't know. And for now he just wants to talk to me. 

But I said that I didn't want to be friends and stopped talking to him. And since then till now we never contacted each other. 

But still it's just so hard for me to move on from him. I just miss him so much. It feels like no one understood me that well. Though our relationship was messed up, but all the happy moments we had, I just miss those things.

We aren't dating officially, but we are not speaking to other people either. We don't talk daily and haven't been seeing one another much the past two months, but he has been around more lately

He has been experiencing unexplained pain and for the past couple of months has been in a limbo with doctors who did not believe him. He explained to me early on that this situation was really overwhelming (even caused him to drop school) and he couldn't handle a relationship. In the past month, he has been diagnosed with a condition that explains what's going on, and he started coming around again and reaching out more consistently. We have seen one another 3x in the past month, 2x this week.

He's a sweetheart when he's around, and we act like a couple. Earlier in the month when he came over he hadn't seen me in a while and made some comments about how he liked talking to me and missed ""this"" (cuddling in my room). We also talked about our relationship and he stated he wasn't talking to anyone but me and he was working on himself so he could get to a point where he could have a relationship. He left and we didn't talk a ton for the next couple weeks, but I felt safe even with no contact and like I knew he wasn't going anywhere. I felt like something had changed.

Well, he reached out last week and plans fell through. Followed up this week and came over a couple days ago. Again, sweet and loving (hand holding, kissing, etc). He told me pretty quickly after he got here how he missed this/me and we started catching up. While we were catching up he made comments about how easy I am to talk to and that he feels like I know everything about him. We ended up staying up most of the night talking, watching tv, and joking around. When we woke up, he stayed in bed with me a couple hours more than usual. He left his stuff (weed and backpack) at my house, and let me know he was coming back later that night. It was football night, which he usually spends alone or with friends, but he came over to watch the game with me. After the game I plucked his eyebrows and then we did our normal routine.

The issue is I cannot gauge him, although I adore him. A lack of contact is not something I am used to, and it is something I am a little insecure about. I am trying to get comfortable with that though. I feel like I am starting to love him and I'm scared considering I don't know exactly what this is. I don't know if I am imagining it, but when we are together it feels like he might be developing deeper feelings (not necessarily love). I feel like it's inappropriate to tell him, but I don't want to stop seeing him. Do his actions make it seem like he might reciprocate deeper feelings?

Tl;DR: I (24f) have been seeing a guy (24M) that has recently started showing more affection (openly stating he misses me, leaving his stuff at my house, talking about our connection, etc).

I'm worried about my friend but I don't want to be nosy and interfere with his (presumably) happy relationship with his new girlfriend, so I want to ask if I'm not the only one hearing alarm bells here. This guy is someone I've grown particularly close with in such a way that I'm starting to see him like a brother and he's starting to see me like a sister. We've been close longer than he's been in this current romantic relationship. Recently I tried inviting him to meet up for the first time since high school to finally socialize for once (in public, of course). He said we could, but ""in respect to his current situation"" we'd have to invite a 3rd person (we don't have mutual friends). I eventually declined and we resolved to just keep things virtual to avoid stirring up trouble.

For context, he says he and his girlfriend have a boundary to not have any best friends of the opposite gender. He says he doesn't mind if his girlfriend has a male best friend because he ""knows she isn't interested in anyone else"", but she doesn't want him to have a female best friend despite him not being attracted to anyone else too. The thing is, her closest circle (""I haven't actually heard her call them her best friends"", he said) is mostly made of men. The other girl in the group is dating one of the guys, the second guy is interested in someone outside of their friend group, but the third guy **was someone she was interested in a couple years back. He liked her too.** My friend also shared that she hangs out at the guys' dorm. From our conversation it seems she was willing to distance herself from the guys, but he convinced her not to because he ""doesn't mind"". Basically she's free to just hang out with them like that without much restriction, but he can't meet female friends (in public) without worrying that he's cheating.

Update is below but here’s the first part of the story

This is a repost cuz the last one got taken down for not specifying my gfs age

The title pretty much sums it all up.

So I’m 18 and started dating my gf who’s also 18 last year. I know that sex is something that comes straight away. I knew this and continued to sexually please myself by jacking off. 

My parents had been gone to a friends house for a while and they would be back in about 2-3 hours so I asked my gf if she wanted to come over she said she’d bring some stuff with her. So she came over and I kinda had to take a shit. so I told her I’m going to go take a shit. My bathroom is upstairs and she was getting some stuff done downstairs on the couch. I forgot that my bathroom door is messed up when it comes to it being locked. When I finished I was kinda horny too so I just said eh why the fuck not. 

Well she wanted to get something from the bathroom and walked in on me. This girl is really quiet when she’s walking around and my stairs don’t creek so I had no idea she was coming up the stairs. She started yelling and saying I was cheating on her. I told her that we had the whole sex talk 2 months ago and she said she didn’t want to have sex and I told her to take her time and come to me about it when she’s ready but that shouldn’t mean I can pleasure myself either. She stormed off and left. I’m really starting to rethink everything. On the one hand she’s an amazing person and I do really like her, but on the other hand she won’t let me pleasure myself in anyway. I don’t know can someone please help.

Update: so we talked. I had her come over so we could talk. I apologized for jacking off at the wrong time and told her I didn’t have a good excuse besides I’m an idiot. She laughed at that one.

She said that she should be the one to apologize. When she cooled off a bit she started to think and put together that ppl need to be sexually pleased. She said that she really appreciated that I never asked her about having sex or anything sexual after she said she wasn’t ready and that she was willing to try it. I asked her 4 times if she was actually doing this out of free will or if she felt guilty from before. She assured me that she wanted to try.

She said the reason she didn’t want to have sex was because she was afraid of underperforming because apparently (I didn’t know about this btw) she slept with some asshole who said wow you were terrible. I’m going to feel bad for the next guy that try’s to fuck you. I assured her that we should be doing this for fun and not look at it as a chore. She agreed and we did it. 

Holy fuck it was amazing. I don’t know what that asshole was talking about when she said she was underperforming. So yeah it all worked out at the end. I had sex with girl that I really like and she’s sleeping right next to me. She also asked if I could stop watching porn. I said yes.

I broke up with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. So I was in a relationship for a while.. about two and a half years, and we were living together. Then we broke up for about six months. Then we got back together in a very uncertain/unsteady way and were only seeing each other once or twice a week. We often talked about how it was sort of a test run and we might break up again. I began to think about breaking up with him about a month before I did it for real. We had so many issues that were long standing and there was not much passion in the relationship. I am having a lot of emotions around the break up but they’re not so much related to my ex boyfriend, just more about how I function in relationships I guess and looking back at past trauma. I met another guy who I just think is amazing about three months ago. I only started getting a crush on him like a month ago, but ugh it’s bad. I really like him. And he knows I just got out of a relationship.. I guess I’m just wondering how long I should wait to tell him I like him. I think he might feel the same way, but he also might just think of me as a friend. We went out the other night just the two of us and had the best time. But it was clear it wasn’t a date. I just know there’s his whole trope of people not really being into people right when they get out of relationships and I don’t want to create that sense. I also really don’t want him to start dating someone else lol.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7527808,public,self,Got out of a relationship recently and have a crush,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytag64/got_out_of_a_relationship_recently_and_have_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I’ve noticed since the beginning that these woman can be very inappropriate (at least in front of me) by touching, flirting and saying things for attention that just throw me off.

One of the women literally wrapped her legs around her waist upon the first night of me meeting her — almost as if she was establishing that she was more important than me (because I’m not going to call her out at her home, in front of her husband and family)…This seems to be her personality overall - always wanting 100% of the attention by being a bit loud and quirky.

Then there’s the neighbor. He became close to her, her husband and two sons as his divorce was ongoing and afterwards. They all have dinner together multiple nights per week. I’ve always been a bit uncomfortable with their relationship as he mentions her a lot, spends a lot of time with them and overall seems to be very involved in their lives. I remember a specific moment in the beginning when he was watching a funny video when both of us were seated on each side of him at a table and he showed her the video first. Minor, but just rubbed me the wrong way.

Then there was an anniversary party for the neighbor and her husband a week or so ago. The way I watched this woman behave (on her wedding anniversary mind you) was so disappointing. She hung next to him, on him by rubbing his beard, asked him to help her with anything for the party — kind of husband responsibilities in my opinion. It made me feel left out, embarrassed and just…hurt. He took a walk around the property with his buddy and she pretty much panicked not knowing where he was, asked me 2x and even texted him asking where he went.

The thing is, he claims he doesn’t get it and I kind of believe him. He’s oblivious to it because he says he knows who he is and that it’s not like that but I can’t shake how disrespectful these women are to me when I’m with him. I definitely don’t think he would ever cross the line with these women but it’s the respect factor.

After speaking my mind on this (and I’m hyper sensitive to women doing this because my last serious relationship ended when a woman did exactly this kind of thing in my presence - just wasn’t married - and got him and ended up marrying him) has made him go into his head about it. He now feels uncomfortable having me around them and it’s affecting events I want to go to with him.

I feel that I shouldn’t be punished for voicing my opinion/insecurities and shouldn’t have those insecurities held against me.

How would YOU handle this situation?

My boyfriend is lovely… most of the time. He buys me things, drops everything for me, never raises his voice and always makes sure i’m ok. There are times where he gets in moods when we’re together and will stop talking to me. The tone of his voice changes and when I ask what’s wrong. He says nothing. 

I struggle with many mental illnesses and it’s very difficult for me to leave the house. So we spend almost all the time at my home. He understands this and never says anything about it. When he does come over to my house which is usually every weekend, he’s extremely touchy and just keeps going on. I try to roll over to go to sleep and then he thinks that there is something wrong. 

The truth is. I miss being single. I feel that all my illnesses have gotten way worse in this relationship. In the beginning, they all went away for about 2 months. We had a great time and I couldn’t get enough of him. But now… I never miss him. I could go a month without seeing him and I wouldn’t miss him even a bit. I love my alone time and he’s the opposite.. If i haven’t seen him for a while he gets in a bad mood and gives one word replies when I try and speak with him. Now all I think about is ways to get out of this. This is not what I want for the rest of my life and I feel so completely stuck. I don’t think I could ever break his heart like this because he tells me constantly how much he loves me and how much I changed his life. I’ve talked to him about the bad moods he says he won’t do it again but keeps doing it.

I miss being single and being able to stay away from my phone, not worrying about if he’s in a bad mood. When I was single I never hooked up with anyone. I didn’t even meet up with guys, I would just briefly talk to them online. 

I’m so stuck and it runs through my mind everyday. I feel different about him every other day. One day I love him and the next I want to leave him.

He immediately corrected the phrasing after seeing my expression, and said he didn’t mean settling as the negative connotation. Just that he chooses to be with a woman.

I should mention, he’s been honest with me about his past sexually fluid experiences. So that wasn’t shocking to me. What bothered me was that early in our relationship I asked him what he identified as. He said he identifies as straight. 

I don’t care that he’s bisexual, I already knew he was at the least bicurious. I only felt insecure and sad because I’ve asked him that question before and he gave a different response. Makes me think he’s not comfortable disclosing that information with me, but will disclose it to a stranger at a bar.

It put a damper on the night. 
I’m just feeling weird about the situation, but also feel like I might be overthinking. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

The problem is, and apologies if I'm generalizing but there's literally been many studies on this (and it has to do with our stupid societal pressures for men not to express emotion), but most men don't have emotional conversations or support with other male friendships. The one person in their life they have that with?? Their wife or girlfriend. So when there's problems, you guys come here and get advice from other men that is so cut &amp; dry, black &amp; white. 

I feel so bad when I see scenarios like an emotional affair. A man only posts his side: his wife had some issues, brought them up, he miraculously did everything she asked for, she had an emotional affair or physical affair, he doesn't know what to do. So all the comments are, ""That's it, man, go to a divorce lawyer."" We're all strangers here. I know it can be easy to see things black &amp; white. But because as a woman I know things are so much more complicated and nuanced, I feel really bad. If needs aren't being met in a healthy way, they'll be met in an unhealthy way. Or, an affair has much more to do with that specific person than being a referendum on the entire relationship. Problems exist in any relationship, no matter how in love you may be. Basically, can we stop just telling everyone it's doomsday?? 

That being said, if anyone specifically wants a woman's perspective to what's going on, I am here to help.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7527722,public,self,"Men, stop coming on Reddit for relationship advice",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yta6r4/men_stop_coming_on_reddit_for_relationship_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,,
