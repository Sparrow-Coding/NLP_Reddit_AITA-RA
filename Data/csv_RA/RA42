first, context: my closest circle of friends are all from the same friend group. we're a group of 7 girls that met each other in junior high and have managed to stay together until now when we're in our first year of college. thats 5 years. throughout those 5 years we've had a lot of ups and downs but we never seriously fell out. nothing lasted long either. we have endured being separated by miles and hours when 2 of us left for a different country in literally opposite sides of the earth for senior high. though we reunited again in college

until recently that is, ironically it's where they're closest w each other physically. 2 of them share a class and are in the same campus while the rest of us have been separated and scattered in different colleges. out of these 2 (both F 19), im quite close to one of them,  i'll call her A . A had liked one of the guys in their class, C (M 18). It only developed recently and when A asked him out, she was shot down but theyre still friends. now during the time before A confessed, B dmed me that she's been feeling left out by A. A always ditched B to partner up w C for activities, went to parties w him and ate and talked to him instead of her

now before this, i had a similar experience w A during senior high. though i had never really thought more of it nor confronted A about it because i always thought that it was just an irrational fear of mine that A would leave me for her crush, because ik that our friendship means more that some guy she liked. so ik where B was coming from. but after B told me that, i sort of never heard of it again so i didnt think much of it anymore

then a few weeks after the confession, A came over my dorm w teary eyes. I asked what happened, told me that she's tired of B. why? well basically this happened after the confession: 

\- A &amp; C r still friends (actually got closer because of the confession.) and B kept teasing them that they're dating and that they kept ditching her, which is annoying because it's making their friendship really awkward

\- B already talked to A about making her feel left out. Now A always apologizes to B whenever she voices this out.

\- But B does the same to A w her own friends.

and now she won't talk to B. B noticed but didn't even try to talk or chase after A either. they're not communicating at all. irl and our gc. i'm not sure if anyone else have noticed. 

so w their situation i thought: what would i do? so at first i told her to to try to talk to B. we've been friends for years and those two have been friends even before all our friend group met. surely B won't spread rumours of her because A's precious to B right?

but surpise, after a few days again, A stayed over at my dorm. she told me she still hasn't talked to B and was rlly hurt that she wasn't reaching out. i tried to urge her to be the one that reaches out instead because that's what i would have done. but i also found it weird why B isn't doing the same. but she said doesn't want to

n im torn. because idk if i should:

\- betray A's trust of being the only person she's told about this and talk to B and ask why she's not doing anything.

\- further urge A to talk to B, which might make A uncomfortable because she told me she already doesn't want to and might stop talking to me

\- confide in another person in our friend group and ask what the best option is 

im trying to be rlly careful w the next move because i dont want these two to fall apart. ik its selfish because its their own life and decision but idk how our friend group would feel like without these two. i dont want to experience us having to choose between one of them or us being a group of 5 only. its also frustrating seeing these two not talk their issues w e/o out. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: two of my friends won't talk to each other and refuse to make up. should i interfere? if so how?

im genuinely sorry if this is a little messy, im dead tired and wrote this right after my shift at my part time job because it's literally been eating at me the whole day at work. the whole week actually

Me (25F) and him (19M) met last year right after I had just gotten out of a 6 year relationship. We were physically together for a year and then went long distance after this summer. We talked a few days ago and we both realized we are not ready to commit to a relationship like this now. I want him to see what’s out there and I also want to do other things.

We totally see a future together, and we love each other so much, but it’s just not our moment right now. We both have to grow up.

We agreed to stay in contact in a more chill way, maybe meeting up just during the summer (we worked together from june to august this year and could do it again).

I wasn't able to sleep last night. Last time I checked the clock it was almost 2:00am. I tossed and turned for at least another 30 minutes before falling into broken sleep. I woke up at 6:00am, unable to sleep any more. He'd asked the night before if I wanted sausages for breakfast. I was excited but understood when things got in the way and there was no time for it.

I got up, fed the cats, took doggo out to pee, drove him to the vet before work and then went directly to work. The coworker I assist at work has covid. It's the senior assistant's rostered day off. The receptionist is away therefore the junior assistant had to cover reception and couldn't assist me. I didn't take lunch. I didn't text because I didn't want to make my problems another person's problem. 

My wrists hurt from typing so much. Email after email. My throat hurts from copious client phone calls. I worked free overtime, not including the 1-hr unpaid lunch break that I worked through, then I drove to the vet, waited half an hour while busting to use the toilet, collected doggo and drove home. 

After over an hour busting, I was finally able to pee at home. A relief. Stress is causing me to break out. I diligently washed my make up off and bandaided the big blind pimple on my forehead. I don't feel sexy, physically or mentally. I'm running on under 7 hours sleep in the past 48 hours and I'm completely spent

He asked if we can lay in bed together; nothing sexual, I'm assured. He knows I'm exhausted. There's a bandaid on my forehead. I need some space. I need to digress. Space for him from me had been a topic of contention recently, and I have obliged and given space as requested, so I assumed giving this same request from me to him now would be easily understood and respected.

His advice to me yesterday was that I'm not clear enough - ""just say what you need to say, get to the point"". So I do. I clearly and directly to the point say ""I need to digress for a while first"". Sitting outside with a beer and a cigarette is my own personal way to unwind.

""Beer and cigarettes"", he says with a disappointed look. Guilt rushes in and I question if I should disregard my own wants and needs for his need for affection. I feel bad, questioning my own self worth and feelings. I don't want to be looked at with this bandaid on my forehead. 

I try to lighten the mood, go in for a kiss and am met with closed lips and turning away. It feels like a punishment. I say that his reaction felt like a punishment, while asking myself why does it feel like that and what am I being punished for, concluding I should have just ignored my own needs and heeded his to avoid this situation. 

Escalation. Nothing major. But now he's lying on the floor. A regular occurrence when he's upset. For a moment I feel like a mother trying to comfort her disgruntled child when they didn't get their own way, but quickly remind myself to be kind and let him speak. And he speaks.

Dejected, unappreciated, ignored - these are the words and feelings he expressed to me, which have resulted from my actions. I don't walk away. I don't want to fight. I need space but what good is that when someone is lying on the floor? I want to understand and empathise. So I take a moment and then take a walk in his shoes, only to realise they are also my own. I can understand his words and feelings because I feel them too. We both have one foot in a shoe making them, or us, a pair. Equals. No villains. No saints. We both have feelings and neither's feelings are less or more important. A level playing field. 

""I think we both feel that way so we should both take a moment to recognise the good things we do for one another instead of focusing on the bad things"". I said this hoping to steer the conversation into positive thinking, to help bridge us towards acceptance and appreciation within our relationship, opposed to continuing the criticism of one another, which does nothing but break it down. 

My hopes are dashed when my push towards positivity is catapulted even further into negativity, because now I'm making the conversation all about me - I can't accept criticism and I don't care and I always just walk away. It's clear that this conversation cannot be about us as a partnership. This conversation is about me and what I'm doing wrong. Empathising was wrong. Explaining myself was wrong. My feelings and thoughts are wrong. My attempts to avoid us criticising one another, and rather communicate more lovingly, were wrong. 

I'm the bad person. The villain. The only one accountable for both of our feelings.

My (19f) boyfriend (20m) and I had several arguments over our sexual life. Some context we met on a BDSM discord server (weird I know) and found out we lived close and would have casual hookups every now and then, after a few months of this we both agreed we liked eachother and got together.

Everything was great for me, we did the deed regularly and he was extremely loving outside of the bedroom, but one day he told me he wanted to try something new.

He showed me some pictures of another couple, and suggested the idea that he would have intercourse with her and I could have intercourse with her boyfriend at the same time same room.

He was kind of obsessed over the idea and I kept refusing because I liked to keep my relations reasonably private and I thought it would make me uncomfortable

After three months of begging, yelling and refusing to even touch me till I said yes I finally gave in.

That same night they were both invited over, we had a nice meal together and watched TV for a few hours before we led to the bedroom.

About halfway through, after foreplay I watched my boyfriend have the time of his life with someone else, he was insanely vocal and so was she.

Now would be a good time to explain that the rules were no kissing, no signs of actual love towards the other, must wear protection etc.

Her boyfriend hadn't touched me yet because he wasn't sure it was what I wanted which I'm so greatful for because I was genuinely upset and on the verge of tears, instead he just sat with me holding my hand.

My boyfriend and the other girl where paying zero attention to us, I genuinely think he forgot we were there because after two minutes he finished leant over kissed her on the lips saying 'i love you'

Both me and her boyfriends jaws almost hit the floor, I wasn't upset anymore just really pissed off. 

In that moment I lost all respect for him as she repeated 'i love you too'.

Me and her boyfriend gave eachother the same look as if to say 'what the actual fuck.'

She got up and went to the bathroom to clean up and he followed her, when they both left I broke down crying and her boyfriend pulled me into his arms and held me for a few minutes.

I knew I would be uncomfortable with this and I hated that I let him convince me to do it, at this point I'd figured we were already there and my boyfriend just fucked me over so why not?

I asked him if we could continue because I needed something to lift my mood, he agreed enthusiastically and we undressed, he continued to compliment every aspect of my body from my freckly thighs to my hair, it made me so happy.

We did the deed and by the end It felt like I was floating, it wasn't what I was use to, he was Incredibly gentle and instead of grabbing Me he caressed me, it was amazing easily the best sex of my life.

We ended it by cuddling for a few minutes before dressing and him walking me to the bathroom, (amazing aftercare too) he helped me in the bath, washed my hair because I was shaking a bit and helped dry me off.

By the time we'd came back downstairs into the living room we walked in and our partners were sat on the sofa and immediately lost there heads yelling about how 'you can't continue when we're finished' and 'you missed your chance' explaining how it counted as us cheating.

I began crying again because I felt like a shitty person, her (now ex) boyfriend took me in his arms and tried not to yell explaining how they kissed, told eachother the loved eachother and broke multiple rules so they were no better than us

His girlfriend stood up and pryed his hands off of me and dragged him out of the house. My boyfriend refused to even look at me and told all our mutual friends I'd cheated on him.

He plainly ignored me for a week before coming up to me and asking 'do you even love me anymore?'

I was unable to answer him and thought for about 30seconds before responding 'did you love her?'

Ofcourse he went silent and I continued 'no I don't love you, ive lost all respect for you and I don't want to see you anymore, that broke my heart, you're lucky that 'her boyfriend' stepped in. I want to move out'

We agreed it would be best, she broke up with her (ex) boyfriend and moved in with my ex boyfriend 

I was alone and moved in with my parents, I got back into contact with her ex boyfriend and he offered me to move in with him, i refused and changed my mind a few months later 

We're currently living together in a fwb relationship without labels but I would honestly marry this man if he asked, he spends all his time with me when he's not at work, has never forced me to do what I don't want to and makes me feel so loved despite never having had to say it at all.

I don't know how he feels about me but Im certain I love him.

My ex likes to send me photos of him and his new girlfriend doing the deed and me and my now roomate just laugh till we cry about it, I don't care about what he does with his life anymore and I'm happy as my life is now, appariently there having a baby now?

Then he started talking about his Binance account and so on he showed me his profits which is so normal because we are both interested in crypto. After that, i send him a funny video which he saw it and didn't reply then I joked around saying ""oops it didn't make u laugh? Okay i'll send another one to make you smile"". Keep in mind that he is always busy the last 2 weeks and never talks to me or just reply with a simple message. After i joked around he said: ""listen, i'm starting to hate our relationship because i feel like i always need to deal with you feeling unwelcome and that i don't love you, i do love you, but i do not have any time to send you a message or talk with you, even if i spend time with you i always think about crypto and profits and my businesses and i can't have a clear mind. So please don't think that i hate you, I'm just busy. I also don't have time for my friends to spend with, and i swear i'm not trying to cheat i'm just busy"". After he said that i got so sad because he literally never speak to me and i always have to open conversation with him or it just he won't talk. I understand that he is busy, but it is too much that he never speak to me and sometimes he just give me a cold reaction like liking my messages instead of replying to them. He claims that everything he do now is for our future. And he does help me financially in crypto. But i need quality time with him :(.

He is a very quiet person, especially when he is working. I heavily respect that since I am also a bit of an introvert.

I was hired no long ago so I understand that people are still connecting with me. But overall I have been able to have good talks with most coworkers. 

The other day it was just me and this quiet coworker. We are in a country where silence is not necessarily  viewed as awkward. But the atmosphere felt tense. I felt the urge to make some small talk but the conversation died quickly. Ever since I have been fearing that maybe he has some sort of dislike for me? He interacts decently well with others and even with me if we are in a group setting. But when it is just the two of us it is tense. 

I am even afraid to offend him by interacting with him. For example, another coworker told me he is in his late 20s, something that surprised me since I thought he was \~35. He showed up during that interaction and the coworker I was having a conversation with told him I thought he was waaay older. He turned to me and said ""is it because of my beard?"". I tried to avoid any real answer and apparently I offended him so much that he shaved next week. 

Before people tell me that ""well maybe he has a crush on you"" let me tell you that he has a gf and I also have a partner. I was afraid that he would think I was trying to flirt with him and that's the reason he dislked me. So last week I mentioned my bf to him for the first time. Now he already mentioned his gf to me. So we both know that no side is trying any approach. 

Why does he dislike me? He is one of the team leaders so I have to interact with him. But I am always afraid to ask questions because I feel like he will find me annoying and dislike me even more.

We became ‘official’ in May during a trip to Cephalonia but soon after I ended things because on the flight home we got onto the topic of how we’d raise our children (as you do!) and we disagreed on physical punishment. I was in the middle of exam season at uni and felt stressed and overwhelmed by the thought of having to make such big decisions about my children that don’t even exist. Z was sad but understood, saying he’ll give me some space. We agreed we’d still met up, still have sex and still say ‘I love you’. We weren’t exclusive but we said we’d say if we were going to sleep with anyone else. Sounds like a relationship, right? The difference for me is that I wasn’t as emotionally involved. I kept more emotional distance than if we were ‘official’ because I was worried Z might leave. I was open about how I felt about being ‘in limbo’ and that I felt distant from him, to which Z reassured me he was still interested but wasn’t yet ready for a relationship. Z had realised he needed time after the breakup from his previous relationship in February, in which he was engaged. A few weeks after OUR breakup In May we met up for a spicy hotel break. I felt a huge distance between us and felt as if our lustful bubble had popped. I was sad but happy for the time we’d had and, as a result, assumed Z was no longer interested and shut that door in my mind.

On the background of this, I was experiencing a depressed episode at the time, and when I was at my lowest, crying in my car, not wanting to live anymore and trying to make myself get out to go to work, I called my ex. That morning I’d already reached out to the GP, my mum and Z, to which I still felt helpless. Z hadn’t experienced my lows before and I was worried how he would react to them. My ex was au fait with my lows and was usually able to help (despite often causing them). So I called, and it did help. The following weeks we talked occasionally and although he’d been wanting to get back together, I was clear this wasn’t going to happen and he accepted that. The conversation was friendly and any slight flirting I shut down and reaffirmed my boundaries. I didn’t tell Z I’d reached out. 

A couple days after the spicy hotel trip, I came down with covid. I felt rotten and living in halls meant I was putting my flatmates at risk. I told my ex and he offered for me to stay at his, platonically. He was medical so around it at work anyway. I felt assured he respected my boundaries and after assuming Z wasn’t interested anymore, I believed I only had me to think about and chose to go. I stayed for a week and the first few days he slept on the sofa and was just friendly. During this week, Z also got covid and was messaging to check I was ok and send me a nude. I didn’t know how to tell him I was at my ex’s. I didn’t tell anyone. So I put off messaging him as much as I could. He sent a messaging saying he loved me, to which I replied I loved him to, which I meant. I did still love him, because I thought a relationship was no longer an option and was sad. I compartmentalised that and him in a box, to think about after that week and when I felt better. 

I started to imagine what life would be like if I got back together with my ex. He already owned a house, was established in his job and it seemed like an ideal setup. He seemed to have changed and be less of a c***. We talked about what went wrong in our relationship with my intention being to offer advice for his future endeavours. We talked about our sex life which was the only positive thing in the relationship and one thing led to the other and we had sex. I regretted it afterwards and I said I should leave, we fought and I saw he hadn’t really changed but where I was feeling so rotten, decided to stay. 

After that, I decided I need to end the ‘limbo’ with Z and go back to being friends. So I sent a long text saying how I thought he was feeling and how I’d prefer to be friends, as we’d be friends for years beforehand and didn’t want to lose that. He was shocked and upset and wrote a long reply about how much he loved and wanted me but just wasn’t ready for the relationship just yet. I felt awful. I realised how much I had f***** up. I was so stressed and upset with myself, so much so I even called the Samaritans. I knew I had to tell Z what I’d done I just didn’t know how. I thought even if it hadn’t been over for Z, it was going to be now.

At the end of the week I went home but carried on friendly communication with my ex. I tried to avoid conversation with Z whilst I decided what to do. A week later I sent a underwear selfie to Z and my ex, intending to inflate my low self esteem. My ex seemed to think we could still get back together so I reiterated how I still had feelings for Z and although my ex’s setup was ideal, I would not be happy. My ex threatened to tell Z, which I was already going to do, but then my confession was expedited. 

I told Z what happened and he was distraught. We talked and he was willing to give me another chance. I’d decided to be open to the idea of physical punishment of children and on August 26th he asked me to be his girlfriend again. 

It is now November and we have been mostly happy since, however Z has asked about having an open relationship to which I did not agree.

Our problem now is that Z is still upset that I left him emotionally, by reaching out to my ex with the phone call, by going to my ex’s when I had covid, the sex, the hiding and the photo. We have talked endlessly, with one week us spending over 25 hours on phone calls and him breaking up with me to retract it the next day.

I love Z and I see him as best friend as well as a partner and lover which I have never had before. Despite our rockiness, I am the happiest I have ever been. I know I have betrayed him but I genuinely feel that with our title comes the commitment we lacked ‘in limbo’. I cheated emotionally, which is what he is most hurt about, but I also feel now I know he could handle my lows, I could open up to him now. He says he loves me and doesn’t want to lose me and feels he can be himself for the first time, but he can’t move past this. 

We are looking for a solution and want to know what other people think.

Should we..

A) break up

B) Allow Z to ‘get even’ by sleeping with someone else and not telling me and then telling me after.

C) have an open relationship 

D) any other ideas????",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7580396,public,self,Should my boyfriend sleep with someone else to get even?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyjh0q/should_my_boyfriend_sleep_with_someone_else_to/,all_ads,6,

The cause of it was her stonewalling me in the middle of our conversation. She left my messages on delivered for four days, then got upset when I didn’t reach out to her. This tipped me over the edge and I responded by being firm, but still calm enough to not raise my voice or call her names.

I wasn’t perfect in my approach, before I called her I said “I will call at x time, pick up because I won’t call again.” After that text I got from her. I wanted to communicate something was very wrong, but instead it came off cold and distant. I realised I could’ve worded that better. Throughout the conversation, I would bring up the issue at hand, then her points would be her focusing on how she feels and not addressing the issue. There were multiple times where she would turn it on me and tell me how I’m affecting her negatively, how she’s always the one fighting for the relationship, how she cares so much.

I agreed with her and said I do see that. I kept asking her why she didn’t respond to my messages with all of this, she said she didn’t want to start a fight. She then said she feels she has to walk on eggshells around me which I didn’t like. I paused for a moment to reflect and ask why. She told me about the instances I said I would break up with her. I told her I never meant that and clarified each statement. Here they are:

The first time I said something was when she accused me of cheating and I denied the allegations. She didn’t trust my words at all, so I plainly said: “I’m done defending myself, without trust we can’t build a healthy relationship. Our relationship can’t survive if there’s no trust.” The second time was when I received an ultimatum. I told her ultimatums are toxic as hell and that I would not tolerate that in our relationship, saying if that’s how she is, then I’d have to reconsider.(now that I write that I can see how my message was interpreted.) The third time was at the end of our conversation when I said “moving forward stonewalling will not be tolerated. Unless there’s an emergency. If either one of us ghost the other, then that person is single when they get in contact again.”

I said that due to her admitting she saw my message, read it, and chose not to respond. The message in question was a small misunderstanding. It only grew when I felt ignored, and disrespected. She may feel that way too. Is there anything I can do to improve my communication? I’m not perfect so I hope I didn’t write as a victim. There are always two sides, I just want to know how I can communicate better so that my intention matches my words.

I have recently started university, live at home and have been commuting every day, 1.5-2 hours one way. 

My sister (19f) started uni last year and is 2-2.5 hours away. She lived on residence first year and my parents bought a condo near her campus and her friends pay rent. Both of our parents pay school stuff, the remainder left after our scholarships (we are quite proficient at academics so they scholarships were quite heavy.)

I did not end up staying on residence because one of my parents lived in a town a couple over from the city my school is in (school is in an iconic capital city) and says that the commute is “hard but doable,” and that residence is a waste if i went. Also important to note that my school’s city is more expensive than sisters, but she lives in the heart of downtown and if there were ever to be a property for me to live in, it would be outside the core city to even out costs (i think this is completely fair.)

Although it did bother me that they paid for her to be away from home I was perfectly fine with this decision as it makes economic sense. I do not talk about how much it bothers me anymore because if i do i get lectured about how there are no favourites and we’re all equal. As well, they told me that I may, eventually, get the same condo privileges as her, just not in the same time period. All I requested that I get the same freedoms as my sister, who obviously doesn’t really fall under their reigns anymore given she’s out of the house. The freedoms I requested were being out later on some days, being able to sleep over at friends houses (either gender given that i’m queer) so i don’t have to leave at 7-8 pm, stop policing what I wear (nothing crazy, mostly lack of a bra because it makes my skin bust out in hives) and not having to update them every time I switch locations.

They were not pleased with this and insisted that while I reside under their roof I will follow their rules. They also said that she gets more freedom due to her being older than me, and got very upset when I brought up the fact that she was on res this time last year and I am not, so she has nothing to do with it. Parents are willing to let me be home later, around 10-11, but realistically that means i would have to stop whatever I was doing at 8ish to get home on time. Furthermore, my dads been insinuating that the only reason I want to move out is to “do whatever I want without giving them a single regard.” Though freedom is part of them reason, the commute is also a killer. I am extremely sleep deprived and crashed a car driving on 0 sleep due to how much it forces me to condense my day.

I have brought up the idea of me moving out with money I have saved over the years as I have been working since 15. They said that this money is for if either lose a job, I can still pay tuition. I would probably be disowned if I moved out on my own without their help.

I really don’t know what to do with this situation, because it doesn’t seem as though any solution is possible or results in everyone being happy. I believe they’re trying to progress with the condo and if they could they definitely would. I would be totally OK still commuting if I was just granted a bit more freedom.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7580367,public,self,I can’t seem to find a way to gain equal treatment to my sister without damaging my relationship with my parents,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyjcxd/i_cant_seem_to_find_a_way_to_gain_equal_treatment/,all_ads,6,

He loves surprises, telling me how much he likes me and he acts nicely. He supports me with my career and he always advises me on what to do in a non-pressure way. This behaviour is consistent throughout our relationship and I haven't noticed any red flags other than the followings. 

So, a few months ago I asked him to do some STI tests because i wanted to feel safe once we had sex. He said he went on a laboratory (let's call it A) and did them. Many days passed and no sign of results. I thought he was lying but he protested that he wasn't. Anyway, a few days later he had the results but didn't want to send them via the Internet because he was afraid of personal data leaking. I respected that but since we didn't have a personal space to meet since his brother was occupying the space we used to use, even more days passed without me seeing the clear results. A month after that and since I was almost convinced that he lied to me all this time, I actually demanded to see the results. He sent them then and it seemed that he had actually been telling me the truth but the laboratory was different from what he had initially told me. When I asked him about it, he apologized for the lie and told me that he didn't remember how it was called so that's why he gave me a different name and that he didn't think it would be that huge of a deal. 

The results seemed quite legit, no photoshopped or anything, the data were correct. So I concluded that it was all an unfortunate experience and decided to forgive him about the lie regarding the laboratory, since he actually apologized many many times.

Let's talk about the brother. It was actually his house, but he doesn't live in the country so when he is away we go there. Anyway, this brother was here and my boyfriend told me that he would leave with his father let's say on the 20th of sth. So brother and father together. Yesterday, he told me that they transported his father to the airport alone (we were talking about a past incident and it came up). I was perplexed since I remembered that he told me that they left together. Suspicion grew again, because if the brother had left earlier and on his own, then why didn't I know it? I asked him about it and he said that his brother left a day or two before his father but that he wasn't sure (that happened a month ago, how is it possible not to remember?). I didn't continue the conversation but it eats me. Why would he lie about that or then about the testing? Those lies seem like the have no purpose at all, or at least a purpose I can see. I don't think he is cheating by the way. He genuinely seems in love with me.

Breakup has been quite rough, as he's been doing certain things which o don't agree with. First of all all he has kept on saying after I have broken up with him is that he has the urge to kill himself. He's constantly saying it and last night after a fight (which I will explain why we were fighting in a but) that I am the person who had made him come the closest to doing it. He has been going around and having a pity party everywhere he goes, and because of that people have stopped hanging around with him. Bear in mind we are on the same college course and friend group. I have said multiple times that I'm down to be friends with him, but nothing more. He's now trying to also say that his social life is ruined because of me, but i have tried to make him feel included, until last night. There was a situation that happened like 2-3 days ago which kinda raised my suspicion. He texted me saying hey, and I ignored it as I was on ft with one of my friends.i didn't read it, I just saw the notification and ignored it. He then called me, sent me a few more messages, and the kept on calling me. He then texted me asking me why I was in the middle of a field, as he apparently saw me on snap maps when he opened it, by accident. I found it weird, but thought to myself maybe a coincidence. Yesterday, we finished college about half 4, and there's a bunch of forests around my college. I went in there to smoke a joint, and I was starting to come out of the forest I see him close to the entrance, by a tree that separates 2 paths into the forest. He was looking at his phone very closely, and it looked like he was zooming in on something, but i didn't see what exactly he was doing on his phone. I realized it was him, and he realised I saw him and he said ""oh I'm sorry I didn't realize you were here"". I found it so weird, especially because it was 1 hour after we had finished college. He said that he went to the gym and now his bus was like half hour late. Thing is tho, he's got 2 buses which he can take to get home and they each come 10 minutes after eachother. I brushed it off. I said I was walking to the bus stop and said to him that he can walk with. He gets his bus from in front of the college, and I have to walk about 5 mins to my bus stop. He said he'll walk my way as he can get the bus there too. There were 3-4 buses that had passed which he could've have gotten, and I tried to tell him to get the bus and go home, he said he'd rather wait for me to get on the bus. He kept on trying to talk to me, and I was being dry and tried to show him I clearly didn't want to talk to him.

I do feel like he confides in me a lot - reaches out whenever he is sad, happy, bored, scared, needs help, etc.

However, I realize that he gets uncomfortable whenever we have a disagreement, if I try to talk about us, or even whenever I apologize after we have a mini argument that took place earlier (aka bringing up an old topic that I feel I owe him an apology for). He always tries to change the topic or joke about other things. When conflict arises and I let him know how I feel about his actions, he usually apologizes, rarely defends himself and says that he will change his behavior - he does take it seriously, though.

At one point, I got really triggered because he wouldn’t care enough to discuss something that was bothering me. When I asked him if we could talk about it, he said we shouldn’t. And I, of course, got mad and extremely hurt because I felt like he didn’t care at all. However, he then almost begged me not to talk about it and said that the reason why he often doesn’t want to discuss such topics with me is because he cares a lot about our relationship and does not want to ruin it.

While I was really mad and couldn’t understand, I did some research and suspect he has a disorganized attachment style. Is this correct? Is anyone like this or has encountered this before - someone who does discuss their thoughts/feelings about everything other than things concerning their relationship with their confidant?

Also, I realized I’m an emotionally articulate person who loves to express myself (complimenting people, resolving conflicts, etc.) in relationships that I care about. I now wonder if it is my fault for assuming that a person would like to lay everything out to resolve conflict if they cared about the other person. Is it false?

One month into the relationship i fell pregnant with our son (8M). Things were okay in the relationship before we moved in together in 2019. 
Since moving in he seemed to have changed a lot, his behaviour became insufferable. 
Financially we are struggling a lot we sometimes have to lend money from family members just to get us by.
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him I'm literally sitting and waiting for him to take his anger out on us when things don't go his way.
He is very short tempered and stubborn he does not care who hears him when he starts shouting at us i sometimes have to beg him to keep his voice down.

I feel like the emotional connection is not there anymore, I'm too afraid to talk to him about how i feel or what upsets me because it will turn into him getting angry at me.
Everytime i try to talk to him he would shut me down or tell me I'm young I don't know what I'm talking about even when i offer him advice on things he would never listen to me but when someone else gives him the same advice he listens to them but not me.
I'm an introvert I'm very shy, soft and quiet whereas he is not.
When we intimate i feel absolutely nothing and i have voiced this to him that sex with him is no longer something i want and he told me as long as he is enjoying it he does not care how i feel.

Everyday I'm reminded by him of the shitty job i have that barely brings in money but bear in mind our salary is almost the same yet he throws it in my face everyday.
My mental health has gotten to the point where i have to take medication everyday. 
We barely spend time together as a family or go out on outings or go on dates, when i do suggest these things to him he tells me there's no money to do these things but I've asked to let us just be selfish for once and take our son out on a nice outing he would then remind me there is no money and gets angry at me for suggesting that.

My son adores his father even though his behaviour towards our son is the same he is to me, harsh.
When he acts like this my brain just shuts down and i pretend that I'm not hearing anything.

Partners is supposed to feel free and comfortable to talk to each other and uplifting each other but he has bring me down so many times I've missed so many opportunities in life because of him or when i suggest i want to study further to better our lives he would always shut it down and tell me I'm being selfish for just thinking about myself.

I say it’s tough situation, because we are still living together for another two months until our lease ends. I obviously have a lot of love for him, but I have decided after seven years of feeling, like my needs have not been met and my feelings are not considered. It would just be best for me to leave the relationship. I ended up trying my luck and making a bumble account which I never thought I would really do because I don’t really tend to be into the dating app thing, but I am a total homebody and I never go out, unless my friends invite me which most of the time I don’t even end up going. So I made an account and started hanging out with this guy somewhat local to the area. My intentions when I made it, we’re just to have a distraction and to cheer me up considering everything that is going on, I didn’t even think I would meet anybody and definitely not end up hanging out with them. But I ended up matching with this guy and we have so much in common and we have already hung out three times. I did not know if it would lead to anything, and because he is a complete stranger I did not disclose the fact that I am still living with my ex, after the second day, I realized I really can like him and it started making me feel horrible because I am not a liar, so I came clean and told him the truth about my living situation. He definitely said he was a little bummed that I wasn’t honest about it from the beginning, but he totally seems fine with that and I was making a bigger deal than he was. he’s not really asking too many questions and after I told him his consistency is 100% still the same he is still texting me every day all day and wanting to hang out.

He gave my brother and I each a house, which I'm very grateful for, however my brothers house is worth around $800,000 more than mine. He gave him $60,000 as a present to make it nice, whereas he spent $80 on a chair for mine. 


My brother already makes a high income, around $350,000 a year. My dad helps my brother by giving him around $800,000 to do day trading with, and my brother makes around $200,000 of his annual income from that. My dad will not invest in me in a similar way; he lent me $3000 and wanted me to pay him back - which would be fine, if not for the huge financial disparity.


I don't earn a lot of money and my brother already does, and it hurts me emotionally that this favouritism is so strong. My dad will give me a hard time over ordering even a pizza sometimes, but my brother gets whatever he wants, even though he already makes a ton of money. 


I don't want to be jealous as a person, as I think it's a very bad thing to be, but it's hard not to feel less loved than my brother. He has always given him more and favoured him more. It really hurts my feelings. I love my brother but he can also be a bit of a bully to me and laughs at me for having less than him. It's causing me to resent my family and the pain of that feeling hurts me. I only want to love them and feel positively towards them, and this is made much harder by how differently we are treated.

We knew each other since we were 8, I had a crush on him since then, we dated when we were early teens and reconnected when we were early/mid twenties.

He is my soulmate and the only person I've ever loved even though I've dated a few people. And the only person I've ever felt comfortable around and myself.

I have a skin disease called rosacea and not many will understand how this effects me daily. My skin will begin to heat up and flush uncontrollably for hours feeling it's on fire.it makes me feel physically sick and start shaking because my body is cold but my skin feels like it's being stung and hot...the whole thing overwhelms me and has left me broken. I've seen a dermatologist who has told me it's rare to diagnose someone this young and to see such extreme flushing, but here I am. And there's nothing to treat it just avoid triggers which is essentially every aspect of life, sun, skincare products, hot air, cold air, warm, spicy food, stress. 

I've had 17 jobs and had to quit all of them because of my social  and general anxiety and skin - which is interlinked. I also messed up every muscle in my back 10 months ago from a physical job which I'm having to see the chiropractor every other week for having regular massage. 

I feel like a broken person. I live in so much pain with my skin and my back.i feel like I'm fighting suicidal thoughts.i know I will never work again, at least not earning a decent wage. I will never be comfortable in the environments people without rosacea are.i can't be inside in heat, or air con and I can't be in the sun for 2 seconds without flaring.

When I met my boyfriend he wanted kids and I can see him being an amazing dad.after I've been honest and repeatedly said I can't have kids because of the trauma I go though, he now says he doesn't mind not having kids. I've even moved back with my parents because when I stopped working we couldn't afford our rented flat so now we are 3 hours away long distance.


But if it were to continue our relationship I would be financially dependent on him and feel like I was taking away his life opportunities like having kids, being able to live comfortably etc. I cry every time I think of brudening him in this way. And I wonder if the fair thing to do is end it and just live with my parents.

He wants to look after me but I'm so broken I feel like I can't being him anything but pain and financal burden. I feel like I'm in protection mode just trying to avoid triggers and keep myself alive, whereas he and everyone around me are working and earning a life.

We have a 4 kids, and a good relationship by all accounts. 

  My husband travels for work, and as of late it's been more and more frequent. (A bottle neck of a workload exploded after the lockdown and it's only getting stronger). 
  It's a good thing financially I'd course, and I've never minded him being gone. 

   We have a very healthy sex life when we're together. But when he's away it's complete radio silence.  He'll text me regular things, updates of his travels, call to facetime and see the kids...etc.  But at night when he'll text he's at his hotel safely, I'll try to respond with something sexy or intriguing, no pics or anything, just normal flirting  like ""I miss your sexy body"" or ""the things I'd like to do to you right now"". 
   And I will get zero response.  Absolutely nothing.  He may send a message half an hour later saying goodnight.  He'll definitely text me in the morning. 

  This issue will come up in waves. I'll give up after a while and just not try for months or even years, then he'll be gone a lot, or we'll have amazing sex right before he leaves that really has me thinking of him. And I'll try again.. only to be frustrated and kinda hurt. 

 When he gets home he's all over me. Wants to pick up right where we left off. But often I'm just annoyed at this point.  I feel like, how hard would it be for him to send me something, or at least not ignore my efforts to keep me interested for the two weeks he's been away? 

 
 I should note. I have talked to him about this, and he always says, yeah, he'll work on it.  He'll try to think of something to say..etc.  but never does.  

  Also, in person he's very confident and has no problem with dirty talk. He's more vocal in the bedroom than I am.  

 Also, I realize in the grande scheme of things I get this isn't a huge deal. We have a good relationship, and I can and probably will just give up on sexting. Just when he's gone for extended periods it would be nice to keep the flame lit so to speak..

So cause of our schedules, our 3rd date originally supposed to be this Monday, but I had mandated hours and she visted her family during the weekend. So we set up our 3rd date for this coming Sunday since it worked the best. She said she wanted to spend longer time with me, so we're doing like mini golf and grabbing some food after.

She goes ""the truman show is a good movie i really liked it, we should watch it one day :) ""

Me throwing ideas out there I say we should have a movie night and watch our favorite stuff, and she says that's perfect.

This year though, those two who had „drama“ have become close. Since moving in together, there‘s been this natural split down the middle with me and my friend on one side and the other two together, which did surprise me considering the „drama“ last year. But anyway, it’s good that they get on now. 


But, we had some issues with housekeeping: us 2 doing our chores and the other two not pulling their weight, whilst the bigger problem was that they were inviting these guys they knew over every single day without letting us know. To add to this, they ignored us which made us feel very uncomfortable in our own home. I called a ‚meeting‘ to confront them and find a solution because at the time I still wanted to fix things. But it’s becoming clear that the guys the have over are more than friends and they‘ve basically prioritised them over our friendship, which makes me sad. It‘s also come out that one of them has been talking about another behind her back, which is making things SO difficult to patch up. 

This has been going on for 1 month plus and I so badly want to fix things but I feel like this is one sided and that they just don‘t care. They‘d rather spend all their time with their new friends. My question is why couldn’t they split their time?? I just have no more energy to give, trying to fix this. My friend who was labelled ‚manipulative‘ behind her back is understandably pissed off and willing to be friendly for the sake of me, but doesn’t want a friendship like we used to have. 

I need advice on what to do, because now I‘m in the middle. I don‘t think I‘ve been unreasonable but things are just getting too much to bare and I feel like other friends outside of the house are getting dragged into it, which makes me feel guilty.

My girlfriend (just turned 29) and I (30) have been seeing each-other 11 months.

Currently she is travelling the past 3 weeks in south-east Asia with 2 weeks more to go.
Once she is back we go on a small holiday skiing for two weeks, and then she goes travelling in Central America early January again for another 3 months at least.

I’m currently struggling with the long-distance part of the relationship. She wants to do these trips now, and I can visit her when she’s in central America for a week or two, but otherwise won’t see her for a couple months. There are less grand things I want to do (but equally important to me) closer to home, which are probably secondary to her plans.

It’s been bothering me a lot recently as I miss the companionship and know I have a couple months coming up where we won’t get to go on hikes, hang-out, play tennis, share life’s day-to-day. So last night we had a phonecall discussing this.

In the phonecall it came up that she wants us to move in together when she gets back from her travels, and then she’s thinking about kids. I have always wanted kids, but maybe in 4 years (she would be 32/33), not in the next 1-2 years. The rate at which things are accelerating is alarming, especially considering I won’t see her, get to know her more or share my company with her the next couple months, and then we jump to the next big milestone?

I understand girls have a biological clock and time is critical, but I feel like things have accelerated exponentially. I also I thought a healthy relationship would be aligning to things approximately, enjoying each other and getting to know each other, making decisions as you grow as a couple, and then crossing the boundary of bringing children into the world? Instead it feels like her pace is far quicker than mine in pushing towards these things. At the same time I love her and care for her, want the best for her, and am super sad to think about losing her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you determine what the best course for you was? I’m currently thinking of calling it quits while she travels, to let things calm, and if we cross paths down the road afterwards, then great.

Tl:dr; relationship accelerating at pace far quicker than expected, punctuated by a block of long distance.

By this time we will have been dating for over a year and be in our third year of college. We will each be a year older and have been good friends since 15 and 16. We are thinking of getting an apartment between our colleges. The commute would be 20 minutes for both since we want it even. Both of us have lived with roommates for the past two years (one of which I was in a different state so we didn't see each other), and will have to work on top of our classes. Given that I am an engineering student with a minor, and she is a math student with a minor we know we will have commitments that come first, so at most we would see each other on weekdays like 8 pm to 8 am. Living together outside of our campuses would save us each about 600 dollars a month since we will both have jobs that pay 20/hour. Knowing these jobs will be stable allows us to know what price range we can look into. Right now we see each other every weekend and are friendly with each other friends and families. We are not best friends with each other friends because we both understand we need separate friend groups to have space away from each other. Lastly, over the summer, we did have to sleep in a car together a few times due to bad households. We both prioritize mental health and will both be in therapy. Someday, we hope to do couples therapy once we graduate. This is a very secure relationship and we worry about each other wellbeing's physically and emotionally. Eating has been a struggle in the past for both of us and now we always check on each other and be firm when we need to. It's truly amazing to have someone look out for me like this. Also, we both have already been through our drinking and partying phases, and yes we do partake sometimes, but both of us have learned those things are not good in excess or on weeknights. I think I'm just trying to say we keep ourselves and each other accountable for things like that. 

Typing this out I think we will be fine to move in together. I just have commitment issues and worry about what other people think. My only worry is we are too young, but honestly, I think given we both want simple lives and know how not to resolve conflict we will be ok. It will be month-to-month rent so if it does go bad we can move. Can someone please just make sure my reasoning is ok?

Here are some important key factors 
TW: talk about abuse/sex abuse
-I’m 19(F) my bf is 22(M). We’ve been dating for a long time now and have lived together almost the entire time.
-I was molested until i was 4 by my biological father. Once my mom found out , we moved and she remarried and when i was about 5-6, i was molested by my cousin once. Due to this, I developed bipolar depression. I was diagnosed with it when i was about 12, and my parents never sought treatment for me. Growing up i still wanted a relationship with my father but he consistently got my hopes up and let me down. I believe i’ve got some sort of father /daddy issues now because of it, as all of my relationships have lead to me seeking men who take authority over me and i latch onto men very quickly so when they hurt me i feel like i relive the pain and disappointment i felt from my dad.

Now to where I need help. My boyfriend is an amazing boyfriend for the most part. He’s nothing like any of the men i’ve met before and treats me exceptionally well. We have our bumps in the road but that’s mainly due to lack of communication. I’m worried my BPD affects our relationship and i’m not sure what to do about it and how to fix it. I have my episodes where i’m very clingy and need him around me 24/7. He’s currently sleeping on the couch to get away from me.

My problem is when i get upset about something, and try to voice what he did to upset me, he blows me off or turns it into this huge argument. He’s said some hurtful things this last week that’s hard for me to get over. One of the things he’s said was that  he’s emotionally detached from me and that’s because he feels drained from me. that i need too much from him. and was throwing the option of taking a break in the air. 

My problem is he works 7am-5pm or 6pm. He gets home, showers, and plays video games until he comes to bed and almost immediately goes to sleep once he’s in bed. we’re also not very sexually active anymore (which he said it’s from the emotional detachment), which we used to be very sexually active. i’ll ask him if we can and he’ll lead me on, giving me false hope saying we can when he gets off the game and then gets in bed and goes straight to sleep. There’s been a few times where we DID end up having it but he was half asleep and so i wasn’t all the way into it because it felt so forced, like he didn’t want to do it but was just doing it to shut me up. which he verified was true in our last argument. basically saying he wasn’t in the mood but only did it because i made him feel bad about NOT doing it (which wasn’t my intention i was just upset he promised we could and then wouldn’t when it was time). now this makes me feel like i r*ped him or something.

&amp; I feel upset because i feel like i’m in a one-way relationship. i feel like i’m fighting with a wall when i voice what he’s doing is hurting me. i’ve threatened to leave, i’ve packed all my stuff and loaded it into my car twice now and THATS when he said he was sorry and will fix things and understands where i’m coming from. i’m mainly upset over just not being heard, i don’t hardly care about the rest, i just want him to understand, there are things emotionally I need from him that i’m not receiving. 
But the thing is, he’s not sorry and he doesn’t understand, he’s just telling me what i want to hear so we can stop because he’ll do the SAME thing literally a day later.

I’m not sure what to do. Am i just feeling this way because of my BPD? Is our relationship doomed? What can I do to fix this, i don’t want to lose him but he’s already emotionally no longer here and i’m not sure how to work things out :(. I’m thinking about just no longer sharing my feelings and just not caring anymore but i feel wrong doing that as that’s what makes me, me. I just don’t think I can be in a relationship where i’m not understood.

To add, i gave up EVERYTHING for him. I was supposed to leave for the military and ended up not going because i met him before i shipped out and couldn’t leave him. I moved 2 hours from my family and friends, and quit my job to move in with him. I’ve literally lost everything i had planned because i wanted to be with him so i gave it all up and i don’t regret it for a second. i just don’t want this to end and feel like i lost all of that for nothing.

I am into fitness and enjoy swimming, biking, running, and other outdoor activities. When I was dating my husband, before we were married, this was something we had in common. I didn’t push him to do these things, he already was before we met. We used to work out, go on hikes, and spend time doing these hobbies together. Staying healthy and in shape is important to me and it seemed important to him too. 

Shortly after we got married, his habits seemed to change. He spent less and less time exercising and more and more time sitting on the couch. I would go out for a bike ride or activity and ask if he wanted to join me, but the answer became no thanks more and more often. Now he spends most of his free time sitting on the couch watching TV. His diet hasn’t changed, but due to his lack of exercise he has gained weight. I check in in him to make sure he’s alright, and he seems happy, he just doesn’t care about exercise any more. He will do something active about once a week, but it used to be almost a daily thing for us.

I’m frustrated because it seems like as soon as we got married he just stopped trying. Being healthy and looking good are important to me, and based on our time dating, I thought it was important to him too. I do love him and care about him and I want him to have a good quality of life, which doesn’t seem to go well with being sedentary. I also selfishly want him to look good. I am still attracted to him, it’s just tough because I feel like he will never be as in shape as he was when we were dating, and that’s the man that I fell in love with. On the weekend when we have a free day, I will spend a few hours outside and exercising, and he won’t have moved from his spot on the couch. I will always love him, it just seems like he is different as my husband than he was as my boyfriend. 

I have tried just gently encouraging him to work with me, but he doesn’t seem to be interested anymore.

I realized that he constantly crossed boundaries and that I didn't like him at all. I told him I needed space. This is when the concerning behavior started. 

After telling him I needed space, he would flip between asking me why I didn't want to be with him and pretending that I was the one being unreasonable/causing trouble. 

I told him that he was starting to freak me out and that he should not talk to me. 

After that he would show up to the bar and just stare at me. To the point where other people started to notice and asked if I was okay. I told them that I thought he was creepy, but harmless. About once a week I'd receive really strange text messages from him. They either didn't make any sense at all or where trying to accuse me of something. I ignored all of them, but kept screen shots. 

This behavior continued on for about a little over a month. He'd come to the bar and stare at me, then send me some weird message in the same week.

I decided to just brush it off, until I started to feel unsafe. I went to an IHOP with my friends late one night and he walked in with another man. I thought nothing about it and saw him get sat across the restaurant. About fifteen or twenty minutes later, I feel someone staring at me and we make direct eye contact. I think he moved seats, so that he could stare at me. I let me friends know what was going on. It was obvious that he and the man were talking about us. At one point the other man turned around to look at our group (teenagers). He was a big old scary looking guy in about his mid 40s to 50s. We had to walk buy his table and he had the nerve to fist bump one of my friends. 

After that, I decided to let the owner of the bar what was going on. I am close to the owner and the bartenders, as I cook for the bar every other week, I'm considered apart of the family. The owner of the bar is military and my stalker just came back from deployment when I met him. The owner advised me to send him one final warning text and then we'd see how he responded. I sent the warning text and it didn't deliver, because he blocked me.

I thought that was the end of everything, but a couple days later I saw my stalker talking to the owner outside of the bar. I walked up to the owner and my stalker tried talking to me like everything was normal. I informed the owner that this was the guy and went inside for my safety. The owner told my stalker that he wasn't welcome back at the bar. Of course, stalker tried to convince the owner I was crazy. 

Over the next couple weeks, the bar and the owner received messages from stalker saying that I was crazy and all of these measures were unnecessary. Of course, all screenshots were sent to me.

I'm worried that his behavior will continue to escalate. All of his text messages are incoherent and not grounded in reality. Spelling errors, grammar errors, it's like they were sent by an elementary aged child. He has accused me of lying about the whole thing, breaking into his apartment (??), harassing him, and basically everything under the sun. He has also said he talked to his people and even if i were to call the police at the second location (IHOP?) they wouldn't help me. He has also said he has filed police reports against me? 

First of all, he's saying false stuff about me. Second of all, I'm afraid he will escalate to hurting me or people at the bar. 

I have screenshots and multiple eye witnesses confirming the truth. However, I don't really know what could be done. If I or the bar get a restraining order against him, what if he escalates to violence? I want to keep the bar safe. He is in the army and is currently in the reserves attending my university. It sounds like he needs a psych evaluation or something.

These situations happened like weekly or every 2-3 weeks. Like I never know maybe in the next hours or days she'll ask to breakup or not.

This time, we have another argument together. And as usual, discussion about ending the relationship etc. happened. The trigger was because I didn't *give* enough to her. As simple as, sending food deliveries for her, or people in her house, etc.

Honestly speaking, I don't know what I need to do. Tried everything but I feel that I have to constantly pursue material things to satisfy her. Give 'em something or anything - just the act of giving stuff and more. 

Maybe it's not a wise decision to ask opinion to people in the internet. But at least I can share a story and know what others think.

Personally, I'm on the edge of ending this all the way and cut everything off. Since I never say that I want to end the relationship, but now I feel I had quite enough of the debates.

So my (m25) sons (M5) mother (F24) has been acting a little different lately. I’ll give some background on my relationship with her, so we get on extremely well and we’ve tried to get back together several times and though we are both seeing different people it’s obvious there is still a bit of a spark (flirty convos etc calling me baby babe hun)

So last week she invited me in for a brew and immediately started asking me about my sex life which I found weird when she has a boyfriend, she went on to tell me that she doesn’t sleep with her boyfriend much and there’s no emotional connection and she’s even thought about ending it with him but didn’t as my son really likes him. She said she has spoken to him and he has improved a bit though.

She went on holiday 2 days later with him as already booked in and whilst she was on holiday I took my lad to the zoo with a girl I’ve just started seeing (she did not know I was seeing this girl until she asked who I was going the zoo with)

She asked loads of questions about her and I could tell it bothered her but she was okay about the situation as my son really liked her.

When she got back home she seemed to constantly be asking me what me and my lad are doing it seemed like she was being nosey and my guess is because of the girl I’m now seeing.

So I’m working on my house and decorating it and she’s said for months if I need help ask her so I did and she agreed to help this Saturday, but what I find strange is she’s said she will bring her boyfriend to help us paint! I find this strange! She knows it would be a weird vibe and what makes it stranger it’s her boyfriends bday on Saturday and she’s agreed to help me paint and bring him to do so. She said her boyfriend is going to his parents in the morning but can come down to us and help us later on! I just find it so weird 

I don’t get why shes bringing him like who would suggest bringing your boyfriend to paint the ex boyfriends house on his birthday
