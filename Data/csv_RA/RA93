I knew this going in and he was pretty clear that this was going to be part of the deal for us to be together, but I am having trouble adjusting.***

My husband's mother is a widow and she and her son, my husband, are very close. He has two brothers, but one died and the other is estranged from the family. He grew up in South America in a pretty patriarchal culture. His mother married as a teenager and went right from living with her parents to living with her husband. She has never spent a day alone in her life, and the men her life made all her decisions.

His father died of a heart attack when my MIL was 54. She was still pretty young, but it was a complete shock to her system. Her husband took care of everything financial, in fact, everything that didn't involve housework or raising the kids. She was also very shy and he was warm and extroverted. I think he had a sort of paternalizing relationship with her, which she thrived under. 

When his father died (this was shortly before we met), my husband took a leave of absence from his job in the States to move back in with her and get everything in the estate and her life situated. 

She learned the basics, how to pay the bills, how to use a computer, how to call people to repair things, how to figure out an appliance needs to be replaced (you'd be surprised what life skills people don't learn when they never really live on their own). But she still was very dependent on having a man around. For instance, she could call a repairman to come, but was scared to be alone with one in the house. She could tell that the refrigerator was cooling well enough anymore, but it seemed impossible to for her to learn how to decide which new one to buy.

We kind of hoped her brother and sister, or maybe some cousins (who live there in South American) could help, but they have busy lives, and it seems her neediness wears people out. Plus, there is clearly plenty of their own family drama from always and they are not all that close and helpful to each other.

We have worked hard to help her rebuild her life - encouraged her to have friends, find rewarding work, have active and mentally stimulating personal interests. And she has responded to this, somewhat. But, in the end, not matter how many friends she has and how full her day si, she comes home to an empty house and the real meaning of her life - to take care of her husband and family - is gone. I now realize there is only so much we can do. In her culture, a woman depends on a man, and if her husband dies, then her adult son takes care of her, usually by moving her into his home. It's not a culture of older women going back to college to get their degrees or moving into retirement communities where they play pickleball and have margarita parties.

We've discussed having her move in with us in the US but decided that's not the best idea for a few reasons. She doesn't speak English, and moving her here would deprive her of everything she knows except us. Her whole life that she's built would be gone. Also, I don't think it would be the best thing for either of our mental health.

So, the compromise is that they (my husband and his mother) speak on the phone every day, sometimes multiple times. And, if anything important needs to be done - a home repair, a medical procedure - my husband flies back to be with her and help.  The phone calls are a commitment, she calls any time she feels stressed or worried about something (even if she just forgot one of her passwords or can;t do something on the computer). Not all the calls are distress calls, the rest are just daily calls, so she doesn't feel so alone. The travel accounts for all his vacation time and personal days from work, plus a few others he manages by working more time, holidays, FMLA allotments, and generally being very productive, so he gets a lot of leeway.

This means my husband is away a lot, and a lot of our couple time is spoken for time with his mother. Honestly, I admire how well he has been able to set limits with his mother and family. The pressure is immense for him to move us all down there to take care of her, and he wants to have his own life and let us have ours. And, as much as he talks to and supports his mother, it's probably 10% of what she really wants. He just tells her he can't be her husband and mine. He loves her, he supports her, but he needs to have his own life, and he honestly believes that  if she wasn't in so much emotional distress all the time she would want that for him, too.

But, we don't get to have vacations together, we never travel anywhere except to SA to stay with his mother (which are actually mixed experiences for me, both horrible due to family dynamics and nice because I actually like where they live - for a visit). In the evening, after every dinner, he goes to his office and talks to his mother for usually 30 to 60 minutes and comes back pretty depleted. I now know that if we need to have a serious talk about anything, it better happen before dinner because he is shut off for the rest of the night just recovering. I would love for us to just have regular couple tiem in the evenings

I thought I could cope with this in our marriage, but I didn't realize how much it would coopt our lives. We don't even go on a date night without him being sure to call his mother before we go so she doesn't worry he's not calling in the evening. I realize now her neurotic issues of being so worried all the time, being alone, and having to make all her own decisions all the time is not curable. It's too deeply rooted in her, it comes from her whole culture, and it's all she has ever known. I think she feels like an object of pity to her family, and they think her sons have abandoned her and maybe she's a bad mother because they don't want to help.

And a big thing is that my husband only has so much emotional energy, and a lot of that goes to his mother. We have an affectionate relationship, and the sex is great. Still, a lot of time, I don't tell him about what's really going on with me, because I know he is just emotionally overwhelmed already. He has thanked me for this many times, and says he is appreciative of how emotionally independent I am (I also have a good therapist and good friends, which helps, my parents and sister have passed away, though). He says over and over, he'd never be able to this, have his own life, have a family, live away from his family, without all my strength and support. 

So I feel super shitty for feeling like I want to be his mom in some ways. I want to be the one who can talk to him him any time about whatever bothers me and he drops everything to help me. Or who really tells him about my own stresses, worries, demons, and insecurities. I feel like she is so open with him and he is so supportive. I don't feel we have that type of relationship anymore.

I want to be the one he lives with for weeks just to help me with whatever I need, cook me meals, take me out to nice places, and buy me nice gifts. It's not like my husband never does that with me, but not the same way or to the same extent. When I ask him why he doesn't take me out shopping to buy me clothes, or jewelry, or perfume, he just says that I have my own money and can get anything I want, I don't need him. He says we don't need to have so many nice dinners our or spend just days doing nice things together because we live together and see each other all the time, his mother barely gets to see him. (His mother is also the kind of mamma that won't do anything nice for herself unless you do it for her, very self-sacrificing). I don't want it all the time, just *some* time. I know this is a manipulative game many mothers play with their kids, but it's hard to get around.)

I've talked to my husband about going to couples therapy, but he is resisting because he says he is 100% sure he is already doing his best with what he has. While this may or may not be true, I think he is not in a place to benefit from therapy in that mindset. I won't give him an ultimatum about that, because I see that as manipulative and untrue - I won't leave him if we don't do this. I also think the idea of more serious emotional labor scares him because he's barely getting by as it is.

I know her family and they all like me. We are in love and feelings aren’t in question, but I just can’t bring myself to date her again. She has been wanting to start actually dating again but I just don’t feel it’s something I’m ready for despite wanting to be able to. She has been a lot more adamant on starting to date especially more recently, I am fully committed to her, and I tell her this and show it a lot, but for some reason the title feels like an amount of commitment I can’t give right now. I feel I treat her better, put a lot more effort and I am a lot nicer to her than she is to me, and this isn’t just my opinion, but one of a lot of people around us. 

She lives with another girl (20F) who is essentially a stepsister/roommate so it happens that all three of us hang out a lot of the time. I have known both of them for a while (5 years or so) and am pretty close with both of them. I have always had an interest or like a thing for her roommate, nothing major at all, more of a general curiosity I’d say. In more recent time we have gotten more close and I find her very easy to talk to and get along with (easier than the person I’m in the situationship with). Sometimes it’s easier to talk to her about certain things because she can understand me more living with my ex so she sees certain mannerisms or habits that can be annoying or frustrating. We are also a lot more similar and have a lot more in common than I do with my ex, we have the same stance and opinions on a lot of things, we have almost the exact same music taste, almost all takes on relationships are the same, as well as mannerisms and habits. Having gotten more closer in recent time has only highlighted my interest in her and has made me more curious of things with her. 

A few weeks ago the three of us went clubbing with a couple of friends (5 total) and we were all having a very good time. A lot of the night I was flirting with my ex as well as her roommate and it seemed like we were all having a good time and nothing was out of the ordinary as I am a flirty person when I am drunk. Cut to the morning after when my friend who was out with us said to me “I don’t want to get involved but you know __ is into you right?” He was explaining to me that she was flirting with me a lot of the night and how it was very clear to everyone around that she was into me. I don’t think my ex remembers it because she was pretty drunk and based off of her character she would have brought it up by now. I have brought up the flirting to her and she says she remembers pieces of it so do I, particularly one where we locked eyes and my heart dropped and I felt something (I did not tell her this part) and we both remember being very close a lot of the night. 

Me and my ex were each others first loves, and we both have little experience outside of each other. We both see that we have a future together and want one together. But I think I have feelings for her roommate and I think she does with me. After my friend mentioned it to me, I have noticed and remembered past times where flirting or insinuating could’ve occurred from her end without me noticing. She has “joked” a few times about how mine and my ex’s star signs are not compatible in the slightest but ours are almost perfect for each other, and has never denied anything when the topic occurred and just said she “wouldn’t go there with her”(my ex). My interest/feelings for her is something even before that night at the club I have been trying to suppress, but it seems to be getting harder and harder. It’s something that is very terrifying to bring up, because once I ask her if she has feelings for me (and if she says she does) and vice versa there’s no real going back and I’d have to break it off with my ex, but idk if I’d even be able to be with her because my ex’s family would hate me and it would be difficult to have a relationship where the family hates me. 

I feel really guilty because I think I’d be able to date this girl if it were possible, even though I can’t bring myself to date my ex. I just don’t know if she even likes me back, or if it is worth bringing up, or I should just continue to suppress the feelings and maybe eventually they will go away.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7519629,public,self,Do I ruin things with my current s/o for her roommate?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yshw19/do_i_ruin_things_with_my_current_so_for_her/,all_ads,6,,,

He then asked me if I expected the man to pay. I ignored this question because I found it stupid--if he was going to ask me out, then I am his guest and he needs to pay. So I moved on.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance. He complained about the menu prices the entire time and made me really uncomfortable. I guess he noticed this because as soon as he saw me looking uncomfortable he rubbed my leg and suggested he really wanted to pay. The total for both of us was 55.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out.

Im an average guy (M,17) its the same old story I have a crush on one of my old classmate ,(F 17) form 2 years back (i didn't , back then) .
We weren't such good friends but didn't hate each other either. just joking around  
Our schools changed after 10th grade i then came in touch with her social media and im a loner so i just kinda fell for the girl i was annoyed back then
Many of my friends and one of teacher thought we were in a relationship cuz we really goofed and made fun of each other
We interacted on social media very often and i used to send her memes and all and she added me on snap (for streaks)


May 2022 came and i was confused in life

Iam from rural India so relationships aren't normalised here ..I knew she was way out of my league cuz she is really a good person but i couldn't help falling for her ..life was going downhill and a close relative of mine died too so i thought i'll just tell her , get all this off of my chest and get blocked to get this over with ....She didn't block me but didn't say much just ""im not interested in this relationship thingy""

This made my anxious ass more anxious 

She kinda ghosted me for a day or two and we went back to same routine but now her snaps were blank (which came back to normal after a month or two) and she just left those memes on seen ...

About a month later i apologized to her for all this she responded with ""Its okayy"" but at this point a friend of mine (his cousin) told he saw the chats but we didn't talk about it much 

My anxiety and overthinking grew overtime and i came to a conclusion that im probably just a inside joke in her friends circle

At this point i just have a delusional hope that she didn't block me cuz maybe she'll change her mind later or sum

I broke down to him for the final time last night begging him to meet me half way with fixing things.

My girlfriend (25F) and I (26M) have been together for almost 5 years. Our relationship has never been easy, but we tried our best to always improve and help each other grow. But I am noticing some form of pattern that is starting to drain me mentally. 

When our relationship is doing well, she’s kind loving and tells me “she feels set with me” or “I want to marry you”. But when things are rough, I am basically a “waste of time”. She would say things like “I’ve lost all respect for you and attraction” and then proceeds to unfriend me on everything and basically “ghost me”. 

We fight about petty small things that escalate to something bigger and we’re both at fault for that. But when things get tough, she’s just a completely different person. I understand you’re angry, but I feel like this isn’t an excuse for her to disrespect me and disregard how her words make me feel. 

In the beginning of our relationship, she was very suicidal. She would physically harm herself when things get tough, and I remember being so sad because we had a small argument and I was trying to reason with her and she physically started hitting her face until her nose started bleeding, and I couldn’t do anything so I had to call her dad. 

Then it turned into her being verbally and physically abusive with me, and despite all of that, I told her that she can improve and be better and she has been. But lately, I find myself with a bitter taste in my mouth because she’s never apologized for any of the things she’s done to me. I’ve never heard her genuinely apologize without “victimizing” herself even though it’s her fault. 

Despite all of these things she’s done, I decided to see the good in her and stay with her and pray that we can get through these tough patches of our relationship. And I know I am not perfect, there were plenty of things I’ve done that I completely regret and I’ve been trying everyday to get better and I think I have. 

Despite this, I feel that whenever we get into these small arguments, she genuinely makes me feel so little and then when I completely had it with her behaviour and start to get really upset, she makes me feel like I am not “allowed” to get upset. 

She’s notorious for walking away and bringing up “breaking up” and ignoring me for a few days without any form of communication when we get into a fight and it actually affected me so much because I would constantly chase and tell her “the fight wasn’t worth it” to lose you and her usual response is “you’re the worst” and many other fucked up things I don’t have room to write about. 

I’ve confronted her about these and she says she “understands” but proceeds to make me feel the same way and I end up begging her to work it out and come back every time.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7519553,public,self,I feel like my girlfriend doesn’t actually realize the things she’s put me through,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yshln5/i_feel_like_my_girlfriend_doesnt_actually_realize/,all_ads,6,,,

He was not contributing much to the relationship and I became frustrated as I felt like I wasn’t a priority in his life as he would often cancel plans last minute. It felt like a one sided relationship when it was long distance but we got on amazingly in person. I used to tell him this upset me but things would never change. I got fed up and started to think about leaving him when I discovered the severity of his depression. I changed my mind about leaving because I realized he is having a tough time mentally and I felt that explained why he has been distant and I wanted to be there for him.

I encouraged him to seek help for his struggles but he refused to do so and then he broke up with me soon after i discovered how bad it was. 
His reason for breaking up was that he couldn’t feel love or any emotions other than hopelessness and I deserved better and he knew that he had hurt me and he wanted me to find someone who could treat me better. This broke my heart and I told him I wanted to support him and help him get through it but he just kept crying saying that I needed someone better.

I was gutted to say the least and I was incredibly concerned about him as I felt he was experiencing some kind of mental breakdown.

Two days after we broke up he contacted me to say he had made a huge mistake and he desperately wants us to get back together but he wanted to be completely honest with me and he confessed that at the beginning of our relationship when we were exclusive but still did not know eachother very well that he had kissed two other girls about two months into our relationship and that the reason he had been struggling with intimacy is that he felt so guilty because at the time he still hadnt developed feelings for me but when we stopped being long distance his feelings grew and he seriously regretted it and it was eating him alive.

I was shocked by this information but I for some reason didn’t feel sad or even angry which has confused me as I always thought if I was cheated on I would be devastated. It is both of ours first serious relationship.

He said they were random girls and he was drunk but he knows being drunk is not a valid excuse. He wants to get back together but says he knows he doesn’t deserve me. I can’t tell if he is still trying to manipulate me or if he’s being genuine. 

I have told him I think he need’s professional help and I think I would consider taking him back but only if I could see he was making an effort to change and get to the root of whatever triggered him to cheat on me twice. I loved our relationship even if it was only 6 months but I can’t be with him until he deals with his own internal issues.

I’m looking for advice, should I forgive him because it was early in the relationship and we were long distance. Should I only forgive him if I see he starts trying to work on himself? Or should I just leave. I still care deeply about him and get in very well with his family but he won’t tell his family about the depression.

I don't like eating anymore and am always afraid of upsetting her. Help?

My sister has kind of a thing about people eating. If she even thinks someone hasn't eaten, she will make them food and expect them to eat all of it. I appreciate the fact she makes food, but she has made my relationship with food a lot worse.

For example, if I eat something and she doesn't know about it, she'll make me even more food and I'm kind of expected to eat it all or she gets really upset. If she sees me do anything *but* shovel food that she made, that I made, or that someone else made into my mouth she gets upset. If I have food I just could not finish for one reason or another, she gets really upset. This has resulted in me hiding my food dishes with the unfinished food on them, just so she wont see them, and occassionally forcing myself to eat and reheat and eat it over the span of a few days/all day. Just to make her happy.

I have asked her not to cook for me, assured her that (while I appreciate it) she doesn't have to. She has a lot on her plate right now, and will often tell me to make my own food - which I'm fine to do and tell her as such. But if I don't make food on her timescale, during the frame of time she wants me to (and never tells me about), she will make food and slam my door and be all upset and leave me very confused. This morning she, kindly, brought me breakfast (she really didn't have to), and saw the food she made me last night that I didn't really eat. I didn't eat it, because last night I had already eaten and way beyond stuffed - I really couldn't eat anymore. She took the plate, slammed the door, and is upset with me now.

However, John and I don't only have a gap in age, he has also had significantly less life experience than I have and I don't know if it was the education system that is to blame, the Bible thumping upbringing, or just a natural disposition, but John also does not have strong critical thinking or analytical skills. 

This combined with an already natural tendency to push back against societal norms means that means that he gets pulled into different conspiracies and extreme life style trends. If I try to coax him to employ critical reasoning against some of the glaring red flags, he just gets kind of over whelmed and confused. And because he is so introverted and doesn't have much of a network of friends, I feel like the bad guy consistently being the only one around to question him. 

So there's that. But there's also his very limited vocabulary, no knowledge of any cultural happenings for the first 23 years of his life (I blame the Bible thumping upbringing for that one) and just generally having a very simple style of humor. All of this combined means that he's just not really picking up what I'm putting down a lot of the time.. a lot of statements get met with, ""...what??"", jokes fall flat, or I just keep them to myself cause I'm not sure if he'll get it. Most philosophical musings or deeper conversations of the human experience are not conversations, they just turn into me ranting until I'm exhausted by the one sidedness and change the topic to something simple like how the cats are doing. 

So here I am sitting with the ickiest thing I could have to ask someone to work on.. like.. can you just.. try to be a little smarter? And I don't know how to ask him to work on his intellect without making him feel like he's not good enough for me or an abject idiot. Because in so many other ways he's a wonderful partner.

Watch how he treats his mother. Because one day he will treat you just like he treats her now. Please believe me. They may hide how they interact when your the new girlfriend. That first birthday or holiday you spend with his family. Watch. I didn't think my future husband would ever talk to me with the lack of respect he did with his Mom. For a long time he didn't. When I started showing my age and having my own ideas it began. The amount of contempt and level of hate is devastating to me. He even talks about me behind my back like he did with her. Not only that he believes what motivated her motivates me. Doing things just as to be a bitch. So please ladies watch how he treats his Mum, because it's a mirror of  how he treats you when you're old.

Been together 2yrs and live together. Yesterday he mentioned that he was going to visit his friend that lives an hour away from us and they were going game together or whatever. He took the Xbox with him which he’s never done. He definitely arrived by 5pm but I had to text him at 11pm asking how it was going.. he was dismissive “good over here! hby” we know each others texts and something just felt off about it I can’t explain it…. I give him his space to enjoy himself with friends and alone time but this felt off. His actions throughout the night has me convinced that he was with someone else. 

2am comes and haven’t received an update on whether or not he’s coming home tonight… I know I’m not being overbearing because we always shoot each other quick texts here and there when we’re out with friends, work, gym, etc. And in the 2yrs we’ve lived together neither of us have ever stayed out that late. Plus I know he’d be confused/concerned if it was me that was out all night without explanation.

I called him at 2:15am, he answered. Didn’t hear anything in the background no video games and no friend. I stayed calm over the phone. Talking to him over the phone felt like pulling teeth when trying to get him to answer my questions. Plus he was still trying to act like nothing was wrong.. Like what the hell is this?? He ended up coming home at 3am, sorry but I don’t believe for a second he spent 10hrs playing video games with his friend who is married and has a damn job to get to in the morning. Like what??

Next day and I’m still very much annoyed. He hasn’t apologized for coming home late, hasn’t asked why I’m upset (because I told him I was), hasn’t done shit but act like nothing is wrong and tried hugging/kissing me. I noticed he hasn’t wanted to kiss me on the lips ever since he came home last night though..

Although they didn’t date that long, she came at a time where he was still getting over his feelings for his ex that left him in December of last year. That relationship lasted about 2 years and when she broke up with him it led him to a really bad depression and now he takes medication for it. Anyways, we’ve only been talking for about three weeks and he wanted to come clean to me and told me that he had sex with his most recent ex two times while talking to me. He told me it was a one time thing because she wanted to have sex with him, and that it meant nothing. He told me that he doesn’t have feelings for her anymore, but would still like to be her friend because he cares about her well being, but apparently she doesn’t want to be friends with him. I always thought it was weird wanting to be friends with an ex, so I asked him if there’s another reason for wanting to be her friend? And he said he just really enjoyed being around her, that he would be very lucky to still have her in his life, but she doesn’t feel the same way. According to him, she has blocked him from all social media and blocked his number. 

I asked him why they broke up and he said, “I genuinely did not deserve her. She was too good for me.” He told me that he had feelings for another woman while dating her and that they were incompatible romantically. He said he didn’t love her as much as she deserved. He’s currently in therapy working through his issues regarding this whole situation. I also found out the other woman he had feelings for is one of our coworkers and that they’re friends. He told me that he doesn’t have feelings for his coworker anymore and that he’s in therapy working on healing from this experience.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance. He complained about the menu prices the entire time and made me really uncomfortable. I guess he noticed this because as soon as he saw me looking uncomfortable he rubbed my leg and suggested he really wanted to pay. The total for both of us was 55.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out.

And when plans change I just want to be informed w out having to ask about what happened and why and what the new plan is etc. This is a common theme throughout our relationship. We tried resolving but cannot come to a resolution. He said I need to admit I’m wrong and hear him out. Which I did admit to being wrong and stating that I don’t want to pester. And then I tried explaining why I feel the way I feel and what kind of communication I value/what kind of communication would help me. And he said I’m making it all about me and blaming him.

I did love this man but I know for a fact that he never loved me even though he told me I was his oxygen and that he was only happy when with me. I fell for the lies. Some days, it felt as if I was his girlfriend and some other days, just a hookcup he would come to at night, get what he wanted and then leave. I tried to break up with him several times because I finally ubderstood I deserved better than that. But we ended up getting back together. This lasted for about 4 years, until the pandemic. At that time, I ended things with him. A few months ago, he came back and told me his wife left him and he that he liked me. I rejected him. 

Last week, I met this guy, T., who makes me think of O. a lot. He is also older than me, they physically look alike, have the same tone of voice, uses the same expressions sometimes, have this way of looking at me that makes be blush. Little things, stupid things, really. I know this sounds ridiculous but whenever I see these resemblances, I freak out. I feel fear. Even though T. is lovely, nice and all one could hope for.

I don't understand why I feel scared because I don't think I was in an abusive relationship with O. Or was I?
I want things to work out with T. but I don't know how to deal with this feeling of fear.

She has 2 kids from an earlier relationship. And her relationship with her ex is well... problematic. Long story short, he plays nice in front of others but is an complete ass to her han have been for year before they broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend (F30) and her childhod friend (F30) meet up at her friends house once every 1-3 month for playdates since they have kids around the same age.

&amp;#x200B;

I've met both her friend and her husband. They are nice, and I've nothing against them on a polite and social level, I'm totally okay with meeting up with them somewere for a night out, a dinner whatever. My GF can hang out with them as much as she want too, I just feel like they are more her friends than mine (she have other friends I like more, and that are more likely to eventually also be ""my friends""). Everytime they have these playdates I haven't gone with her so far. Because even tho I like these people on a polite and social level. I don't have anything in common with them and they are kind of racist from what I can tell (I hate racists) and the husband seem to be somwhat good friend with my gf ex which I feel can be problematic because of how problematic their relationship is (they were both on vacation with my GF's ex a few months ago, and they both probably hang out more often with her ex than her). So I simply don't feel like ""hanging out"" at their house, or making plans with them because I feel like I get nothing out of it, and even tho I can be friendly with these people I don't see any purpose on trying to have any deeper relationship with them, like there is nothing to gain from it for me personaly.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately my GF's friend have been suggesting that I should come more often (I've been there once) and hang out with her husband. I guess she kinds of keen that we should become ""buddies"" so we can do fun stuff together or watever.

&amp;#x200B;

So this far. My opinon is (but I have not told my GF this). I don't have a problem to be friendly with these people. But I don't see any reason too, and wont make an effort to have a deeper relationship with them.

I did the laundry and went out and got the meds and gave them to the babies. Sometimes I feel like I have to deal with the problem and he spectates the problem. 

We haven’t been as intimate as I personally like as well, so not sleeping together was hard for me(because it’s like a big intimate thing, and if it lacks in other areas, I need it in some form)

Let’s start off with an introduction. Me, 25 year old Hispanic heterosexual female, has been dating her 26 year old Hispanic heterosexual male boyfriend for about 3 years. My partner is literally perfect for me in every way but we all have some flaws. One major flaw that has been affecting me lately is his comments towards the LGBTQIA+ community. Recently, he has been super aggressive with his comments. An example that happened a couple of months ago, when an individual who was born a female and had a feminine name came to his job. This individual stated that their preferred name is more masculine and they go by he/him pronouns. He told me that he thought he was so funny and referred to him as “her” and asked the patient to come to the office using his given birth name (the feminine one). The individual corrected him and my partner was just like “oh my bad”, but he knew exactly what he did and feels no remorse. Last night we got into an argument regarding LGBTQIA+ community because he states that there’s only two genders and he will continue to refer to people as their appeared pronouns. Then, he said “Nikita dragon deserves to be in a men prison”, due to the recent event that occurred with her. This comment clearly triggered me because she is extremely afraid of being placed in a male prison. I do not agree with her actions that made her go to jail, but she shouldn’t be forced to be in a male prison because of her safety. He also said something about how there will always be racism, and always be two genders. Then I went in a rant about how we are all battling for rights as human beings. These comments that he’s making are triggering me because I can not comprehend how someone could be so selfish and have so much hatred towards an individual who bleeds the same. I don’t feel comfortable sharing this with my family or friends because I feel/know he is wrong for being a homophobic jerk. The reason why I stated Hispanic in the beginning is because he’s not the only one who I know in our Hispanic community who shares this same mentally. I question myself often and think if it’s a educational level mindset or just pure “never argue with stupid people” mindset. 
Side note: I truly love him so much and he has been amazing partner for me all these years. I’m just not sure how much more hatred towards individuals I could handle. I don’t agree with his statements and I continuously try to make him understand and be accepting. He thinks nothing is wrong, because his friends think very similar. I don’t know if I. Want to continue surrounding myself with him because of our differences. We have also been fighting more recently due to our differences in mindsets/beliefs.

I clean the bathroom whenever I'm there, the fridge and the microwave which are the only things I utilize in the common areas. The rest of the house is filthy. They do not clean at all, which brings me to the reason I'm making this post.

They have apparently been searching for a while for a cleaning person to come clean the apartment and they apparently have a whatsapp group that I found out through a girl that moved into the apartment just last week! They did not ask me at all to be in the group even though whenever I'm there I pass the girl that actually created the group all the time.

I feel really uncomfortable whenever I'm there now, it's like I'm walking right into the middle of a high school clique or something like that and they're all conspiratorially whispering behind my back.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out.

He then texted me a week later saying he was sorry and wishes we could have kissed and wats to meet again. Why do this to me?

me and my husband have been arguing a lot, and sometimes for the exact same reason. Something simple would happen, I tell him ""hey I didn't like that A happened"" and after a long time of me explaining why I didn't liked it he would say ""yeah but you didn't like B"" and I would say ""No, that's not right I said A"" and explain it all over to him just for him to understand ""C"" in the end. Then I would go all the way again to explain ""A"" but then I would be mad already at that situation and he would act like I was overreacting over something simple, but I would explain him again why ""A"" happened just for him to forget the reason why we were arguing and say ""why are you still mad you have said this already"" and act like nothing happened WHILE THE PROBLEM STILL NOT SOLVED! (and he would even tells me that I had to say something over and over for him to understand or change attitude over it) He would come to me asking for kiss or hug and I would still be REALLY mad at him for not giving the proper attention to the situation we were in, I would feel like talking to a door everytime, he would even get mad if I don't want a hug or a kiss. I tried to explain something that once was simple but he would always understand wrong even when I explain it differently. after hours of me stressing and crying to resolve the problem he would finally understand me and apologize, like I would do too and things would be OK.

but not too long after the same ""A"" happens and the cycle starts the exact same way again, just like his brain would be reset after apologizing. I'm not a really patient person and after the 5th time of the same thing happening again and me arguing alone I would be so done that I would tell him how tired I am for repeating the same record over and over... and he hates hearing that, I know it is due to ADHD but it's not easy to keep a peaceful relationship with me being the only one stressing over something that won't change a thing later on. I need to learn how to deal better with him in this situation but I don't know how.

I could really do with some help right now so I would appreciate any replies/advice.

I have been in a relationship with my current partner for almost 3 years now. Previously to that I was married for 10 years and had a huge shock in that I gave him a kiss/cuddle on my way out the door one evening and when I came home all his stuff was packed and he informed me that he was leaving. He had been having an affair with someone I knew and it completely blind sided me. He had never voiced any unhappiness and there were no real classic signs apart from a few small things that could be spotted in hindsight such as slightly less interest in sex. It shattered my world and was quite a traumatic time as it also caused a lot of financial worry.

Anyway fast forward 2 years from that time and I meet my current partner. He is quite different from me in that I'm quite an emotional being with all my feelings on display whereas he is very cool, calm and collected at all times. I have had a little anxiety around the relationship since the beginning really which I understand is a me problem and I've pin pointed that it relates to my past experience. Initially it was some anxiety around myself in general, I.e worrying that I was enough for him. I had some therapy in relation to this to work through what happened to me and to all build some self compassion and self esteem which seemed to help.

Recently I've noticed that I've been feeling increasingly agitated which I can attribute to a few things:-
1.As encouraged by me my partner has started to do a few things with friends such as going to the football and poker nights (which I'm also really happy about)
2. He has a low sex drive which has always been the case which he attributes to low testosterone/some medication he has to take. Our drives have always been very different but recently there has been less sex than usual, now averaging once every 2 weeks
3. He is a very loving person, we are always kissing, cuddling and telling eachother we love eachother. He shows me acts of love everyday but he isn't overly romantic and sexual. I'm always telling him how gorgeous he is and love seeing him with no clothes on whereas he has never been the type to be that way.
4. On occasion saucy videos have popped up on his tiktok 

All of these things have triggered me in a massive way to where I'm in a state at the moment. I feel sick, I can't eat and I'm a ball of anxiety. Out of nowhere I have this massive fear that he is or will cheat on me and its out of control. For context I do trust him as a person, he has never given me any reason not to trust him.

I have tried to be vulnerable in this and talk to him about it. He says he is who he is, he loves me and still finds me attractive and that his sex drive is his drive. We discussed maybe having more days nights and making specific time for intimate romance even if its just a massage etc but I think he feels hurt in feeling I want to change who he is when I love him for who he is I just feel I need a little reassurance or for it to be slightly more on display.
Despite this I've not been able to shake this and I'm very ashamed to say I looked at his phone which makes me so disappointed in myself. I've never done that before and I don't agree with it as I've always prided myself on being a trustworthy and honest person and I want to trust someone rather than only trusting because of lack of evidence. Anyway there wasn't really anything to find, no suspicious or hidden apps, normal search history, no questionable photos or texts although I did notice that the first short on his snapchat was a saucy video which although I'm not overly happy with as I don't agree with porn I would never lay out a stipulation as to what someone else does with their own body.

I realise this is a massive me problem and I really need some help. I want to trust this man desperately as I believe he is a good person and I love him. Even if I get hurt further down the line I want to have the ability to love and trust and be confident in that I can do those things even if others can't. This irrational thought won't leave me alone and I dont want It to create any issues. How on earth do I let go?. Also in wanting to be completely open and honest myself as  a person do I tell him that I snooped?.

It has been great so far and our relationship is great. We did have a few issues arise at the beginning of our relationship due to our ex's, but after discussing it and establishing boundaries, we were fine. Last talk we had was due to me talking to my ex because I was moving and still had some of her things that I needed to give back (they were expensive things I wasn't just gonna throw out). My gf was uncomfortable and after we moved, we agreed that we should just block our exes and move on (previously we had an issue that her ex kept calling her and they'd spend a while on the phone talking about random things, she wasn't trying to hide it or even step away to talk, but still made me uncomfortable). We both had ended our previous relationships in good terms (her not really, her ex dumped her because she realized my gf was too young, they started dating when my gf was 19 and her ex was 40), and she looked up to her.

However, after a couple weeks she told me it was unfair of her to ask me to block someone because she felt insecure and I told her that it didn't bother me, I didn't need to stay in contact with my ex, we broke up over 2 years ago and both had moved on. She agreed and everything went like normal.

Yesterday I noticed she started talking to someone on snapchat pretty frequently. I saw the first name of the user (let's say ""Victoria"") and I thought it was a friend of hers with the same name, but the bitmoji that it had was one with tan skin and red hair, her friend is white with red hair, and they always talk through instagram, so it was weird they were using snapchat but whatever. Then in the afternoon, she mentioned another friend of hers I know well got a new phone number and she was happy to start talking to her again because they hadn't been in contact in a while (the girl had been going through a lot). Oddly enough, 

Curiosity got the best of me and I decided to figure out who her ex was. I had only seen a few old pics of her, and I never paid much attention really. I only knew her first name (Let's call her ""Laura""), but it was easy enough to find out all her info because this lady had 30+ criminal/civil charges in the past 10-15 years, it was pretty scary tbh. With that, I found her middle name was Victoria, and also got her last name which is not too common. I was able to find some of her social media, found out she was into art (this is important), and she did have red hair at some point, I did find her snapchat and it was not the same I had seen, although I can't see if this one is al old one or something. I also found that some things my ex had told me about her past weren't really full truths, but weren't lies either, more like she omitted her ex's involvement in certain periods of her life so things about her wouldn't be tied to her ex, which is fine, I also do it sometimes because I learned a lot of the things I enjoy to do or in general while I was with my ex, but her involvement was not the main reason.

I may have dug deep into her life because I'm just extremely anxious and that's all I can think about since last night. I know basically everything there is to know about that lady because a friend of mine was also able to get me a copy of her background check. I have a close PI friend that asks no questions and loves me.

Last night she kept talking to her ""friend"" she wasn't trying to hide what she was messaging but I wasn't trying to read it either. She doesn't know I know her twitter account, and she tweeted ""I hope you turn your pain into art"" around the same time they were talking. Her ex's whole IG account is about her art and doing drugs pretty much, it was rather cringy tbh. 

How can I go about asking her if she's talking to her ex? 

I'm on the spectrum and have awful anxiety and this has been eating me inside at work all day. Been shaking on my desk all morning and trying to keep myself busy but I can't think. I was hoping she'd get a snapchat notification that showed the last name again because this is driving me crazy, but I know you can also change people's display names on snapchat. I know she would be completely honest with me if I ask her, but I don't know how to bring it up without sounding like I'm crazy and/or wildly insecure.",False,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7519379,public,self,I think my girlfriend is talking to her ex again.

My bf (26M) and I (25F) have been together for 6 years. We spent a few years long distance but early this year we were able to move to the same city and live together. Soon after we decided to buy a house together and we were the happiest we have ever been. Looking forward to the future

We have always had what in my eyes is an amazing relationship. I came from a very toxic and disrespectful relationship which made me have a lot of insecurities, but he help me overcome them. He is everything I look in a partner. Makes me feel pretty when I know I’m not looking my best, very caring, open communicator, very ambitious with work and life, and we honestly have so much fun together. I never thought I could be this excited and happy about my future with this person (and I know he feels the same way)

The cheating: A month ago we were in bed and he started acting a bit weird and said he needed to talk about something. He told me that 3 weeks before, during a night out with his high school friend were he had gotten very drunk, he kissed another girl in an after party. He did not blame it on the alcohol, me or anything, and I think he is still trying to figure out why it happened. He said he had been dealing with fears and insecurities. His parents relationship ended in divorce, my 2 siblings just got engage and he did feel a bit a of pressure for that and said he self sabotaged and it was the biggest mistake of his life. He is still trying to figure out more reasons as to why it happened and it’s talking to a therapist. He has apologized multiple times and told me all the details of the night. I of course feel like he truly regrets it.

My position: As soon as I found out, I told him I needed space and we were over. We have talked about cheating multiple times because of my previous relationship and he knew how much this meant for me and how much it hurt me. I can’t possibly understand how this happened when we just bought a house together and were on such a high of our relationship and because of that, I think I might never be able to trust him again. Because this happened even in one of our stronger moments as a coupe so it will forever be in the back on my mind even if we find “happiness” again.

I moved out of the house for a few weeks but had to come back temporarily. We are sleeping in separate rooms and I’m trying to find a new apartment (he has insisted to move a bunch of times but I would rather go as I don’t want reminders of our relationship).

I’m also scared that I might not be able to find something like what we had again, and it’s making me doubt the decision of leaving because there is also sooo much love involved. But at the same time, I feel like staying will be settling for a relationship that we might be able to enjoy again, but we won’t be truly happy ever again because of trust issues. And I don’t want to be on a toxic and controlling relationship either.

we realised that we had a lot of cultural differences but we made it work. The problem is that when we fight , its always about very silly stuff but I realised that its most often come down to me trying to have some boundaries or mentioning something she do that I dont like and it turn to be a very angry reactions from her... 

She is one of the sweetest person I know but , I start to think she have some anger issue and very reactive to small criticism ... I tried to talk to her about it but I feel that she dont want to realise it and I am just blaming her ... 

a chinese guy I know who dated pretty much all type of asians told me that most asian cultures are very rooted with guilt and shame and that it might be why she just see it as me blaming everything on her instead of sugesting some self improvement about herself and have a healthier relationship ... 
I dont think that yelling , throwing stuff, storming off mad in the bathroom and giving silent treatment, etc  is a mature way to deal with conflicts ... but thats how it always turn with her ... 

I have some very legitimate demands but to her its me being selfish etc ... dont want to get into details but for instance once I came back from long day at work late , was hungry and tired ... she had dinner already and all was left was some little bit of frozen food ... so I made that tiny meal of frozen craps, she love to share food and she know I dont but I make effort ... so she asked me for 1/6 piece of my meat when I know im still gonna be hungry with 6 piece I usually eat about 8-10 ... I give it to her without saying anything... but the she asked for a 2nd piece ... so I split one in halfs and gave her half one ... she got mad ... and im the selfish person ... 

its always petty stuff like that and she accuse me of being the one who over react and exagerate... this week we had arguments about my pet and I asked her to be careful with him because he is sick and struggling and to give it some space ... again an argument happened and she act like I said she was about to kill him or whatever ... 

is there a way to make someone realise they need some self growth or introspection ? or is it impossible to get em into it ? 

Im tired of fighting out of no where and I feel like its getting toxic for me and her too ...

Me and my husband have this issue going on for so long that I don't know what to do anymore. He and I try our best to keep our house clean but everytime he cleans something he does it poorly, like leaving the dishes dirty, oily, not cleaning all the spots when moping the floor and doing it in a way that I have to do it all again. there's a lot of other stuff that he does it like that. I'm not perfect either but I do ask him to do it nicely so I or we don't have to do it again.
 we would have constants disagreements because I would say ""we really need to clean the house"" and he would say ""nah, it's clean"" while clearly it's not. he would pass by the trash that I specifically put there for him to get out, doesn't see if our cat litter is full or if our cat water is dirty, won't never clean a dirty object unless I do say so...
I feel bad, my sister sometimes suggests that she comes home to help cleaning and when she does I get really uncomfortable but not because she wants to help, I'm greatful for her, but because everyone outside sees that our house is a mess but not my husband. I feel ashamed.
 I deal with depression and most of the days I feel like giving up on everything because it just feels a lot, me and my husband don't have much time to take care of all. He wants to invite a friend over and when I told him to really clean the house this time (since the last time he invited someone I cleaned EVERYTHING because he asked me so) he complained saying that I want him to do things my way, that he will do the cleaning like he feels right to but I know that I'll have to do it again. he said that ""I think I'm the only one that knows how to clean"" and that ""I do everything and he doesn't do anything for the house"" which isn't true. He said that if I wanted things ""my way"" then I was supposed to do it myself but I don't want things to be this way like every other couple that the woman does every cleaning just for the sake that it's clean.

Last year during This same month I met this girl who had just moved from Wisconsin here to Miami. She had also brought me for the first time to our church called Vous down here in Miami and that’s where my Christian journey also started. We started dating and sometime around our third month of dating my landlord had given me a 30 day notice that I had to leave due to legal renovations he had to do on the place. I began living in my car and for some months I’d also stay at her place from time to time. As time went by my living situation was having a really big impact on our relationship because of how much it hurt her seeing me in that car  situation. Unfortunately my situation was making me become bitter and it was really messing with me mentally. From waking up to 6 mosquito bites way before my actual morning alarm went off to developing a foot fungus from showering at the gym most of the time to constantly having to dig through bags in my car in order to find what I was gonna wear that day. The situation was really affecting me and I wasn’t laughing anymore the same way I did when she had met me, our conversations dwindled, and I couldn’t stop constantly complaining about my life. I still knew I had a lot of love for this girl but my situation just kept blinding me. This was all also happening towards her on stage bikini competition. After her competition was over it was time for her to finally begin the first steps of her own personal Jesus pursuing clothing brand. The day came when we both spoke about how we needed to distance ourselves because of how heavy my situation was becoming within the relationship. I then started working full time at a restaurant in order to seriously get out of this situation I was in. After working there for about a month and a half two friends of mine offered me to head over to Fort Lauderdale in order to find work over there, move in with them for a couple of months, get back up on my feet within an actual stable home and then move back to Miami once I was ready. Before I left to Fort Lauderdale I was about to quit that restaurant I was at and head over to another one that payed incredibly better but instead I left to Fort Lauderdale. Anybody in my situation would’ve seen that as rational. Before leaving to Fort Lauderdale me and the manager of this new restaurant came to an agreement of putting the onboarding process on hold and allowing me to jump back into the position once I came back from Fort Lauderdale. Thankfully he agreed. I was working and living in Fort Lauderdale but Benihana was barely paying me nothing. Luckily, while in Fort Lauderdale I began freelancing videography on the side for a bit more cash. About a month later one the guys I was living with gave me the unfortunate news that they were moving into a mortgage deal. I had a couple of days to move out and go back to living in my car in Miami. During my last days there the distance between me and this girl was eating me alive. I’d be editing for my videography client and I’d literally start crying out of nowhere because of how much I missed her. It wouldn’t stop. I texted her and told her that we needed to sit down and talk privately. She’s extremely structured and scheduled so just finding a time window for us to meet up and speak at her house took about a week and a half. Every Sunday her whole week is literally structured out on a whiteboard and she even has her monthly expenses written out on a notebook anywhere from vast to small. We were finally able to sit down and I told her absolutely everything. I explained that I didn’t like her but that I loved her. I explained that I didn’t want just a relationship but that someday I do want marriage. I explained that I didn’t just want to date her but that I wanted her to have my kids someday. We spoke and she kept her firm ground on the distance and how the timing of us together was wrong. She then concluded that in order for us to date again I’d have to first become single and secure through Jesus Christ and give things time. I explained that a huge part of this whole thing is the factual matter that I’m not at a stable point in my life right now financially. I don’t even have a home. Before leaving Fort Lauderdale I contacted the job that was still waiting for me in Miami and asked if I could begin the onboarding once again in order to start working. The position was already taken. Another punch to the stomach. All I had left was doordash while I applied to other jobs in Miami. A friend then helped me get a serving position at the magic Mike live show. It was good money but the acts that were being performed on stage and on the women watching the show were seriously messing with my mind and heart. It was so morally incorrect and it showed what the world has come to. While working there I even asked God why did he place me there. I kept contacting the girl I was with and telling her to please not give us and on me especially at my very lowest. I told her to please trust me and that I will get my life back together. She firmly stood her ground and shared that she wasn’t looking to date absolutely anybody for the next year or even two. She just wants to be firmly single and secure through Jesus and wants me to do the same. She keeps explaining God’s timing and how either in some time or even the far future he’ll bring us back together through his timing. After about a week of working at this event the restaurant job position I had been waiting for finally reached out to me about the position opening up once again. I’ve been working there ever since and yesterday I completed my 5th day of training. Me and her still go to the same church obviously not together. I’ve told her multiple times that it would hurt to see her someday a couple months down the line at church with someone else or even hearing something I didn’t want to hear from one of our friends. She’s told me that shouldn’t even be any of my concern. My emotions are absolutely everywhere and it’s taking a toll on other things in my life. From her telling me to give it time, to her telling me it shouldn’t be my concern if she started seeing someone else, her telling me that she’s not giving up on us, her mom explaining that maybe we’re not for each other or that god may bring us back together, other people telling me that she’ll wait on me to get everything together in my life, our church service literally this past Sunday sharing messages like god closes doors at times and us both sitting in different sections listening to that message. I’ve explained to her my values and how in a vastly broken city like Miami that will only objectify her sexually I will always give her purity. I’m not just some other guy from Miami. I actually want a pure future with her. I’m absolutely exhausted emotionally and this is eating from the inside. I have so much going on already with being homeless and surviving every single day of my life and this just adds even more stress to my life right now. I’m working endlessly at this restaurant I’ve been waiting for. I don’t want to lose this girl.

so, we’ve been talking for about two months now. we go on dates, we hold hands and kiss but we’re not official yet. in the beginning, it felt mutual, we both wanted to make plans with each other and see each other, but as of lately, it feels like it’s always me asking to see each other or what their schedule is.

and i don’t want to end what we have or give up, i really like them and i can honestly see myself in a relationship with them, i just wish sometimes they would put in more effort into seeing me and spending time with me. they do work long hours and go to the gym, and i am a full time student and i work as well. i don’t know what to do because like i said, thjs is something i’ve been feeling but i don’t want to make anyone feel bad, especially when they’re feeling drained as it is because of work.

She is an elementary tutor (not even a teacher) and is currently breaking in to the sports media world - I think she has like 4 jobs which is odd... so she is a school tutor, private tutor during weekends and does sports writing and broadcasting some weekends. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her. 

In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously. She comes from a wealthy family (she is also a shareholder in the business valued at roughly $3M) - I only know this from google search results... she is elegant and classy but you probably wouldn't be able to tell her family are rich as she's humble and doesn't brag or anything. She is not that well travelled although she says she would like to do more of that in future. Instead she is focusing on the London marathon which she got in to through the ballot.

I just feel like she's boring - the main thing I struggle with is the fact she has a lack of social life so not many life experiences...  I also don't understand some of her values - she told me she's going to get a lot of Christmas gifts for her niece and nephew... she said she's got some creative ideas but she'd basically be spending $200 on each so $400 in total.

My bf (26M) and I (25F) have been together for 6 years. We spent a few years long distance but early this year we were able to move to the same city and live together. Soon after we decided to buy a house together and we were the happiest we have ever been. Looking forward to the future

We have always had what in my eyes is an amazing relationship. I came from a very toxic and disrespectful relationship which made me have a lot of insecurities, but he help me overcome them. He is everything I look in a partner. Makes me feel pretty when I know I’m not looking my best, very caring, open communicator, very ambitious with work and life, and we honestly have so much fun together. I never thought I could be this excited and happy about my future with this person (and I know he feels the same way)

The cheating: A month ago we were in bed and he started acting a bit weird and said he needed to talk about something. He told me that 3 weeks before, during a night out with his high school friend were he had gotten very drunk, he kissed another girl in an after party. He did not blame it on the alcohol, me or anything, and I think he is still trying to figure out why it happened. He said he had been dealing with fears and insecurities. His parents relationship ended in divorce, my 2 siblings just got engage and he did feel a bit a of pressure for that and said he self sabotaged and it was the biggest mistake of his life. He is still trying to figure out more reasons as to why it happened and it’s talking to a therapist. He has apologized multiple times and told me all the details of the night. I of course feel like he truly regrets it.

My position: As soon as I found out, I told him I needed space and we were over. We have talked about cheating multiple times because of my previous relationship and he knew how much this meant for me and how much it hurt me. I can’t possibly understand how this happened when we just bought a house together and were on such a high of our relationship and because of that, I think I might never be able to trust him again. Because this happened even in one of our stronger moments as a coupe so it will forever be in the back on my mind even if we find “happiness” again.

I moved out of the house for a few weeks but had to come back temporarily. We are sleeping in separate rooms and I’m trying to find a new apartment (he has insisted to move a bunch of times but I would rather go as I don’t want reminders of our relationship). It’s been over a month and I’m still heartbroken. I’m also scared that I might not be able to find something like what we had again, and it’s making me doubt the decision of leaving because there is also sooo much love involved. But at the same time, I feel like staying will be settling for a relationship that we might be able to enjoy again, but we won’t be truly happy ever again because of trust issues. And I don’t want to be on a toxic and controlling relationship either.

He then asked me if I expected the man to pay. I ignored this question because I found it stupid--if he was going to ask me out, then I am his guest and he needs to pay. So I moved on.

He then found me on another site and offered to ""take me out"" and promised he would pay because he wanted to see me that bad. So I decided to give him a chance. He complained about the menu prices the entire time and made me really uncomfortable. I guess he noticed this because as soon as he saw me looking uncomfortable he rubbed my leg and suggested he really wanted to pay. The total for both of us was 55.

So when he asked to meet again for a second date, I felt obligated to see him again. I thought since he was requesting to see me again, he would be paying.

Then all of a sudden when the bill came, he said we were splitting it. We NEVER discussed it. This time the total for both of us was close to 100. I started crying (felt dumb for agreeing to see him again) and instead of softening up, he threatened to get up and LEAVE. He then bragged about how he had all these other women that wanted him.

So I put my card in and he put in his. The waitress came back and said that his card ""didn't work"", so she had to charge mine the WHOLE thing. I panicked and the guy had an evil grin and had made me feel awful for just existing and showing up to the date, so I ended up paying for his meal too and having to leave the tip, even though he was the one that asked to meet me again.

He then tried to massage me on the way out and said ""Sometimes couples fight"", said he had to use the bathroom after walking me home, and then took off his shoes and tried to stay so I had to kick him out. 

He then texted me a week later saying he was sorry and wishes we could have kissed and wats to meet again. Why do this to me?

He started going downhill a few months into the relationship and has been sliding further and further since. There is rarely a time that he seems happy. Sometimes he is able to mask his misery for a couple of hours so that we can try to do something enjoyable but not much longer than that. You can see the misery in how he carries himself, the way he slams doors/cabinets, and the way he walks so heavy footed throughout our apartment. He tells me multiple times a week how he wants to kill himself, how shit life is, and how shit people are. I often here him punching his desk out of anger which startles me. I can hear him bawling his eyes out  in the computer room over the TV in our living room, when I go to check on him he is just drooling on the ground crying. There isn’t any escaping it either, if I’m not home he will text me about it how he wants to kill himself or how awful life is. He isn’t always angry or crying of course, but he very rarely smiles.

 I pity him so much. So many of the things he complains about are solvable problems. It is unbelievably frustrating to hear someone cry about the same things day in and day out but never do anything about it. I do not respond to his cries in the way I feel I should anymore. I have grown numb as a way of coping with my environment. Perhaps numb isn’t correct – I disassociate. I don’t feel we really have conversations either. Sometimes we say things but they aren’t conversations in my opinion. We aren’t very intimate anymore. The environment I have been in has absolutely extinguished my libido. I feel quite lonely.
I have grown to feel he may never get better. He is a victim of abuse from his mother and brother. Several years ago his brother punched him repeatedly in the head while he was drunk. It gave him a concussion. He woke up a few hours later with a dent in his head. I wonder if that could be contributing to his severe instability, but he has always had mental health problems.  I worry that he will kill himself if I leave him; I am the only support system he has left besides his therapist and a couple of friends he plays video games with sometimes. He has isolated himself from much of his friends. He has insinuated that that would push him over the edge. 

I know that I can’t sacrifice myself so that he will continue on. I do love him though. I feel like if I leave him, I am giving up on him getting better; Ifeel like it's similar to someone leaving their partner who has cancer or some kind of other illness.

I need some advice as to whether or not i me and my boyfriend should break up (We are both 22). We have been together for a bit over a month. Before that, we were friends for a while. I love him, but a certain incident, I don’t know what I feel anymore. 

Some years ago, I was in a bad relationship. He was high and drunk all the time and was often abusive. We broke up long ago, but a lot of what he said and did still haunts me. Since then, I have entered a new relationship and have been happier. 

My current boyfriend and I took a trip with some friends. There were a few incidents throughout the trip. First was when he got drunk when greeting our friends, which bothered them to say the least. It was his birthday, and his friend had gotten him a very nice gift. My boyfriend had responded that it wasn’t the right size and threw it back at him. The last straw came later in the night. 

 We were all planning to go to a rave, and me and our friends headed down ahead of him while he sobered up. While we were waiting in line, I got a message saying he was on his way down, and that he had had another drink. I argued with him that he shouldn’t come until he sobers up, since the lights and music might overstimulate him. (I have had a friend who reacted that way at a rave and was worried). 

He then lied and said his friend told him it was fine. That friend was with me, and told me he was very drunk, and worse than we had realized. I told him to wait until he sobers up and eat something. That way he can come later on (it was going to be going on for at least 6 hours). After arguing back and forth, he finally sent me a text that said. 

“Fine, I’ll wait here in this boring room while you go out and have fun.” 

Our friends saw the text and said he was being extremely passive aggressive and I agreed. After some time, he texted me and asked if he can come to the rave now. He asked it in a passive aggressive tone. For the rest of the night I largely ignored him until we went back to the room. 

Our friends went to take pictures elsewhere so I took the opportunity to talk to him about all the issues. He wasn’t receptive at first, claiming it was all a joke and he didn’t mean what he said. I told him it wasn’t a joke if only he was laughing. We argued for a bit after that, and he finally agreed to apologize. Finally, our friends arrived and he apologized to them for his behavior. He began to cry and talk about all the issues he has and that he won’t drink again. 

I appreciate that he apologized, and we have all accepted his apology. But, part of me just doesn’t see this relationship continuing. The entire incident was incredibly triggering to me, and it kind of hurts to even talk to him or make plans with him. I want to support him through seeking help for his issues. I do care about him but I’m wondering if it is still worth continuing this relationship. I could probably continue with him as a friend. I wanted to ask you, Reddit. Should I give him a chance to seek help and continue the relationship, or should i call it quits?

Recently my girlfriend of a year has grown distant. She is separated with three kids and showed so much interest and pursued me before I started to pursue her very seriously in the beginning of our relationship. I fell in love with her and she felt like she was more interested than me, and our relationship blossomed for months until recent. Our sex life was incredible and we couldn't keep our hands off each other in the beginning. We met at work, and even though our company is very large---I made the mistake of shitting where I eat.

I made reddit posts recently about how we've been having intimacy issues as she has been less interested in sex and I have been pushing the subject too much--which in turn has turned her off. This has been an ongoing issue for some time that I overlooked because I thought in some ways we managed to talk and resolve the issue. In the past month she was involved in a car accident that totaled her car, had a huge fight with her parents and moved out, her daughter broke her thumb and she has been out of work for a month. I first thought all those things combined where why she was distant, and I kept pressing the issue. For the first time in our relationship we would go days without talking (I mostly let her reach out first because of her busy life). Finally after saying nothing was wrong numerous times, she said she lost romantic/sexual attraction to me because of negative experiences regarding sex recently.

Now, I'm starting to believe there's much more going on. Over the course of our relationship she has been extremely jealous of things I thought were minor. She got mad at me on multiple occasions for liking other girl's photos on instagram, adding other people we work with, getting hit up by an ex (and even though I shut it down and blocked her, she still remained angry with me). She would even sometimes wonder why I hadn't texted her when I got home from work.

At our job we spend alot of time one on one with a coworker in a vehicle. Months ago, she met a guy at our job who she thought was ""actually pretty funny"" and they got along well. We had an argument the day they worked together, and the next day he told her to pick up her shift again--without telling me first. Then she added him on facebook to add him to the work groups, but only told me after. I know if I did this she would lose her shit. So then he started sending her memes, which she told me about. Then she told me she changed her activity status on facebook because she didn't want him to see that she wasn't looking at his memes and essentially ignoring him. He has a girlfriend who he calls toxic and says they plan on marrying.

They had picked up shifts in the future together during the day in which they had to work events were they just sat in the vehicle for hours. She would text me during those times, but I thought it was suspicious that they picked up shifts in general. It hasn't happened in a long time. I actually worked with him one time and he brought up his girlfriend within the first few minutes of us talking. I let my guard down, and just saw how he interacted. He seemed friendly, and didn't bring up my girlfriend at all--even though he knows we're dating.

Then, my coworker who I work with on a regular basis who is a female shared with me something interesting. She said she worked with this guy once, and he was friendly in person but started messaging her outside of work. She said it got weird, because first it was memes but then he said ""I miss you"" to her. She called him creepy and stopped answering him because she had a boyfriend.

Over the past couple of days my girlfriend and I have not talked much, but I see her active on fb around similar times to him now on a couple of occasions. I am even more suspicious because she has liked some of his posts on facebook--one particularly of a beach that said ""let's sit here and talk about life."" She doesn't like the fucking beach.

I'm starting to wonder if I'm going crazy, or if there's something really going on here. I need advice because I'm worried I might bring this up in the wrong way (or should I even bring this up at all).

Everyone knows my gf and I have been dating for a long time.

I’ve been talking to this guy and we decided to start hooking up since he’s not living here anymore. 

This was his text to me.. 

“Hi. Hello 😁”

“Yea FL has been crazy.  Work has been chaotic lately but still getting out to the beach fairly often.  Getting better at surfing since there’s no snowboarding here lol.  Yes, definitely let ya know when I’m coming back in town.  Don’t think it’s gonna be this holiday season but sometime within the next 6 months I’ll make the journey home for a week or so.  So I know we talked about casual at one point.. 😝”

And I wanted to text this but it’s too long.. how can I make this shorter? 


“Glad to hear you are getting the chance to enjoy Hawaii through the chaos of getting settled. I’m not sure if you’re that bummed about that. My snowboarding trip will be chaos. I have a new puppy, And This will be his first snowboarding trip. So it will probably go downhill fast 🤣.

I 25M didn’t get much action thru highschool or college, a tale as old as time. Some of that was by choice and some because I wanted to be a better person before trying to date so I could land higher quality partners and some because of low esteem. In retrospect I should have gotten some of my sexual energy out of my system before getting into a committed relationship. 

But I am in a a 3 year relationship with a wonderful girl. However my internal feelings waffle from feeling happy to scared that I will regret not having more experience in my 20s. In a shallow sense I’m scared that we will breakup eventually and i’ll be older with less options. 

Catalyzing all of this is that I met a girl who is gorgeous and pretty much the definition of my physical type, she is also younger than current gf. It’s making me want to risk the end of my relationship in which I am comfortable for someone I don’t know very well. I know that if new girl is a nice person she would be a better fit for me long term (a quick fling is fine too)- but I would be guilty for the motivation of my choice to leave my gf blindsided. I would entertain dating both of them at same time but that’s a recipe for disaster.
