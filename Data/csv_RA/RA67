In my head she's already dead. It's taking a huge toll on my mental health. She's threatened to hurt me when I've approached her about this issue. As a result I go through differing periods of refusing to acknowledge she lives with us. This problem started in Summer of 2021 when my parents finally divorced after years of tension in their marriage. My brother (24M) and I first noticed back then and I can't believe it's continued for a year. 

Here's the bad part of this- I'm glad she's dying. She emotionally abused me when I was a teenager, neglected my mental health needs. I suffer from depression and anxiety- and one time when I was 17 I told her that she needed to allow me to hangout or leave the house by myself and that it was making me incredibly angry. She came in from work and made the text messages about herself and complained about she was tired from work and that I didn't care about her wellbeing. 

One time she found out I was using aspirin to attempt to kill myself. I was 17. Again, she didn't change the strictness. So when I turned 18 I began spending as much time away from home as possible- and in recent memory I've recognized that my father was the better parent in all of this. 

Should mother pass away, I won't shed a single tear.. but I will cry if she allows- if she makes you believe it was your fault. Dad, you never did anything wrong. She failed us, she left us and moved away for a year- has come back a broken woman- and is expecting us to see her as a different person. I see an old failure. I see a person who's stopped trying to change. I see someone who isn't my mother. 

But, I love my brother, I love my father, and that's enough for me. I'm happiest when it's just the three of us- just like I always dreamed about.

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this as I am really looking for advice.

My dad met his girlfriend in 2013. Let's just call her Ellie. I was around 12 at that time. I didn't like her from the start - she had a DWI and a suspended license right off the bat which I think is a huge red flag. My dad tends to be naive and really just wanted to be loved, so I think he rushed into the first person that gave that to him. I met her and I just felt off about her, but with really no good reason, I just have never really liked my father's girlfriends (one of them physically abused me when I was younger so I kind of have a PTSD with them). The two of them really forced things  - constantly bringing me out to dinner with her kids, bringing me to different sports games etc. 

Within two months of knowing each other, my father got Ellie pregnant with twins. My world literally flipped upside down when I found out. I hardly knew this woman. While she was pregnant, she heavily drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes, starved herself, and drank like 5 cups of coffee a day - she literally did everything wrong. I lost my respect for her after knowing that. However, my two siblings were born healthy. The twins were one boy and one girl.

I started to feel off when Ellie started making comments out loud saying that my dad's favorite was the girl. She knew that I was upset that she had gotten pregnant (I liked having my dad to myself) and it seemed like she was rubbing it in my face. That's when I really started noticing that she was strange and that her fake nice act was exactly that, fake. 

Throughout the years, there had been many times where she had stolen money from my dad, been found drunk or taking pills while watching the twins, etc. She always pretended to be nice to me and was never rude directly to my face except for stupid little comments. On Christmas one year, I was 17 and I refused to say Merry Christmas to her because the entire day she screamed at everything my dad did, and made fun of him &amp; my grandma. Later that night I heard her yelling at my dad telling him that he didn't raise me right and I'm disrespectful, etc. I ended up leaving and not coming back for a while and living at my mom's.

I ended up coming back to live at my dads with her there. If I didn't look at her, smile, and say hello and goodbye to her, she would make a HUGE deal out of it and scream at my dad. One time I went to the bathroom I overheard her telling my little sister (who was 2 years old at the time) that I was a bitch that never said hi to anyone. So, I left again.

I went away to college and for holidays, I would stay over sometimes because I liked spending time with my dad &amp; siblings. I had my own room there as it was my childhood home they live in. I left a birthday card from my grandma that contained $100 in my room for a day by accident, and when I came back, it was gone. I knew she stole it. Another time, my father gave me a card of $200 and a $50 bill was stolen out of it. I knew she stole it. One time, I was sitting in my room and she bursted into my room for no reason. She looked at me and said Oh, didn't know you were in here, and closed the door. She would ""clean my room"" all the time even though the rest of the house was an absolute disaster.

She has done many horribly irritating things since then, the worst being that she gets piss drunk constantly while my father's a recovering alcoholic. She's also extremely filthy and the house is disgusting because of her. We are very fake nice to each other and we both make it clear that we don't like each other. But just recently, I finally hit my breaking point.

My boyfriend and I got my father tickets to a sport's game, just the three of us. We went a few days ago, and everything was fine until I see him texting during the game. I looked over at his phone and saw her saying ""I hope you have fun but I'm extremely hurt that I wasn't included"" blah blah blah. After the game, I go to stay at my grandma's house and she tells me that Ellie called her while we were all at the game and was crying to her, saying my boyfriend and I were so rude, that she wanted to go and loves hockey, she's so hurt that she wasn't invited, she knows where she stands now, all this dumb stuff. Everyone in my family dislikes her, btw.

So today I called my dad and I told him that I'm sorry, but I'm sick of this. He told me that she's an asshole, she was drunk, all ""stepparents"" are like this (he dealt with the same exact situation when he was a kid). Then he called my grandma and I overhear him on the phone telling my grandma that Ellie is jealous of me and any time I'm around or involved in anything she goes absolutely insane. Apparently she hadn't drank in a while but because she was ""so hurt"", she started up again. 

I really can not fucking take this anymore. My father is trapped because he has kids with her. I told my dad I'm never going over there again. I live a few hours away from him now but I visit often and stay at my grandmas, so I told him that to see me, he will have to come over or we will have to do something. I feel so fucking awful for him. I know he put himself in this position but he is clearly so depressed and doesn't know what to do. At the sport's game with me, it was the first time in a while I saw him genuinely smile and laugh, and to know that he had to go home to her yelling at him about me and ruining his night, hurts so badly. 

Confronting her directly has never worked in the past for me. She only blows things way out of proportion and makes my dad take the brunt of it. My dad is a very chill man, he is recovering from a severe alcohol addiction and doesn't need all of this around him. I'm just worried that she is winning by me staying away from the house. 

I feel extremely stuck. I'm sitting here crying because I love my dad so much and I don't want to not be able to see him or my siblings anymore, but hearing my dad say that whenever I'm around she goes crazy, it makes me never want to see her ever again. All I do is exist and I don't ever do ANYTHING wrong to anyone. She has NO reason to dislike me whatsoever, other than the fact that she wants my dad all to herself and wishes that I didn't exist.

We met online through a video game a few years back and our personalities really meshed well together from the beginning. We spent so much time together doing everything we could together online that everyone we talked to just assumed we were dating or already married. We live only a few hours apart; so, about a year ago we decided to make a go of things and start going on dates in person.

Our dates from the beginning have gone better than any I've ever had in previous relationships. I feel incredibly comfortable around him and spending time with him just feels so natural like ""it's meant to be"" (sorry for being horrendously cliche). The big hang up comes when we get intimate with each other. I knew going into things that I wasn't physically attracted to him but tried to convince myself (however foolishly), that with time, it wouldn't matter; that I love him as a person and that's what really matters; that I would eventually be able to love him in all ways. As time has gone on I've come to realize that things may never change. Trying to be intimate with him is just getting harder instead of easier. It's gotten to the point that I dread the moments he starts to get intimate with me.

It doesn't feel fair to him to keep going with the relationship and hope there is no intimacy. He's my best friend and I really don't want to hurt him; but, no matter how I look at it that seems inevitable. I'm really at a loss for how to handle the situation. Do I just need to keep giving the relationship more time and things should change later on down the road? If not, is there a way to maximize the chances we can remain friends while also ending things romantically? Any thoughts or suggestions on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

It's been hard navigating this whole new chapter in my life because aside from it being my first time, I also have to deal with coming to terms with my sexuality. My partner has been quite supportive and patient with me figuring out how to be in a relationship, especially in the beginning. However, this pattern has slowly diminished and I feel guilty for not being experienced and knowing things about relationships. Recently, trust issues have come up because I've realized that she's a different person when she's drunk. I never knew how much it bothered me that she's a very touchy person, especially in situations like that. I feel like when she's having fun, she tends to forget that I'm there but insists I party with her so I often just feel alone while she's with friends. One particular situation involved another girl who she used to have a thing for. She took me to a party. The said girl was there too. At that time, I didn't know she was attracted to her before so I was able to look over the fact that she was being touchy for the first few minutes of the night. However, the touchiness and even flirtiness developed throughout the night to the point where there were instances she would leave me to go dance with her. As someone who was just a plus one at  a party where she didn't know anyone, to be left like that and actively see your girlfriend flirting with another girl, i needed to walk away. So I did. A part of me walked away because I couldn't handle watching it anymore and a part of me wanted to see how long it would take for her to realize I'm gone. She didn't realize I was gone until 30 minutes later. Because I really wanted us to work and because I felt dramatic for acting that way, we talked it out. She reassured me that yes, she used to have a thing for her but they are strictly friends. Though I believed her, my trust has never been the same since. After that, we partied together for another 3 nights and I just saw a different side of her. A side that contradicts her reassurance that she only wants to be with me. At one of the parties, she told me ""I would make out with anyone right now"". She caught herself and insisted that she meant she would make out with me. Things like these just make me question her loyalty and how much I really mean to her.

In addition, I feel like I put more effort in our relationship more than her and I feel under-appreciated. When I tried telling her that I feel like she doesn't see how much I'm trying and how hard I make time for her, she answered back saying that I shouldn't be rubbing it in her face and that it's what people in relationships do. However, I feel like she doesn't make time for me. I always have to be the one accommodating to her schedule. I ask for one night where she has to make a sacrifice with her time and she's not willing to. Me, on the other hand, traveled 8 hours just so I can make it to an event she wanted me to go to. I just don't think she would make the sacrifices and effort I make. And the very least thing she can do it is appreciate it. I feel unloved, unheard, and unseen. She gets mad over the little things and she's warned me before. Maybe it's my fault that I told her I'm okay with it at first but recently, I've expressed that even though I understand she has those issues, it still hurts me everytime i'm berated for the littlest things. Despite this, I feel like she hasn't tried to change. But I feel like it's all in my head. I feel like the reason why I'm unhappy is because I expected too much. I expected us to put the same amount of effort in the relationship. I've communicated this need in the past, and she said she knows when she's not trying and that she knows she hasn't been trying but she'll try harder. But I haven't seen any effort to change. But I love her and there are still moments where she makes me happy.

So when I was 17 I  had my first friend group, it was a “trio” and eventually they just started to not invite me to anything and basically cut me off.

Not completely sex repulsed, but he goes very random periods of time where he doesn’t think about or want to have sex. I understand as I’m also not a very sexual person and can usually only enjoy it with someone I have an emotional connection with. Recently it’s caused a strain though, because I can’t ever initiate sex without making him uncomfortable. I don’t want to force him by any means, but despite understanding and trying to be considerate of his boundaries, sometimes it hurts my feelings. I can’t help but feel almost disposable because I have to wait for him to be in the mood in order for us to have sex.

It’s honestly not even about sex for me, I just want passionate affection sometimes. I want to make out like horny teenagers, or get flirty and sexy even if it doesn’t lead to sex. When he does initiate, he usually kisses me a bit and then says “want to fuck?” which is fine sometimes… but I miss the buildup and feeling desired. It feels almost transactional. I can’t even hint at wanting sex, or any intimacy beyond cuddling, without it being pushy. I feel like a bitch saying it, but I’m lacking so much needed intimacy and it hurts.

Last night I tried to get sexy and have a little flirty fun but he got upset and told me he felt like I was crossing boundaries. He said that since I’m not asking him anything he doesn’t feel like he can say no when I act that way, but he doesn’t want to force himself into sex. Again, I don’t want him to either, but I don’t always want sex. I could ask him directly, but I’ve become so self conscious about the rejection I feel that I don’t know how. I have no way of knowing when it’s ‘safe’ for me to express my desires. 
I desperately want this to not be a big deal because I don’t want him to feel guilty for being asexual. I wish I didn’t have to feel scared to be flirty and passionate with my boyfriend. I wish I didn’t have to feel guilty for wanting intimacy, and not being able to ask. I wish I knew how to make him comfortable while also meeting my own needs and feeling desired in that way. I love how comfortable our relationship is, he shows me he loves me in so many ways but I miss being chased and wanted.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7551448,public,nsfw,My asexual boyfriend (m21) and I (f23) cannot find a comfortable compromise when it comes to intimacy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvk566/my_asexual_boyfriend_m21_and_i_f23_cannot_find_a/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

I've been dating one woman since Sophomore year of high school.  It wasn't a highschool sweethearts thing.  We just clicked.  Things were going great since we started, having only had one major argument.  Sure, there were debates here and there, but what relationship doesn't have those?

Then, out of the blue, I'm asked to call her.  She's decided that since we're in our final years of college, she wants to try dating women for a change, to see what's out there.  I knew that she was also into women, but there was never any thought that it would lead to this.

Now for the question.  I've been out of the dating game for almost 5 years at this point.  It might sound dramatic, but there are so many things that meant one thing in my relationship that mean something else in a more casual dating since.  Where do I start?  Because from what the internet has said, dating apps are a crapshoot, but I wouldn't know where to start with just finding someone again.  Any advice would be really useful.

TLDR: Got dumped two weeks ago after being together for almost 5 years and don't know how to start over dating.  Any advice would be nice.

So basically sometimes when I approach my gf with something she did she like freaks out not like full blown but more of like wtf until she remembers and calms down. 

Ik you aren’t supposed to do this but I went thru her phone (obv told her I was going to and did but it wasn’t for the reason I said I was going too) and saw a message to her ex that she is civil with pictures of her trip just like the surrounding area and a selfie cause she went on a month trip in Spain and never told me. Basically he reached out asking how it was etc and asked for pics and she sent some. However she never told me this in counter happened, we have a strict boundary that either one of our exs reaches out we just tell each other and what was said etc. I said what is this? And she freaked out like she had no idea five minutes of bickering go by she says let me see and sees it and breaks down crying and apologizes. 

My question is this normal for women? I’ve delt with this  in the past and heard some women don’t like being told they fucked up and first instinct is like a black out until they calm down and remember?

she has had previous partners who cheated on her and an abusive family. also has depresion and anxiety. i am a pretty chill and unassuming guy. i do my 9 to 5, then mostly spend time by myself or with friends on the weekdays. i have been for more than 10 years a non-conflictive person, trying to mind my own business and don't provoke other people, kind of focused on my own lane. i've had partners in the past, more often than not, serious relationships, where nobody has cheated as far as i know. i wouldn't cheat as honestly a single relationship is already a ton of work and i see no real purpose on that. i also like hanging out with my friends quite a bit, play sports and cook most of the days, so realistically speaking, even if i was dying inside to do it, i wouldn't have time to. and i definitely do not have the energy either, something which i learned by trying to date two people in a non-commited way and very transparent manner a couple years ago. having said this, i do get along with women and have many women friends (as male friends) with which i have no shared or one-directional romantic interest, many of these friendships spanning a large amount of years

my girlfriend knows all of this, as well as my sexual history and also knows many of my friends, who also, like me, happen to be very chill dudes, yet completely overreacts every time i hang in the most unplatonical way with some random woman. for instance, earlier this year it was my friend's birthday (john) on a restaurant. i got there late and sat on the only empty seat. talked with her friend (sophie) i literally didn't know because the person i knew on my other side was already into a very involved convo. she always asks a lot about what i do or expects me to tell her everything so i just told her a short summary of me going to this and talking to this person. fast forward, later that week it was my john's birthday party. he doesn't have a big apartment so i volunteered to host on mine. i got late from work so was doing a ton of cleaning. by the time i was done a friend (william) had arrived so i talked to him. then to sophie for two seconds who introduced me to her friend (some dude) who shares musical interests with me. honestly hours flew and i replied to her when the party was a bit more chill. when i did she was super jealous, implying that there was something going on between me and this girl, that i was a liar, that she was crying because i didn't reply to her in 3 hrs, that i was cheating and a ton of other very intense nonsense shit. i was obviously completely overwhelmed but still explained that this was just my friend's friend and that i was just being nice. that there was no reason for me not to engage with this person, that she obviously wasn't into me and that i was actually mostly catching up with william. this is btw, exactly what happened. she eventually accepted what happened

more recently, a friend from school (karen) which i haven't seen in years told me she was coming to my current city for work and that she wanted to hang. for reference, i've known this girl for over 15 years without nothing coming out of it ever. she is also on a 3-year relationship with her current boyfriend on her now home city. i obviously accepted the invite and we went to a restaurant to eat. when my gf asked about what i was doing i said i was going to a restaurant. i didn't told her about karen coming because i was running late and i didn't have the time to have an argument as the one above or explain who karen is. but when i was done we talked and i told her the deal. she got super hysterical, going back at me for ""being a liar, ommiting things and being a cheater"". the other thing that i hate that she does when she is being petty about these things is that she is super sarcastic and sassy and starts saying that i am like ""all other men"", ""now don't pretend that you are a saint"", ""oh poor you"", ""stop playing the victim"", ""own it, stop playing uno reverse card on me"" all things that imo are extremely emotionally and verbally abusive and honestly kind of manipulative too, when i haven't done jackshit. like i'm just hanging out with some fucking person who happens to be a woman, why does that make me a liar or a cheater. she also keeps implying i am calling her crazy when i have never done that. altho i have told her her behavior is unreasonable and unacceptable and that i'm not going to put up with it. she also pretends me to have some bullshit excuse every time i hang with someone and pretends that is fucking odd if i hang out with someone new or someone who isn't a very close friend

she claims that her lack of trust on me stems from a couple months ago when she ""found out"" that i had liked ""provocative pictures"" of some girls on instagram. i did like a couple of pictures of some girls on bikini but i don't see what is the big deal. she made a huge deal out of it and threw a couple tantrums and i gave in to stop doing it, even tho i never talked with any of these women or was pursuing them. she keeps bringing it up as if it is something i keep doing on a consistent fashion (which when i did, it was just a couple times, and i haven't done it since we talked) and then claiming that her reactions to my interactions with women are rational because i broke trust. as a matter of fact, she found a picture of this friend in bikini of several years ago that i liked and claimed that i was into her and that i was lying because of that. i've told her she is not good at dealing with her anger and her emotions in general and that she should go back to therapy. she insists that i am a bad person and that i have worsened her traumas and that her reactions are totally valid. i know i am not perfect, but claiming that i am the devil because i am hanging out unromantically with old friends or just with friends' friends and liking a couple pictures on instagram seems a bit extreme to me

Now I can't get the way he said what he said to me out of my head, even after apologizing.

My partner (31M) and I (26F) have been dating for nearly 2 years, and we've lived together for most of that time. We recently had an argument, which when it got heated, my partner said to me, ""I don't want to talk to you anymore."" 

He does this quite frequently when we're having disagreements and so I got frustrated and said something snippy and passive aggressive under my breath in response (""Surprise, surprise""). He then scoffed at me and said ""Fuck you"" in the most contemptuous tone I have ever heard from him. He's normally so level-headed and stoic. 

Anyway, I immediately got overwhelmed and retreated to the bedroom. A few hours later, I came out and apologized for the passive aggressive statement I had made, and he said ""sorry for saying 'fuck you'"". It's been hours now and I can't stop thinking about the tone he used (as well as what he said, as we don't swear at each other like that). 

I can't get it out of my head, and I don't know what to do. I think of myself as a very forgiving person and don't generally hold grudges. Usually I am able to let go of something as soon as there is an apology, or after a certain amount of time even if there isn't one.

He currently owes me about $270 from past stuff and I suggested that maybe we see how much a replacement or repair costs and then I’ll cancel that debt and pay the difference if it costs more or it’ll be all clear. He currently doesn’t have a source of income, so the bass probably wouldn’t be repaired/replaced until he had money. 

He seemed very upset with this proposition and said well now he doesn’t have money or the bass. I empathize with what he’s saying. I don’t know if this was a bad option to offer, and if it makes me an asshole for suggesting it. (He doesn’t currently play the bass, but he has been learning and practicing guitar and was planning to learn bass soon, and obviously if he wants his bass now, he deserves it now because I broke it), I have just been waiting a long time for the debt to be repaid in full and thought this would be a good means of clearing it.

I’m just not sure where to go from here.

Was it due to losing attraction or do I just have a low libido?

Honestly, maybe it’s the attraction that has just died for me. But for my previous relationship, the only reason we lasted 3 years is because we have history and our families know each other. We “dated” as kids when we were like 13-15 and then broke up of course when he went off to college (he was 16 when he left). So we decided to rekindle things post college and dated 3 years. When we first started dating, my ex (now 28M) was overweight but now he’s like borderline, if not already obese according to BMI. Over time, his weight gain, paired with our relationship frustrations just killed any desire for sex on my part, though I never had much to begin with. We still had sex here and there, but I never initiated and honestly became rather averse to it, I just did it when I had to and couldn’t wait until it was over. 

Now I’m getting to know a new guy and I can’t help but think how will I ever overcome my lack of desire for sex? Is this guy doomed to a similar fate?

I masturbate like once in a while. Currently once every month or two, but I can go pretty long without even the thought of touching myself, and usually I break during high stress/anxious times.

He apologized but ended up doing it again and he explained that she confessed to having feelings towards him in person and to reassure me, he said, “i told her i loved you, and only you and missed YOU” and i then realized that one of these nights we were hanging out i had a strange feeling and asked to go through his phone, he always let me go through his phone but he said he wanted his privacy this time. when i asked a few weeks later why he wouldn’t let me go through his phone he told me he wouldn’t let me because he had been texting her behind my back. but he expressed that it was only to vent about our relationship and i was pissed off at that point because why would you vent to her?? to which he explains “she was there…and i was supposed to go to you? i don’t trust you and i was scared.” scared i’d find out?? geee thanks…i only got more angry.

We met in college and after graduating, I got my own apartment. He was applying to medical school and didn't know where he would end up, so he lived at home and with me some of the time. After he got accepted, his mom bought him and his younger brother a condo since they were both in college/ medical school. Once his brother moved out, I moved in for a year while I quit my job and applied to dental school. I recently got into dental school in a different state, and we have been long-distance for 6 months. He is finishing medical school and applying to residency programs now, and we are hoping he gets into a program in my new state.

Being together for 6 years and living together twice, I've asked him about marriage several times, and his answer always changes. He's said ""Let me see where I get into medical school"" or ""Let me see where I get into residency"". I can't help but wonder if that is just an excuse because it is easy. In my mind, if you want to be with someone, you make it work in whatever way possible. I mostly want a genuine answer on if he can see himself with me in the future or if I am not the one he thinks he wants to settle down with. I am his first girlfriend/ relationship and worry maybe he doesn't know what he wants. Our relationship is great (sure we have normal ups/ downs) but it works for us and we understand each other's busy schedules, and there's no reason to break up at the moment. I can't help but fear he is not being genuine on if he wants to spend the rest of his life with me or if we will break up once/if he moves here if he still doesn't want to get married. We have already agreed that we would most likely break up if he doesn't because his residency program will be 7 years and I will be in school for another 3.5 years.

Guys, would you commit/ get engaged if you were in our situation? I would love the idea of being engaged and knowing there is an endpoint after 6 years of 'seeing where we end up'. Is it too crazy to want him to say he wants to make this work no matter the distance? Worst case, we do long distance for 3 years while I finish school and he starts residency, but we both are so busy anyways that long distance hasn't been completely terrible these past 6 months. Plus he would be working crazy hours, and I wouldn't even see him much if we were living together. I would be willing to relocate if he did not end up here once I am out of school. Plus, I would be able to visit him on weekends while I finish school.

Side note: he used to say he didn't want kids and didn't want to be married until after residency. At that point, I would be too old to even have kids. Now he says he wouldn't mind having kids a few years into residency, but that is still pushing it for me. His views seem to be changing but I still don't feel confident he thinks I'm the one.

Im seeking to know if I did the right think with me and gf, or ex gf.

TLDR: GF has been distant, I broke up with her, was it right?

Background: Gf (F 20) and I have been dating just around 6 months. She lives at home with parent (Father 50s). She has a PT job at a coffee place that doesnt like unions and more than FT college, I have a FT job in a tech industry.

2 Weeks ago, she ran out of ADHD and focus drugs from her prescription. She said that throughout the year the Drs cant keep a regular schedule. 2 weeks ago she got a nasty flu and our communication dropped. I was worried about her and brought her food to get better and also got the number of a cousin (F 19) that lives with her 4 days a week. She has been very stressed with school, family, work, and mostly parents. Her parents are going through a divorce and due to English is not their primary language, she is handling all the paperwork.

On Monday I called her and offered anything to relieve stress, a date, concert, whatever. Yes, I have a good stable job and I did not mind supporting her with bills, or gas money, or tuition. She said no, cause it would just make her think of all the things she needed to be doing instead. She started crying, hung up and sent me a text saying she would talk to me later and she wanted to be left alone.

Tuesday no comm

Wend: I called to see how she was and text. No response. Before anyone judge, our daily communication was between 10 and 30 messages a day.

Thursday: Heard she was sick from cousin, left food in her garage and messaged with no response.

Friday: she called in at work. No communication either way.

Saturday: I left a VM and text saying im worried about her and about us. No response.

Sunday: (Yes I have trust issues, however this is the first time Ive done anything deceivious with her) I created a fake phone # and texted her as a wrong number with a wrong message. She texted that number back when she got off work saying wrong number.

I was hurt, you will take the time to answer a stranger. But not say anything to a guy you dated for 6 months. Not an FU or sorry, or anything. I calmed down collected my thoughts, sent a message saying I wanted to discuss not over text, but im ending the relationship. I care more about us than what you can receiprcate. I wish you the best.

I have two tips if you’re going through a breakup. Whether the breakup was amicable or not you NEED to do no contact + Block on socials etc. 

It was hard initially but it was the number one thing that helped me move on. 

Tip number 2 is if you’re worried about finding a new person or even if you’re just looking for someone to make love with. Fuq tinder off, go out and meet people. I have met 5 attractive woman in the last 3 weeks and slept with them all. 

This helped a lot as well. Obviously only do that when you’re feeling like the time is ready. 
It sounds cliché but be yourself and act confident even if you are not.  Fake it till you make it… 
I never had confidence but I forced myself to be in uncomfortable situations and now I’m much better.

I met my boyfriend on FB dating shortly after breaking up with my girlfriend of 5 years. I thought he was cute and he liked me back. We went on a few dates and became official after the 3rd date.

A pattern I have noticed about my relationships in the past is that they tend to go hot, heavy and intense at first and then it falls apart. This one is no different. All the red flags were there and I feel stupid that I didn't see them.

Every conversation we have is an argument, he has done nothing but criticize me and try to change me  and doesn't listen to a word I fucking say along with he refuses to learn my boundaries.

He moved in with me shortly after I kicked out my ex-roommate for attempting to steal from my family.  He's lived with me since we started dating and I can't take it anymore.

For the past two weeks, I've been at my uncle's despite not wanting to at first. I have to be here for 6 more weeks until my uncle can lift more than 8 pounds again. My boyfriend knows this and I have told him I can't hang out much bc of this and he ignores me whenever I say no.

We have a roommate (Also 27) who lives with us but he doesn't pay his rent like he's supposed to. That and his constant drama are the only things I hold against him. 

The house we live in belongs to my family and they're going to help me kick them out but I fear what might happen as a result.

I have been trying to ghost my boyfriend for a week, thinking he'd be smart enough to take the hint. No such luck. He keeps contacting me and bothering me to hang out when I tell him the same thing over and over again. I'm currently sick with a stomach bug (probably more attributed to stress but I digress) and I have to take care of my uncle and 4 dogs. But he still won't leave me alone and he won't take no for an answer.

I'm working in the service industry as a server assistant and this guy is a server. We're both mid twenties. For the sake of this thread, we'll name the crush Mark.

**A little bit of background on me with regards to the story:** I have a little of social anxiety left over from working from home during covid and the whole quarantine social isolation people experienced. I'm trying to work through the anxiety and regain these social skills and I feel like this environment is the perfect place to do so. With that being said, I feel like I'm not reading clues or hints and I ""don't have any game"" and I'm shy. I also haven't actually had a crush on anyone or liked anyone in like 8 years so I really wanted to give this a shot while not getting played by someone who might have ""experience"". I don't know what the dating landscape is like now.

I'm super shy and avoidant and awkward when I have a crush so I've avoided Mark and I think he figured it out because one day he said, ""you know \_\_\_(my name) \_\_\_\_ is one of my favorite names"" and I was nervous and just replied something like oh I really like the name Tom. This was him being direct and I've been indirect mainly because I'm shy and I just don't know how to flirt or do this. As a result, I've been noticing him giving off a lot of indirect cues as well but I'm also just not sure in reading them.

**Before I share the indirect cues, its worth mentioning an issue with some of the other Server Assistants I work with and how I was essentially getting harassed by them and how this has affected the situation with my Mark**. One day one of the him and one other girl were standing behind me and I hear my Mark go, ""She stinks?"" and the other food assistant go, ""Yeah she does"". I got self conscious thinking I did and asked someone to sniff test me and they said I smelled good. The next day, the same server assistant and I got into an argument and I reported her to our managers and I included the little statement Mark and her made about me since it was evidence for the harassment I was dealing with and I wanted to keep documentation if anything.

I think he's been kinda hesitant as well but I also don't want to be masculine and pursue because that never works. **Here are some of the indirect cues Mark has given off:**

* (Not a green flag but 🙄) When one of our coworkers was nearby, he started talking about another girl that used to work there that he was in love with and how he was gonna marry her. I walked off upon hearing this.
* He sarcastically/playfully said, ""Thanks for your help \_\_\_\_(my name)"" and there was another girl around with my same name. I asked if he was talking to me and he pretended the area around was too loud for him to hear what I was saying.
* He started trying to run his own food. Not sure if this has been to help or if he's afraid of me sabotaging him or I honestly don't know.
* It seems like he's mimicking my behaviors or matching the same energy. If I try to communicate and be cordial at work or I'm avoiding him or if I try to hang out next to him, he'll match the same energy, if that makes sense. That or I'm losing my shit lol. I also don't want to be reading too much because idk if he's just shy too and not sure how to tread or just not thinking much about it. Example: I left to take a personal call at work and I guess he noticed? He took a personal call right in front of me the same day which I noticed he's never done before either.
* One day, I made direct eye contact with him and I avoided saying hi to him and he noticed and walked straight up to me and asked if I had just got there like in a way like I know you saw me and avoided me. I just started fumbling words because I was anxious that he approached me and that was it.
* Whenever he says anything indirect about himself, he always says it loud while in my presence and I feel like he's been paying attention to me as well. I've caught him looking at me from across the room or if he says something that he wants to be heard by me, he'll look around to see if I'm close enough to hear. For example, after this whole ordeal with the saying ""I stink"" thing, I overheard him saying, ""Its me isn't it, I mess everything up.""

I want to be feminine in my relationship and not be the one pursuing and I want them to take the lead but I feel like he's also unsure of how to tread. I'd like some advice from men on how would be best to move forward assuming there's any sense of maturity in this guy and if its a relationship worth pursuing or if I should just move on.

We've been together about 6 1/2 months and currently work together. We first met and hit it off immediately shortly after she started working at the same small grocery store as me and things looked good for a while, but looking back it didn't take her long to start putting her trauma towards me. She always talks about how her mother would hit and manipulate her and how her exes would do the same thing. Her mother would throw her into walls, throw things at her, physically beat her, gaslight her, make her pay for using basic things (shower $1.50, razor $0.25 etc), take her money, prohibit cooking and then call her lazy and force her to go on family outings. Her exes would also beat her, use her for her body, gaslight and manipulate and other things. I'm not 100% sure on what's true and what's not, just retelling what I've been told. She's also apart of a local volunteer fire department which causes even more trauma (and drama since she used to sleep around there a lot when her and her ex were together). She's constantly stressed about her financial situation despite routinely going on online shopping sprees when she gets a little extra money or bored, but refuses to try and work extra hours to try and compensate for her spending. I have helped her on multiple occasions with her bills however she still hasn't quite figured out how to save and always ends up near or in the negative by the next paycheck. She recently got a new puppy (Golden retriever/black lab) from an adoption center stating that ""her mother is paying for it"" however her mother hasn't paid for anything on the dog and its beginning to feel like she got the dog in the hopes that I would be around more. This is after having 2 other dogs (beagle mix and 7mo GSP) all in a small area of the house that her parents allow her to stay at. Daily I hear about how the dogs did this and the dogs did that and how the dogs are mentally and physically abusing her despite them being confined and bored and wanting to play and how it'd be so much easier if there was extra help. The GSP tends to behave better when iI'm around so its become 'my dog'. Every morning and evening its ' Your dog did this, your dog did that and destroyed half the house' even though its more her dog than mine. She keeps pushing for me to move in with her, and initially I wanted to but now not so much. It wasnt long after she moved back in that it became more and more like I was having to take care of the dogs and her anytime I was over she wouldn't leave her room to do anything, including eat or get food. If I'm outside doing work, she'll complain and whine until I come inside and make her food and cuddle up with her in bed, so its extremely hard to get any kind of necessary work done if she's around. If I mention that I want to try and do some work around the house or even hangout with my friends or parents she gets extremely upset and shuts herself down for the rest of the day, and I get an earful about how she just wants to spend time with me, how i mean so much to her etc, but I actually see her more than my own parents who I still live with and them more than my friends. If I bring it up that I want to see them and that its a problem with what she's doing she shuts down again. I've got to be on call seemingly 24/7 for her otherwise she gets upset although she doesn't have to answer if I call her. She's constantly talking about how she wants to die but she hangs on for me. She's been talking about that for months now but she says that its getting worse lately. I love her to death but it seems like the girl I fell for is gone or never existed to begin with. So I  guess what I'm trying to ask is what's the best thing to do in this situation? I don't really want to leave her but at the same time I'm tired of the drama but don't want her to kill herself if i do leave.

So I did my best to get over him. It was hard since I’ve liked him for 3 years. But I finally got to a better place when this happened.


Us and some of our friends were playing a board game. Around this time I had noticed (out of the corner of my eye) a couple looks towards me from him. But I brushed it off as chance since I was convinced he hated me. I’m not one for hanging out with guys, it makes me anxious (which is another problem for another day). But there was a lot of eye contact going on between the two of us. A lot more then I’m typically comfortable with. And there were a few smirks and smiles between the two of us as we tried to beat each other at the game. We were definitely looking at each other more then anyone else, but whenever our (nonverbal) communication got anywhere close to flirtatious, I promptly looked away. I am a pretty shy person and I typically ignore it when people stare at me or give me any signs of romantic attraction. 

I honestly don’t know what to do your how to feel. Like previously mentioned I don’t hang out with guys basically ever. And he doesn’t hang with a ton of girls. I don’t know how to figure out if he likes me if we aren’t hanging out together.

At this date it has been nearly a year now since we started dating and since its mainly LDR, you might expect it to be hard. But we have plans to eventually start staying together, which the preferred method would be for me to relocate to her country, while furthering my professional study (law) and working there especially since the income there is much higher as compared to where I am from. Another method would be her coming to my country but the income would be much lower since I will be the only one that can obtain a decent job while she would have a harder time here.

However, when I voiced out my plans to my father (52m) he is very against it, commenting that I am being used and saying how the girl would only use me and ditch me at the end, saying how he have seen much more than I do considering his age. True that there's a stereotype that Hong Kong girls are very 'money minded' but right now, by no means am I rich at all as I can't possibly buy her the luxurious bag, yet she stayed, she supported me, and even to the extend of saying that she will try to fund my professional studies if my dad refuse to do so, and so I let me dad know about it. In the end my dad is still against it despite me saying these and further commented that she is doing so, so that in the future after my studies and obtain high income, she will leech all the money from me then. Of course the conversation eventually got heated up, and I don't rmb too much from it but something about him asking me to bear my own consequences and he will not 'give a shit' about me anymore.

Now after that conversation perhaps he has 'gaslighted' me? or perhaps I am thinking too much, I have worries now. If I go all in for both my career and relationship and shit goes down, I doubt I can return to my family  considering that's what he said, but this is the first time I have a girl willingly contribute so much to me, mentally, financially etc. I just am uncertain what is the correct choice, is my father right?

There is a news report recently stating how women MPs face it worse than men and get s exual, r ape and d eath t hreats. And a man said they face it worse. And that unfortunately  women have to be thick skinned and resilient.

Another female celeb said women get it worse than men, are judged harsher in all ways and held to higher standards.

I'm probably overthinking it, but I'm also not that great with understanding female behavior a lot of times and can be a bit awkward. 

TL:DR - I have a contracted business relationship with the venue this younger girl works for. We meet up at a concert and drunkenly make out on the dance floor and then she ""goes to the bathroom"" and never comes back and I have no way to contact her. I confirm she's safe the next day but would like to know what happened without coming across as clingy or desperate.

Back story:

I own a small but growing stage lighting company and recently started getting contracted to do lighting for all of the larger concerts for an outdoor venue downtown, which has been a big growth point for my business. I landed this gig after getting contracted to do lighting for a music video for an artist who is also the production manager of said venue, who loved my work. I'll call him John (early 40's). 

There is a very cute and friendly girl who works for the venue, I'll call her Rae. Rae is very extroverted and a great person to be around. She often volunteers to help me and my crew out when we need it. Since meeting her, I've had a slight crush on her but hadn't pursued her because:

1. I thought she had a boyfriend
2. She's a lot younger than my typical dating range and we are on a little different maturity level
3. I'm scared to rock the boat with this awesome gig that has great growth potential
4. I'm really terrible at flirting and didn't want to make it awkward 

Current situation:

Two nights ago, John hired me to do lighting for his band's show at another venue that he is also the production manager for. Rae comes to the show, having had a few drinks prior, and is chatting with me while I'm working and giving me clues that she has a thing for me. She insists on helping me load out all my equipment after the show ends and then invites me to go with her to another show a few blocks away where another venue coworker's band is about to go on. 

She meets me at that show and we have a few more drinks together at her lead. She also eats some MJ edibles from a vendor there. We are having a great time together hitting it off. She pulls me into the crowd and starts getting very friendly with me in the middle of the packed dance floor and we start making out. Although I'm not one for PDA, especially since I have ongoing business relationship with this venue as well and would prefer the owner and Rae's other coworkers who are there not to notice, we are having a good time together, so I go with it. After more drinks and more of this, Rae has to go to the restroom and asks me to hold her drink, leaving me in the middle of the crowd. Minutes turn into an hour and she isn't back. The crowd isn't big enough at this point for her not to be able to find me. The show ends, everyone is leaving, and she is nowhere to be found. I don't have her phone number or any way to reach her. I hang out a little longer talking to the band members and another guy who works at Rae's venue, he mentions that he thought he had seen me in the crowd (haha whoops). 

Finally, I conclude that she has ditched me, and I leave. I was worried about her and unsure if she got sick and left or if she suddenly changed her mind about me. I thought about sending a female in the bathroom to check if she was in there sick, and maybe I should have, but given the amount of time that had passed I felt like she would have been out of there by then. Plus, I was feeling a little embarrassed at that point. 

The next morning while discussing John's concert with him, I ask if he wouldn't mind checking to make sure Rae was okay, just telling him that I had been at the other concert with her and she had asked me to hold her drink while she went to the restroom but then disappeared, and I wanted to make sure she got home safe. John told me he was currently working an event and she was there also. I said I was glad to hear it and left it at that. Still being very confused about the situation and wanting answers, I search for any social media for Rae, find an Instagram which is private, and send her a follow request. Earlier today she finally accepted it and followed me back, but neither one of us had said anything to each other. 

I'm really at a loss of what to do or say in this situation. I don't understand why she would have bailed without saying anything to me and can only guess that maybe I wasn't matching her enthusiasm since she was the one initiating most of the dance floor PDA and she got embarrassed? Or maybe she just got sick and embarrassed? Regardless of whether or not I want to pursue her romantically, I feel like I should at least clear the air and discuss the situation with her. I preferably want to do it in a light-hearted low stakes way that makes her feel comfortable to be honest. I also don't want to somehow come off as clingy and desperate. I really don't want this to be weird and awkward, especially since that has the potential to hurt my business growth.

I recently reconnected with an old fling.  I instantly announced that I was emotionally unavailable for the first time in my life. I thought this would make having a FWB with him easier since the first time I pushed him away because he wasn’t ready for a relationship. Now I’m only looking for casual and he seems really good at casual (hasn’t had a long term relationship since I’ve known him) 

I thought this was a win-win. We could resume as FWB. Our first meetup,  I couldn’t tell if he thought he had a second chance at a relationship with me because he is normally really easy going but instead he was cautious. I communicated not to worry and I was looking to do casual for once. Our meetups have been amazing but lately he has seemed a little more nervous and tense. But I noticed the sex and kissing has gotten better too, it almost seems like relationship sex. We are laughing a lot more too and sharing about our lives 

I can’t tell if I’m just missing social cues or what. The last time he visited it was a Friday night and he wanted to hang out earlier in the evening, like 5pm. I figured he had plans afterward. After we hooked up he put his clothes on fast, so I preemptively said it’s cool if he heads out, no pressure to stay. But then he seemed offended and asked if he could stay a little bit? Then he asked if I was hungry and wanted to get food. I wasn’t but I made him some food and we watched a movie. He asked what I was doing this weekend and I responded nothing and he didn’t respond. At the end of the night we were laughing and cuddling and I told him how easy it is being around him and he got all awkward again. I mentioned he was my first fwb and he got kind of awkward and he left shortly after that. He always kisses me goodbye and asks if we can meet up again and I say of course.  I didn’t think anything of it. I texted him and he was acting more… awkward/tense than usual. 

Normally I would just assume someone is losing interest but it doesn’t feel like that, do fwb act more awkward when they start to like you? 

I’ve never had a fwb before so any insight would be really helpful. I plan on having a direct talk with him but want to save it for being in person, I will follow up here after.

Some context: my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. Most of the relationship has been magical and we have truly been happy and hope to spend the rest of our lives together but there have been a few ugly moments that largely come down to poor communication, insecurities (hers or mine depending on the situation), my emotional cowardice, and her explosive temper which is truly frightening. There's also a fair amount of tension between our work schedules (she works in IT, so she usually sleeps until noon and works until 3 p.m. whereas I work \~60 hours a week or more).  


We live separately but I spend 5-6 nights a week at her place.   


She recently got very upset because I woke her up at 9 for a meeting she needed to attend. She was pretty rude to me so I headed home to work (as I usually do and had told her I was going to do) but I left a little abruptly without much explanation and unintentionally gave her the silent treatment for the next few hours because I was buried in work. I tend to retreat when she's rude and the silent treatment drives her crazy, which I know, but I swear that wasn't my intent that day.  


Anyway, she texts me a few hours later canceling our plans for that night. I ask why and she gets onto me waking her up ""so early"" and basically explodes on me. It isn't long before she blocks me on Instagram and eventually tells me to never speak to her again, which is something she has told me a minimum of 10 times in various fights. But this one escalates... because I feel I haven't done anything wrong, so I ask her to apologize. Instead, she explodes.  


Fast forward to screaming phone calls from her which eventually lead me to hang up on her, which only prompts more screaming phone calls, which leads to... you guessed it, me hanging up on her.  


Now here's where it gets really shitty and complicated. This huge fight occurs shortly before she's headed back to Colorado, where she's from (we both live on the East Coast currently) to have surgery to remove a cyst from her ovary. The plan is to have the surgery there so she can recover at home near her large loving family with mountain views rather than in a cramped city apartment.  


So the last two days before she leaves are basically her calling and screaming at me about what a ""monster"" and ""asshole"" I am, and how I've abandoned her at her lowest when she just needed peace. (She also gets obsessed with the fact that I had mentioned a new female co-worker to her, someone who I had just met and have no interest in, but she becomes weirdly jealous for no reason. I should mention that I always thought the trust between us was very strong. This part is very irrational to me.) This ugliness continues and she even makes a rare visit to my place to bring over my stuff (including gifts I've given her: shoes, jewelry, a camera, etc.) but I missed her because I wasn't home, I had gone into the office at that time so she left it at the front desk of my apartment.  


Then, because she's in such a stress/rage spiral, she has an anxiety attack at her place that was so severe she passed out and hurt herself. She didn't tell me about the severity of it until later. Anyway... she moves her flight up and leaves for Colorado early without me seeing her and while telling me to never speak to her again, though I continue to do so because I've heard this before. But of course I’m distraught and hurt, so I tend to focus on my feelings and prioritize my heartache over hers.  


Now she's in Colorado and apparently in a hospital because she had some sort of mental breakdown, which she is blaming on me. She's about a week out from her surgery and I was supposed to fly out there for it but now she wants nothing to do with me. And of course, she's running me down in front of her large, close-knit family, people I need to impress if I am going to marry her as I intend to.  


She is currently stuck in a hospital in Colorado and texting me about what a horrible person I am and asking why I don't center her in my life, why I am purposefully fucking her over, and so on. I spent almost the entire last night on the phone with her, mostly listening to her rant and rave and call me various names. I am at a complete loss for what to do. How do I support the woman I love--even though she hates me--as she is in a hospital halfway across the country and having a breakdown before a major surgery? How can I make anything better? I don't want to lose the love of my life over a cranky wake-up that escalated. But I also don't want to be called names and treated like shit.

Two years ago I liked an old fling’s post on Instagram. A harmless photo(a selfie with her cat), but it was disrespectful of me and I shouldn’t have done it. I know. My gf immediately thought something was going on between her and I, so she messaged the girl. Truthfully, nothing was going on. We hadn’t even talked since we stopped seeing each other. Things were recovering, but I started to question the relationship because sex had was few and far between, there was no affection coming from her either. I thought I started to develop feelings for someone else. I felt terrible. We broke up for a week. I never told my gf about why we split. I said it was my mental health and that I’m scared of what’s going to happen between us in the future. That was all true. I suffered a breakdown and couldn’t pull myself together, thankfully I am much better now. 
We got back together, and a bit down the road she discovered that I started to have feelings for a coworker (at that point we haven’t worked together for over a year)
Fast forward to now: GF says she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me and is unsure if she can trust me fully. I own all of my mistakes. I’m aware that this all happened because of my actions.  What the hell do I do from here?!

We actually met up not that long ago and it was great! We plan on meeting up again and I’m really looking forward to it! Only thing is, he’s the worst at texting back. Like actually awful. Like he’ll go from texting me back every few minutes to every couple hours to up to 22 hours. I don’t complain or anything because 1. He’s in college 2. He has friends 3. He has extracurricular activities. But in all actuality, I wanna talk to him. I like him a lot. He’s cute, he’s smart, he’s funny, he’s everything I want in a guy honestly. But I have no idea how he feels. It’s like he’s giving me enough attention to keep me interested but not too little so I can let him go. I’m afraid if I say something he’ll be weirded out and think I’m craving too much attention. But 22 hours? Cmon i know he’s on his phone. There’s no way. But yeah, should I say something or just let it be?

So my girlfriend is at a internship and a co-worker who is a guy took few pictures (2 to be exact) from a distance (nothing provocative) and send it too her via text. I'm initially thinking, it's a like a hard work done but not sure the meaning behind this. She has a easy going personality and very social where it seems shes flirting and I understand and don't make it a big deal but let her know this is kind of wierd. We talked about it and she doesn't take picture of him etc and lets me know everyone knows she has a bf etc. Just wondering any situation like this happen to you guys and just don't think much of it? It's been 2 weeks in if any timing is a issue.. I'm in long distance right now and work as a web/graphic designer and she is the nurse. If this didn't happen to you and if it did, what are your thoughts? First relationships for both of us (guess we are careful who we choose lol) so please be nice with advice lol
