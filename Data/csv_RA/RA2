We’ve been planning a nice little get away for a couple months now and up to last night, we were both super excited about it. 

I had to take our pet to the vet today and I had texted my boyfriend and said it would be more than I had expected since they wanted to do X-rays for bladder stones. A couple minutes later he came back and said he was depressed and didn’t want to go on our trip. I assumed he was worried about the X-ray and waited for the doctor. I let my boyfriend know that the X-rays came back clear and as far as the vet can tell, our little one is fine. I asked if he was worried about the appointment and that’s why he had a sudden shift in tone. He just said it was everything. I told him getting away could be good for him to get out and relax but he still wanted to cancel.

I’m a bit upset since I was really looking forward to this trip and I felt a bit blindsided to him wanting to cancel. I didnt fight him on it since, to be honest, when he gets in a mood he can be stubborn and plus he’s at work. It doesn’t help that I know he is completely miserable at work but refuses to look around and gets hostile when it’s mentioned. I do feel like an inconsiderate ass for being upset since he did say that he was depressed.

It sucked. It used to be very easy to see each other but when the borders closed we couldn’t. I became very depressed because of this loneliness and other things and became a person you wouldn’t want to date (lazy, +3.0 lbs heavier, addicted to prescribed anxiety medicine, arrogant because I wasn’t talking to other people for almost a year). After the borders opened, I went to live with him again for 2 months, but it was clear(and understandable) he liked me less than before. 

2 months after I went back home, he tried to break up with me cordially by video chat.(one year ago) It was my first breakup and I was very hurt. I had a few times were I told him I was hurt in an embarrassing (but not abusive or toxic) way. This is still the deepest pain I have felt because we were together 4 years and I truly thought he was the one.  I eventually stopped talking to him entirely when I got my Master’s degree and didn’t like his uninterested response when I told him. I told him I need time to heal because I wasn’t acting right and didn’t want to be seen this way. As far as I know, he isn’t mad at or hostile toward me. 

It’s now been 3 months since I’ve interacted with him and I’ve really focused on making my life better. I run every day now, have quit those awful anxiety drugs, have gone through 9 months of weekly therapy, only eat healthy. I feel, act and look so much better. I regret that I didn’t do all of this while I was still with him, but I’ve taken it as a lesson to work toward becoming a complete person on my own rather than date again. 

His birthday is in a few days. Should I break my silence with him to wish him a happy birthday? I would like us to be in a place where that’s possible because I still am fond of him and enjoy his conversation even though I know we can’t be together anymore. I would like to be in a place where we can at least wish each other well occasionally after all that we’ve been through. 

My apprehension about this is because I don’t want to ruin his day. Do you think me reaching out would be a positive or negative thing?

Everything was great but then he started having insecurity issues with someone from work. So back story his ex worked with him they broke up shortly before we met. She according to him was flirting with let’s call him Erick while they were still together and this was all happening at work. Once I met my now ex bf and we got in a relationship I found out my brother was friends with Erick. So one day we (my brother, sister, bff) we’re drinking at home my bf couldn’t go since he was working and Erick came since my brother invited him. That night I took videos of all of us. I ended up telling my ex he came and we were all drinking. So after that he was more weary we continued having issues about this Erick dude which I only saw twice at my home hanging out mainly with my brother. We broke up like twice due to him insisting I was cheating on him with this dude, which I gave him no reason to think that. He became more clingy due to that which I didn’t mind spending more time but what did bug me was him constantly telling me to not cheat on him. So fast forward November 11th to be exact he came and told me there were “rumors” around his job which my brother, sister and Erick work at as well. That I was cheating on him with someone from there that if he checked my phone there would be messages and I would be calling people mainly guys from his job to go drinking with, mind you the only number I have from anyone aside from siblings that work there is his. I told him to tell me who was spreading the rumor he gave me three different stories every time we talked about it. I suspected he was lying about it and it was him having doubts again. I already knew he was talking about Erick and I having an affair mind you Erick is married. So once we figured out this girl he was claiming spread the rumor denied it and was willing to speak with him and I he out of nowhere broke up with me. Then I gave him stuff back yesterday and he told me he broke up with me because I was cheating on him with Erick as I pretty much knew that was his response. He said Erick showed guys working with him pictures and messages I had sent him they were screenshots that he saw supposedly. I was like you broke up with me over the weekend how did you see anything, aside from knowing this is bs. My question is I was planning a romantic date for him tomorrow getting him flowers and all as we once said we would not give up so easy.

if he wanted to he would… right





i cant rap around my head how someone who really cared about you and was always there for u just stopped carring


my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc he said he was depressed and suicidal etc and felt like he wasted his time with me when he could have gotten a better internship etc

it was bad bc we hadnt had sex in 2 months and just i felt pushed aside. 

we break up and well i beg and cry and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
“ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…” i beg cry and say all i did for him etc


then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me and missed the sex 

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building 

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels but said he would make it up to me

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety

i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later he
screenshots someone's story on instagram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz”

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it


i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text
im
scared” 

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

he comes back hours later and talks to some girl next to me. and i pass by and look at each other and wave and i leave

i think ive lost most of my feelings im just concerned at the fact that he saw that i wasnt the one… what is the one? and why arent i the one?

i texted him
today only to ask him about some file i needed and called him by his full name. he was shocked i said it that way as i always call him sam. and he told
me if he finds it he will give it to me.

i ended up saying “u know what its fine we will figure it out” and thats that…

and he didnt respond so im fine idk

She went to college out of state and I joined the military and we didn't talk at all for 4-5 years, but we both came back and saw each other at the bar when we happened to be home and clicked instantly back like nothing happened. Eventually, we told each other how we felt etc. started dating. We have done so many awesome things together since then... but she has one problem that makes me feel so bad about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously love her and every second I get to spend with her or talking to her is a second well spent, I have never felt this way about anyone. But holy fuck I can't get her to communicate and it actually makes me so frustrated and makes me question everything. It makes me feel very not important to her. We are both old souls and we hate texting, hate social media and stuff, so obviously texting isn't up our alley, but I try to make the effort because I genuinely want to talk to her and I want her to know I think about her. She just doesn't respond. Like if I text her something, send her memes, or ask her a question, 90% of the time it just gets ignored, or she doesn't respond. Every week feels like a battle just to get through to her. Some people might already see that as a very bad sign, but she's always been like this for as long as I have known her, and its even harder for other people to get through to her. I am lucky that I can at least get her on the phone sometimes, but I have to make sure I plan things or else I swear I would never see her. 

Her lack of communication fucking kills me. When I am talking to her or we are doing stuff together, its amazing, its a connection I have never had before. But as soon as we are off the phone, or leave after being together, I'm just stuck in this awkward limbo where I don't know when the next time I will be able to talk to her will be. Will it be a few days? A week? 2 weeks? Hell if I know! It just makes me feel like I am not important in her life because I am not even worth texting just to answer a question. If I call her and she's busy, there is no response. I would feel a lot better if she just sent literally anything back. I don't spam call her, literally only call once every couple of days. She is a busy person, but I just don't get how anyone can be so busy that they can't afford literally 30 seconds to just acknowledge someone else's existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a clingy guy and I am pretty shit at communication but this takes the cake. It makes me feel fucking awful. Like if I call you and you are busy, it really shouldn't be hard to just say ""Sorry, I can't answer right now."" right? Like that is bare minimum. The biggest pain is that sometimes  I think that if I just stopped texting  her, stopped reaching out, I feel like I would literally never hear from her again.

We have been together 11 years (married for 8 of those years) and have a reasonably healthy and happy relationship that we don't want to screw up lol.

The job I am in the running for is in a different department, and reporting to a different supervisor, but he did mention that his work sometimes overlaps with the work of the person who was in this position previously (i.e., they back each other up on phones since there's no receptionist, or they set up for meetings and events together). Our workspaces would be far enough apart that we'd have to walk to each other's desk in order to see each other.

My husband and I have talked extensively about this and don't really foresee any issues. He had brought up the idea of me searching for a position at his company about a year ago, because he feels really well taken care of. When I saw this position, I asked him what his thoughts were on me applying. He gave me the green light and even asked the person in this position before me how she enjoyed it and gave me her feedback. Before I accepted each interview, my husband and I set aside time to talk about it and see if it still felt right, and each time neither of us had reservations.

We might just be making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be, lol, but we'd hate to get into this situation and have it negatively impact our relationship, our careers, or both. So far all the cons we can think of are:

- If the company goes under, were both unemployed at the same time (but that's unlikely, and we could apply for unemployment, and neither of us have been unemployed for longer than a couple of weeks at a time)

- Getting sick of each other since we'd carpool, be in the same office for 40 hours a week, and spend whatever time together at home (but we agreed to set healthy boundaries, i.e., we probably wouldn't schedule lunch breaks together, we have our own hobbies/alone time outside of work, and if this part really gets to us, we'd talk through it together, escalate it to a couples counselor if necessary, or I'd find a new job as a last resort)

- I personally worry about how I am much more uptight and professional in a workplace, versus my husband who can let his personality and sense of humor shine through in a workplace more easily. He is more of a social butterfly and I am more of a performer/perfectionist. I might feel funny if I don't fit in as well as he does and he witnesses that failure. But also I am more sociable when I'm with him, and also if we would rarely interact then how big of a deal is this really?

There are more pros than cons, like having the same holidays off, better pay and benefits for me, being able to carpool and save on a second vehicle, more PTO for me so we can plan vacations together (since we're in different departments, we don't think it would be any more difficult to get the same days off as it would in our current roles), and possibly eventually even moving closer to the work location to cut down on commute time without having to factor in another workplace commute.

Is there anything we should be considering as a possible red flag of working together?

I typed out a post about this and it was way too long so going to try to keep it shorter. 

So me (27f) and my husband (26) have been together for 7 years and married for 4. We have had a lot of ups and downs that started at the beginning of our marriage when I found out about something he did that was a major breach of trust, and shattered my self confidence as well as everything I thought I knew to be true about him and our relationship. (He didn’t cheat physically/emotionally, it was a weird thing that’s too much to explain but it was deeply hurtful - especially because we had only just gotten married.) unfortunately, in hindsight, what happened is something we could have definitely gotten through if he had handled it better, gone to counseling, etc. Instead of drinking all the time and letting everything fester. 
Anyway though, that event kicked off multiple years of me not trusting him whatsoever, questioning him all the time about what he was doing etc, and yeah just overall things were not good between us. 
All of this combined resulted in him starting to text this girl he worked with. (I found out from snooping, yes) I found out and was devastated and felt so set back. I made it clear I wasn’t okay with it obviously and that it hurt me, but he continued doing this when he would get drunk. This went on for a little while with me finding out, getting upset and asking him why he kept doing it, does he like her/want to be with her, etc. - and him telling me no to all of it and saying that it was because he was upset with our relationship, unhappy with how things had been, and hurt himself, and so that’s how he would lash out when drunk. These things made sense to me though still very hurtful, I felt like I pushed him to it. 
That was last year, which at the end of, we moved and got new jobs. Things didn’t get better between us as I still had no trust in him, and I felt like there were more things he didn’t tell me about regarding that situation. 
Recently though I found out about a girl he worked with that he basically was hiding from me. Having lunch with her everyday getting to know her, etc. He admits that he was attracted to her and that talking to her “made him feel good”, but has explained that (again, sort of) this only happened because he felt unloved/unappreciated by me. (Which makes me feel bad and again like I pushed him to it, which I never meant to and it hurts me to realize I may have hurt him, but have to admit I wasn’t treating him that nicely) 
Basically though - I asked him what happened/why they stopped with these “hangouts” and he told me that they just kind of stopped meeting up, for no real reason. Something is telling me though that might not be true, and I’m wondering if something happened to make them feel like they should stop? 
(By the way, he apparently told her that he had a “girlfriend”, not a wife, and she apparently had a bf) 
I’m debating on messaging her on insta (know it bc he was looking her up) and basically being like “hey remember __? I’m his wife and I was wondering if you could tell me if there was anything going on between you two?” Maybe not with those words but yeah. I’m hesitant because a) if everything he has told me is the truth, I would feel dumb and might look weird to her b) don’t think I’d want him to find out and c) I guess I’m afraid that there IS more and it’ll be bad (if she tells). 
So any advice?

Unfortunately some of it only comes up when getting into a relationship, like seeing what your triggers are. He’s aware of this. I also have Bipolar and he’s aware as well, I am medicated and have it under control. So the last few weeks I have been on edge, a ball of anxiety and fearful to talk about what’s going on. I recently asked and he said “idc about labels and I don’t wanna see anyone else but we’re just casually dating”. I said “yeah if we only see each other and no desire to see anyone else we’re in a relationship.” he just went with it, he said he doesn’t care and if it makes me feel comfortable then he’s fine with it.

i’m not comfortable. i’m so uncomfortable it makes me physically sick. i care about him a lot, and when we’re together it’s great. he never asks me to hangout. i only see him 1 time a week, maybe 2. he said because he’s busy we can’t call each other bf/gf, which makes no sense. i can’t handle the anxiety/fear that comes with the uncertainty and i’m not sure how to approach that conversation. nor do i want him to feel like he HAS to give me more time. or even HAVE to date me.

I posted in this group about 2 weeks ago explaining the situation between my Italian boyfriend and myself. We’re both gay, been together for 3 years, he’s 41 and I’m 34. I’m from the UK and he’s from Italy and we both live in Italy, in his flat with my dog. Anyway, I’m in the UK visiting my family and today he calls crying saying he wants to break up.

I can’t even think about finding a place to live, getting my dog, and collecting my stuff. I loved him so much, but he said that something was missing for him on the physical side of things. It is true that we were only having sex every 10 days ish, but I really love him and he says he loves me, but just feels like something is missing. He also said part of his stress at work was down to not knowing how to leave me. My question is what the hell do I do? I’m distraught and just want to make things right. I feel lonely, depressed and cut off from everything I love, 3000 miles from what was my life with by boyfriend and dog I’ve had for 10 years, sat in a room at my parents crying (which I know sounds pathetic).

My (28m) husband and I (29f) have been married for almost 2 years. That man is my absolute best friend and everything that I've ever dreamed of in a partner. Last week, something in my gut told me to look through his phone and I found exactly what I was hoping I wouldn't. A 'calculator app' with a password that I figured out, and it had 7 nudes of a girl that he used to work with in it. That was like a dagger to the heart. I immediately questioned him, and he told me that she sent him those months ago when they were still working together. First lie. I checked the time stamp on the photos and they had been sent within the last week or so. After asking him what had been going on, his side of the story is that it started as friendly texting, it turned flirty, then she sent him those photos and he blocked her. Of course I didn't buy it, so I called the girl to get her side. She had a similar story, except added that they had kissed a few times. That was the second dagger. After learning this new bit, I told him that I had spoken to her and if there were any details he left out, he needed to tell me now. He said he had nothing more to add. So, I asked him if it was true that they had kissed and he nodded his head yes. Third dagger. 

I have been an anxious wreck since I found all of this out. I went 2 days without eating or sleeping, a few panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing. We've finally gotten to a place where we can talk about it amicably, but I just don't see very much remorse on his end, or at least as much as I'd like to see.

I (28M) am in a relation with a girl (25F) and it's been more that 6 months now. She's foreigner and we met while she went working in my country, but she needed to leave 2 months ago and we succeded in meeting each other twice during this time despite the long distance (2 hours of flight + 1 to 3 hours of other transports). I can state at this point that she's very into me, she misses me a lot, but I cannot tell I feel the same for her... And I don't know exactly why... This is not how it was supposed to work. 

It all started because (I just tell from my point of view, but of course relationships start from two people) I was single and this girl showed up in my life and just could not miss her: she's a good-looking woman, like nothing that drives me crazy or something but she's pretty. I think she's also very sweet and smart. Thing is I didn't think about the consequences, and did not expect her to take it so seriously from the very beginning, to the point she's far ""ahead"" compared to me. I'm not able to give back the same level of affection she gives to me, I started acting cold. It's strange: years ago I thought about this as the perfect life, like being in a serious relationship full of love, cuddles and everything, ready to share the life together... Now that it's happening I'm somehow scared.

On the other hand though, Im scared of losing her. She really seems to love me for who I am (but probably she doesn't know the ""whole"" me yet... Idk) And I spend a really good time with her so far... But fact is, I can carry on my life even without her close to me... and I feel I miss her only in few sporadic moments. Distance has shown me this clearly. I have to say I'm very inexperienced with relatioships: she's the first seriuos one but the my whole life I had issues approaching women. I have self-esteem issues and suffered a lot because I felt women did not want me. I've always had this feeling that every girl who is slightly attractive is just out of my league, but also hoped that Im going to find the right one one day. So basically if I leave her, Im afraid that at age of 28 Im not going to find any other woman... I'm afrad being alone at some point of my life. However, after being single basically my whole life, I somehow learned to feel great alone, by myself. I like the freedom, I like checking out other women, I like staying with my friends and spending time with my hobbies. I'm also scared out by the idea of having children (for sure my gf would be much more ready for) because I became skeptical about the whole idea of the family... Im afraid of putting in this world creatures that will suffer and I would feel responsible for them suffering... But again, Im afraid of ending up alone... And along with that, I don't want to hurt her feelings, she doesn't deserve that. I don't wat to break her heart.

Now, she makes a lot of pressure on me cause she wants me to find a job in her country (also because I know the launguage and have some relatives living there) she keeps saying she wants me so badly... But all of that is stressing as hell. Idk I did not imagine this being so difficult. I don't know if Im just lazy or if these are all signals she's not the right person for me. Im not going to tell further details so basically Im stucked in this situation where I don't know what to do. Please I need suggestions.

I’ve only been on a date once before. And that was 4 years ago.

I started university in September to study a Master’s degree. I met my friend in the first week, and we’ve got super close after the past couple of months. Pretty early on it was quite clear that we both liked each other a bit more than friends - over time we’ve been spending more and more time together, we work together on all of our assignments, and we regularly just spend evenings watching tv together and kind of cuddling, sometimes holding hands.

There’s this stereotype about lesbians that they can make it clear as day that they like each other and still second guess themselves, and unfortunately in this case it’s been very true. Both of us are very awkward and have been completely refusing to acknowledge the fact that we’re into each other. The topic only came up because one of our friends was under the impression that we were dating, and when we realised this we laughed about it together, and then eventually very awkwardly kind of mutually asked each other out.

This was yesterday. We’ve agreed to go on a date in a couple of days. But now, apart from occasionally referencing the fact that we’re “dating” now, we’re still doing the awkward thing where we don’t know how to act. And I’m very anxious. I don’t know how to go on this date and make it feel like a DATE, and not just the two of us hanging out together like we always do. We haven’t kissed or anything since agreeing to the date. Whenever we talk about it we get really awkward and giggly and don’t know what to say. I’m not sure how to get past this - I’m so scared I’m going to ruin it before it’s even started. How do we go from friends to dating???

But now that we aren’t together and we haven’t talked in days I feel such an overwhelming sense of regret and grief. I knew that my new life would come at the cost of my old one but I feel like it didn’t fully hit me until after I made the decision. 

I know that I had been thinking about this for the better part of a year so I didn’t rush into it, and there were multiple factors that went into it, but did I make a mistake? Or is this just post breakup grief? How long do I need to feel this way before I know that it means I f*cked up?

One day i saw this girl working out beside me, and she was kinda cute, I complimented her tattoo, and 2-3 days after we had a casual conversation. She asked me what do i do and where i am from... stuff like that. After 2 more interactions, I suggested that since I'm new to the area we should hangout. She said yea, I'll give you my Instagram. We added each other on Instagram same day, on the same day she posted a story of her doing squats that she can't lift more than 50 pounds weight on a bar doping squats because of her knee condition, i commented on the story. Props to you for lifting 50 lbs even after her condition and gave a thumbs up.

Not even to have sex we didn’t end up having sex until 1 month in but I really enjoyed every minute I spent with him.

He would text me every day, double texting me when I was too busy to reply and I actually liked it things like this would usually give me the ick but I could feel myself falling for this guy. He even made us more official after sex and asked if we could just see eachother now and no one else which I agreed

Anyway the last month I have had a lot of personal things going on etc family and work meaning I didn’t have much time to see him as I was travelling with my job I was that busy I didn’t realise in the last 3 weeks he had tried to make 12 different plans with me and I let him down on every one but he still remained so cool about it as though it was not a problem as long as I am happy.

 Anyway I came home from work a couple of days ago and he asked to make plans together so I agreed then he randomly cancelled and re arrange for the next day which was not like him then the next day he cancelled again so I did drop a text about being annoyed that he let me down without even telling me the second day he longer had time he just avoided letting me know and I was sat at home ready. 

Next day he replied ending things saying he isn’t that invested in me and I deserve more! So I called him as this was out of the blue it was only 2 days before this he was last telling me he cannot wait to see me and sending me good morning messages I genuinely thought he had fell for me and so did everyone around? 

So I called him and he explained how he was longer wanting to date me, he couldn’t understand why I like him and what I see in him, he didn’t see things progressing and also that casual sex is not for him because it is not fair as it always leads to getting feelings (even though we was no longer being casual we was actually dating). He also said I was making things become too serious?? Even though he was the one making all the plans to see me and talk about our future not me? I still wanted to keep things private as that’s how I am but he dropped hints about me posting pictures of us together and he even told all his friends and family about me. He even tried to plan holidays for us and events a year down the line to me that’s someone who is thinking long term. 

Anyway what I want to know is why would a guy who was so into me making countless plans to see me randomlly drop me? I have called him to meet over coffee to talk and he keeps declining my invite? He has not met anyone else yet he just said he doesn’t want to see me as there is no point? This feels unfair as even though it was only a few months there are feelings got involved, I really want to see him and I don’t know how to convince him. 

What do you guys make of this? I really liked him and don’t know what to do.

He is pretty bad about being emotionally supportive and validating my feelings. I’ve talked to him about this in the past and he said he didn’t realize he was invalidating my feelings and he would try not to do that anymore. 

I’ve gone through bad periods of depression and he straight up emotionally checked out and was not there for me. 

Since I was 18 I’ve really wanted to go to Iceland and I’ve saved up enough money to go, but when we started dating we agreed to go to Iceland together. He hasn’t saved any money towards that goal and I feel like if I wait on him I’m never going to get to go. Going alone just feels wrong because we’ve talked so much about going together and I think it would really hurt him if I went by myself.

I feel like we’re more roommates than we are partners. If I told him this he would be really upset so I haven’t brought it up. I’ve said something similar in the past about how we don’t go out and do anything anymore and he just says spending time together watching TV should be enough for me because it’s enough for him. We can’t go out to the movies or to dinner unless I pay for everything because he isn’t currently working due to an injury. I’m tired of not going on dates and just sitting around watching TV. 

I go back and forth between feeling really negative about our relationship and then the next day I’ll think I was crazy for thinking about breaking up with him. I’m afraid to tell him how I’ve been feeling because I’m anticipating that his reaction is not going to be good, I think he will say I’m being unfair with being unhappy in this situation because he can’t control that he’s hurt right now and unable to work. He’s a great person, I love him a lot. We laugh a lot together, we’ve taken a class together to learn how to be better partners to each other, and he knows me pretty well.

We’re studying together and have known each other for almost 5 years now. Almost 3 years ago I was in a relationship with someone else before I started seeing my current partner, and we were on good terms for more than a year after we broke up, like we were friendly and would hang out (platonically) and he was in a relationship too. 
I haven’t seen him in a long time and we kind of lost contact, which is completely natural and okay with me. But I recently saw him for the first time in a while since we have some events in common. Before he would have a conversation with me or at least say hi, but now he doesn’t do that anymore and I was confused to why he would act that way. My current boyfriend has asked me about it and I told him my ex has been weird lately, but didn’t think of it too much and didn’t say anything else to my current boyfriend. 
Yesterday we had another event we were both attending, and I was talking to a close friend of mine who is also still friends with my ex, and he would still not acknowledge my presence or say anything, which started to bother me. 
The next morning I told my boyfriend that “it kind of bothers me that he doesn’t acknowledge my presence” and continued explaining that it worries me because I know people in his circle don’t like me and I’m worried they are spreading rumors or something like that (I have no evidence of anything like that, just something that worried me).
My partner got upset over me telling him, has mood swings all day (meaning he was acting normal, then got angry again, then acted all normal again, until finally he was dropping me off somewhere and heading home and his said I should break up with him before I say something like that. 
When I got home most of his things were packed and he left without saying where he was going, just said “good luck in life and have fun with *ex’s name*” 

I want to feel like I can share my thoughts with my partner, and kept trying to clarify to him that this wasn’t because I miss my ex and I’m not looking to reconnect with him, it just felt weird and uncomfortable to be in that situation, especially when I don’t know if I did anything wrong.

hi to both of them. I tried to make plans with

the very beginning because she felt I chose
him over her. Our relationship has only
deteriorated since.


His sister, however, loved his ex gf (25) and
the two of them were really close. My bf and
his ex broke up last fall. They were together for 3 years. His ex hit him up and asked to get drinks with him and his sister because she is in town. 


He made the plans with his ex and they used a group chat for the 3 of them to communicate - I was not informed of any of this.

him seeing his ex with his sister (which I
said on numerous occasions has made me

defense is that he had to try to make the
plans for them to be possible for today.

Something about me. I have always been a very self-conscious guy, werent happy with my looks and thought i was not worthy of beautiful women. So for my whole life i have been seeking for attention or glances of beautiful woman, since that would make me feel better about myself. I have always liked  spending time with myself and doing what i like, without people bothering me much. I have always kept my friendgroup small, because i like to have friends with whom i share strong bonds. I am also very bad at making decisions and it had a role in my situation.

About relationship. We have met in highschool and have been dating for 4 years. She is my first real girlfriend and the first person i have been intimate with. The honeymoon phase lasted about 8-9 months than some problems started to arise. I started to see flaws that made me irritable, for example i didnt like her singing, she is quite clumsy and she is quite clingy (which i am not used to, since i have spent most of my time alone).  That is the first time I started to doubt about the relationship. It was about 10 to 11 months into the relationship, when we talked about my issue. We were both very emotional about it and on the verge of breaking up. But we did not want to make that decision. I think one of the reasons was that i was scared of being alone again (which is opposite of what i said earlier, now that i think about it). I became comfortable with her and could not stand the thought of erasing her from my life. What we did is just ""wait"", we let some time pass and the doubts slowly faded. In the mean time we made a lot of good memories. But they re-appeared after 3 months and i got the same anxiety again. And we did the same again, let the time solve the problem and it did... for about 5-6months. Worth mentioning is that i had some doubts even in good periods, but they did not make me anxious. These bad periods than repeated every 6 months and now i am here, in doubts and thinking about  breaking up. 

All of this episodes were about the same problem. I was skeptical about my future with her (in good periods i could see it). I started to look at other attractive people and trying to get their attention. With that came me imagining being with these women and sleeping with them. That imagination then sparked doubt in my relationship and made me anxious. I then started to think about it a lot and it intervened with my everyday life. In this times I always communicated my thoughts to her and i know i am hurting her, but she accepts it and we try tobfind a solution which never comes. 

Maybe the problem could be that this is my first relationship and am not sure what else is out there. Different people, characters, bodies etc.  I might want to have more sexual experience with other women.This wonder gives me a lot of trouble and is currently my main problem. Should i stay and wonder what could have happened if i left, or leave and risk losing a loyal, loving person. I am a person who always tries to use logic and calculated decisions, but this is a problem that doesnt have a right or wrong answer.

I started studying this year and have been in contact with many new people, many girls aswell. Some were interested in me and were flirty, which made me feel good and bad at the same time, since i am in a relationship. When i told them im not single, they quickly lost interest. In this new environment full of new people it is hard for me not to be interested in them and to not wonder what would have happened if i were single.  I am trying to find a strategy to just befriend girls and not falling for them. I have always felt for girls very quickly which also plays  a big role here. 

If I look at times when things were ok, i cant see many red flags in my partner and had enjoyed my time with her, which can only mean it is a problem with me. I am probably gonna meet a lot of new people in the course of my life and if i cant find a solution to my problem, this will be a problem that probably never ends.
My partner is very commited to us and mentions us living together a lot of the times.  On downs that triggers anxiety in me, on good days it makes me happy and can totally see it. So there is my fear of commitment, when not knowing whats out there.

We do not fight much. We try to solve most of our disagreements by talking about it, using arguments, making compromises, which i really like.

What i have also noticed is that i have been putting less effort in our relationship.. i basically got comfortable. I dont give as many gifts anymore or dont surprise her as often as in the beginning of the relationship. The initial spark is obviously gone, but i love the person and really care for her. 

Should i seek therapy? And try to work on my issues first before making this decision? Idk. 

I just know that this never ending cycle wont be any good for me, aswell as for my partner in a long run.

Thanks for reading and would love to see and read your thoughts, your experiences and what is ur birds eye view on my situation.

I've been in a long distance relationship for 4 years now. He's a great guy, funny, smart, hard worker, very realiable and trust worthy, I love him of a deep unconditional love, he knows everyone of my secrets and he is not only my boyfriend but my best friend too. 

Now. Last year I went to visit a friend of mine that I don't see very often, and while I was there he had another visit from one of his best friends. I had fun talking and joking with both of them for the afternoon, but with the guy I just met I had a weird chemistry, like he could read my mind and understand all my thoughts in a way that never happened with anyone before. On the spot I developed a crush for him but I also convinced myself that he was just a very attractive guy, that knew how to talk to people and that probably could establish that sort of connection with everyone and make every women fall in love.  

Also, I was not alarmed for my relationship since in many years of being together I've come to the conclusion that it's normal to like other people sometimes (especially being long distance) but I would never cheat on my boyfriend nor anyone could replace him, so I convinced myself that I was just fascinated by the guy because he was a very interesting person that I would have love to get to know.  

The problem is: yesterday I met again that friend of mine after a long time, and casually he told me that after that afternoon together his friend developed a crush on me too, but never made a move since I have a boyfriend. In the moment he was saying this, I felt like melting, my heart started beating like crazy and my brain stopped working properly, knowing that he felt that connection too. I quickly changed subject and didn't tell anyone a word about it but now I honestly can't stop thinking about him with butterflies in my stomach. I feel so ashamed towards my boyfriend, but again I love and care so much for what we've build in all these years together, and for what our life will be as soon as we'll have the chance to see each other everyday.

I feel I am in a bit of a predicament. My girlfriend (32F) and I (31M) are traveling for the first time together to the Bahamas this December. This is a sales contest trip with my company and we've known we are going for about 6 months now. We have spent a lot of this time getting ready for it, getting in shape, etc. however, It has been difficult getting my girlfriend excited for this trip.

She has been expressing a lot of concerns the entire time leading up to this trip and I feel pretty exhausted by it. There have few a few times when she's gotten anxious or overwhelmed at the idea and has taken it out on me verbally. I told her that I don't appreciate it and we talked about it, but it seems her anxiousness about it isn't going away.  


I feel like I have done a lot to even get her a little excited for the trip but truthfully,  I am so exhausted by it now. I am now starting to feel concerns about her well-being on this trip and whether or not she will be taking out some of her anxiety on me like I have experienced in the past. The other day she sent me a text message while shopping saying ""I can't go. I don't want to go"".

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is how can I help her further? Do you think it's fair for me to say to her if she doesn't feel comfortable going then she doesn't have to? I feel very stuck.

Then  after that, I had been going to his once a week for a month. We  cuddled, kissed, cooked together, and watched movies. At the end of  September he started to be distant he stopped kissing and hugging me.  And then a few days later he texted me saying he didn't want to date  even though he thought he did and that he didn't have time for anything.  And that he knew it wasn't fair to me and that he was sorry. I got  upset with him and went off I asked him if he was interested in someone  else. And if he was having sex with someone else. But then I apologized  to him he said it was fine that things happen. And that he hasn't had  sex with anyone else. He asked me to come over again after all that. So I  saw him again at the beginning of this month. And then again last week  he was kissing and hugging me and he asked me to take a shower with him.  Yes, I know him kissing and hugging me doesn't automatically mean he  wants to be in a relationship. I just think it's odd he'd do that when  initially he had stopped being physically affectionate. We haven't  talked about boundaries at all. I feel like if I say something about him  kissing and hugging me. He'll think I don't want him to do it. And he  said he likes to kiss because it's sensual.

I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay when I started crying. I panicked about being left with the whole bill. I also was honestly extremely insulted because I had invested a lot getting ready to impress him and was excited to see this guy, and this felt like a massive smack in the face.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

**TLDR:** Guy bullied me into paying and I was really really shocked and unsure how to handle it. How do I avoid this happening again? my mom said it would have been rude to ask upfront if he was paying and i wasted my time and feel terrible and traumatized. I also feel as thought I was unintelligent, thoughts?

Update: He texted me a week after this ordeal, says he was really excited to get to know me, he ""doesn't see not paying as undervaluing me at all"", he wishes we could have kissed, and really wants to meet again. In this case, should I ask him to send me the cash back or just ignore him?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7624467,public,self,Was I Bullied Or Was It All In My Head?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2zm59/was_i_bullied_or_was_it_all_in_my_head/,all_ads,6,

When we first came our parents spent alot of money to make it happen. We were above average in our home country financially. But due to the insane costs from international student fees and everything else we had to live very frugally.

I remember when we first came it was me, my sister and 4 other girls living in a 1 room studio. We went through so much and it felt like it was me and my sister against the whole world. It was a very dark part of our lives.

During my studies why were able to find a part time job with a large company but we were in different buildings. Eventually I meet my now husband at this company.

I suppose we both started off at the bottom, but his bottom was different to mine. And even though we worked together our jobs were different and he had alot more responsibilities.

There were alot of late night shifts that we had to do together and eventually we started to develop feelings for each other and thing just developed naturally. He is 2 years older than me but he is so responsible and smart. He even put in a good word for me to get me a promotion which got me the title and made me go over the threshold to get residency.

My sister also meet her now husband and we both headed to brighter days.

3 years ago sister's husband developed a very rare disease. There is no cure but there is a medicine that can prolong life and there is an experimental stem cell surgery.

My sister and her husband are ""normal"" people they don't waste money and live responsibly. Not long after the diagnosis was confirmed they decided to do the stem cell surgery which was high 5 figures. There was no government subsidy and they had to fly overseas to do it. This effectively drained all their savings. 

A year after this it was clear his condition was getting worse and worse. They don't know if the surgery slowed the disease but it was definitely getting worse to the point he had to cut back hours at work.

This was also around the time covid started. Both my sister and I got laid off. My sister almost immediately found a job at a supermarket. I tried to find similar work but was unsuccessful.

At this time my husband have climbed extremely high in his profession. He changed company once during his entire career. He was an ""essential"" worker and his line of work was as stable as it gets in the covid environment. 

To add abit of context. Not long after me and my sister started working full time we both pretty much sent every extra cent we had back home to our parents. Their business was really struggling and they spent all their savings to get us here so it was only right.

I continued to send money back home after marriage. My husband was OK with this. We had a very mature conversation early in the relationship. He was comfortable for me to all the money earned to my parents. He did say he didn't want to contribute to this which though was awkward to hear the first time I completely understand and think is more than fair.

I haven't worked since I got laid off due to covid. There really wasn't a need. My husband earns more in a day then what I would earn in a week. My parents back at home closed their business and are getting retirement fee. It's nothing amazing but they are living comfortably. 

A month ago my sister called me crying that she really need a hundred dollars to feed her baby = they have a 3 year old. We meet up. Turns out her husband was laid off 6 months ago. Now we do keep in contact regularly. But ever since covid we haven't been doing too many meet ups. It's usually just the phone call here and there. His company didn't want to make him redundant in the condition he was in because they knew he was struggling. But had no choice because that entire division was being laid off. Sister was working double shifts every other day for the past several months now. 

She said not long after the surgery it was clear the clinical markers were showing the disease was worsening so they started to pay for the medication which costed them about 2K a month. She knew it wasn't sustainable but she also didn't see any other choice. I completely understand and would have done the same. about 5 months ago they had no choice but to stop the medicine as they were literally having to piece money together for rent. 

She tells me her credit card is maxed and need a hundred to buy food until she get paid next week. I quickly transferred her $1000. You wouldn't believe the relief on her face. She looked like a completely different person. She had these dark circles and looked like someone just spend 10 years in hell and just got back. I told her if there's anything else I can do she can contact me anytime.

My husband found out and we had a huge fight. To put things in context my husband also started out poor. Not so much like me as he came to this country with his parents when he was just a child. I remember he told me stories like how he and his dad would walk 2 hours just to avoid having to pay $2 for public transport. So he lives frugally as well. Yes he ""made it"" and we are living very comfortably now but I guess what I'm trying to say is we both experienced hardship and neither of us will forget it.

I also want to say my husband is never tight on money with me. And I never felt it either. I've always got whatever I wanted (though I am very responsible with money due to my past). 

My husband always checks the bank accounts and yea he some times asks me what this and that expense were for and regardless of what I say he never fussed. He just want to make sure there aren't any fraudulent charges.

Anyway my husband was not happy I gave 1K to my sister. Now there are never any conflict between my husband and my sister. They are not that close though I think that's to do with my husband being an introvert but they've always got alone. 

Long story short. My husband pretty much laid it out as in we had an agreement where I can do whatever I want with my money but I can't give money that he earned to my family. I was so upset. We don't have separate finances. I mean I don't have an income currently. 

After the fight I thought about it and as disappointed as I am I do see his side. All these years I mean I did contribute when I was working but I did send alot of money back to my parents which I would do again everytime. Meanwhile before we married his parents bought him the house we live in now. and over the years he realistically paid for &gt;95% of all our expenses. I worked hard and so did he. I feel I can't really blame him for feeling the way he does. Even with his current salary when we go to the supermarket he still keep a sharp eye on things on special and avoid out of season stuff.

We pretty much put this behind us and I agreed I won't do it again. 

So I tried looking for a job any job. A few months ago I found out I was pregnant - yay. I'm a fairly tall and slim girl. So even though I'm still not ""big"" it definitely looks out of proportion. I've had 2 interviews and in both of them they asked if I was expecting. After I've said I am they say ""congratulations with a really big smile and I kinda know that's that.

Yesterday my sister phoned me again asking if I can lend her some more money. They do get government benefit to help with BIL's ""disability"" but turns out there were so bad in debt they completely miscalculated the interest. We had a long talk. Seems if they had 17K to pay of their debt they can ""normalize"" as their weekly income wouldn't be chewed up by loan interest.

I'm sooooo tempted to just transfer the 17k to her and make them ""whole"" again. But I also promised my husband I wouldn't give them any more money. So here we are reddit. How can I convince my husband he help my sister and her family.

Now I've been on reddit alot and really don't need unhelpful rudeness.

We are in a happy and stable relationship and he is the sweetest and most loving guy I have ever met. We have also been living in for the past one year. Now this is where my problem begins. Both of us are working but our shift timings are totally different. Mine is 8-6 in the morning while he works from 1-11pm. On most of the weekdays we don't even get much interaction time apart from lunch or during small breaks after work. I try to find new ways to spend time with him but recently I hardly get to spend any time with him throughout the week. We have two separate bedrooms as well and most of the days he is just working in his room while I am working in mine. Initially we would go to bed together but somehow sleeping together doesn't happen anymore. Usually after work I want to spend the remaining time with him, but by the time he gets free it's time for me to go to bed. Also, he has always been used to sleeping alone since childhood but I am sorry for the totally opposite person in that regard. I really find comfort and peace in sleeping next to my partner. However most of the days I don't find him taking any initiative in that regard. After work he is usually hooked on to his phone or laptop and honestly it has started to get a little disappointing. I understand that he also needs some personal space and much needed me-time, especially after a hectic day and so I don't want to impose myself on him, but recently I have been feeling more and more lonely and sad. I have tried telling him multiple times that since we don't get a lot of time together, at least we could try sleeping together and he has agreed to sleep with me as well, but that too rarely happens, mostly only on weekends. At this point I am just annoyed and mostly sad. I never imagined before living-in that I would have to urge my partner to sleep with me every single day and thought this was something to happen naturally. So this has left me quite saddened and disconnected recently and i don't know what to do.

Last Wednesday, after my girlfriend went to therapy, she told me that she was done and we weren’t compatible. I was shocked but understood somewhat. As things unfolded and she started to move out, I learned details ( Can and will give anyone more context if they have clarifying questions). She says she hasn’t been happy since last September. The only thing that I can think of were we agreed to sign a lease for another 6 months. Since then, we’ve tried to figure things out, work on ourselves and each other and figure life out, together.

We adopted two kittens, move into our apartment (a first for both of us), and she was re-kindling her relationship with family (that’s always been an issue for her). She’s always spent time away from them, and always told me and her repeatedly how much they want her around. 

As we got to the last couple months of our lease, things felt different. She started talking about how things weren’t matching up, how she wants to get out of the US, how she only wants to be in tropical climates. I told her that if she wanted to do that, and still have me in the picture, we should hangout for a little, save up money and go. Why did I say this? Because we were both broke. We took a road trip for 2 1/2 months during COVID to Michigan where we moved. We went straight into an apartment after that. A 550 sq foot apartment for 1450. We needed to save money. 

Our plan was to move to Nevada for a couple months with my mom and dad (when we met, I was living with my parents.  Apparently, I’ve been dealing with compounded grief from significant losses in my life as a child. She knew this, she loved it). She loves my parents, and loved being with us. She still tells me she loves me, loves our cats and loves our time.

My(22F) bf(22M) and I have been together for almost 5 years. We have had a very healthy supportive relationship although we have had a few bumps along the way. As I'm sure all relationships have.



We both graduated University last may, before graduating he was offered a PhD with one of his professors. It suits him to a T, he's passionate about the subject and I'm delighted for him. I had to do a repeat which really took a toll on my self-image as, I suppose, I'm decently good academically and have never had anything similar to this happen before. It was hard for me to not let jealousy get in the way but I think I did an ok job in the end. He never brought it up and I owned up to it as best I could when I acted not in (out of?)  his best interests. 



Anyways, we have always lived down the road from eachother and subsequently would spend alot of our time and nights together. He decided to move into the city centre this year. We didn't discuss it much which was partially my fault. I found it hard to process as my mom has been sick and with my repeat, I felt like I couldn't get a handle on my own life without having to think about what he was doing aswell. He,.however, also failed to bring it up and I had to ask if he was going ahead with it to find out for myself approx 3 weeks before. I should add here, the grade I have now graduated with was dependant on this repeat, I had to do very well. It was alot of pressure to deal with. I also didn't apply for jobs, I'm not really sure what the reason was, I just felt frozen.




There is now more of a distance between us. I'm not entirely happy. I have no desire to move out, I like living at home and it's very normal where I'm from as we have a pretty severe housing crisis. Similar to Toronto or so I've heard. I'm working a temp job at the moment so I am busy. I don't really know how to move past this. I feel like our relationship has gone backwards which I had never imagined and I feel out of control. It's my relationship too but I don't have a say. How can I move past these feelings? Will I ever not feel resentment? Is there anything anyone has implemented in their own relationships that could help?

(Little story detail )
Im f21 and my husband is m22 we have been together for close to 7 years and have been married for three, and we have one child together who is 5. My husband has major angry issues and has social and anxiety in general and he is a very much an introvert and he was very babied but also judged my his family and has suffer with alot mental health issues 
I myself have been Diagnosed with multiple mental health issues and alot of them make me not a great partner (I have trouble depending on people and I never ask for help and I shut down and shut people out but also sometimes cry and get upset alot (I have been medicated and been getting help for almost a year now. 
I have talked to my therapist about this issues and I feel like this be my way out but I feel horrible for feeling this way but I don’t know if it’s just bad in my head and I’m in the wrong and I’m just a bad wife. 
So quick back story of what we had to go through the last two years and that’s when the issues started 
-my grandfather died suddenly in front of me and cause me ptsd and I shut down for a bit, I’m still healing from this 
We went through two miscarriages 
We found out I can’t carry children
I relapsed with my eating disorder badly 
His mom spilt with her long term partner 
His grandma got cancer (she beat it ) 
Our house we were renting sold unexpectedly and we had to move quickly 
And much more those are just the worse. 
The last two years I find whenever something stressful happens he blames me and gets mad and he tells me his anger isn’t directed at me but it feels it and when someone is screaming at you it feels directed, we constantly fight over everything, he doesn’t like that I lost so much weight (I went from 270 to 180) he says I don’t spend enough time with him,
I have to do everything and sometimes I find it hard to find the time and it’s not like we’re not having sex, whenever he ask I always do and I don’t mind, sex is not really a big emotional thing for me, I find it just something, so I know he needs it so I do it, he always says I do to much for people and he always mad That I’m on the go a lot (I volunteer for my daughter school, after school activities, dance, gymnastics and I also in a group for fundraiser for our community) i have always found with alot of things I struggle with it helps to say busy and I try to tell him I would
Love to do things with him but I just don’t like laying down in bed or on the couch or just watching tv all day or watching him play games and that’s all he wants and I will do sometimes but he wants it all the time and I just can’t because when I stop doing things they don’t get done. For the past year expecially he is always telling me really mean things for example (your a lot to deal with, you get really sad) (you dress like your single if I was anyone else I’d be forcing you to change) and then telling me if I loved him I’d change, (no one else is gonna wanna listen to you cry all the time)  and just little things like  that but then he goes and tells me he didn’t mean it and he was just hurt and he was upset, he picks fights just to fight, he’ll tell me I was mean or an asshole for leaving him to go talk to someone or say I didn’t clean this right or that right but then he tells I’m his everything and he lives for me, he tells me he worship me
But sometimes I feel like it’s unhealthy,
I was his only ever girl friend and the first person he has sex with, and before him I was around a lot and went through some really abusive relationship and that’s why I feel bad that’s I’m not happy because atleast he doesn’t beat me, I’m just unhappy and I don’t know if I love him anymore just all the things Over the years and all the little things just feel very built up and I’m drained and I don’t know if I love him anymore, I feel like there a million other things but I don’t want the post to long it just I want advice I don’t know I feel like I should just deal with it and find a way to love him again but I just feel depressed and unloved, how do you fall in love with your partner again or is admitting it isn’t working the right thing to do?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7624414,public,self,"I feel like I feel out of love with my husband and I want to fix it but I don’t know if I should, help please.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2zdzc/i_feel_like_i_feel_out_of_love_with_my_husband/,all_ads,6,

He asked me to be his girlfriend about a month ago, it means a lot to me that he initiated that conversation and wanted that from me. He’s kind, considerate, he accepts me for exactly who I am and accept him the same, we share many of the same values and beliefs about the world and life, and I love spending time with him doing mundane things. He’s responsible and really down to earth. He inspires me to be a better person. This was supposed to be a practice date, maybe some sex, but I *really* like him. I love who he is as a person, not just how he makes me feel and he does make me feel great! Every time I’ve had something come up with my health or when I’m feeling emotional about something he’s there for me. He consistently steps up for me. He comforts me and gives me reassurance that he accepts all parts of me. I’m very much not used to this. All I want is a healthy, loving, and supportive relationship and I feel like I have that with him. I’ve only had one relationship that felt healthy and a lot of neglectful or abusive relationships. 

I haven’t felt like this since I started dating my ex husband, my first love. I’ve said “I love you” to 2 people since him but I think it was more of a “I love that you are giving me attention” and not truly knowing, accepting, and embracing that person for who they really are. I want it to be real the next time I say it and I believe it is with him.

My GF (Isabel) of a few months just moved in with a long term friend of over 5 years (Dan). She was going through a divorce and told me that when he came to talk to her about it that he said that he ""would date her"". They were smoking and she claims it was more of a vote of confidence in her. 

That story was my first introduction to him as a person, so my perspective has always been a bit warped as I believed it was more than a positive statement. She told me that she wanted to move in with him, as she trusted him and needed to find a place to live quickly and wanted it to be with a friend. I voiced my concerns after hearing the story and didn't want to sabotage our new relationship.

She suggested I meet him and it made me feel worse. He was affectionate, a bit handsy in a dancing nature, and called her things like ""babe"", ""sweetie"", and ""my love"". I got bad vibes about him and he seemed over the top and like a liar/exaggerator.

I immediately talked to her about this and told her that he gave me weird vibes and she basically insisted that this was just his personality and he treated all women like that. It made me feel slightly better that on a separate occasion we went to eat with him and he was actually just as aggressive with other women, and I thought maybe this WAS just his personality. I accepted that as truth, but I told her that I was not super comfortable with them living together, all things considered, and that I really wish she would pick any other person. She listened to everything I had to say and basically told me she has no other options and he was a long term friend who she trusted. I had to just accept that and I didn't really push on this again.

Then they moved in. I immediately heard about how he wanted to plan cooking nights, start going to the gym with her, plan roomie nights, movies, and do everything together. It appeared to me that he was basically using her as an outlet for his couple-like desires that he desperately missed with his recent ex of 12 years. I learned that he invited her on a ""date"" to go eat, and while he did use those words, she was convinced that it was platonic. At this point she had made it very clear that he knew she and I are in a relationship. She insisted that he basically a ""gay"" best friend to her and that he was the best friend she had. She did not see any issues with his behavior at all. Thank god, the date never happened. 

The pet names continued, though.  I tried killing him with kindness and he was actually a fun guy to chat with (in small doses - he is A LOT).  In spending more and more time talking to him alone, I felt a little bit better, but he was wildly different around her.

I set my boundaries with her from the beginning about the pet names and the way he was treating her. I was not sure how to handle it, as it was me that felt weird about - she was fine with it, so I was basically asking her to enforce my own boundary.  She basically told me that if I wanted to change things, I should address it with him myself. I was mortified and did not want to make things awkward for her and I didn't know him well enough to do that. I thought it was really on her to make those boundaries clear, so I kinda let it sit, but it was slowly eating me up inside. I knew he was calling her that and acting inappropriately, but I was too scared to cause a rift and make her make it stop.

It was not about not trusting her, but more about feeling uncomfortable at the thought of his actions. They somewhat regularly smoke weed together, alone, and I wondered if he would make a move if her inhibitions were impaired. 

As a few months passed, I had stopped being so on edge about Dan, as he was now in a relationship and never home. One night, he asked me for a ride to a convenient store after Isabel passed out. He confided in me that his GF was his previous friend's ex GF and that he had known her for a while. He went on to say that he had not told his friend that they were dating yet. That his friend was scummy and that he really didn't deserve to know anyway. It was shockingly close to his relationship with Isabel. He went on to say that he had asked his GF on an innocent friend date and that the relationship blossomed from from there. I saw the exact actions that he attempted to do on Isabel performed on a different girl... and it worked. A few weeks later, I heard him encouraging our mutual friend to hook up with a girl who had a GF. He was also scared to bring his GF to their Halloween party because his friends who knew his GF and her ex would be there. He was clearly hiding it out of shame.

Since Dan has entered this relationship, he has shared almost everything about the relationship with Isabel. Including all the nitty gritty of their sex life and issues. I am unsure if his GF even knows about Isabel. 

If that wasn't enough... Isabel told me the backstory of how Dan broke up with his GF of 12 years a while back. He was emotionally cheating on her with another mutual friend of his friend group. He shared all of his couple issues with her, including sex stuff. She did the same behind her SO's back. The real bad part about this was that he was hiding his relationship with her from his previous GF. As a result of their talks, this mutual friend hated his previous GF and didn't invite her to her wedding. It was, again, eerily similar to what he was doing with Isabel. Isabel told me that she knew that he propositioned that old mutual friend/confidant for sex, as well. All this led to Dan's previous GF of12 years breaking up with him. 

After learning all of this, my view of him changed and I no longer believed that it was plausible that this was just his personality. Knowing all of this, I was convinced that Dan was scum. I did not really push her to set more boundaries with him since when they first moved in and it had died down. 

But after learning this new information about his character,, I changed my mind and I told her he needs to stop calling her ""my love"", ""babe"", and ""sweetie"".  We had a few long talks about it and how he was constantly breaking my boundaries. It seemed to go okay and the next week, while she was alone with him, she said she addressed it very non-aggressively and almost seemed to obfuscate what she was alluding to in bringing up the mutual friend who caused him to break up and how his actions come off as flirting, she did not directly tell him why she said he should be careful with the pet names. 

A few weeks pass and she shows me a text he sent about something unrelated and I see a ""my love"", so I called her out and told her that she needs to tell him to stop as it makes me feel insecure and takes away from what we have. I cannot call her a pet name without thinking of him. It takes away from our relationship. The next day, she says she gently told him to stop, so I asked what she said and she showed me a text to the effect of ""Gentle Nudge to stop calling me pet names LMAO"". This was in response to him calling her ""babe"".

I'm not going to lie, the LMAO really made me mad, as it showed she was not really serious about it and that she was not going to be firm about it. I told her that she needs to be more direct and actually stand up for my boundaries, because after their discussion, he used a pet name at least three times in as many days. After talking about this, she admitted that it stemmed from her people pleasing and her fear of losing a roommate and causing strife. She admitted that she would be more aggressive in telling him if her living conditions did not depend on their relationship being stable. 

I told her that him using those pet names (along with his other actions) were a huge sign of disrespect to me. I also said that her not effectively enforcing my boundary was a sign of disrespect to me. All of this led to her getting upset at me and telling me that my constant rehashing of this subject matter was making her question if I was controlling and manipulative. She said that I was making her feel ""less than"" for saying that she was not doing a good job of enforcing my boundaries. Since this last talk, she has promised that she will have a direct conversation with him. Here's hoping it works. 

This is where we are. I know I have made mistakes here, but she is honestly making me feel like I am crazy for acting the way that I did. That may very well be the case, but I need some honest feedback as to if her behavior is normal or out of line, if anything  can be done, if I really did fuck up by enforcing my boundaries here, and what to do moving forward.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7624400,public,self,My (M33) GF has trouble enforcing my boundaries with her (F31) roommate (35).
