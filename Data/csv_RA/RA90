My parents have been divorced since I was 2, mother was primary caretaker until I was 14 when I went to live with my dad. Not saying I was perfect because teenage girls are a nightmare, however my mother was…. unpredictable? You never knew what you were going to get with her. Either the nicest, funniest, most down to earth, chill person you’ve ever met or the absolute scariest and it flipped at the drop of a hat without warning. But when she’s good she’s soooo great. 

Also, I had (have?) a younger brother. He died of a fetanyl overdose in 2020 at the age of 20. Unless you’ve lost a child, there’s just no way to understand what a parent goes through when that happens. It wrecked my parents. They canceled on me on both Mother’s and Father’s Day and Christmas that first year. Which of course broke my heart because it made me feel like I wasn’t relevant. And I know they were hurting but they also have another child who is still living and who still loves them and wants to spend time with them. But I digress. 

So my parents and I were invited to one of my brothers childhood friend’s wedding in October. We probably would not have been invited to this wedding if my brother were still alive. So we all go. And at this point my parents are amicable enough that it’s not awkward to all hangout. It was bittersweet being there because I think all of us knew that we were there in my brother’s place. Ceremony commences, we all pile into the reception area, grab some booze and start mingling. I rarely drink. I had 4 glasses of wine. One of my brother’s friends had a 420 pen and I asked him if I could hit it. BAD IDEA. I immediately start having an anxiety attack and my husband walks me out to our car and calms me down. I pull myself together and we head back into the venue. Drinking, smoking, crying - my eyes are bloodshot AF. 

When we walk back in, my dad and his girlfriend are sitting at our table so we walk over and sit down. I asked where my mom was and dad told me she was dancing so I turned around to look at her (dance floor was directly behind me). We make eye contact, smile, I turn back around and say something along the lines of “she’s always down to dance” and we started on about something totally unrelated to my mother. The night went on, everything was gravy, we all said our goodbyes, my mom hugged and kissed me goodbye, and we left. 

The next morning, I wake up to a text message from my mother that says “I hope you enjoyed talking trash about me last night because it’s the last time I plan to be around you. I’ve tolerated being with you around your husband, your dad, and your brother’s friends all watching you and your hateful, hurtful eyes cutting this way and that because I know you were talking mean about me. I don’t like people who talk bad about others and Im tired of working my ass off to have a relationship with you when it’s not only not reciprocated but apparently unwanted. I love you but I’m done being abused by you.” 

And I’m just like, huh? Nobody was ever talking trash about her at any point in the night. Not once. So I reply: 

“I’m not so sure that saying that you are always down to dance is talking mean about you. That was all that was said. You have created some false narrative in your head thinking that all I ever do is try to run you in the dirt but in reality, nobody was talking shit about you. The only thing that anybody even said about you was that you liked to dance. And when I was looking at my husband I was telling him to go dance with you. And I didn’t “cut my eyes” at you mom I had 4 glasses of wine and then I hit Casey’s pen, I might have looked at you but I wasn’t cutting my eyes.” 

And then there’s a long thread of other texts where she realizes she doesn’t have a leg to stand on in her baseless argument so she tries to redirect the conversation by throwing my dad under the bus for every wrong thing he’s ever done in his life stomping him in the ground even though she “doesn’t like people who talk bad about others”

Honestly, I don’t know if I need advice or if I just needed to vent but that felt really good. Stupid bitch.

I (25M) have been talking to this women (30F) for the past few weeks and things have been interesting to say the least. We met on a dating site and everything seemed fairly normal, she’s beautiful, has a great personality and we really hit it off. She gave me her telegram (I know, it’s weird) and began talking a bit more serious on there.

After a week of talking our chats began to get more intimate, she’d talk about kinks, fantasies, turn ons and everything else. We exchange some pictures and we began to plan where to meet. Once those plans started to be discussed she mentions that she has a fiancé and he doesn’t know about what’s going on. She also mentions that she’s been selling her underwear and nudes to other guys as well. 

This was incredibly shocking for me, I had no idea what to say or how to respond to something like this. My first reaction was to gather screenshots of her profile, pictures, messages, etc. you name it, I have it. Anyways, I began searching for her on social media and came up with nothing and for a while I thought all hope was lost but then, I noticed she slipped up. She had her phone number on her profile, so I find everything, her full name, her fiancés name, work, address, everything. 

So now I’m sitting on a everything I need to let this man know what’s going on. I want to send him a message on FaceBook but I don’t really want to use my profile, I have no clue what to say or how to even come at this properly. I don’t want to be dragged into this.

We grew up together, she spent a lot of time staying over my house, and we were basically attached at the hip for years. We were the friends who everyone thought would be friends for life.

Essentially, for the past 2 years, my (ex) best friend ""Brittany"" (we're both 23F) was putting more and more distance between us. We went from talking every day throughout the day to no contact, whatsoever, for many months at a time. Any contact we had was initiated by me. The few times we did see each other, it was always brought up by me and she acted like she was doing me a favor just to spend time with me.

It started in March of 2020. We had always planned on celebrating my 21st birthday as our joint birthdays (we both live in the US so legal drinking age is a big birthday here), and I later found out from her that she planned to do a weekend trip with her college roommates during my birthday, so we wouldn't be seeing each other at all.

This had really hurt me at the time. She claimed that she just ""forgot"" it was my birthday, despite the fact we'd been friends since we were 7. She and I also went to different universities, and these were people she literally lived with, whereas we hardly got to see each other due to going to different schools. I had asked her if there was any other weekend she could possibly do given nothing was paid for or set in stone and it was still 2 months before my birthday, but she said she didn't want to ""bother"" her roommates.

Then Covid happened, she went on the trip anyway despite it being the height of the pandemic (and lockdown), and I spent my 21st alone at home. At the time I was also dealing with a chronic illness and no doctor could figure out what it was, so I was really struggling mentally and physically and was in pain every day. I couldn't work or go to my classes anymore. And Brittany was never there, never spoke to me about it, never asked me if I was okay. I had friends in different countries checking in to see if I was okay, but not my best friend who was now living in the same city as me.

Despite my illness, I ended up picking up a creative hobby to distract myself from the symptoms. I got very good at it and ended up making a career of it and became a minor celebrity in my field by the time I was 22. I met my fiancé (M32) through this hobby and finally had a very healthy and strong relationship after years of bad or subpar ones. And yeah, she never really cared. I was finally diagnosed and found out what I had was temporary (don't want to get into detail about it) and am now healthy.

She would hang out with me from time to time, but there was always an excuse. She was always super ""busy"". However, she would then post all over Insta and Snap photos of her with new girl friends, and they would all like and comment on each other's posts with nauseating crap like ""love you bestie!"" and stuff like that. The funny thing is, her ""new"" friends were all girls she used to bad mouth in the past to me, saying they were annoying, clingy, b\*tchy, etc.

When we were 9, she had pulled some similar shit with me. I'm autistic and had a very hard time socially as a kid, and she ended our friendship and straight up told me she couldn't be friends with me because I was a loser and I would ""hold her back"" from befriending the popular girls. Turns out they didn't like her anyway, dumped her, and then two years later she came crawling back to me begging to be friends again and apologizing profusely. Which leads us to now.

I feel I ignored her ""mean girl"" personality for so long. She would from time to time make really catty and rude comments to other girls, including girls I was friends with, that were completely unjustified simply because she thought they were ""annoying and weird."" She tried to talk me into excluding less popular girls when we were 10 from sitting with us. I gave in once and it was instantly one of the biggest regrets and sources of guilt in my life.

So last weekend I messaged her on Discord and told her how I felt. How she's basically ignored me and stopped acting like a friend and went from calling me the ""light of her life"" to treating me like a doormat. I didn't name-call or get aggressive, just told her everything straight up.

Anyway, four days later I get a reply from her. She said that my message was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" (which confused me immensely since I was just voicing my feelings), and that the pandemic ""brought a lot of things to light for her"" and that she doesn't think we can be friends anymore and that I hurt her? She never elaborated on what I did or said, or what the pandemic brought to light. She also said she was deleting Discord since she only ever used it to talk to me.

The entire message was written like a diplomatic statement from the UN and not like an ending to a 16-year friendship. She didn't even have the balls to do it in person. She said there have been ""a lot of things that made her want to cut it all off, but she decided to make up with me anyway."" I was befuddled by what this meant, as I had NEVER confronted her about this before and we hadn't had an argument since the whole roommate trip back in 2020, and even then it wasn't aggressive. There was no yelling or name calling.

Should also mention she has a master's in psychology and is a social worker. so yeah, she knows how to phrase things in a certain way.

I never replied, and was just sat there so confused. I'd been racking my brain for two years wondering what the hell I did, and even now I just have more questions than answers. I showed my fiancé what she said, and he advised me not to reply as he suspects she knows she's in the wrong and is trying to turn the tables on me so that she can cut me off without feeling bad about it.

So I guess I'm the next ""annoying"" girl she's gonna blast on social media.

My (25F) boyfriend (25M) are spending Christmas together this year and he and I like to buy each other lots of small practical gifts like nail clippers (since we lose them every year I swear) and funny slippers, instead of stressing over what to buy.   


He has longer hair than me and he's started looking more and more professional this year with a change of wardrobe and glasses. I've noticed him tying his hair up too which is new, before this year he only tied up his hair for sex since it gets in the way, I do the same or we'll end up all tangled up together. I'd love to buy him some hair ties and scrunchies so he has different colours to match his new wardrobe.  


This is going to sound stupid but I hate his current and only hair scrunchie. It's old, it's a colour that is heavily associated to his ex (his ex basically lived in this colour... her hair, her clothes, her bedroom, her makeup, her everything was this colour and he's repeatedly said that the colour makes him anxious now as she was pretty abusive).  
And on top of that it was given to him by someone who he hooked up with and then also tried (and failed) to get between him and I when she found out we had started dating. Given that he only used scrunchies to tie his hair up for sex, I asked jokingly at the time if it was a scrunchie for hookups and he said yes.   
So honestly seeing him put it on when we're being intimate always just makes me hesitate, it's such a dumb thing but it represents so much shit that I don't want to be reminded of in our most intimate moments. He doesn't see it when he's wearing it of course, but I do.   


But in his eyes he hates throwing things away or wasting things so I don't think he'd throw it out, but I think he'd also know I'm trying to replace it and he does miss his friendship with this girl even if they haven't talked in forever now.   


I don't want to look like I'm forcing away maybe the last physical reminder of a genuinely good friendship, I'm fine with him keeping it I just hate seeing him put it on when we're having sex.   
She had been adamant she didn't want a relationship but did a 180 when she realised he was getting into one and tried to change his mind.

Me (25f) and my bf (27m) have been together almost a year. We love eachother deeply.

I recently heard some stories about his past, and learned he had an extensive sexual history, or as he says he “lived a full life” before meeting me. He’s lost count of how many sexual partners he’s had, and he’s had threesomes.

While I have my own past (single digits) I always felt shy, and felt like I probably could’ve had a lot more fun than I did in my younger days if I was more confident. Hearing about his past makes me feel a little jealous, and slightly insecure. Which I’m not proud of. 

Can someone give me some advice on how to get over this? Tough love works good with me.

Thanks!

We have been long distance for some time but recently moved back in with each other earlier this year. Our sex life was often sporadic since we only saw each other every month or so, and since we’ve moved in together it hasn’t really picked up. 

I tried to initiate sex with him a few days ago and we made out but his body language didn’t seem interested in much else. Things seemed tense and we just laid on the bed in silence for a while. I was kind of spiraling out thinking maybe he wasn’t attracted to me anymore or fell out of love with me since moving in together. On the verge of a panic attack at this point I decided to just ask him why we’ve only had sex a handful of times since I moved back. 

I always try my best to encourage open communication but he struggles to tell me things he thinks might make me upset. Which would be fine except he’s not very good at hiding his feelings and I can always sense when there’s something he’s not saying. So after some prodding he told me that my lack of hygiene was a turn off. 

He had made comments previously but I didn’t realize this affected him so much that he didn’t even want to sleep with me. For the record I do not have the best hygiene (mostly due to depression) but none of my previous boyfriends have ever mentioned anything to me about it. I was embarrassed but I thanked him for his open communication and said I’d make more of an effort.

The last few days I’ve taken all of his suggestions and tried to be as clean as possible. Tonight he finally came onto me. We started making out and he made it clear he wanted to go further but I started feeling really anxious and embarrassed because I was worried I wasn’t clean enough for him. I ended up shutting him down and once again we awkwardly laid next to each other on the bed in silence. 

I’m proud of him for having the courage to tell me about an uncomfortable subject and I’m afraid my negative reaction may discourage him to communicate with me in the future. I didn’t anticipate feeling this way but I’ve already been struggling with body image issues from some recent weight gain and now I just feel like I’m disgusting and unworthy of love.

How would I explain that I don’t want them in my life anymore without her thinking I’m a weirdo?

Not interested in going into too much detail but since childhood my relationship with them hasn’t been good, same with my extended family. I was treated bad by many of them, even nuclear family (even my younger sibling doesn’t respect me, which makes me feel embarrassed because what kind of a loser doesn’t have the respect of the younger sibling?), and they always twist things around to try and say that I caused the problems when I didn’t. I’m just not respected very much, so it’s easy and cathartic to just blame me for everything. I’m tired of trying and would rather just have a fresh start. There were lots of times when we were younger when I stuck up for my little sibling and it caused me to be excluded from things, but he never did that for me. In fact, if there were times when I was being treated poorly and he would just go right alongside those people and leave me behind. There’s more stuff that happened with cousins, their cousins, and dad, but I’m too emotionally drained atm to even bring all that up.

When we first started dating, an old fling of mine had messaged me a couple times and I had just not replied. Figured I had nothing to hide. One day I left my phone at her house and she immediately started in wanting to know why the other girl was still messaging me. Mind you, I hadn't responded, thinking that the old fling would get the hint and leave me alone, but that wasn't good enough. Fight ensued. Fast forward about 6 months, old fling messages me again, my (at that time) fiance sent her a message with a few choice words. The old fling and I blocked each other on social media, problem solved... Right? Wrong. She dropped it for a year or so, then brings it back up. I tell her she can go through it, but it makes me kind of uncomfortable because 1) I don't have the same trust issues as she does, 2) because I bought an overpriced house in a town I hate in a state that I wanted to leave because that's where she wanted her two kids from a previous marriage to finish school, so m obviously committed, and 3) because all I do is go to work and come home, and when tf would I have time for another woman anyway? Also, and this is a big one, a couple of my buddies and I can go hard on the paint when we're joking or meming back and forth. She accepted that. FAST FORWARD AGAIN. I get home tonight, she's in a perfectly good mood, and then 20 minutes later ""(youngest daughter)'s boyfriend lets her go through his phone, why can't I go through yours?"" (With the daughter sitting there). I explain, again, that my idiot friends and I can say some spicy shit, which is half of the truth, the other half being that I was freaking out and venting to a buddy of mine before the wedding, and told my buddy that the thought of dealing with her 15yo and 17yo daughters who she was allowing to drink that day *before going to a nice restaurant* was the stuff of nightmares. She yells at me enough that I her that sometimes me and my guy friends talk about things that she doesn't need to know every detail of, like for instance, how I was freaking out before getting married. That wasn't good enough, she wanted to see the conversation, which I outright told her I deleted because it wasn't her business. After more yelling, I told her that I was concerned some of the younger guests at the wedding wouldn't be behaved at dinner. Again, the kid who was my largest concern at the wedding is sitting right there. Still not good enough, she wants the exact words, so I tell her I'd like it if just the adults could talk, and oh boy, that went over like a fart in church. Refused to talk without the 15 year old daughter sitting there, who, btw, has been sitting in the middle of this shitshow and asking if guys compare dicks, which is a whole different level of ""how the fuck do you think that's an appropriate question"".

I can't help but feel that if the roles were reversed, I'd sound like a controlling dickhead. Almost feel like she's trying to set me up to say something I'll regret, and I have no idea why, or why she can't just have an A and B conversation by ourselves, without trying to involve her kid(s). 


It's like I'm guilty of whatever she imagines until proven innocent, and all I even do is work, home, work, home, work, home, and a little shopping on Saturday mornings, so there's no way I could be up to anything even if I wanted to be. I've pretty much dropped all my personal ambitions for life in favor of making her happy, and seems like it still isn't enough. And again, I've never once gone through anything off hers with or without permission, because I've never felt the need.

TL;DR: 
I have given my wife no reason not to trust me, but can't even have a conversation with my guy friends without getting accused of *something* if I don't want her reading it.

Things sort of blew up about a week ago, and ever since then we've been on shaky ground. A few days ago, we agreed to go on a date night tomorrow, which seemed like progress. That's, I guess for now, still on.  

On to what I need advice on. Basically, early yesterday she told me she was meeting up with a friend for drinks at the pub at 6 (she had today off for Veterans Day; this is a friend who she knows I don't like and am not super comfortable with, but for many reasons I really don't think it's an affair), but that she wouldn't be out too late because she was tired. She came home much later than anticipated (like at 1 AM). I was watching TV, and she came to say hi, sort of complain about her day and tell me about a few work things and other mishaps that happened. I cut her short and said that I didn't really have the energy to be her therapist or diary at the moment. Which, if snarky, was the truth: Ever since all of this went down, I've tired of being overlooked for the good stuff while being the repository of the bad stuff. She got upset about that, said that I was making things worse (for our relationship), and accused me of being immature.  

Basically, I see it as three options at the moment (I brought up the idea of couples therapy in the past and she was reluctant): (1) we sit down, talk things through, and figure out what's wrong and how to fix it (ideal, but it seems impossible); (2) we continue to go through this passive aggressive phase until it passes, and if it never passes then I guess we eventually break up; or (3) we break up.

I’m not sure if I feel like this because I’ve been in not so great relationships before that were super controlling but I don’t know how to view this in a different light or if there’s something I should be doing differently.

Just posting here to get some different perspectives on this conversation I had with my girlfriend of nearly three years awhile back.  


She brought up the idea of marriage when we were about a year or so into our relationship and I was as honest as possible when I looked her in her eyes and simply told her this: 

""I do not think that marriage is a value or goal that I hold for myself, in fact, I'm pretty against being married altogether. It's not that I don't want to marry you in specific, I don't want to be married to anyone. If that is something that you want for yourself, I think that maybe we should reconsider our relationship. I don't want you to be unhappy."".

There was tears at this moment of course, and I felt like the worst guy on the planet because of it, but I owed her that honesty. Once the emotions subsided a bit, she told me that she is okay not being married if it meant that we could still be with one another.

Going forward from that, there is from time to time brief comments relating to marriage from her that kinda rub me the wrong way y'know? It's never anything big, just small things. One of the most recent ones I can think of is when I asked her when she'd make this lasagna recipe she has that she'd been telling me about and I get a quick comment like, ""That's wifey privileges"", and fair enough, I guess if I don't wanna buy an expensive ass ring for you, you have all the right to not make me some lasagna but still, I thought we were past this whole ordeal and could move on being happy where we're at now lol.

We have a happy relationship apart from all of this and I love her deeply but these comments just really get under my skin to be honest. I'm convinced that she is in fact, not okay with never being married to me (Shocker, right?). Just wish she'd have some nuts, balls, kahonas, nads or pelotas and just lemme know that so we could maybe find different people to be with instead while we're younger that may have more compatible life goals with ourselves.  


Marriage just seems to be one of the major incompatibilities that can really shape a relationship long term if y'all don't both see eye to eye on the matter, that and children. Neither of us wants kids, but I think this marriage ordeal is slowly eating away at her as she starts to realize that I was not lying when I said that I do not change my mind or myself on life goals like this. I know what I want and what I think is best for me, but I thought I was as clear and understanding as possible when I told her I'd respect and understand her if she decided to leave and find someone else the first time this topic came up.  


TL;DR: Told SO I do not believe in marriage, we agree to continue living happily with one another the way we are now; SO still makes brief snide remarks pertaining to marriage.

I 21F met Jay 23M two years ago online during the pandemic. He lived in the US and I live in the UK. I go to university but the pandemic hit and uni went online for 18 months. I didnt see or speak to my friends very often, so after talking to Jay every day we became really close and eventually we both developed feelings. Whilst we were both single and knew nothing would ever happen, we both entertained the fantasy of being together (the conversations werent exactly PG). Both of us live at home and have emotionally abusive parents. I  never met anyone I clicked so well with, he was caring and funny and we both helped each other out with our mental health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

In Jan 22, Jays dad introduced him to a girl called Clare. Jays dad is a conservativish middle eastern dad and wanted him to get married to a girl from their culture. He said he wasnt interested in her but messaged her to keep his dad happy. He wanted to meet and attempt a relationship but I knew it wouldn't work, neither of us wanted to move so I said no.

&amp;#x200B;

Around April, Jay was acting strange and off. I know him very well and sensed the weird vibes but he said it was work stress. He continued acting distant but apologised if I felt ignored. Honestly I was just worried about him. In August, I discovered he was engaged to Clare and I was distraught. All the odd behaviour made sense. I really did love him and I knew we would never be together but it hurt knowing he was lying for months, entertaining the fantasy of us and not to mention the X rated pics we'd been sending considering he's had a gf for months.

&amp;#x200B;

After confronting him, he gave a half arsed empty apology. I wasnt ready to cut him off and he didnt want to lose me as his best friend so we still spoke but I was so hurt. He was my support system but his betrayal bought all the weight on my shoulders crashing down. I never mentioned how bad I was doing, it wasnt his burden to bear. Every mention of Clare made me feel like crying but I felt selfish, I wanted him to be happy. I always kept postitve in our conversations but he continued flirting with me, and eventually all the things I wanted to say came pouring out. Did you actually you loved me, is the flirting part of a game, do you truly care about how hurt I am? After a small argument, he said he doesnt love me anymore, but still cares for me but if I couldnt get over everything, we should stop talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know hes struggling. He got laid off, his family are bashing on him and he wants a friend. I feel like he doesnt connect with his wife like he did with me and I'm just a convenient option to keep around. My parents always put me down and nitpicked my appearance resulting in low self esteem so I always kept in my small bubble of friends and didnt try out societies/sports at uni. But I'm trying to change and join clubs and meet new people even though things at home are deteriorating. Things have changed, but I still miss my friend platonically.

The problem is doing stuff in the real world (not online) gives her anxiety and it's becoming a real problem. I don't mean to look like a jerk by illustrating this, but here are some of the many things she can't do:

\-Doesn't like driving because she has anxiety about crashing (even failed her test 4 times, then got her license just to say she got it and never drove)

\-Doesn't know how to smoke a bong, cigarette or light a match, and is panicky about fire

\-Can't cook and is afraid of knives

\-Struggles with combination locks

\-Couldn't figure out how to open a filing cabinet (I had to sadly show her to slide the clicky thing when I gave her my briefcase and she panicked and just started pulling it)

\-Struggles with a can opener even though I've showed her how to use it multiple times

\-Can't change a tire, BBQ, and didn't know how to clean the bathroom/use the microwave (used the wrong sprays and was afraid of bleach poisoning)

Again, she's a nice girl, but she literally can't do anything else besides browse the web and write and I'm wondering if this is some kind of disability she has with hands-on tasks or if there is any way I can cure her. She literally panics about simple things and the other day I even asked her to cut the pizza and joked about whether she can handle it.

For the past four years him and I have switched back and forth being a stay at home parent and being the one that works. We have two small kids and child care is just too expensive. 
Anyway, when my husband has been the one working, I was told that all house chores were my job because I was the one home all day. To a certain degree, I agree with him. He works long hours and wants to come home to a clean house. I totally get it. And on the days where I don't have the energy, he never fusses about it because he knows I'll get it done when I have the time and energy again. BUT what I don't agree with, is the fact that when he comes home I am expected to wait on him hand and foot. He will come home and immediately take his shoes and socks off (he's a blue collar worker so you can imagine the smell) and will leave his dirty socks all over the house. I serve him dinner and he will leave his dishes on the table and walk away. When he's ready for a shower, I'm expected to get him his towel. If I don't he will deliberately drip dry, leaving water all over the floor everywhere he goes. When I ask him to pick up after himself, he tells me that he doesn't deserve to get nagged at when he gets home and to just do it myself if it bothers me that much. On his days off, I hardly ask him to do anything because he works hard and deserves to rest. But I'm still expected to feed him and clean up after him. If I put my foot down about it, he guilts me into it anyway. 
Now let's switch rolls
When I was the one working, I was expected to work a 16 hour shift, 6 days a week (nurse in the ER). Then come home, make dinner, bathe the kids and clean up the house. When I ask my husband why nothing got done, he would have his face glued to a screen playing video games. And proceed to tell me to stop nagging him because he would do the house work when he wanted to, not when I wanted it done (which was never) 
I have tried getting him to understand the frustration I feel about this but he refuses to see what he's doing. I feel like I have a third child to care for instead of a partner and I don't know what to do anymore.

TLDR: My boyfriend started acting weird with his messages, blocked a girl from viewing an instagram story that he posted of me.

I started dating my boyfriend over a year ago, we're both MD's and we met at the hospital where we both worked. It was all great at the beginning, he was everything I could have asked for and more.

A couple months ago we got a break from the hospital at the same time, we stayed at my apartment and the entire time he was being weirdly secretive about his phone, he took it to the bathroom when he was going for a shower, if he got a text and I happened to be next to him he wouldn't open it. This kind of thing was never a problem, in the past he had asked me to do certain things on his phone and we both have each other's passwords. I never thought of going through his phone because like I said, everything was perfect up until this point. One day during the break he was scrolling through instagram and I see a notification pop up of a girl that we both know, she liked a message he had sent her I asked him what it was about and he said it was nothing important which I found weird but I didn't think more of it.

Fast forward to this week, this one girl from instagram comes up on a conversation and I ask about the conversation again, he gets pretty defensive and I do too so I tell him if it's nothing to hide to just show me what they were talking about and he says he deleted the conversation because he knew I'd take things out of context. He stays at my house one day and even though i'm ashamed to admit it, I went through his phone where I don't really find any conversations or anything, but I do notice he has this one girl blocked from viewing his instagram stories where he had just posted me. I don't ask him directly about this one thing but again, I ask what the deal is with this girl and he says that they're just old friends, which I know is true. He does regular posts of me too so I thought just blocking the stories was weird. A couple days go by and I go through his phone again and no one is blocked from his stories anymore.

I'm not working at this one hospital anymore, but my best friend is and they work in the same area, I asked her if she has noticed anything weird about him and she says no, I know where he is all the time and he has an incredibly busy schedule, we have been seing each other less because I had to move to a different apartment and that just made things difficult.

We have broken up due to some spells of cheating (him cheating) and me feeling unhappy. 

He hasn’t physically cheated on me that I’m aware of, only texting other girls, being on dating apps, taking girls numbers in clubs and texting them after ect. He has never admitted to these ive found out from seeing girls names pop up or my work colleagues finding his dating site profile and sending them to me. 

As you can imagine, I am not pretty weary of him going on nights out. The main issues it he has a habit of going missing. Most nights out he use to not come home turn his phone off ect. When he would casually stroll in midday the next day I would have been up all night crying panicking. I’ve even gone out in my dressing gown driving around all night worried he’d drunk and passed out somewhere. 

Either way, I’m always a psycho whenever I’ve brought up how him disappearing and coming home the next day and not even telling me isn’t fair. The police once had him registered at missing and were calling all the hospitals he was gone for so long. 

The new issue is I don’t trust he is where he says he is when he’s “staying over a friends.” So I tell him after every night out I will come to pick him up. I don’t care where he is or what time as I will be up worried sick and panicking if I don’t have that reassurance that I’ll be getting him and he will defo be coming home. 

Well now his way around this is going out telling me he won’t be late so he can get the train home. He then will stay out past when the trains end. I’ll message him before the last trains to ask if he’s getting on them, and he will of course ignore me until they have passed. I will then say ok I’ll come get you whenever you’re ready please just let me know. He will say I’ll let you know if I need a lift? Btw we live quite a while from where he goes out out so taxis are not an option. I will then ask him to promise me he is coming home and will let me know what time. At this point he will start to ignore me. I’ll ask another question and he will reply to the new question but not the one where I ask him to promise. He does this so when I say I stayed up till 6am ect waiting for the call to give him a lift, he will say oh well I never asked for it. 

Sometimes he’ll ask for a lift over the phone and then be very vague in his texts so he will then say the next day show me where I text you I promise I will come home?  

I just don’t know how I can resolve this. Breaking up is hardly an option. We live together have just signed a new tenancy, have a dog also who whenever we have broken up he tells me I’m not allowed to see ever again ect ect.

He is the kindest, most intelligent, chill, reasonable, respectful, supportive and loving person I've ever met. We've talked about getting married, we want to get engaged sometime this year. I feel more confident about that than I've ever felt with anyone I've ever dated.

There's just one issue that keeps worrying me. If we got married, I know that for the literal rest of my life, I would have to spend time with his family. Our kids would, too. That terrifies me. I haven't met his family yet, they are all over the country, but I've heard my boyfriend talk to them on the phone, I've seen their texts to him, and I've heard his stories about them. I will be meeting them all in January. I'm scared.

His family isn't a bunch of casual conservatives. They are hardcore pro-trump conservatives, some of them believe in QAnon, all of them say racist things regularly. They talk about politics all the time. They treat politics like their religion. It's part of their personalities. They will casually bring up how abortion is murder at the dinner table, and ask everyone directly to say their stance, and if you don't, they'll say things like ""if we can't discuss this with family, who can we discuss it with?"". They're also really, really christian, in a not-nice way. They openly judge most people really harshly, they say casual misogynistic things, and generally weaponize the church.

They are openly anti-trans, anti-gay, and I'm honestly really scared about that because I'm a pretty closeted bi person. All of my close friends and the men and women I've dated know, but none of my family, and I don't tell anyone casually. Also, what if one of our kids is trans or gay? I would love them no matter what, but I know his family wouldn't.  

My boyfriend's Dad keeps saying that my boyfriend needs to get a gun and sends him drunk texts a lot (he's openly a non-recovered alcoholic) that just say one word like ""Beware"", and calls him pretty regularly to discuss how the world is ending, and how my boyfriend needs to be prepared (usually because of some political thing that he read). I'm pretty worried about his Dad.

His Mom sends him conspiracy theory fox news messages all the time, even after he's told her to stop (he said he's seriously considered blocking her number) and she has said wildly racist things in text. She is not a nice person, she's pretty selfish and made a lot of mistakes when raising my boyfriend that really concern me like leaving him alone with different men she was dating that were pretty mean to him. 

All of his brothers and their wives are also hardcore conservative. I've heard them casually say anti-trans and racist rhetoric on the phone when they were talking about something else totally unrelated.

My family is so different from his. They lean conservative, sure, but everyone is wildly polite and kind to each other. They know we don't all agree politically, and they still love everyone regardless. We have a very strict no-politics talk rule at all family functions that everyone actually follows.

I lean pretty liberal, but I am always open to other view points as long as they are kind and logical, and based in truth and reality. I also do not discuss politics at all if I can help it, because I know how emotionally charged it can get people. 

The silver lining is that I likely will only see these people a few times a year. But. I worry about that even. Like, 3+ times a year, every year for the rest of my life, in addition to them seeing their grand children every now and then, sounds like hell.

I'm worried about being attacked for wanting to not discuss politics like my boyfriend said has happened to other family members. I'm worried I will feel really alienated at all family functions with them. My boyfriend said his ex got into a huge argument with them a few times because she was liberal. He also said the first question his brother (and many of them) asked about me when we started dating was my political affiliation. He told them I was liberal. I'm worried about that. 

What are the best things I can do to cope with knowing I could in theory have to see these people multiple times a year for the rest of my life? Also, what are the best ways to get out of political discussions?

He asked me pretty early on when we started talking this summer if I would date him (we had barely chatted anything at this point) so I told him “I’m not ready for a relationship and I have lots of mixed emotions I have to sort out” which isn’t even a lie, because that’s genuinely how I feel. I didn’t mention, however, that I’m not interested in pursuing him romantically.

It’s like he doesn’t want to let that sink in I guess. And maybe that’s mainly my fault that I might have led him on.

He also oftentimes say that he feels alone and that life would feel so much better with a partner and also that he is a failure and worthless because ‘he can’t be in a relationship.’ And I try to comfort him when he says things like this but at the same time, it feels like he’s using these statements as a way to make me feel bad for him and to make it more difficult for me to reject him.

It also feels like he might only keep me as a friend because he thinks I’ll eventually ‘give in’ and date him. And I feel bad if that’s the case because the I guess I’m at fault for it. I should have made it more clear from the beginning.

I guess I just want someone to look at this situation and get some more insights, and I want to ask what you think is the best thing I can do in this situation?

Me (F22) and my boyfriend (M23) have been together for around 3 years. We currently live together with his family. We have had issues for the past year but they have gotten worse as we moved in together about 6 months ago. I will admit I have jealousy issues and a fear of abandonment due to some childhood issues but I have been working on it. I got to therapy but I do act out sometimes. We used to get in arguments all the time about what he was doing and harmless comments he would make about women. 

Most of our arguments end in me crying and him telling me I’m overreacting and that he can’t deal with it anymore. I do understand I am a lot to deal with so I have been trying to calm myself down and not get so worked up. Out arguments are usually weekly and can last 40 minutes which I do see is a lot. Recently, I have gotten better and our arguments are about 5 mins and I can mostly stay calm throughout the whole thing. I feel like I should be able to discuss these issues with my partner but I can see how it gets to be too much. 

He does not handle the situations well either imo. He usually gets so frustrated that he starts calling me names, talking down to me calling me an idiot. On his end it usually ends in him saying he wants to break up and how he could be so much better off single. I tried to explain that I feel like that too sometimes but if you do not feel that way in a couple of hours or so, maybe they’re not permanent feelings (I will admit I don’t practice this completely either). 

We have also broken up several times as he says he cannot handle me anymore. Of course I get upset but I’m not going to force someone to be with me. When we do get back together though it’s always him saying he wants to. I always leave him alone and try to get over the relationship but he’s the one to reach out. 

The biggest problem I have is that I’m actively trying to work on being better but he is not. He says he cannot work on the way he treats me and speaks to me until I fix my issues. He says that I need to speak to him with no emotion or I cannot talk to him. He says I “make” him treat me badly by how I act and that bringing up things and talking about them for more than an “appropriate” (until he gets tired of the conversation) is unacceptable.

My ex and i dated from 2019 to the end of 2021. we were toxic. we both weren’t mentally prepared for a relationship, since we both got out of one at the same time and started talking. we were too young to realize that we needed to heal before we started dating each other. i was toxic too, i will never deny that. i was the “crazy girlfriend.” he was the “nonchalant bf”. 

he cheated on me, and i got an STD from him because of it. i know he did and i went back. i expected too much from an 18 year old boy. i expected him to act and treat me like we’re grown when we’re on two different levels in life right now. i wanted him to care, he didn’t want to try. 

now here i am, after him telling me 2 months ago he doesn’t want to love me and he doesn’t want to be in love with me. (he told me this because i asked why he’s never gotten me flowers). i don’t love him. i am not in love with him, for the very first time in my life i do not love him. and it feels flipping amazing. 

this is the feeling i have been chasing my entire life. i have wanted to feel this since he first broke my heart. but it also brings sadness because i realized our chapter is ending and though we were toxic, i spent 4 years getting to know him and i feel so bad that i’m so happy without him. 

i don’t want him in my life, yet he’s trying his best to make me love him again. he’s buying me gifts, replying faster, communicating, taking me out, but anytime i’m with him, i look at him as my best friend. i don’t see him in a romantic way. and i know he does this every time. he’ll reel me back in, make me feel loved and special, then leave. it’s the same cycle. 

why do i feel so sad for being so happy without him in my life romantically? why do i not love him back in the same way he loves me? after everything we’ve been through, i should love him back. but i don’t. he’s trying so hard and it’s hurting me to know he’s suffering while i’m out living my life without him.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7523082,public,self,"i don’t love my ex boyfriend anymore, but he’s still trying to make me love him again.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysu0qa/i_dont_love_my_ex_boyfriend_anymore_but_hes_still/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I found out I was pregnant a month ago.
I’ve been on birth control since I was 15. Same pill. Im enrolled in school, have a job, and an apartment in a city close to home. I have a cat too. Every thing was perfect. 6 weeks ago I missed my period. Like, waited 10 days missed my period. This wasn’t normal, I originally started the pill because of my irregular period. Did I miss a pill? I counted twice, three times, four. No extras. I looked at the open pack I had for this month and the unopened one for next month. They weren’t expired? They were exactly the same, down to the print of the expiration date. I fished the trash can for last month’s empty package, same thing. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. On the way to class that morning, I grabbed 3 pregnancy test from the campus bookstore. I sat my coffee and breakfast sandwich outside the bathroom door and went in. I’ve never taken a pregnancy test, but I’ve always heard the phrase pee on a stick, so I opened all three and used them at the same time. I waited three minutes and washed my hands, grabbing each of the tests in a paper towel. All 3 of them were positive. I cried. I dry heaved. I wanted to pass out on the bathroom floor. I called my boyfriend and he was excited as ever. I was panicking saying we weren’t ready for a baby, how I couldn’t stay in school and work with a newborn, how I would lose everything. Im not ready, I don’t want children right now. He started to say how I was selfish, and would just have to put my classes and what not on hold until the baby was old enough to go to daycare. That made me nauseous. I told him I was coming home and he met me there. He held me and cried saying how happy he was. I felt so disgusted with myself for knowing I didn’t want this baby after seeing him cry like that. I wanted to try and keep the baby for him. I thought about having the baby and just leaving him with it. I thought about disappearing and never having the baby. But after a few days I had to ask what he thought of me getting rid of the baby. He told me he would hate me, he would never speak to me again. He layed into me, going on and on about me being a baby killer, how I was selfish, evil, and immature for even thinking something like that. We got into a huge argument from there and I made him leave. He broke my tv and my favorite vase. I cried for his for days, begging him to take me back, he said I would if I kept the baby. Needless to say, he didn’t take me back. I spent every night after that drinking bottle after bottle of Jim beam whiskey. Apple flavored. My dad’s favorite. I miscarried in the dead of the night on a Thursday. Thought I had a real bad stomach bug until I saw the blood in my toilet. My neighbor took me to the hospital, where my now exs sister works. He showed up with my mom, his mom and his dad. While she half hugged me his mom and dad made comments about how I probably did this on purpose considering I didn’t want the baby anyway. I just kept my mouth shut. My mom asked if they were here to support me or their son and if they weren’t here for me they should just leave. They started arguing and eventually it got loud and security escorted everyone out, but not before my ex and his family could start shouting at the top of their lungs how I’m a baby killer and I’m going to hell and yadayadayada. I’m in so much pain, I’m so tired, and I’m so angry everything had to come to this. I really loved him and now I feel like I’m losing everybody because of this.

I haven’t spoken or seen him in years, up until recently, so I’m at a loss of where to go from here. 

I was 13 when I had my first boyfriend, who I’ll refer to as C in this post.  Everything about our relationship initially was everything you could imagine a first childhood love could be.  He was the sweetest and had this charm about him that made me weak in the knees.  We lost our virginity to each other on my 14th birthday, in hindsight it was very young but I truly loved him a lot so I don’t regret it at all to this day and I’m glad my first time ever was with him.  However this was where our relationship started to go downhill because I had a pregnancy scare, and my parents caught me buying a pregnancy test.  It turned out to be negative but the damage was done already.  Both of our families are very strict, his parents made him break up with me.  My relationship with my parents was never really the same and they eventually separated as well due to unrelated reasons. They did forgive me and I can say now that it is much better than it was years ago. 

C and I dated secretly off and on for the next two years, but it was rocky throughout the entire relationship.  His dad was abusive and a cheater, which drove his mom to have an affair. So C basically had to watch his parents go through a long divorce and nasty custody battle of him and his two younger siblings.  He has an older brother that’s now living on his own because of all his family trauma.  C started drinking and doing all sorts of drugs, hanging with the wrong crowd even. I first found out about this when I went with my older cousins to a club to pick up our other cousin and saw him sitting drunk and alone. We were 15 at the time.  I learned that he’d acquired a fake, in my gut, I knew that was the beginning of the end of us.  He was admitted to the psych ward after having multiple mental breakdowns when we were 17.  I so badly wanted to get better so I stuck by him. 

But then once he was released it didn’t takes him long before he relapsed.  We started fighting and he continued to drink and get high.  We finally broke up for good when I graduated high school while he dropped out.  I cut off communication with him as much as it broke my heart because I knew we weren’t good for each other anymore. Over the next few years, I would hear from old friends how he still thought of me, would spend the rest of his life trying to get back to me and be better.  I took these words with a grain of salt but never responded.

Now FF to this month.  I’m 21 and a junior in college.  I get a call from my mom to tell me that C tried to commit suicide by taking pills.  I went home literally the day after and went to see him in the hospital where we had a long conversation.  He told me he bought pills from his dealer who slipped some vitamin C in them.  Doctor said if they’d all been real, he would’ve probably died.  C apologized for ruining our relationship and that he’d love me for the rest of his life.

This happened a few days ago and I’m home just trying to process. All the memories are flooding back and I can’t focus on anything. I’ve dated a few guys since him and had one relationship.  I’ve definitely cared about them but I don’t think I ever loved someone as deeply as I loved C.  The fact that I almost lost him kills me, but I know I can’t ever go back to him. Could I? I can’t save him no matter how much I want to.  I hate that life has been so hard for him but I’m also scared that as long as he’s around, I’ll never truly be able to get over him.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7523063,public,self,"My first love tried to kill himself, and now it’s killing me.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ystyi7/my_first_love_tried_to_kill_himself_and_now_its/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
