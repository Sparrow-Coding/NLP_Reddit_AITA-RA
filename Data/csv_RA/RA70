Aside from this issue, we have a pretty healthy relationship and treat each other amazing. But in the past few months he has asked for a break/broken up with me constantly bc he “doesn’t know who he is” and needs to figure out his life. I have TRIED to give him the break he wants. But then the same day or the next day he takes it back, and shows up at my doorstep saying that he loves me, and acts like everything’s normal, that nothings changed, and he tries to be affectionate with me. 

He assured me  when the last time it happened that he only wanted to break up bc of his own mental issues and that he is “off the rails.” but why break my heart &amp; leave me crying saying that i can give him all the space he needs, we can work it out somehow, just for him to say there is “nothing I can do to change this. We need to break up.” Then 5 hours later after that he asks for me back and acts like everything is normal.

 I only kept asking about our future bc I kept picturing us marrying each other someday. Until we reached one year we were perfect and everything was great. He said he KNEW I was his soulmate. Maybe he just cant picture a future with anyone if he cant even picture what his future is going to look like for himself (this is what he implies.) Or maybe he just doesn’t want one with me. But when he said he wanted to break up he said that he wants us to keep talking and maybe we can reconnect romantically when he figures himself out. Now he’s just saying he needs more space bc we are seemingly codependent. He needs time to figure out himself, and that this needs to be more “casual” instead of me asking if he wants to move in someday or get married someday. I just thought discussing a future together was normal and expected once you reach one year in a relationship, especially given he asked me to move in a few months ago. But I said I dont want to make the serious commitment of moving in unless we are committed to a future together.

While there are some redeeming traits and great memories together, I have been more focused on avoiding his negativity and self centered nature in recent months. My friends mother reached out to me and said he misses me so much and that he was in an auto accident and asked me to call him since he is my ""supposed best friend"", after all. I can't fully decide how I really feel about him (and worry I've been too influenced by my fiancée who has personal grievances towards him trying to make advances on her behind my back in the past), and can't decide if I should respond to his mom or reach out to him. 

I apologize in advance for the length of this post; it is difficult to consolidate a decade long friendship and its demise. I suppose I will just start from the top. T (I will call him for short) and I met in early high school and were best friends for years. For a majority of our friendship, he was my rock.  To list just a few examples he was always the person I could call at any hour to rant, he helped me through major breakups, in a very practical way helped me in life by using his truck to move me between apartments, etc. We had, and to some extent still have, similar interests and have wonderful memories together which I greatly appreciate to this day.  The older and wiser I get I realize this friendship, and T's personality  has some flaws, however. He's a very negative person. Conversation most often leads to ""F this"" or ""F that"" type of dialogue; long rants about intense conspiracy theories and problems in politics and within certain groups of people, or nasty and disrespectful remarks about his girlfriend and some old acquaintances of ours. I'll just say he has made remarks similar to Kanye's recent remarks about Jewish people, has called his own girlfriend a bitch and unintelligent, for example. Our old friends are ""soy boys"" too. When he doesn't seem to be going off about one of these things, it's usually him bragging about his lucrative career and the famous people he meets doing it. He's involved in filmography and is paid quite well and often meets musicians and celebrities' and makes sure most anyone knows it.  He is self centered and, especially in recent years when I have seen him increasingly more seldom occasions, he rarely asks about me. I have to really push to get a word in and talk about myself. All of this aside, he has a history of drug and alcohol use and I feel has been a bad influence in this regard- in the way of being the person who I have been around the few instances I have experimented with drugs and being forced to be around his constant pot smoking. (No offense to cannabis users; it just is not something I enjoy). 

The real downfall with our relationship began in 2020 when I met my now fiancée, who I will refer to as M.  He's disrespected her several times. When M and I first met and were still talking but not officially together, we made the mistake of engaging in a sexual escapade with T. I won't go into details, but it was a one time occurrence and the boundary between T and M most certainly ended there. Regardless, in my absence he tried to kiss her when I wasn't in the room months after. There was an instance where he made very patronizing remarks about me. He said something like ""Isn't he so cute?"", making a stab at my inherent awkwardness due to suffering from social anxiety and being a high functioning autistic individual. Months later yet, during Halloween 2021 (the last time my now Fiancée and I seen him together) he was very touchy and inappropriate to her. He went on to make strong advances towards one of M's friends despite me asking him not to do so (since I knew he was in a phase of only wanting sex and this friend of hers is easily mesmerized by men and looking for something more serious). That evening he embarrassed me in front of other friends too, stealing knick knacks from a restaurant table and choosing to publicly piss on the side of a building. These things I would have laughed at years ago, or perhaps taken a part in but I feel much more mature these days.

Shortly after this, last November, M and I went through a very rough phase. I went to T's apartment, very clear in my motive to get away and have a chance to talk to him about my relationship problems. He was very dismissive of this, and went on to invite another friend over also whom I had never met before and barely gave me a chance to talk, not that I would want to in front of a stranger anyways. The visit was brief and mostly consisted of me watching him rip his bong before going to the gym with the other person he had invited over before I left. I recall not really getting the chance to talk, and being offered ""get over it, more fish in the sea"" type advise mixed in between conversation with the other friend.

 The final straw was when I proposed this May, and sent a photo to him of M with the ring and he had no response other than responding ""Oh boy"". What kind of response is that from my alleged best friend? I haven't spoke to him since, and have not seen him since April or so. 

He's tried to call a few times, and sent a text here and there- I have not reciprocated. His mother, whom I was very close with during our friendship has begun reaching out to me now too. Today she sent a message telling me to ""CALL T\_\_\_"". and that my ""supposed best friend"" misses me and doesn't understand my distance, and that he was in a car accident and wants to talk to me. Her choice of words in saying ""supposed"" feels like a guilt trip, and candidly, I bet his ""accident"" was just another instance of him very intentionally choosing to drive under some sort of influence and get in another fender bender (which has happened several times before). 

I just really don't know how to process my feelings or know what action to take. On one hand, I feel completely warranted in ending the relationship and in not feeling obligated to provide an explanation or respond, and that M has helped me see some things about T and I relationship that I have been blind to for years.  On another, I worry I am influenced by my fiancée who has never liked him much and is not as forgiving of a person as me. I can't decide if I should respond and check in with T. I feel it would certainly open up the doors with him in regards to seeing each other again, and perhaps even feeling obligated to invite him to my wedding. I don't even know how I may explain my absence in recent months, let alone the choice to have not elected to have him in my wedding party as he likely would have expected.

I asked my girlfriend what she wanted for Christmas and she said she wanted a diamond. I was thinking about getting her earrings or a necklace with diamonds. However, when I asked a friend of mine to help me choose, he kept telling me that she’s asking for a proposal. 

For context, we have been dating for 2 years and been living together for one. And the friend I mentioned earlier has recently bought a new suit that he clearly wants to put to use.

I know that the most obvious thing is to ask her. However, I feel like if I ask her for clarification, and that’s what she actually meant, I’d be taking away the surprise if any is left. 

So I’m reaching out for you people of Reddit to help me figure out what I should do. I would like to mention that getting rejected on Christmas Eve is not on my bucket list.

I love him to death but we have been having some communication issues. 
- He is the person that when bothered with something, he gets very quiet, does not speak to me or act as kindly as he usually do.
- I am the person that wants to speak through our problems and try solving them talking asap.

So from that you probably can see the root of our problems. I try giving him the space and time, but it hurts so much that he goes to this 'world' in his mind and seems to forget about me. It seems to me he just does not want to fix things sometimes and drags a grudge for longer than needed even though most times he haven't even communicated to me what I did wrong. 

I know he loves me and he seems oblivious to the way he acts around communication(probably some past trauma is the root of that). I have tried giving him time, I have tried confronting him to fix it... most times after a day if I confront him after a lot of effort from my side I can get his side of things and solve our issues. 

However, is it fair that I need to do this even when I am the one that is mad with him about something? What do I do? I DO NOT want to be the person to always cave and go after him to solve a fight that I was the one complaining about something he did...

My (32F) husband (40M) and I have been married for 7 years, and our marriage is good. Normal ups and downs, but we communicate well through our issues. However, his family and I do not get along. Unfortunately it seems like the one thing we can't talk through.

His family and I argue a fair bit because I'm a hot head and so is his dad. They are also very openly opinionated about things I don't feel comfortable just smiling and nodding about (eg. Very anti-BLM, very anti climate science, heavy ""Fox News"" conservatives) because I don't want it to be taken as agreement. There have also been comments that make me think they have some disdain for me for not having children, even though husband does not want them. 

During these conversations, my husband doesn't usually say much. I used to be hurt/feel abandoned but I know now he just doesn't handle confrontation with his family well. They're very much a keep silent, keep up appearances, talk crap after they leave kind of group and he doesn't have much practice telling them what he really thinks. He still hides that he smokes pot, for instance. 

Unfortunately I am the odd man out. Now that they know I am very left leaning in my politics, I'm needled until it escalates at every family gathering. I wish I wasn't so reactive, but I can't keep my stupid mouth shut when his parents say things like the 'BLM protestors should be shot' or ''climate scientists are lying for the money'. I am a mixed race immigrant, and an environmental scientist. There's no compromises on the opinions themselves.

I want his family to like me, but there's this horrible gap between us and I don't know how to bridge it. My husband has been keeping us mostly separated, and we weren't invited to Christmas this year. Husband seems okay with that, but I know over time just not getting to attend family functions because of me is going to impact him in a negative way. Beyond that, I'm pretty hurt by it.

I feel so sad about this situation and all my attempts to resolve it haven’t helped. 

My fiancé and I bought a house earlier this year, and long story short his mom violated some major boundaries by showing up late at night demanding to be let in/other stressful antics. 

She has some major control issues and this was the first time my fiancé tried to set reasonable boundaries, he tried talking to her and she refused to listen/then showed up and threatened to call the cops/wouldn’t leave unless he responded to her texts asking him to go to dinner. 

He ignored her demands like his therapist told him to and it ended up with our new neighbors seeing my MIL looking through our windows with a flashlight (her phone) while spam calling fiancé and texting demanding to see him. 

This sort of thing seems really unhinged but she’s done similar things before. 

I have always smoothed things over in the past and never made her feel bad for these uh… lapses in judgement. 

But this time my fiancé and his therapist decided he should go no contact for a little while. He texted his family explaining the situation and that he needed space. 

All the stress and drama really put a damper on buying our first house, and it triggered my fiancés autoimmune condition to flare up again. 

My SIL (fiancés sister) gets engaged a few weeks later. All well and good, we used to be really close and I thought we were like sisters (which she always said to me) since I’ve been with fiancé for a decade. 

She calls me to talk about the wedding and I’m happy for her, etc, and then she tells me I need to get my fiancé to apologize to their mom and fix this stupid situation because it’s ruining her wedding (which was an entire year away.) 

For the first time ever, I tell her that I can’t and it’s up to my fiancé and his therapist, I don’t want to be involved. 

She shocked me by freaking out and insisting her mom did nothing wrong, that we were ruining her wedding by not apologizing, and that families don’t need boundaries and that I was lying about what the therapist said to keep her brother away from his family. 

I cried and hung up, she called my fiancé and told him to never let me speak negatively of their mother again (for saying she violated boundaries) and that she wants him to be in their wedding party as a groomsmen all in the same breath. 

My fiancé argued with her and hung up. His sister didn’t care about him buying a house being ruined, but was angry about him needing space ruining a wedding a year away. 

I tried texting her and apologizing, telling her that I love her like a sister and I don’t want our friendship ruined by this, that I was sorry I said anything about her mom or the situation. She didn’t respond. 

My fiancé started speaking to his parents again to try to smooth things over. His sister keeps asking him to be in their wedding party but he’s upset at the way she acted towards us both, and that she’s refusing to even speak to me. 

I feel really hurt. I don’t know what to do. I’ve spent a decade brushing off things that hurt me and it feels like the one time I defend my fiancé and repeat what he told me I become the family destroyer.

We live together and fight constantly. It seems like every time I have emotions, he gets upset with me. He always says “we shouldn’t talk about it now” whenever I try to have a conversation with him about it. The problem is he works 9-7 every day and never has time or energy for me, so we never talk. 
For example, last weekend, I asked him if he could wait to do the dishes until I was out of the shower because it was making the water cold. He immediately started yelling at me about my “tone” and me “throwing emotions at him” while I was crying and asking him what was even going on. Yesterday I tried to ask him about the fact that he jerks off every time I’m not home but doesn’t have sex with or even touch me. I was just trying to ask if that had anything to do with me. He shut down and got upset while telling me I was upset, but I wasn’t. It was genuinely just a question. 
I’ve been really sick since last week and I didn’t sleep well last night so I was having a rough morning today. I complained a bit, but nothing aggressive or rude to him. He shut down again so I gave him space, and when I called him later to see if everything was okay, he was pissed and said I was “aggro toward him” and that he can’t deal with that first thing in the morning. 
Point is, this has been going on for months where every time I try to talk to him about something real, he gets mad at me for it and shuts down and then I end up apologizing for having feelings and wanting to talk. I told him that I want to break up because this isn’t healthy or sustainable, and if there are this many things that cause us to be upset with each other, then we’re probably just not compatible. He got mad at me for saying that at a bad time (again) and insisted we should go to couple’s therapy. Then he stormed out, slammed the door, and sped off in his car. 
I decided to pack up and go to my mom’s while we figure stuff out, but I’m starting to feel like I’m crazy.

For some background, he is a big fan of a specific old movie. I am an avid vintage and antique collector and have a lot of contacts in the same area that I regularly buy from. He knows about my hobby. I asked one of my contacts for help with finding items related to this movie, and one was able to find a real (significant) prop from the film but it costs $250. There's no way he'd be able to figure out what it cost. We're both financially stable so the price doesn't bother me, but I'm aware that it's a LOT to spend on a new relationship.

My options are:

Buy it and give it to him for Christmas, blow his mind and not reveal what I spent on it.

Buy it and hold onto it for a later holiday, resell it if we break up before then.

Let it go and find something cheaper.

I love my partner. We met online two years ago, but the middle of last year I found out she has been sexting another man which caused us massive issues. At the time we almost split up and I didn’t think it was solved - and I did keep questioning her and she wanted it to be put aside. I did do that but wasn’t ready and admit I made some comments. But we finally put it aside as I was allowed to speak about it and then we moved on and out love grew.

The problem is, every now and then she tells me I am being cryptic and not saying what I really mean. She tells me that I’m accusing her of cheating. I am not doing this and the things I am saying can be general comments, for example I’ve said “you spoke in your sleep last night” and she then says that I’m accusing her of cheating (she speaks in her sleep.

The other day she messaged a man who was made homeless and told him things would get better and honestly that’s why I love her ❤️. I work with vulnerable people and today used our system to find advice on homelessness and so today I asked how that man was. Her instant reaction is to send a screenshot of it and suggest I’m accusing her of cheating.

My exact message was “Any update on the man who was sleeping on the sofa? X”

So that, according to her, is an accusation. It didn’t even occur to me that she was cheating as I knew what she had said. Last week she told me she hated a female friend of mine who had replied to a photo I had posted. I don’t get how I’m accusing?

&amp;#x200B;

More context: My nephew died last week, and it really hit the whole family hard. Even though it was my cousin's child who died, for simplification I will refer to her and her family as my sister, mother etc. because I am very close with them. 

The service itself was beautiful. There was obviously a lot of crying mixed in with laughter as my two-year-old niece tried to sing along with the songs. I don't think she understood it was her little brother's funeral, but at least it made my sister smile. After the service at the funeral home, and at the grave site, the family was invited to my mother's house. One of the family members who came was my uncle James. Uncle James is known as the family asshole. He rarely stops drinking, doesn't know what is, and is not inappropriate (like asking me about my dog at the gravesite). Toward the end of the night, his daughter asked me to help him to the car while she went and said her goodbyes. I asked my boyfriend to come with me because being alone with him is extremely uncomfortable (lots of placing his meaty hand on my shoulder, making crude jokes etc.) 

On the way to the car, he started talking about how the last time he wore his suit was at my father's (his brother's) funeral. Before I could say anything he started going off about how weird it was that we were all burying him. And how inconvenient it was that it was raining. He had to wash his shoes out in the sink because of all the mud, we should have just said our goodbyes and left. I'm Jewish, but he and the rest of my father's side of the family are not. I understand they do not understand why friends and family bury our dead, but it was the most beautiful part of the service for me. My father was never alone, he was buried by people who loved him. 

As he kept going on and on about how horrible my father's funeral was, my cousin finally came out of the house and I nearly ran back into the house without saying anything. My boyfriend comforted me as I bawled my eyes out. How could he have said such hurtful things at a *funeral*? Any other time I have to interact with the man I can keep a straight face no matter how inappropriate he is. After I was able to stop crying, I tried to say goodbye to my mother and sister before leaving and they stopped me and asked what was wrong. All I could say was that Uncle James was insulting my father's funeral, and they brushed it off like I was overreacting. 

I know I'm not overreacting, but since the funeral, I've been unable to sleep. I want to call him out on his rude behavior. I want to tell him he cannot talk that way to me. His daughter's bridal shower is coming up in a few weeks and I know he will be there. I don't want to go, I don't want to run into him and make a scene. I love my cousin dearly but her father crossed a line. And there are many people not coming to her wedding because of him. I want to tell him that too but I think he already knows. It's all I can think about and it makes me so angry.

We are a couple in our late twenties and have been dating for 6 months. Besides this issue, thing are going relatively well.

He has a girl best friend and I don’t understand their relationship. They are distant cousins. I want to preface this by saying, they are not in love with each other or have any romantic feelings. Both of them have not given me any indication of that. But i do feel like my boyfriend is obsessed with her. Note that she is happily in a relationship, soon to be married.

1)He had attended a different university and decided to switch. He choose the one she was attending.

2)He was married to her- it was a convenience marriage. No romantic feelings. It was a sham marriage- they did not live together.

3)Couple months ago, he said he wanted to be closer and wanted to move in down the street from her.

4)Plans to start a business together and if necessary, plans to move to a different state ( and wants me to move with him also).

I’ve discussed this with him and he admits that they are close but doesn’t understand why I am skeptical and find their relationship odd. 

If we move, I want just us to make the decision to move. Not because of her. I’m now realizing the lifelong issue of dealing with their relationship, if we stay together.

I’m not a jealous type or insecure type of person. She is not the issue, he is the issue. She is perfectly nice person.

We study abroad and have been long-distance talking on and off for 9 months. He decided to drop out and pursue a different major in a different country, so he’s taking the semester off.

In the beginning, he made it very obvious that he liked me. He constantly complimented me, wanted to talk to me everyday, and gave me a gift only 2 weeks after we met. Now, I constantly feel like I'm chasing after him and hoping he'd talk to me. 

3 months ago, he went through some family issues and got back into therapy. I kept on checking up on him everyday and telling him that I'm there for him at all times, but I was also going through some health issues so after a while we lost contact for about a month. 

He came back, saying he's sorry and that he misses me 2 months ago, and we started talking again. He was diagnosed with OCD and said it would take at least 6 more months before he felt normal again, but that he's feeling better already. Talking to him again made me realise that I love and care for him more than I thought I did.

I booked a flight to go visit him for a couple of days during the upcoming Christmas break and he was so excited. He asked me to meet his mom and named off a long list of all the places he wanted to take me to. But then he disappeared. He kept posting on social media but all my messages were left unread. We had our first fight, where I told him that I felt like an afterthought but he assured me that its just his mental health taking a down turn again. I tried checking up on his a couple of times but all I got back was one word responses or nothing at all. 

It's been almost a month and I can’t sleep at night, I miss him all day, and I’m worried about him constantly. I’m also quite angry and I cry over the way he leaves me hanging sometimes. 

My friends are convinced he's just playing with me. They keep telling me to just block him and forget, because he's probably just bored of me but doesn't know how to say it. They say his OCD can't be that bad and that if he wanted to, he'd text me back. Are they right? 

I've never been in a relationship before so this is all new to me. My trip is in 5 weeks and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm not even sure he'll text me back if I do end up going.

It started off very casual. We met some times had a good time and just wrote between the days. It was very easy going without stress.

She comes out of an abusive relationship and told me that she needs her time for herself. She has many activities which she does not want to stop doing. Which I really respect but I have this feeling that I have no priority in her life at all.

End of august we both said that we’re now in a steady relationship.
At this time she had no real place to stay that’s why she was most of the time at my place. It was beautiful. Felt like family.

One month later she found a new place for herself and pulled herself more and more back. It was clear that her stay was just temporary.

Holiday time came around. We both went hiking together for some days. And at this point I really fell in love. She admitted that she feels love too.
After the hiking I went with some friends to London and absolutely hated it. I missed her, did not like this urban hell and wanted to return. Well, that’s what I did. I just bought a ticket back and went back to her.

Things started to change. She was more distant and was annoyed by my expectations to see each other more often.

I try not to force her but I really miss her and can’t understand why she doesn’t want to meet more often.

I (26M) have been friends with a girl (35F) for several years now. This girl is amazing. I've never met anyone like her. I thought about asking her out, but she has made two things pretty clear: she's not interested in another relationship, and she's not interested in sex. Mostly because she has pretty crippling trauma, so bad that she can't work, and is on some pretty heavy medications. She's told me before that her life plan is basically to live with her parents, and then move in with friends when they die. She doesn't ever see herself having a partner or kids. 

Now I'm actually in a similar boat. I'm autistic. As a result of sensory stuff, sex just isn't fun for me. I prefer to have fun on my own, as they say. Now I Do want a relationship, but... I'm pretty much in love with this girl. Head over heels. I can't imagine being with anyone else. And, I think most girls find me a bit too weird to date. I'm not willing to share a bed or a bedroom, I have very specific ways I do stuff, and again - no sex. 

And I've been thinking about talking to her about just marrying me platonically. No sex, no ""romance"", separate bedrooms. But - since I'm successful in my career - joint finances could mean I could take care of her, since she can't work. The idea of coming home to her every day sounds amazing, just to hang out and play video games and get high. I feel like I can be myself with her. I don't want anything to change, I don't want a romantic relationship with her (esp since she doesn't want one). 

I thought about just moving in together, and broached the topic with her, but she made it clear she wont ever be able to afford to pay rent or contribute, so she couldn't. I offered to pay her way, but she kinda brushed it off. I think as a pride thing, and that she doesn't want to be a burden to me. But I hope if I ask her to marry me, she won't mind me funding her life.

I guess I'm wondering if this sounds too crazy. I know if I bring this up with her it'll probably change the vibe of our friendship, one way or another.

We have met up a couple times ever since then as friends feeling out purely just our friendship still, since we both admit that we think of each other daily, and we are both in a massive period of transition in our lives (he is moving out of a house and is directionless of where he is going to live next or what to do (he is a dealer and has used it as a crutch for years and who is exiting that world hopefully soon because I was the one to inspire him to finally do so), and I am temporarily in a hotel awaiting my new apartment to be selected/locked down by the housing program which I have helping me get a place to live while I continue recuperating in Athens until I can get back to my old level of self-reliance and sustainability mentally, emotionally, and financially.

I was laid off, but he looked out for me and helped me find a new job. We started hanging out after work and became super close friends. 

It meant a LOT to me that he stayed and helped me find a new job. I was seriously struggling in a brand new city and he made sure I didn't do anything stupid, stayed focused, etc. It may not sound like a lot, but it was a LOT to me. **MORE** than *anything*!

We went out to a company party last weekend. We both got really drunk. We took the train back to my house and he helped me while I was sick from the drinking. It seemed juvenile, but I kept feeling really uneasy around M40 and kept ""looking over my shoulder"", so to speak. 

I spoke to my co-worker (f28) a few days later, mainly to apologize for being so drunk. She said it was fine but she was concerned about me (???) and M40. After we left the party, my co-worker kept texting/calling us to make sure I was OK. She was getting super creepy vibes from M40 and she felt M40 was getting too involved (staying the night, insisting to *everyone* that we were just friends, trying *way too hard* to control drunk me, etc.). 

My co-worker said ""we just tolerated him for the night because you insisted he was a good friend. But he's so creepy and like the dad friend. He wasn't drunk last night at all. It's so obvious that he's waiting for a pat on the back from you; he wants to !!!! you. A normal friend would drop you off at home and bring a trashcan before leaving.""

My drunk memories came back INSTANTLY. I remembered screaming at M40 (playfully) that he was lying about being drunk. M40 insisted that I needed a lot of care and ""no one else will do this for you"". He even crossed several boundaries and touched me (not sexually, but affectionately). I remember drunkenly thinking how much I hated it.

I feel like sober me has kept this firewall up around M40 and drunk me finally forced myself to see the situation for how it was. An older guy maintaining a super intimate relationship with a much younger woman and never asking for anything in return? CREEPY. 

Now I can't even talk to him when we see each other and I've avoided our usual after-work drinks. I'm so creeped out and I don't know how to deal with this. He helped me in the darkest point of my life and he's always been there. But now I suddenly feel manipulated...like he only did this to prove himself to me in ways that will never ever be reciprocated.

After they’d arranged to go back to local pub to have a drink for him. 
My ex was there and i knew he would be so naturally i was very nervous. we broke up a year ago, he left me on a random sunday after 2 n a half years. 
i’ve since moved on and i’m with the most amazing boy and we’ve been together since jan. (5 months after my ex left) 
we’ve been on holiday, family events, it’s just been amazing. 
i haven’t seen my ex since the day we broke up, no contact, no social media, nothing! not even bumped into him on the street or the local nightclub. 
so seeing him at this event obviously had me nervous. 
once me and the girls got back to the pub, we started drinking, i think in total between 3 of us we had 4 bottles of wine😬 
my ex was mature and came n said hi to me. i respected his maturity. then an hour later, his friends came n sat with my friends and we all started chatting (baring in mind we all went to school together so it was a nice catch up for everyone). 
when we was together, my ex suffered with a lot of mental health issues, and i used to be the only person he turned to. and if i was to seek help from anyone else, he’d go mental. so naturally i kept it to myself. 
at the pub, he opened up to me a little about how he still wasn’t 100% and i said if he genuinely needed anyone, i was there. that id rather him text me than someone else message and say he was no longer here. 
this only lasted an hour n a half max, and as we left the boys said they’ll walk us girls to the car. 
as i said goodbye to him, i reassured him again and repeated the same thing about me being there for him. i hugged him and as we pulled out the hug, his hands gripped round my back and he kissed me, i’m assumed to say i kissed back but it was only for a split second. quicker than a blink. 
i’ve told my boyfriend that he kissed me, but i can’t help but carry this guilt and shame. i feel like i’ve ruined our relationship and i want to rewind time.

He then also called another woman love and the rest of the messages showed him asking her why haven’t she ate and that she should send him her address so he can get her some pizza. He claims they were joking. Later in the conversation he asked for her number so “they can finish the conversation tomorrow 😊”. After he got her number he started asking her what she liked to do for fun and getting to know her in general.  I just don’t know how I feel. I feel like these kind of conversations lead to cheating.

Between the saved pictures and disregarding what I told him I wasn’t comfortable with I am seriously thinking about ending the relationship.

And I want her back in my life...
I might cry as i write this because i miss her so much. But I'll start w her background as well as mine

Her background- she is one of the most amazing person with a genuine heart and just her little things make me so happy. I love her and every thing about her. She has REALLY good story telling skills and i can never get bored of hearing her vent or rant. We laugh alot together make jokes..
Her background tho, i came to know slowly that she failed one of her high school classes and had to repeat. She was bullied by absolute pieces of shit and was called names. Her so called friends who would say they'd be friends forever left her... she was alone. She would miss her classes because she felt shame. None of which should have happened. She deserved so so so much better. She would tell me that she repeated class bc of some issue and i didn't doubt her. But one day she just felt really guilty and cried it out to me. She said my response felt nice to her. I never judge her and never would. She never judges me either. I should also add we live in a third world country. So doing normal things in our own life and sharing that w someone seems tabboo sometimes but i have shared everything w her and she has too. We have our boundaries ofc, i speak up if i am uncomfortable or i dont want to talk ab sth bc it is triggering me. But i feel she doesn't do the same. And ofc it's not her fault, it is difficult to be open. I am the way i am, i can't afford any miscommunication or hurt a person in a relationship without talking ab it, sorting it out.


My background- Ill really just start straight out w my traumas bc i feel like thats the thing making us clash. 
My mom died in may of 21 bc of corona. My bsf was my friend even before that, but we didn't talk for a month. Because i needed time to collect myself. 
My mom dying resulted in me getting diagnosed first with depression and anxiety, and at last bipolar.
Bc of that i have attachment issues, abandonment issues, Mood swings depressive episodes manic episodes all that bs 
i get paranoid as soon as i feel even a little vibe of a person i love leaving me or getting upset with me. 
And I very well know this is not healthy and i am currently working on it. Constantly in touch with my psychiatrist. 
Recently i met a boy, and he's my bf now. So unknowingly since it was the starting of a romantic relationship I stopped texting her as much. We had a fight over this as well. But i am the kind of person who wants to talk it through. Communicate. Meanwhile her response is to shut down and gulp it down. I never want her to feel that way. I love her so much, i dont want her hurting in any way deep inside. Or having misunderstandings in our relationship. 

The day before yesterday she came over to my place, which is sth we have to ask permission for from our parents. We wanted to have a sleepover. I had plans w my bf since it was weekend but i told him that and he said it was fine and i kind of felt guilty and sobbed bc i thought he was hurt but he reassured me it was fine. 

She came over and i was cleaning my mess of a bed while on call w my bf and we were very excited and stuff, i asked my bf if he wanted to meet her on call he said no, then i told him I'll talk later then.

I was brushing my teeth and i was talking to one of my friends whose text was left on delivered. I responded and said MY BSF IS OVER FOR SLEEPOVER!!!! they were really happy ab it and made some silly joke that i told to my bsf and we laughed ab it. I was on call w them telling them some stuff bc i was getting ready to settle down and i thought I'd just talk to them as i do that. I cut the call after i had freshened up. 

My bf suddenly called and said would you two like to meet at the tea stall near (my) place. I asked my bsf if she'd like to and asked again just to let her know that if she says no we wont go. 

She said yes and we met up w him. They were meeting for the first time and it somehow slipped out of my mind and i was just ...being myself saying some stuff. And she suddenly said ""she's not like this her personality changed suddenly w you lol"" 
And she has NEVER talked like that. So i looked at her and asked whispering why would you say that. Then she said i was about to cry by the way you were talking ab me. 
And by talking ab me it meant that i laughed at her for drinking her milkshake really slowly and said googoo gaga as in you drink like a kid. It was a small box and i finished mine so ..idk maybe i shouldn't have .but then i genuinely dont understand how that would offend her. 

She said leave it, but i pushed her so that we could have a good time and not sulk ab it. So we sorted it out. And had a great time together.

We went home and danced. We then decided to watch a movie as we ate. It was scary. And somehow.. that feeling of being scared mingled with my other fears and i started to feel unsafe, and like i might have a panic attack or anxiety attack. So i asked her can i call my bf. She said no, we will be alright...then i asked her again and she shook her head but i was so anxious that i ended up calling him and telling him to stay on call.

We paused the movie for a bit and my bsf seemed angry. So i asked if she was angry bc i called him and she said no, i explained why i needed to call him and she said ""now what can i say""

It hurt me alot i cut the call w my bf, and curled up and panic attack started. She didn't notice until i weakly called her name. I was panting really loudly and she froze for a second because she had NEVER seen me like this. 
My other friend (who is my ex as well) and my bf have seen me like that. 
So she didn't know how to handle me, i simply called my friend (my ex) and they calmed me down. She gave me water. And i calmed down. Then she had an anxiety attack and she said ""i should call my dad im never coming to your house."" 
I got scared. I was scared i scared her. This is the only fear i have bc of my mental illness. I cant burden people. With my new bf i didn't really tell him but we were on video call once and he saw me have a panic attack so it sort of broke that barrier and i didn't feel judged.
But her saying those things right after just made me paranoid. I repeatedly said you will be ok. Just go home in the morning. She sort of shouted ""obviously i will"" 
And i was stroking her arm trying to calm her down and she threw my hand away. 
She started crying and she vented ab how she feels distant from me. That i keep texting or calling other people. 
And i told her the truth. I told her i am not really comfortable regarding my mental health w you. It hurt her. Obviously. She said but it's such a big part of you.
I didn't even know how to tell her but however big it is, it is very very intimate.

My other bsf has no idea ab it either. My sister slapped me 5 times on the cheek when i had a breakdown in front of her. My father barely knows the extent. After telling her all this, i said take it as you will.

I told her you have trust issues with our relationship. I value you so much. And i genuinely do not understand how i am hurting her. 
She told me to put myself in her shoes and tell me how it feels. I told her my people, my friends are very valuable to me. Idek how to explain this but they hold different important parts and make me stable. And that if that i wouldn't mind if she did the same thing. I love her still and i wont ever leave her. 

I went spiraling after that, warned her what happens now, i said I'll say random stuff repeatedly but I'll be fine. She was scared, i could tell. But she trying her best to make me feel better, altho it felt very bookish. 
I didn't want her to see me like that. I felt guilty i had a panic attack in front of her. She doesn't deserve to be burdened by all this. Also her being one yr younger than me makes me feel protective of her idk.

But since then...she has taken a break, its been almost 2 days. It feels like a heartbreak where your heart physically hurts. How do i help our relationship get back on track? Am i rushing it too soon? Or am i being too pushy?


TLDR- my bsf has abandonment issues where she pushes people away before they leave bc of her past and i have the same issues but i communicate and try to solve it. My mental health is sensitive topic and not sth i shared w her bc i felt she didn't need to be burdened by all this and also i was somewhat scared she would leave me. After seeing me have a panic attack and seeing me spiral, she said she needed a break. And she says she doesn't feel the same way she did before w us, like i have changed but i have no idea how to figure out what has changed in me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7547480,public,self,My bestfriend (f19) took a break from me (f20) after seeing me having a panic attack,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yv5xog/my_bestfriend_f19_took_a_break_from_me_f20_after/,all_ads,6,,

His son was almost 2 when we were together. He was almost 6 when we separated due to his father being a serial cheater and I couldn’t take it anymore. My ex has full custody of him since his real mother lost her rights when he was only 1 year old. I’m really the only person he knew as mom. I broke him from the bottle, potty trained him, took care of him day in and day out, he was treated just like my son.  

During our relationship we had two daughters together who are now 8 and 6 years old. When we parted ways I have physical custody of the girls and he has visitation. He works out of state 6 days a week so he sees them when he comes back to town. He stopped contact with me for his son saying he wanted him to bond with his wife. They have been married for 5 years now. I assumed he told his son about his real mom years ago. 

Today my ex’s wife, my kids step mom called me to tell me her car broke down and asked me to pick her up along with my ex’s son and the child they have together. I pulled up with my youngest child that I had in my current marriage he’s 2. 

While ex’s wife was dealing with the car seat for her child my ex’s son got into the car with me and we were chatting about school. He’s been acting out quite a bit and was removed from school at one point for behavior. He looked at my youngest son and called him “baby brother” I was confused at first and asked if he was referring to his brother that was being taken from the car. He said no and was referring to my son. He said he knew I was his real mom and he didn’t understand why I left him to live with his dad and took his sisters. He wanted to come live with his sisters and me again. 

This poor child is absolutely confused and feels like I abandoned him. I’m pretty sure this is one of the causes for his poor behavior. I am going to bring this up with his father to have a talk with him because I don’t want him to think I just left him and didn’t want him anymore. I don’t want him to have long term issues over this. I really thought his father had told him about his mother and didn’t just let this go on for so long.

She's amazing and I'm really starting to fall for her. I really want to ask her to be my girlfriend but I'm a little worried it might be too soon.

There are a couple things that make me hesitate. The first is the existence of our dating profiles. I haven't deleted mine yet but I haven't used it since we started dating. When do people usually delete these? I'm guessing a few weeks after being official bf/gf. Should have have the 'exclusively dating' conversation before I ask her out?

I also hesitate because she's hard to read. She's very practical and direct when speaking. She grew up going to a strict catholic school and is now a lawyer and I can definitely see it when she speaks, but it makes it a little hard to read her emotions. She is also a very practical texter and usually takes her time to get back to me. We discussed love languages and she told me that she has a hard time giving words of affirmation. We both agree that we tend to favor quality time and acts of service.

So next week I have a cocktail party to attend at a 5 star hotel. I’m allowed to bring one my friend.  During college days we were very close and mean together chilling and laughing around. After college no contact. No after 3 years we met again and I got to know through our mutual friend she had a big time crush on me and liked me a lot too. We recently had a great time and had lot’s of talk too. 

Now, the real thing which scares me a bit. During college days I was a fit muscular gym later I had an injury and now I don’t have that muscular body but looks and the funny natures is still the same ( my natural character). We have recently met only when our mutual friend was in Mumbai. 


I need suggestions on how to ask her out for the party and what should I tell her. What makes me overthink is in 3 years we both have changed a lot and must have had different opinions. She is single too and is very comfortable and friendly with me. But never been with her alone.  

Please guys suggest me and give me some tips. If any girl is reading this please suggest me through your perspective too. 

I really wanna be with her to explore the future opportunities. Cheers 🥂!",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7547447,public,self,Need help to ask my crush out for a party.

We are both divorced. I've been divorced for 6 months (out of a 3-year marriage), and she's been divorced for nearly 2 years (out of a 10-year relationship, 3 of those years married). 

She came out of a pretty toxic marriage, her ex-husband cheated on her many times and just exhibited a lot of toxic behavior (never followed through with his actions, and she eventually forced him to marry her via ultimatum). She originally wanted to divorce, changed her mind, and tried to make things work, but then he didn't want it and proceeded to divorce her instead. She was the one who ultimately got dumped.   


As for my previous marriage, it was mostly healthy, we just had some issues we couldn't resolve and ultimately things ended between us. I wasn't the greatest husband in the world, but, I came to terms with it and accepted it.

So with that background, this is where my resentment is coming from, I feel like she's constantly comparing me to her ex-husband to some degree. 

An example, I visited her family for the first time, and things went really well. They like me a lot and everything, however, she called me that same day later in the day and talked to me about a few things. She had mentioned that I seemed somewhat relatively quiet amongst her family and such. She was seeking advice from her sister-in-law about it.  She told me she told her sister-in-law she wasn't sure if it was a ""me"" problem or her problem.

So she proceeded to tell me how energetic and engaging her ex-husband was compared to me with her family and everything else. That he had a very bubbly personality and made everyone laugh. I'm not the most bubbly person on the planet, and I do try my best to engage with everyone. I told her I'd work on engaging more with the family since it was important to her.

Another example, sometimes when we hang out I'm not always very talkative. I don't like to force conversation and I do sincerely enjoy her company in silence sometimes. This, however, seems to bother her, she told me how she used to be the quiet one and that her ex-husband was always engaging her in conversation. Again being compared here woohoo... 

We generally do have good conversations with each other, but there are plenty of times we don't have much to say to each other. I told her it's normal to sometimes enjoy each other in silence and it's not a bad thing. One of the things we noticed from the get-go is we have very strong similar core values, which to me is so important. However the superficial interests (music and whatnot) are vastly different, which doesn't bother me, lets me really learn more and fall in love with the things that she likes.

She also mentioned that she had amazing chemistry with her ex-husband due to his personality but their core values did not align whatsoever (she didn't realize this till after the divorce). I feel like she feels this is the opposite with me, we have aligned strong core values and the chemistry while not as intense as with her ex-husband is slowly building and not as fiery as she was probably expecting. 

Part of me feels she's not really 100% over her ex-husband, she claims to be over him, did a ton of therapy, and whatnot. A lot of times we talk about our past marriage and she gets really choked up by how he treated her sometimes. She says she is still working through some of the trauma. She says when I talk about what I went through that I don't seem to get upset or cry about it, but, I tell her I did my work on moving on, which is why I don't get emotional about it.  


She mentioned there was an opportunity to get back with him way before I had met her, and, she ultimately decided that it was best for her not to do so. He wanted her back pretty badly and she refused his offer.

Lately, the comparisons she voiced have been stuck in my head and now I feel like I'll never live up to her ex-husband. I feel like she's trying to find the same things her ex-husband had (personality) but with the qualities I have. It's causing me to build resentment and I feel like its put a strain on our relationship. I'm not even excited anymore.  


She does mention all the ways I'm so much better than her ex-husband like it's night and day in how I treat her, respect her, love her and how I follow through with my actions.  


As for how she treats me generally though, she's great, very confident, mature in many ways, thoughtful, and also lets me know how well I treat her and shows her appreciation for my affection, intentions, and seriousness. I can see a future with her, but, the resentment I'm feeling is also pulling me away. I'm trying to work through that resentment and I haven't said anything to her about itit.

- New account cause my fiancée knows mine 
- formatting is a mess cause I’m on mobile 

Alright, let’s get straight to it. Me (29M) and my fiancée (F28) are childfree by choice. This is important to note. It was a requirement for our relationship ever since we started dating 8 years ago. 

Her mother (51F) is very conservative and didn’t take it well she won‘t be getting grandchildren. From what my fiancée told me, her mother is very controlling and manipulative. 
Now, that she finally came to accept the fact we won’t have children, she proposed to my partner that she would like her to surrogate so she could raise another child and that my fiancée would „owe her this, since she‘ll never experience being a grandmother“. 

What bothers me the most is: she is seriously considering it. She asked me to „donate“ with her to her parents, so they get off her back about grandchildren. 
I told her that while she was free to do with her body whatever she wants, I would not stay with her if she decided to follow through with this. 

All of this would be unofficial, there would be no legal adoption involved and I firmly believe it’s a ploy of her mother to pull out last second and force us to raise a child. 
And even if it isn’t: we would still be the ones legally responsible. And ofc, since MIL isn’t the youngest anymore, who knows what happens if something happens to her? 

It hurts me to say this but I‘m not willing to take this risk. And even with my partner having a sperm donation I don’t feel comfortable marrying someone who‘s technically becoming a parent. 
My fiancée won’t budge and I‘m afraid this is the end of our relationship. 
She‘s furious that I think her mother is trying to trick us and went to stay with her mother for now. Is there any way to safe this?

If I’m being honest, both of us don’t look the same from when we first started dating. We’ve both have gained some weight and have changed our appearance and style over time. This past year was a big accomplishment for us, as we got our first apartment together, signing our first lease together. 

I honestly don’t know what it is, but I am not physically attracted to her as much as when we first started dating. The attraction isn’t as strong anymore as when I first met her. 

The problem is I am very much still emotionally in love with her. I love that she’s always there for me when I need her, and she’s supportive of what I do. And that we have so many things in common that we like to do.  

As times goes on, I have a feeling that she knows that I am loosing physical attraction to her. As she sometimes asks me, “are you sure your still attracted to me”?

I love her a lot, and I tell her this frequently. Whenever I see something she does that's particularly cute or when she's wearing her hair a certain way etc I make sure to point it out and say how it makes her look beautiful or majestic, whatever the case may be. I try to give specific compliments and an outpouring of affection because my dad never did that with my mom and I want to be a better boyfriend/fiance/husband than he was.

But my girlfriend really struggles with accepting my compliments. She refuses me almost always, saying she's not pretty, saying she's ugly, and saying she's useless. (She's incredibly talented and just this year earned a master's degree). I tried to fight this with unending support and love, I tell her i love watching her work and I love listening to her nerd out about her interests but she still questions me about whether or not I'm bored or annoyed with her.

We've talked a lot about our pasts, and we both have childhood trauma related to bullying, familial abuse and relationship abuse, so i 100% understand where her insecurities are coming from. In my previous relationships, i was the one never accepting affection and fighting back. I know it's a defense mechanism.

The worst moments are when she's feeling depressed. I'll tell her all the things I love about her and she will say that I ""can do better"". I really don't like when she says this. She is by far the best person I've ever dated and I love her more than anyone I've ever been romantically involved with. But I don't know how to fight this statement with love and support. ""You can do better"". How am I supposed to refute that? I told her about my exes hoping she would understand that it's not true but it's not helped.

I would like to know if anyone has any tips on how to approach this situation. She asked me about this post while I was writing it so she knows I'm posting it. I would just like to know how best to love her and show support. She says I'm really nice to her but I want her to realize that the love I show her is the bare minimum and that she deserves it. I also want her to realize that my love is genuine and that I would do anything for her, and that this is what she should, and anyone should, expect out of a relationship.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7547395,public,self,Her negative self image is starting to hurt our relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yv5m68/her_negative_self_image_is_starting_to_hurt_our/,all_ads,6,,

I struggle daily. Lost my career, my job, broke but still trying. I’m not giving up. But since it happened I’ve been slowly iced out, relatives ghosting and I’ve also heard I’ve become the laughing stock in the family. Whenever they meet up, they all make fun of me. Tbh, that’s the least of what they’ve done, I’ve been called every name in the book to my face, constant abuse, constant gas lighting, constant arguing and belittling. I’ve been told that no one cares about me so many times I’ve lost count. And when I tell any other relatives, they say I’m being sensitive or I’m just a burden on the family and should be on the streets anyway. And this past month there have been major family parties and events and I was completely left out and specifically singled out and not invited. 

I’ve worked my hardest to be apart of this family. I know what you’re going to say, they are abusive and that I deserve better - I know, I agree. I guess I always had this hope that I would be accepted but finally, this week - I’ve come to terms that I may as well have been born an orphan. It just…sucks. I thought I was ok with this, I thought I was done and ready to move on, if not physically and literally, at least mentally. 

But this week has been really tough and I don’t know why it hurts as much as it does. And I still care for them. I know they don’t care about me but I can’t stop worrying about my parents and if they will be OK. If I leave, I’ll be homeless so I have to stick it out but tbh, I think being homeless on the streets without the abuse may actually be easier than living this life. 

Has anyone been through this? Any advice.
