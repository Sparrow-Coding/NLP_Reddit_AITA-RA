I would end up hanging out with them a couple more times that summer and making good memories. These people were into all of the things I was and life was great.

I developed a small crush on my friend back then. This was back before I had any real dating experience besides my first girlfriend. I was awkward and asked her on a date and it just ended with an awkward hug. So I figured she probably doesn’t like me. Later, I would go on to meet other women (and one toxic one).

This was around when COVID hit and I didn’t really get a chance to see my friend again. I just kept seeing random women until I was sick of that lifestyle. I tried one last time to see if she would like to hang out but she was so busy (she’s has A LOT of friends). So I moved on, and I met my gf who I have been with for 1.5 years.

My relationship with my girlfriend has been awesome. We are similar in a lot of ways, the same aspirations but different interests. We have our ups and downs, but our communication skills are top notch. We never come out of fight without knowing the love we have for one and another.

My gf knows my dating history and the friend I’m mentioning. I have seen my friend only once since COVID at another concert (same band we met at) and I was just with other friends. When we were catching up I mentioned I am with someone and it wasn't a big deal. I tried to invite her whole crew for a party too at some point. Well since that, I haven't really heard from her.

I do not text her often, I am usually busy with my roommates or girlfriend. But I am a people person and try to hit up all my friends occasionally. I also really hate when people are mad at me. So that brings us to the issue. I texted her a while back for an invitation I missed and got no reply. It was her bday a couple days ago and sent her a belated wish. She said thanks and hope I am doing well. And then I said ""everything is pretty routine, how are you doing?"" and I do not think she will reply.

My gf offered the idea that she might not want to talk to me because maybe she thinks I am only talking to her to ""keep her in my back pocket"" incase I am single or something. But I swear it is not like that. I hate how there is a stigma between a guy and girl being a friend. If this is the case I feel like a teenager with these games people are assuming. Its like you can't be friends unless you see each other as siblings or something. I have another girl-friend like that who does remind me of a sister but I talk to her occasionally as well. I am not sure if she thinks like this or she is busy.

If she is busy I do not know how to approach the situation. Asking someone if they are mad at you usually comes off as needy or annoying in my experience.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7614718,public,self,I (24M) don't think my friend (24F) wants to talk to me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1xnjx/i_24m_dont_think_my_friend_24f_wants_to_talk_to_me/,all_ads,6

Im tired, it’s draining me that she always wants to fight and yes i am writing she wants to

I drive to visit her (as our schedule because of school) every Wednesday until Thursday morning and Friday until Monday morning

Monday, Tuesday and Thursday Im home with my parents, cat and my gaming pc. My girlfriend always wants me to come over and she gets mad everytime I say I can’t
For example today she was mad I could not, I had early free so she thought oh yeah he can just drive 45km to me and then wake up at 6 tomorrow morning to drive 45km to his school and then after that back to me again (since it’s Wednesday tomorrow so we meet)

I told her I could not, I had a barber schedule and she gets mad at me, and we don’t talk

Other times I tell her I just wanna spend some time with my parents and she gets mad and says that I just play on my pc anyway in my house. Which is true but atleast I’m with my parents sorta and eat dinner with them and can help them

I’m too scared to say I just want some free time because it might hurt her and I don’t want to do that

But it’s draining me. Everytime I’m with her I have to wake up early and I’m already sleep deprived which causes me to fall asleep in the weekends where she gets mad at me for falling asleep early.  Then she says I can just go sleep when I’m home instead of playing on my pc.
I just want some free time to relax and play 

I’m just so tired

Idk what to do. I’m going to have a talk with her tomorrow (Wednesday) because I think this is really toxic and it’s draining my energy and I constantly just wanna cry and cut off the world

Usually when she got mad I would spam call her and text her. I stopped that now because I’m so tired and now she even gets mad at me and tells me I don’t care about her because I won’t spam call her

Even though when I used to spam call her I would just get a cold shoulder anyway.

I was really excited, blew off a work project, got new heels, a dress, and was excited to be wined and dined. I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. My mom told me NOT to ask him. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay. I panicked about being left with the whole bill.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

**TLDR:** Guy bullied me into paying and I was really really shocked and unsure how to handle it. How do I avoid this happening again? my mom said it would have been rude to ask upfront if he was paying and i wasted my time and feel terrible and traumatized. I feel really awful and I think most girls would have complained or spoken up but I had no idea what to do.

I (30F) think I need to leave my (36M) husband. We've been together for 3 1/2 years, married for the last 8 months. We met at work. Our first six months of dating were great, then I found out that he had been talking to other women behind my back. I view that as cheating, he doesn't. We broke up for about 2 months before deciding to get back together. Since then, he has been in and out of jail and rehab, for drug use, constantly lieing to me about being clean, blows his whole paycheck on dumb sh*t or at casinos, and has put us in severe financial difficulties and I have been by his side the whole time, trying to supporting him, trying to help him stay sober and learn how to manage his money, and defending him to both his family and mine. He has this bad habit of self-sabotoge right before he graduates from rehab and gets kicked out. He's been in therapy (still is) but it hasn't really been helping. Of course, he'd actually have to want it to help instead of because he has to go. I try to take control of our finances and make sure our bills get paid and he tells me I'm being a controlling b*tch. I ask for half his paycheck to go towards bills, and he can do whatever he wants with the rest, and I'm a controlling b*tch. The whole time we've been together, he's paid for maybe 4 months worth of rent and utilities. I paid for everything else. I recently lost my job, and although everyone around here says they're hiring, I've yet to get a new one. Since I lost my job, my husband has wasted no time in belittling me and criticizing me for ""not contributing my share"" and since I'm not working I ""should act like a proper housewife and do all the cooking and cleaning."" This guy even wants me to plate his food and bring it to him in bed. He calls me rude names, disregards my thoughts and feelings, and lords whatever money he gives me for bills or groceries over my head, like I should be grateful to him for giving me anything, even though it goes towards both of our benefits. I spent over $3000 on him my last month at work and never once said anything about him needing to pay me back for it, much less everything I've spent on rent, groceries, gas, car insurance and phone bills over the last 3 years. And God forbid I say no to sex. Dude throws a tantrum like a toddler and refuses to pay for anything we might/do need unless I have sex with him. Most of the time, I give in and say yes just so he'll shut up for a few minutes and give me some piece and quiet. He says since we're married, he can do whatever he wants with me,  whenever he wants. Because ""what's the point of being married if we can't bang whenever he wants"". I don't even get a break on my periods, because if I don't ""put out"" he'll start hitting up random chicks he meets online. And I do try to keep up with the housework, but I  have chronic depression and anxiety, PTSD from a previous abusive relationship, and absolutely loathe being a housewife and I procrastinate on doing a lot of the cleaning. Could I do better with the house work while I'm home? Yes. But that doesn't excuse his attitude and behavior. Should I put in the effort to maintain a clean home for a man who clearly doesn't respect me? Not in my opinion. I've tried to leave before, and he literally barricaded the door so I couldn't. I'm not sure what to do or how to get out. There's a small part of me that believes he may end up hurting me (more than the emotional hurt he's already caused) one day if I don't leave, or kill me if I do leave. I know, logically, I should just load up my vehicle and drive away while he's at work but I'm not in a position financially to do so. I have nowhere to go and no one to help.

I never thought that I could love someone as much as I love him and what drew me to him the most was his sense of responsibility and his always wanting to build a strong future for us as a couple. Our relationship was founded on the principle that we push each other always to do and be better. 

I never had any doubts about our relationship despite the disapproval of some of my closest friends who always found him too macho or controlling. Before I moved out of the city i went through one of the hardest times of my life, I was severely depressed and was losing a lot of people in my life but he really stood by me and supported me through all of it which proved to me even more that I couldn't give him up. 

Anyways fast-forward to this week, where we got into this massive fight about what pictures i should post on my Instagram and in what order. its not the first time we've argued about this, bare in mind we almost never argue at all, and i just find the whole thing ridiculous honestly. He takes it as me not trusting him, or relying on him while he wants to be my mentor and guide me into building a good future for myself and for us. While I'm just like I'm not going to fail in life nor does it mean i don't love you just because i don't love the pictures of myself that you love. 

the argument blew up and he started telling me things like I'm sucking the life out of our relationship, that I'm boring to talk to and too sensitive, and that if I'm not careful he was going to stop talking to me for days. all of which i just found extremely hurtful at first because days before i told him that i was feeling insecure and he made me feel like it was about that and i wish he would've chosen his words more carefully. i went from hurt to angry and impatient because i know I'm not perfect but i cant find it within myself to keep justifying this behavior. no amount of nice words will make me forget the shitty things you said to me in anger to hurt me especially if it worked!!

i considered and am still considering risking my relationship with my parents just to spend the rest of my life with him. He gave so many blows to my self-esteem constantly telling me that i need to grow an ass or eat and workout in a certain way to please him but never is the conversation about what i wanted from him or out of all of this. i am so angry i just want him to be angry enough to just give up because I'm struggling to even though the back and forth is so tiring. 

i don't know if i need to muster up the courage to break up with him or if this is something we can workout and move past, i don't know how to deal with this anger cause he hasn't apologized or recognized his fault in this. to him i fucked up by asking him if i should post x picture instead of y picture and because of that I'm ruining us. i dont know what to do because i dont want to be like him either and say things just to hurt him even if they may be true.

When I was over at Jake's house for dinner last sunday, I overheard my SIL talking about me to someone over the phone. She was telling them about how I had the gall to tell Jake to take the sofa away without thinking about how he's supposed to move it or how it would fit into their tiny house or how it'd be a money-losing business just so I can get rid of it in peace. She said I take their house as a garbage disposal bin and would always rub it in Jake's face that I make significantly more than him, that I'm a narcissist and neat freak, and that if she was the one who made the kind of money I make, she'd never let her siblings live in poverty. Shame on me and a bunch of other things. 

Anyway, I stayed calm at the time, said goodbye to Jake and went my way. After thinking about it, I decided to see where  stands he with this. So I called him and asked whether he told his wife about the sofa. He said why, did you hear something? And I was like, dude just asnwer. He said that yeah he told her I wanted him to take the sofa and he refused to take it. 

I then said listen, I heard her badmouthing me to someone over the phone the other day and it's not cool. I was about to tell him what I overheard when he interrupted me and said that he knows, she badmouths me to him too. He said that he never told me anything because he didn't want any hard feelings between us. He said that she just doesn't like me and anything I do would be criminal in her eyes. He told me not to take it to heart and that she's like that to almost everybody. 

Anyway, in the end I told him listen just know that I won't be going over to your house in the future if she's there and he was cool with it. 

Now why I'm here is because idk what to make of his reaction. He's my bro, I can't imagine how he's been listening to this woman's bs and tolerating it for so long, nor how he would bring up me offering the sofa in conversation if he knows she doesn't like me. Right?

(26M-24F; Not engaged or married). We moved in together for the first time this year and about 6 months ago I felt he was acting really strange (in the sense of always being on his phone, his attitudes, how he was acting towards me), and after he got home from work one night we were having dinner together and he's on his phone and he gets a call. He was acting weird and didn't answer and he said it was a coworker calling him about some paperwork and I told him why didn't you just answer then? He replied that he shouldn't have to because he's already off work and he's with me so she shouldn't even be calling first of all. That whole situation just made me have a weird gut feeling that something was going on. I normally do not go through his things and I do not like to either, I like to know that I can trust the other person enough to not go to that extent but I felt that I just needed to. The next day I go through his computer and he still had his Facebook open and low and behold he was searching up a bunch of girls and he was sending screnshots of their profiles to his friends and typical videos of girls half naked dancing. He didn't have any messages with girls from what I know of in Facebook at least. It went on like that for a week until I confronted him and he completely denied EVERYTHING. He went from saying it was old stuff, that the time was wrong, that he didn't do it, etc. I know it was complete bs because we have been in this exact situation before, him searching up other women and watching these videos. I've told him time and time again that it hurts me and I do not like him doing that. I thought he had stopped, but he's still doing it. I also found a 20 page porn list that he has and girls Instagram and names. I know every guy probably watches porn but what bothers me is that he would always claim that porn was disgusting, he never got off with it, and most shockingly he used to shame me when I told him I used to watch it and would accuse me that I still did it. Again he said that stuff wasn't recent and why didn't I just delete it, that he doesn't care about those videos and that they're old. (He didn't delete them after I told him). I decided to try and give him another opportunity because we literally just moved in this year together but I just cannot with this anymore. I cannot find a way to just ""let it go"" or ""forget about it"" like he says. He says that this is the first time this has happened and I know it isn't. We has arguments about this plenty of times. If it was a 1 time thing and he stopped doing it when I asked then OK I can move on of course. But this is too much, he's not respecting my boundaries and just hiding stuff from me. I have lost all trust in him but he still wants to be together and doesn't want me to leave. Thats a whole other problem now. I know that if I move back to my parents home I would have to deal with him messaging me all the time and showing up unannounced. And I cannot afford to rent an aparment and just disappear, we have vechiles that belong to us both and other things so I cannot just leave and block him. He also makes me feel guilty saying and turning things around on me saying that I don't want to be together with him because I don't love him and I clarify it's not because of that it's because he keeps doing the same bs he's done before but like I said he claims that this is the first time. And he says that I'm now trying to find any excuse to leave him.

It felt like way too much, way too expensive, and I don't even really wear jewelery! I have it but I barely wear any of it. And it's never over 20$. Or it was given to me.

It accidentally broke and I just don't have the money to get it fixed right now. So I already still have a necklace to wear all the time. It was a small orange gem with gold and a small gold chain, very beautiful. But now he's bought a 300$!!!! Guys, 300$!! Now I am very grateful that he thought of me but that could have gone to bills! Or cat stuff?? Or anything else that we need, I don't need a 300$ necklace.

at the beginning of our relationship he would constantly compare me to her (always saying i was “better” in some way, but it still made me super uncomfortable). he had frequent communication with her mother (and would even get money from her sometimes) but said it was because she was like a mother to him for so many years. as we’ve lived together, i’ve also noticed he’s kept a lot of belongings from his past relationship. i’m not an insecure person at all, but all of this has made me borderline paranoid, especially since his stories about that relationship (how it started, ended, etc) have changed a lot.  it’s almost like i feel him thinking of her sometimes, especially since he’s told me damn near every thing she likes, from her favorite movie to her favorite foods. i almost resent his dog just by the amount of stories he’s told me about her with the dog. he doesn’t mention her nearly as much anymore, but will sometimes mention things we should do together that i know they did together (either because he told me or i’ve seen on her social media) which makes me feel super weird. i’ve expressed before that i felt like i was living in her shadow, and he told me he only thinks of her when i mention her and basically that i’m obsessed and need to let it go. 

he swears he’s over her and i thought all of this was getting better, but last night he randomly mentioned how he wanted to get tattoos dedicated to each other. he was drunk and i was clearly hesitant about the idea and let him kinda take over the conversation, which he then led to what his birth month flower was (a violet) and that i should get one of those tattooed on me. as he’s looking up photos of tattoos of violets and showing them to me, it hit me like a freight train: i’ve seen a tattoo like this before. on his ex girlfriend’s social media. because she has a half sleeve of violets. 

the whole interaction made me so uncomfortable and i’ve literally been sick to my stomach since. i’m sure if i were to say something, he would say it’s just a coincidence and that i’m crazy. but why the f*ck would he ask me to get the same tattoo his ex has? is he doing it on purpose to fuck with my head or is he a creep? and why is he seemingly obsessed with their relationship/me taking her place? am i crazy? what do i do???",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7614574,public,nsfw,boyfriend tried to get me to get same tattoo as his ex girlfriend ???,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1x2ke/boyfriend_tried_to_get_me_to_get_same_tattoo_as/,promo_adult_nsfw,3

And I really hope I'm placing this in the correct sub.  


So I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (31M), who moved countries for me, for almost four years. I have been in 2 previous relationships before him, but I quickly came to the realisation that I am asexual and I'm actually completely.... confused in a relationship.   
My mother, who is not really worthy of the title, is capable of pushing so much doubts in my head that I'm now litteraly afraid for losing him.   
And I dont know where to ask for this kind of advice.   
And yes, I will also be talking to my bf later about this, but I also would love some help and tips.   


So my mother was saying that I have to do more my best for him.   
For example.   
I am a stubborn person with a muscle illness and I should not be carrying heavy stuff. Now I am home because of this and I do the shopping. Incluiding the drinks. I will carry this upstairs regardless, even if my boyfriend says to leave it in the garage. Again, I'm stubborn and just don't want to bother him.   
My mother says I need to make him 'feel useful'. Play a bit weak and dumb so that he would stay.   
Another thing she brought up was that he would get sick of me if I don't keep the bedroom interesting. So do more things that are not just standard.   
Now with my asexuality I litteraly have no clue about this, nor am I jumping at the idea....   
She also says I am deciding too much in my relationship.   
I for example, like planning things out. Coming weekend his parents, nephew, brother and SIL are coming here and I have litteraly made entire day planning of us going to the zoo that day, and to a chocolate museum that day.... And I should just.... generally play more dumb to keep him interested. 

And then she confused me completely out that I need to get sexy lingerie to keep his interest, start things up, etc. or he will eventually cheat on me.   
Now again, I am basically blind on these parts.   
I read so often indeed that men want their women to act sexy and like a bit ""catty"" in the bedroom?   
How much of this is true? 

Do I really need to fear losing my boyfriend because I am too stubborn and too planny, and not ideal bedroom material?   
Will he lose his interest if I don't spice up the bedroom? And act weak? And act dumb?

I (30 m) have been married to my wife (27 f) for 6 months just about. We got married earlier this year and everything has been great so far. We recently started having small arguments that have had a significant effect on me. The arguments have been about where to live. I currently live in MD just south of Baltimore City. My wife moved in with me after we got married. She is from Pennsylvania and has a very close knit family and a large family too. 

I have to work in MD and VA so staying south of Baltimore is important for me but at the same time I'm very safety/security conscious and Baltimore is the complete opposite of safe and secure. I have mentioned to my wife that I want to live in VA but she said that she will move if I get a job that requires me to move there and it's a significant pay bump and she won't be happy. She says she won't be happy because it's too far from her parents house (~3 hours). 

I have brought this up to her family too and everyone always tells me that I'm taking her too far away and her parents said you can go there if you want us to not come visit as often. I was extremely upset when they said that because I love them more than my own parents. They have done so much for me and loved me more than my parents have and for that I can never repay them. 

I think our future is brighter there but my wife only seems to think that I'm doing this to take her farther away. I was talking to her cousin and she saw our conversation and got upset with me because she said that I'm bad mouthing her family to other people. I just told her cousin my view. 

I feel like everyone is going to take her side. She's their blood. I have no one. I don't want to go to my family because of another long story that I don't want to get into here but basically they didn't want us getting married and I fought with them for 3 years to get married to my wife. 

I also feel like this is our life and I should be able to do whatever I want without having to worry about being manipulated. I feel like it's emotional black mail to to tell me that I can't move to VA unless I don't want my in-laws visiting. Everyone someone in her family makes remarks about how far we already live (~2.5 hours) it just makes me feel shitty. I understand they're very close and I have no problem with them visiting whenever. We are already at my in laws house basically every weekend. When they tell me not to move it crushes my dreams and hopes for a better life and career. 

My wife has a lot of restrictions about where we can and can't live so we are very limited and then adding the distance requirement just leaves is with no options. We are renting an apartment for about 3100 a month now because this is the only place that meets both our criteria.

I just don't know how to explain to her that her family means a lot to me, I love her and them, in want us to be in their lives and them in ours but I also want to do what's best for our future without feeling shitty about it.

I really did put in a lot of time, money, and energy trying to impress him and be good company.

I didn't ask him about whether he was paying and expected him to pay since he asked me out. When the bill came, he just gave me a blank stare. I asked him if he was taking care of it and he just said ""No"".

I got visibly upset and he started bragging about other women that wanted him, then threatened to get up and leave if I didn't pay. I panicked about being left with the whole bill.

He said we could split it and we both put in our cards. Turns out, he had actually LOCKED his card. The waitress came back and said ""I'm really sorry, his card didn't work"" and she told me my card got charged for BOTH meals.

Wanting to be ""nice"", I didn't complain, I just said that's okay and signed the check, but I'm wondering if this was my legal obligation. Can I complain to the restaurant?

I feel as though it was not fair he bullied me into paying for him and I got screwed over for trying to be a good person and pay my share out of respect for the restaurant, even though it was a date HE asked me on. But then the restaurant charged me for BOTH meals because this guy locked his card.

The guy also seemed very, very pleased with himself that he didn't need to pay and wouldn't leave a tip either, so I had to put down the little cash I had (20) too. It was 100 for both plus tip and this guy refused to pay anything and bullied me into paying for him by locking his card. I'm not sure what else I could have done and feel really bad about the whole thing. Could I have asked to only pay for myself?

ALSO: since my house was down the street from the restaurant, I stupidly let him talk me into ""walking me home"" and then when we got to my door, he said he had to use the bathroom so I stupidly let him inside. He then took his shoes off and tried to stay, and I had to kick him out. Thankfully my 30 year old roommate was there, so the guy sheepishly left when he realized another man was in the house, but I'm worried something terrible could have happened. I'm kind of shocked at my naivety looking back. Could he have bullied me into segs too if my roommate wasn't there?

For a bit of background I’m Nigerian and we’re very traditional/cultural. Parents usually act and believe we owe them our life and they can’t ever be wrong- even if we both know they are it’s disrespectful to bring it up or acknowledge it e.t.c So even if they hurt your feelings or are in the wrong you’re expected to stay quiet and let them rant while still putting the blame on you. Basically never talk back at adults always stay quiet e.t.c this is how most of us are brought up. Like we were raised just to take care of them in the future or be their insurance plan. Needless to say I have a lot of resentment towards them that I can’t even fully express to them.

I’m the first child (24f) and I have 3 siblings. I’ve always been responsible for them and we have a great relationship and have each other’s back mostly. We basically always just rant to each other and console ourselves whenever our parents does something hurtful- I’m not going to go into details but I can give examples in the comments if they’re needed, I hope I’m not starting to digress.

It happened last night. I got married April this year and started living with my husband. Relationship is so strained with my parents that we hate visiting - my siblings always come over to see me instead when we hang out, but we drop them home after. We come in to say hi about 2 to 3 times a month just to fulfill our duty and avoid more nagging and drama. I’m 6 months pregnant and my siblings accompanied us to go baby shopping so we dropped them home after and decided to come to say hi quickly and get it over with. 

I came and said hello, good evening so did my husband. My mum turned to acknowledge me and we smiled and I greeted her personally again. My dad never turned to even acknowledge us and was pretending to focus on the shoes my brother bought. At this point I was irritated because he was clearly giving me attitude so I just sat down chatted with my mum and ignored him. I’m pretty stubborn myself I admit. My mum was like won’t you go greet your dad? And I said I tried he wouldn’t even look at me. Then she said I should go to him and kneel down. I was pissed at this point - I’m almost 7 months pregnant and have to wear a belly band for back pain so I was like seriously? When did we ever do that. This is a cultural thing- some families enforce that but we never do. No one else did among my siblings. 
Then my dad was like I haven’t called him in 2 weeks or come to see him. At this point I was mad, he literally knew I was on bed rest for the past 2 weeks and just resumed work this week. He never called once or came to see me. We have a family group chat and I try to call every Sunday to check up on everyone but he’s apparently always too busy to join and expects me to call personally or something. 

Anyways we got into an argument, he was saying he won’t let a daughter of his disrespect him in his home and that he only acknowledged my his because he’s a man. He’s doing this for my future and they this is life- mind you I barely ever have any problems with any other adults. My mum kept saying how proud I was and that I should beg him and hug him. All this isn’t new I’m used to them acting like this, the hurtful part were my husband and siblings reactions. They’re all non-confrontational. The thing is I never expected them to get involved or try to support me but at least let me deal with it my own way, but instead they kept trying to shut me down and telling me to be quiet or just beg him. I don’t know if I’m actually proud for this but there’s no way I’m going to hug or beg someone I’m mad at and that I don’t even like. Mind you they are all knew he was being an ass but they wanted to appease him to keep quiet. The thing is I don’t mind arguments, I would we both say what’s on our minds that way we could move on and reconcile, but there’s no way I can move on if I didn’t even get to express myself. 

I apologized for not coming to greet him personally and just left. I burst out crying as soon as we got in the car. Not because of the argument but because I felt so betrayed - they all knew I would stand up for then in an heartbeat if the situation was switched even I risked getting my parents anger also. I didn’t even need them to do that cause I know they aren’t that way but the least I expected from them was to see their disapproving look’s because I didn’t “let it go”. Letting it go would mean acknowledging all the accusations and then begging him. 

I was also mad at my husband and explained why. He said he was agitated and just wanted the argument to end and that he was worried about me. But he apologized for not letting me handle it and trying to shut me down. After I calmed down I started to worry about the baby because I had cried so hard. That’s when I started thinking about giving my family space because this happens every time. They do more harm than good to me. The problem is I feel bad for my siblings and I know they’re having a hard time too. I don’t want to just abandon them because my house is literally like their escape and excuse. But I can’t shake this feeling of betrayal. They do this every time. Always try to shut me down at the moment, but whenever it’s their turn I stand up for them and they appreciate the support. The last born is the only one outspoken like me and isn’t afraid of confrontation. Apparently she told my dad she hated him once I he threatened her with a knife or something. They were back home then while I was studying here.

Anyways I’m sorry for the rant but I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to just ignore them but I don’t want to abandon my siblings. Also I still feel betrayed by the other too. I told them how I feel by the way and sister gave an insincere apology and said she felt that was the right thing to do at the time. My brother just said sorry. I really don’t know how to escape this, everything reminds me of last night and my parents. After the anger wore off I just became extremely sad and depressed. My husband tried to cheer me up the remainder of the night. But I’m an over thinker and a worrier, I also have anxiety. As soon as he fell asleep I became miserable again. My sleep was distressed and I just gave up after a while. 

Any advice on how to move on or deal with this would be appreciated. Please be kind I’m exhausted from crying. I wouldn’t mind a cheer up message also. Thank you.

So I was mad at him because he was outside doing yard work and refused to come in the house and be with the family. Everytime I tried to talk to him it ended up becoming a huge argument. He went missing and I went to go search for him in the neighborhood. Took 2 hours to find him. It turns out he built two iron bars facing each other that had 800,000 volts of lighting and were supposed to shoot me if I went through them. They were over 60ft tall. Past the iron bars was my boyfriend behind it. I needed to go over to get him. I was scared in panic mode to go through it. I looked up at the towers and (drums playing, do do Do, do, do, do POW!

I’m not someone who views sex as something to just be done for fun. I have throughout my life turned down many women because of my views on sex. I have been on many dates that have never led anywhere because of my own beliefs. I’m not a hypocritical man who holds women to a standard that I myself don’t follow. I believe everyone’s body is their own. I do however believe that I have a right to be picky and try to find someone who views sex how I do. 

My current partner and I talked for a bit and then stopped over something quite silly. Almost a year went by and she had been with two men. I didn’t know I of this when we started talking again. When we had first got together she had expressed that sex is important to her and that it’s not something to be taken lightly. But I come to find out 3 months into the relationship that she has had multiple one night stands and has been with almost 10 men. 

Now I’m disgusted with her every time I look at her. My body count isn’t very high for a man my age and that’s by choice. I have worked in night clubs as a bouncer for years and now in a hospital where women are constantly all over me. I do not find women attractive when they throw themselves at me because it means they would do that for any attractive man. I grew up with mostly girlfriends and watched them sleep around and cheat and I promised myself to never be with women who treat sex like that. I always valued sex as a spiritual bond. So I’m not a man who sleeps around and then judges women. 

I think everyone’s body is their own and they have the right to sleep with whoever. But she lied about her values. Now I’m disgusted every time I look at her and when we sleep together all I think about is the other men she’s been with. I have fallen for her and I hate that I look at her this way now. She doesn’t deserve to have a partner who is disgusted by her… I am hoping the feelings go away with time. 

I’m sure I will get a lot of hate on this post

We are LDR couple and I am flying back for thanksgiving and I noticed for the past week she has been so off and distant, so I texted at the airport saying is there a problem. Bam she sends that she wants to talk about our relationship. So I asked is this good or bad and she said there is no definitive outcome. She did also say I dont know if I want a break or break up after I asked her is that what it is going to result in. Well then she started bring my wrong doing from a year ago which did happen, I acknowledged it and apologized sincerely and she seemed to be more accepting. Ever since July I have been one of the best bf ever, I changed and became good and yet I may not be perfect still, I tried to change and grow the relationship for me and us together. But due too situations that occurred last year such as, screaming at her, just not accepting of LDR as it was our first time be away from each other after being in a relationship for a year. I used to yell, ghost, just be immature whenever she did something that was not with me. I also was involved in a cheating allegation which never happened and it was proved but still she became very suspicious. All these events made her feel suspicious of me randomly doing a 180. Well she said all these events changed her forever and she doesn't know and is scared to talk to me and is not sure what she should do. I did my very best, I know I am not perfect and it was about 7 months of a rough time in our relationships in the 2 years of dating. I am scared what she might say when we meet up.

Few months into the relationship she really started showing her teeth so to speak.  
She became jealous for no reason all the time.

I have a female friend? I must be fucking with her secretly.  
I wanna go out with a friend to grab a beer. I must be picking girls up at the pub.  
I don't text back within 10 minutes? I must be texting with someone else.  
I don't show her my messenger and Viber texts? I must be hiding something.  
I mainly have women as my coworkers and of course she thinks I'm sleeping with all of them.

She gets jealous several times a week which of course turns into an argument which I am really tired of.

If something doesn't go her way she becomes hostile right away and/or ignores me for hours or days. (Which is honestly nice sometimes...)  
I keep telling her that I just want some privacy and alone time every now and then and that we don't need to be up each other's ass 24/7 but she thinks it's normal to text all day...  
All the while I told her I won't restrict her from doing whatever she wants because I do trust her so trust is very one-sided with us.

Our future plans don't even align, I want kids and she doesn't. I want to move south (we live in Finland) and she doesn't. She still tells me she loves me a lot and wants to be with me forever and I could let these ""dreams"" go if not for the other problems.

Over time I started becoming distant because of her behavior and I don't feel the same way I used to and I find myself more and more looking at other women and feeling the urge to put myself out there as if I wasn't even in a relationship... Tho I have never cheated on her and never will.

Despite all this, I find it very very difficult to break up.  
We've been together for almost a year and I became good friends with her parents and siblings (2 brothers) and I know this will be compromised in some way if I break up.  
I am just really used to her being around and our sex life is actually amazing despite all the problems. Not to mention I really don't want to hurt her.

Some of my reasons not to break up are also very selfish because I am afraid I will not find anyone else or if I do I won't like sex with them as much as I do now.  
I'm scared she will find someone else quickly and I know that feels really bad cuz it happened before.  
I'm scared I will make a mistake and I will miss her but then I already have decided and it will be too late.   
So yep, I am not perfect either and I know it's wrong and selfish to think like this.

This dilemma is also making me feel very down and sad and I barely ever feel that way so I know I need to decide soon it's just so difficult.

I also can't decide if my feelings for her could come back or not. Maybe if she stops her toxic behavior I will start to love her again.

I feel like we have a good relationship and vibe on a lot of different things/interests/values etc. It also seems like we both are looking for the same thing in a relationship and we’ve been taking things very slow (not even at French kissing yet) but we still make out and cuddle and I couldn’t be more okay with that. I don’t want to rush things and I want to build a strong emotional connection before anything sexual anyway so it works out. The issue lies where i have to initiate everything in the relationship. If we are going to cuddle, I have to put my arm around her or she’ll just sit there. If we’re going to kiss, I have to lean in and kiss her or she won’t do anything. I don’t have a problem with doing those things. But she’ll never initiate cuddling or kissing or anything else. She’s changed a little bit where now sometimes when we’re making out and I brake away for a moment, she’ll lean back into me to keep making out. she’ll also touch me more when kissing/cuddling. I’ll also see her infer that she wants to cuddle, kiss, etc with her body language and when we do she is always receptive. But it’s like she’s waiting for my permission and that she’s not allowed to have the same level of control in the relationship or something.

At this point, I was emotionally drained because of his constant blame games to the point where I burst into tears. To which he said I was ""making him feel bad by crying"".

I plan to lie to them about beeing invited by someone else but I feel shitty because of it.

My parents died earlier this year and now I live with my boyfriend and his family. They are awesome, I love them and I already spent several holidays with them. This year one of my bf's brothers wants to bring his new girlfriend and introduce her to his family. I'm really looking forward to meeting her, but not this christmas. Over the last year I realized how hard the ""first xy without"" someone can be. My parents' birthdays, my birthday, their wedding anniversary etc. So I expect christmas to be tough. I also learned that the ""tough days"" are easier, if I can spend them with people I feel 100% comfortable with or completely alone. 
Maybe the new girlfriend is the loveliest person ever, but I don't want to risk it. She'll stay here for a whole week. Even if we get along great, there still is a pretty high chance she will see me crying at least once and I don't want that either.

Now I don't know what to do.
I don't want to talk to my bf's family about it. They shouldn't have to decide between me and the new girlfriend. The brother should be able to bring whoever he likes. It's his family and his home.
I also don't want to talk to my bf. He wouldn't let me spend christmas alone and would insist on getting a hotel together or something. But then I'd feel guilty for keeping him from spending christmas with his family. He gets bored easily and I don't want to plan a full week entertainment programme for him. I want to be alone for the whole week and do stuff I like.
I could stay here and see how it goes, but an excuse for leaving spontaneously would be even more complicated. My only option is to lie to my boyfriend and say that friends invited me or something.

I told her she is free to have kids, but I am not  interested and (tbh I have been upset at her for some information I  found out she did and I am actually reconsidering this relationship and  do not trust her to have my children even if I did want any) that she  could move on and find someone who did want kids if she needs.

He said it's believed that m isogny is far more common than m isandry, across the world and throughout history. And he said everybody you ask will say M uslim countries (like I ran) hate women, and that's billions of men.

He said women have always liked men more through time and across the world too.

He said men who hate women hate them for personal reasons. They see women as i nferior, l esser, i ncapable, u nfunny, etc etc.

And he said women who hate men hate them as backlash against m isogny, not because they see men as i nferior, etc.

He said traditional roles for men and women are not seen as different but equal, and instead most people these days say housewives are housewives because men think women are not c apable and are i nferior. They don't say housewives raise families, they say that they are o ppressed.

He said take s ex with women away and these men prefer men in every way. But take s ex with men away from women and they have many things that they still like about men.

He said many people say that men o bjectify women and think they own them or women exist in relation to men, but nobody really says that women reduce men to o bjects.

He said therefore women accept more about men than men do about women and he said f eminists complain about how bad it is to be a s traight woman and how they are helpless because of this. They complain about how bad men are and still want them. They are happy to find the needle in the haystack.

He said women are believed to treat men better than men treat women, respect them more and to also put up with a lot more.

He says it's widely believed that women hate each other, get catty, bitchy, cliquey, jealous, backstab, two faced, drag down other women, compete for men and say ""I'm not like other girls"" or try to be a ""cool girl"" and put other women down while it's also widely believed that men form deeper bonds and connections, friendships, camaraderie and bromances.

He said teenage boys often have to outgrow their immature anti girls views and only want girls for s ex.

So I never thought I would post here, but let's go. In the pandemic, I started talking to a guy from a dating app. That is all it was at first, very sexual texts from him that sort of morphed into everyday casual texts. Because of lockdown, I saw him 2 months after we started talking. It sounds stupid, but he was very sexual at the first encounter and I did not want to engage. I left his house thinking, okay sure this is it, he is going to ghost me. I was not too invested in this. However, this is not what happened. I need to mentioned this happened around August, we planned to meet at other times, it fell through. In November, he texted me saying he was no longer interested.

 To be honest, I was upset. I enjoyed talking to him and liked to know what he was doing, but it was what it was. A month later, he texts me again. His number was out of my phone so it just came up as a number. We began talking again that autumn as friends. In the summer of the next year, started dating around Memorial Day. I really liked him beyond a sexual level. I need to mention we did not have sexual interaction. HERE IS WHERE I MADE THE MISTAKE.

 Prior to all of this, I would say 2 months after he started talking to me again, I told him I love you. He brought it up at a different time and how it was ""weird"". Anyway, when we started dating that summer, I did not think much of it. I moved on from that comment that hurt me. I was there at his house every weekend from Memorial day to Labor day. It was seeming like we were in a ""normal"" relationship, however, we only kissed. I was not seeing anyone, but him.

 One day, he insinuates he is meeting up with a coworker (mind you this is a sunday) to work on a project. This was early in a Sunday morning so I left to allow him to work. That night I had a strange gut feeling, call it women's intuition. He did not text me 7-9 pm. He finally texts me at 9 and I say casually, what were you doing?. He responds, "" I was getting a drink with a friend"". Okay, something is not right. I ask ""Is this friend a girl?"". He tiptoed around that, as you can assume, it was. I freaked out and told him not to text me. He texts me three days later saying I am ridiculous and that it is just a ""friend"". I was not born yesterday. (he said the meeting in the morning w his coworker fell through, this was a way of getting me out of his house)

 That weekend, actually the day prior to meeting that girl, I tried to initiate sexual contact with him. He admitted, ""Something is missing"". Although hurtful, I expected this as he acted this way before. I expressed that we should no longer see each other and that I can move on. What else is there to do? He literally did a 180 that night and let's just say he ""tried"" to have intimate relations with me. I know how ridiculous this is lol. Anyway, trying to shorten this up.

 So ""drinks"" girl happen to be this girl he met off online dating, shocker. He said it was a friend, confessed months later after I was prying him about it that it was a girl he met off tinder. This is after I questioned him heavily, trying to get the truth. Why would he try so hard for me to stay with him then go on a date the next day? 2 condoms were missing from his pack, I am not sure when this happen. I assumed he slept with this girl.

 After he went on the meetup which he refused to admit was a date, he called me jealous and said he was not talking to other women. Fast forward a year later, we are living together. I mention this tinder girl again. Let's say her name is Sarah. Now, he says I shouldn't be mad, how we were not ""dating"". How I need to get over it. I couldn't shake this feeling that something was obviously off. He kept saying it was a friend.

 Now, HE SLIPS UP. Says oh we went out to dinner and drinks, seeing her twice. I asked if the second date was the date I knew about or if the second date was another secret and happened AFTER he said he wouldn't see her again. Drove me crazy. I went through his phone. The text chat to her was deleted, however, there was a ""k thanks"" text from her in october. The date I knew about was in August, so figure two months after I tell him to stop seeing her.

 Now, there is a full on convo on insta. This dates back to the first date, the last texts went something like this.

""You're always so busy. I didn't want to bother you.""

""You were like 1 block away last week.

""You didn't text me. Come over""

""Come over as in now, where do you want to go""

""Come over and we will decide.""

This dates back to the date in which he disappeared for two hours. I know from how he was texting her that he had her come over the house. I don't like invading privacy, but I needed answers as our relationship is serious now. I know she came over to his APT. They most likely had sex. He denies it. To this day he says he did not. When did the date where they had dinner take place, before or after I know. Why did he delete the text chat?

 By the way, when I asked him why he deleted the txt chat, he said, ""I was ending things"". I said, why didn't you end them when I was upset about the date.?. He says he didn't see her after , but happened to run into her two months later, then texted her to end things. I think he cheated on me and is trying to say we were not exclusive. Sorry for the long chat. I was over his house every weekend. He never told me about any other women. I guess we became exclusive november of that year. I don't go by that whole ""exclusive thing"". BTW he went on another day with a lady 3 days after my birthday, but that was okay given that we weren't exclusive (sarcasm).

I mean she is going through her periods but it seems like it's only affecting me. Today me, a mutual friend and she was just hanging out and they were both talking so happily she was asking him if he wanted to go on the swings while i just stood there and she didn't even bother to say hi when i came. We kind of tried to surprise her today morning but she looked around and noticed me, didn't seem so shocked about it but once she saw the friend she was all smiling and came running to us. I just stood there and watched as they were interacting. IDK about her but my friend couldn't help and notice my mood going down. He later asks me if I'm okay and what was going on their with her treating me like im not even present there. I told him it's all good even though it wasn't because I didn't know how to explain such a situation to him.  


The whole time I was there I felt so unwanted by my own girlfriend that every second I wanted to leave even more, but I know I couldn't do that, don't know why though. Maybe just that she'd notice and then might feel bad about me feeling that way. I didn't want her to feel guilty during her periods so I just stand there watching my girlfriend and one of my best friends (the mutual friend) have a conversation in which I wasn't invited.  


later in a bus, we 3 were travelling back to home from somewhere and I went to sit beside her and so I asked ""Can I sit beside you?"" and she said ""no, why?, the bus is practically empty, you can sit anywhere else."" and so I did but my friend notices this and asks her ""Why are you treating him like that, he's your boyfriend."" and she then replied with some excuse like she just wanted the bus to start moving before we could sit together and she eventually asked me to sit with her.   


the day before all of this happened. I was talking to her in my society when another one of my friends came and her mood cheered up all of a sudden but when he left she didn't notice because she was maybe zoned out? I don't know why she didn't notice but when she did she was like ""oh did he leave? maybe I'll leave too then.""  


I love this girl and she says the same but I am having a hard time believing it after her actions. All I want is this one girl. I really hope its something to do with the periods but if not then I do not know what to do.

The only thing that he has been questionable about is his friendship with his ex girlfriend. The first time she ever got a call from him while we were together she asked for me not to be around while they talked. Turns out she was telling him that its not a good idea to date me because he’s not ready for a relationship. Might I add they have been broken up for 2 years and he has been single for those 2 years. 
My boyfriend is still good friends with his ex-girlfriend and she helped him a lot with his mental health struggles. I was friends with him for a few months before we started dating so I knew that he is still good friends with his ex and was comfortable with that and I even wanted to meet her. Over the few months we have been dating she has said/texted some strange things like “you fumbled the bag when you lost me” “not to be a pick me girl but I know your tattoo is about me” (he has told her repeatedly that the meaning of his tattoo is not related to her besides that she helped design it but she insists the tattoo is about her) and has had all around a very inflated view of herself saying things like “i’m so cool huh” “don’t you wish you still had me” And will not stop repeating those things until my boyfriend replies by complimenting her or agreeing with her. Also to add she didn’t invite me to her Friendsgiving and when my boyfriend told her he can’t make it because I’m not available that day she said “…so? i didn’t invite her”

So to sum it up she has excluded me from her events, has tried convincing him he’s not ready to be in a relationship, and when he tried talking to her about setting boundaries and respecting our relationship she repeatedly said that I am insecure and fragile, she even went as far to tell him that she is sorry he is with me. 
My boyfriend now thinks he needs to apologize to her for trying to set boundaries because “I won’t ask her to change who she is.”

It was really love at first sight and after we met it was going great until we started talking about relationships and cheating. C used to follow a lot of girls on social media and told me that wanting to f*** other girls while in a relationship is normal, and that every human wants to cheat there are only « the good ones » that don’t give in. I, of course, was really disappointed and started backing away. 
After some time, we eventually really fell in love (I’m his first love) and after confronting him about his previous words, he deleted every girl and he told me that now I changed his way of thinking and that he could never look at anyone else. 

It’s now 4 months later, and last week he told me how his best friend « A » kept on cheating on his gf every weekend. I was sad to hear that and told him that A should break up with her, and he told me that A was planning on doing so but that he convinced him not to. I was shocked by that and asked him why he would do that. He responded by saying that A was just hitting on girls at the club and « nothing more » and that A is a good guy because he went on a trip with another girl behind her back but he didn’t do anything. 
But when A told my bf about it, he also said that he wanted to leave her instead of continuing doing this. That’s when my bf told him not to, just hide the truth, try and be happy with her so A decided to do so. 
I got really really mad and asked him how he could do that and that he just sentenced a girl to a miserable relationship. He then told me how she wouldn’t be miserable as she doesn’t know, and he just wanted his best friend to be « happy » and how « I was the one that made him believe in love » and that’s why he did it. 
I lashed out at him because I couldn’t believe how he could defend this, say I made him do it and why wouldn’t he do that to me as well. He then told me that he would never do that, that he’s madly in love with me and that it’s just for his friend. 


I’m really scared that if our relationship lasts and faces hard times, he will eventually go back to everything he told me and that he could actually do the same thing. 
I then started questioning our relationship and now he’s really mad at me for doing so and says that I am overreacting and too sensitive and that I don’t love him if I question our love « only for this »

Just general opinions also.

We have been together 3 years and living together for 2. We've had some tough ups and downs but navigated through them. I've often felt my bf was prioritising fun with friends over me/us. Like leaving me to walk home alone at night when there was no taxis so he could stay out drinking with friends. This isn't on of course, but his friends are a huge deal to him and important. Mainly 'the boys' as he's not overly fussed about the girls in the group, but they come as part of it.

The worst instance for me was a party where we were together, really happy and having a great time and my bf started talking to a girl beside us a bit drunk. We were even pretty lovely with each other aIl night, touching and hugging etc. But I could tell his voice changed talking to her and he automatically went into flirting mode. He wasn't even that drunk, and started touching her hip/side repeatedly whilst talking to her. I started tapping/kicking his foot a bit to get him to realise what he was doing, but he didnt even notice me doing it. He'd never done anything like this before and I lost it, we left and had a huge fight. In the morning he couldn't even remember doing it and was hugely apologetic. This was 1.5 years ago. No issues like this since. It caused trust problems but we worked through them, mostly I'm now just embarrassed about us fighting in front of people at his friends party.

Now his actual friends. They come as a group of couples, bar one single guy. They have all known each other for 10+ years from school or uni and are mega close. Bf hid that he'd slept with one of the girls like 10 years ago or something. She's now in a new relationship and has been all this time with his best friend, he didn't want anything more with her at the time,  but she did. I've had a ton of issues with her whilst trying to be friends with her and her with me. She's nice and we are similar, but then has gotten drunk and told me my bf is a narcissist and that she couldn't trust him. She definitely has wounds she's never addressed or gotten over from him back in the day and obviously likes his attention. My issue here is she shouldn't be saying that to her friends gf, and she obviously still has some kind of feelings for him. My bf just seems to naturally react to girls giving him attention without knowing he's doing it, so they have definitely been flirty with each other on nights out. Nothing over the top but enough that I could feel it and felt uncomfortable (this is how I found out about their past, I could just tell from how they were acting). My bf has really reigned this in and qorked on himself a lot. We both have for the differences we have.

Other girls: horribly toxic, bitch the back off of his ex, and another guys ex when we are out.... I very much feel like they likely bitch about me when I'm not there now too. One of them who he was really good friends and a flat mate with, hasn't initiated a single conversation with me in 2.5 years since meeting me. She did roll her eyes at me once and say nothing when I made a joke towards her, trying to get in with her and be friends. The joke didn't hit the mark apparently and hit on an insecurity of hers, but I was just trying to be friendly and didn't know this. Again 2.5 years later she's made zero effort to talk to me. Then another girl told me on a night out about how the girl my bf has slept with, is totally obsessed with him, brings him up all the time on nights out and everyone knows 10 years later she's not over him. Given they are supposed to be close friends, sharing this with me for gossip and not talking to her friend about her issues or going directly to my bf is just trying to cause drama with me. 

One girl told me she's been going hot and cold on me because she was jealous of my figure, and because the boys had said in passing that I was 'hot.'

I pretty much gave up at this point and spent a week down in bed, as every time we go out I'm out of place, awkward, told inappropriate things or see my bf acting like he did in the past. He has sorted all his own behaviour out but it's obvious the girls don't like me, aren't really fundamentally nice people and I feel miserable if I'm out with them.

Now our current issues. I can't just go out and hang out with the guys. They are football boys and we have nothing in common, and if I do that anyway the girls will slander me more and make my life more difficult. The girls will not just disappear, they are my bf's best friend's gfs. He can't choose them or get rid of them. His friends are hugely important to him, and he wants me to go out and feels really embarrassed when they all go out together, then everyone asks where I am all the time. (I've started not going with them anymore). He doesn't want our relationship to be like this forever, and wants someone who goes out with him and all his friends.

The biggest issue right now: They do new years together every year and are having a huge party this year, including the girl my bf was repeatedly touching and everyone who was there when we fell out. I feel anxious, awkward, sick and unhappy about going. If I don't go, I don't know if our relationship will make it and that's not the outcome I want right now.

I have explained to him that this is making the time we spent playing, which is a lot, not enjoyable for me and I'm kind of resentful of his attitude, he just doesn't care ""he plays all to win or he doesn't play"" and since he ""considers me a true rival he won't play soft with me"" his words not mine.

I met H in school when she was 15 and I was 16. We were high-school sweethearts (I don't think we have an expression for it here). Essentially, we were kids but, damn, how I loved her. Inseparable. We were together for four and a half years, when I popped the question one Valentine's Day and she said 'Yes' - We were still living seperately, at home with our parents, but we had savings at the ready. Being 20 and 21, and being long-term can be tricky. People grow. People change. Everyone knows that. We seperated after being engaged for six months. What we didn't know then was that H had undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Regardless, we lasted five and a half years.

We both moved on and found others. H met someone after two weeks. Got engaged, married and seperated, in the space of six months. I met someone and that lasted five years. Engaged, wedding was being planned. Again, life happened.

After that break-up, I drove to H's old neighbourhood, expecting her mother to answer the door. It was H. My true intent was to hand over my phone number, because I simply wanted to talk to her. This was my second failed engagement and I was beginning to think I was forming into Ross Gellar from Friends. I wanted to know where things went wrong. But she answered the door and the first thing she said was, ""You're here.. And I look like sh*t!"" (Haha) - I invited her out for a drive that evening. Nothing happened. We talked. We caught up. She said ""It's weird how this is not weird"" - Our past angers became water under the bridge and I hugged her goodbye as I dropped her off home.

Around six months after that, I met someone. We'll call her M. And, damn, this girl was it for me.. Intelligent, educated, funny, sarcastic and incredibly gorgeous. Readers, whatever you're imagining. Double that. M and I lasted four and a half years. She was unfaithful after two years and surviving infidelity is not something I would recommend. We seperated in August.

In that time, H had a string of boyfriends or dated people. She found herself a guy and they had a child together, but that relationship turns on and off more than a lightswitch . For the record, the child is four. And H definitely has a specific type of guy, it's safe to say.

So, three months ago, I became single and moved out. Retreated and worked on myself. In truth, I've never actually been single. Maybe a year out of 16, combined total. It's safe to say that being in a relationship suits me, as it's all I know. I mean, I have my own life, my own career, my own hobbies.. I guess I just like having somewhere there or caring for someone. That's not unhealthy, is it?

Anyways, H has always been there in the background. Social media, etc. The occasional Like and Happy Birthday. But on Halloween, specifically, things turned up a gear with the pictures of her costume she was sending me. I knew she was throwing out the bait and I happily obliged, for old times sake. She was looking great. We sent the odd message, in the space of the past 3 weeks, but nothing crazy or anything that can be used as evidence.

Until Saturday. Now, this is the good part..

She sent me another picture. And she knew what she was doing. She was out on the town, celebrating her brother's birthday. Tiny backstory. He would have been around 17 when H and I seperated. The weather was awful and I offered to give her a ride home. Being 100% honest, I was maybe asking for trouble. Being 110% honest, I was not prepared for what took place. She asked me into town to join herself and her brother. And I obliged. It was his birthday and I hadn't seen him for 15 years and her for five-ish. I took my car. Parked. Walked into the club and met them at a booth. She was looking good, guys. I won't beat around the bush. Her brother left, despite my offer to drive him home. He was happy to walk. So, there we were. Me and H. After all these years. We talked, we reminisced, we spoke about the old days. And then I walked her to my car, when the club closed. I connected her phone to my car's Bluetooth and she began playing songs that took me back in time. Nostalgic. Our songs. She asked to see my new place. Full disclosure. Even here I still didn't know what was happening. I said to her my new place is freezing and she'd hate me. ""Take me back to yours. I wanna see it"" she insisted. Okay, fair enough. I drove. I parked. I unlocked the door. This is around 2:30am. I'll fast forward to 5am. She's still here. On my couch. Heels are off. Under my blanket. Head on my cushions. We're deep in nostalgic conversations. She asks me to come closer and she lays her head on my chest. I know I'm in dangerous territory NOW. My hearts going crazy. I ask her if she's waiting for me to make a move. And that damn look in her eyes. I know that look. I was hesitant. She was still involved with her son's father. I said to her, 'I have nothing to lose by making a move on you. It's all you' - She pulled me in. From there, what unfolded was two hours of foreplay, sex and 'us'. Living room to bedroom. It didn't feel weird or bizarre, it felt right. We were in sync.. It was incredible. She was incredible. 7am came and she lay in my arms. The place she once owned. She claimed again, temporary. She said that she'd have to get home before her son woke up. Her father was staying over, babysitting. Her 'partner' out of town for work. They don't live together. Another sidenote. Again, they're on/off.

I joked and asked her to stay longer. She kissed me and said, 'I'll come back""

I drove her home, as originally planned. She kissed me on the lips and I watched her leave. I got home to bed around 7:45am

I've not heard from her since. And I'm overthinking.
Maybe she's overthinking, too. Maybe she's not..

I'm going to message her tomorrow and ask if we can talk. If it was just a nostalgic whim or if there was something more to it. I would hate to think that such a thing could be just sex to her. Especially after a wevewbeen through. 

I guess there's either a lot to think about or there's nothing to think about until that conversation happens.

I (19m) have been together with my girlfriend(19f) for about 4 months now. At the start of our relationship, she had this guy friend around that she would hang out w abit together and i felt okay about it, however gradually, i did not like it and had a few arguments about it with her eventually leadibg me to breaking down and asking her to cut him off which she did, i asked her if there was anything between the both of them before i met her and she told me no. This was when things got worse, soon after, i found out that she actually had a situationship with the guy for about a month, (fyi: i have met this guy irl and sat in his car for a ride home and everything) i felt devastated and disgusted at the same time and thats where my retroactive jealousy came in. I kept asking her about the details of the situationship and she would always give me the wrong details like (he did not manage to penetrate her, he never kissed or cuddled her) up till now where i told her she had to be honest. Her reason for lying to me up till now was that she was afraid that i would break up with her over this. So at the end of the day she did have that sort of situationship with the guy and never told me about it since the start of the relationship. I have found it in my heart to forgive her but i still cannot come to terms with it and i am not sure how to overcome this or let this go.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7614358,public,self,I am lost,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1w6vw/i_am_lost/,all_ads,6

We both make the same amount of money (roughly 50k USD/year). 3 years quickly passed and I just found out my boyfriend is completely broke.  Not only is he broke, but he cannot confidently say where his money went over the years. We split almost everything 50/50, so I don’t understand how he has no money after I’ve been able to save so much. We are both daily cannabis smokers, so that is his go-to excuse as to why he has no money. Cannabis is expensive, but I split the cost and it has not wrecked my budget. 
Over the past year he has taken at least one weekend trip a month where he and his friends go to raves and do LSD and MDMA. I personally blame this for his financial problems. Aside from financial problems, the frequent trips have bothered me because of the drugs he is doing. I’m starting to worry that he is using me as a free place to stay while he regresses into a punk teenager with no aspirations in life. I’ve spoken to him about this multiple times, I’ve even given him the ultimatum that if he continues to spend money on trips before we can move out then he’ll need to leave my parents house. The ultimatum did not work and I’m planning on asking him to leave today. I love him very much, but I feel it is the right thing to do for myself, this situation has caused me to spiral into a rut of depression and I’m ready to get my life together. I’m sick of cleaning up after him, stressing about his financials, and most of all I’m sick of spending all these weekends alone while my boyfriend trips balls with strangers.

Got back together weeks later and now not sure if I HAVE to tell him about it 


So I’ve been dating this guy, Tom, for a few months now, and even though things are amazing right now, initially it was pretty rocky/toxic. A few weeks into us dating, I ended things saying that I deserve to be treated better, to which Tom replied he never liked me anyways etc etc. It was very evident in the moment that he was hurt I was ending things and was saying things to hurt me back. 
After a couple weeks of being broken up, I went to a party and kissed a guy that was an acquaintance of Tom’s and mine (NOT a friend) - Tom wasn’t at the party but he knew several people there.
Turns out that night Tom (drunk) had been messaging several people asking about what I was doing and about my behaviour, to which someone told him they saw me kiss the acquaintance. 
The next day, Tom sent me long messages clearly pissed off, calling me a horrible person, etc etc. 
My intentions were not to hurt him, so I told him we could talk in person. That night, I saw Tom, he told me he was hurt because the person I kissed was a part of our “circle”, since we often run in to him, and that finding out I kissed him made him realize he might’ve lost me for good. He asked to get back together, for a second chance, and that he would change. That was over a month ago and it really does feel like I’m dating someone different. My issue with Tom before breaking up was that I didn’t feel like a priority, he was not affectionate, and didn’t put much effort in with me. All this has drastically changed and he’s literally everything I’ve ever wanted in a man.

My problem is this: While we were broken up, I slept with someone. He is not anyone Tom knows, I haven’t continued talking to him, and I’ve been loyal the entire time we were together. I personally don’t feel like it’s cheating since it was clear we were broken up and I never thought we’d get back together.

Tom has told me several times in the past that he thinks when people break up they absolutely need to take a few months break from anyone else out of respect for the person they were seeing. I’ve made it very clear to him that once I stop dating someone, I don’t owe them anything, and I would go on dates right away if that’s what I wanted -he replied by saying he doesn’t agree with my mentality, and I told him he doesn’t need to agree with it because it’s my mentality and doesn’t need someone else’s approval.

All this being said, I know if I tell Tom about the hook up, he will consider it a form of cheating since we had only stopped seeing each other a couple weeks prior, but in my defence we only dated for a few weeks at that point and he made it clear he didn’t care about me when I ended it.

Do I owe it to him to tell him or should I just avoid further drama and put it in the past?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7614340,public,self,Do I need to tell the guy I’m dating that I hooked up with someone else?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1w5ph/do_i_need_to_tell_the_guy_im_dating_that_i_hooked/,all_ads,6
