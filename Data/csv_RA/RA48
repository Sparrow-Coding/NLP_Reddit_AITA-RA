I don’t know where to begin. I want to start out by saying I APOLOGIZE WHOLEHEARTEDLY for the language and terms I’m going to use but I must use this language so that you can understand the context of the situation. There’s so much context that must be provided.

I’ll try to make it as short as possible even though I could literally write a book on this. So I’m a young woman, I’m Italian American 2nd generation kinda (my mom came to America a as child around 5 years old). My boyfriend who will basically be my fiancé is from Japan and is a bit older than me. Im in 20s he’s in his 30s. Now, this is where some of my language will offend people and Im sorry again but I have to explain it like this and need to share my fears and feelings. These are also MY personal experience so I’m not stereotyping anyone truly. 

My bf and I love each other very much and are both introverted and are into the same tv shows and animes and cooking. Im a quiet person and so is he. Now, my family, on the other hand is VERY stereotypical Italian American. They’re loud, they have thick New York accents, they fight a lot, they don’t really have good etiquette or manners and ask rude questions. They’re not very educated and work menial jobs. I love my mom flaws and all, but truthfully, my family embarrasses me and I don’t want my family to meet my bf because I’m scared it’ll change the way he views me forever. I don’t want to be derogatory but the best way I can describe my family is ghetto. Some of them have criminal records and will walk around in Pajamas pants and talk like…not proper English. I know this sounds fcked and I personally don’t care about this but it’s my fiancé im worried about. I’ve basically hidden my relationship for 4 years out of embarrassment. 


Idk if any of you know anything about Japanese people or culture but they are very timid, work oriented, taught not to stand out from the crowd, value education, look down on single parenthood and overweight people and have a sort of class system. It’s like they’re obsessed with class in Asia. I’ve had fights with my fiancé about this and he even agrees. Again this is OUR personal experience  so please don’t say I’m generalizing. If you go their you’ll especially see it’s true. 

They also had this old idea of bringing “honor” to their families. People still use this concept sometimes. I basically feel like I’m trashy and his family and he will view me in a different light if he sees my family. It was hard just telling me I went to community college, he’s a microbiologist. Him meeting my family would be like him meeting tony soprano. It would be so awkward and such a MASSIVE culture shock. Because that’s what it is, a massive massive cultural difference. If he were from like the American south, like Georgia or Alabama even Ohio (lol) it wouldn’t be as bad because then he’d kind of “get it”. 

Also in japan or Asia, they have this idea that everyone in Europe is rich and it’s beautiful like they don’t really know about the “poor” Italians that came to America for a new life. Like he’s asked me if my family has been to Rome when in reality my mom came from a rural village in the middle of nowhere. His family and friends think like that so again my own Personal experience. 

I just don’t know what to do. I love my boyfriend but I can’t hide and creepy around my family without it blowing up in my face. Or we move far far away. I need all the help guys or if people have gone through something similar? Im very different from my family somehow I’m super timid and quiet so my bf would NOT be expecting their big ass personalities. Again sorry for the language but this is my own personal experience.

Some of the traits I noticed are
Never texts first to the girls he meets

If the girl is eager and is a bit fast where she is willing to sleep with him by 1st or 2nd date itself and does it, he will be responsive to her and text her but if the girl isn't giving him sex, he ghosts and gets resentful towards her

He acts passive aggressive towards the girl who didn't chase or sleep with him

If she's nice and he starts developing a crush, he will start mimicking the colours she wears but stops wearing the colours if they have arguments.

He plays mind games with girls like playing hard to get, not giving too much information about himself, hiding his private life 

He wont communicate and will leave the girl who didn't sleep with him on read and not reply to her texts much.

He will treat her poorly like calling her to meet him and then he will act shocked when she actually comes to see him in front of people he sat down to eat lunch with at the exact time he asked her to come to see him.

He acts nice and helpful in front of the people he insulted the girl 

When the girl called him out for his behaviour, he deflected the argument by saying why does it bother her how he acted and why does she care if she doesnt know those people, or how her perception is wrong, how she thinks everyone is out to get her and how her argument is childish.

He holds grudges and if the girl asked him to stop talking if he won't reply to her, he gets angry and then decides to insult her in front of people.

He lied to her face and denied everything he did so far

He has a hot temper and keeps saying he will get very angry and starts kicking objects

He mentioned he's distant and fights a lot with his friends

He is prone to panic attacks under stress

Hi so my friend (19M) and I (22F) met a little over 6 months ago. We have flirted and kissed before. He even told me he liked me (but he was drunk). Anyways it didn't go anywhere. It took him two months to get him to actually tell me what was happening between us, where he just said he isn't looking for a relationship right now because he's 19 and not ready for commitment, etc. We are still friends because he is a family friend and comes around often.

Before I moved back for school (I go to college 12 + hours away, which was my reasoning for not wanting to start anything serious) I texted asking if I was missing the obvious, that it was a line. He said no, he really just isn't ready to start anything serious.

Well months went by of us not speaking. Finally, something reminded me of him so I reached out and the conversation never died. At first it was just small talk. Then he got very sick with Covid and I reached out to help, he appreciated it and we began talking more. Finally, I sent a flirty text. He encouraged I send more, he loves them and always gives me a response after each cheesy pick up line, flirty, or suggestive message. 

Here is where I'm confused. It has been 4 weeks since the first flirty text. He hasn't initiated one back. When I've sent suggestive texts, he plays along and keeps it going but never starts it. He also wont tell me whether or not he's going to see me when I come home. He just always says something like ""yea we should hang out/call when I have more time"", then he just pushes it back and says he's busy when I can literally see him online playing games for like 6 hours straight. He has done some things that show he has more interest than before like insisting he stay on my private accounts. He seems a little jealous because he makes slightly passive aggressive jokes about me sleeping with one of my guy friends (who I haven't slept with) and he leaves me on delivered but still religiously watches my stories on nights where I go out partying. Finally, he has sent me one text where he complimented my character and one text that was like wholesome flirting.

Well recently he has started texting less but still everyday (some days I'll be on delivered for like 18 hours, others he text back immediately). I stopped initiating but he has told me he is interested in starting something if I am, when I come home. I know he's still sleeping around but he doesn't talk about it around me. When I ask if he wants to play games online or call and he's planning to go meet another girl he will normally just tell me he has already made plans for the night but he will call me another night. 

I asked him to ft last Sunday and he has been very avoidant since, like if I even ask if he is wanting to call, he responds saying ""he will let me know when he gets home from work"" and then ignores me the second he gets home until he is busy again the next day. I realize he may think I'm wanting to talk about serious things, but I'm not. I really just wanna chat with him and see if I still feel anything towards him. How do I casually tell him, I'm literally just looking to chat and hang out with him? Also why does he seem interested but isn't making a move? Is he not interested in me and just trying to be nice? This is the second occasion of us ""talking/flirting/whatever you call this"" and I have been told by our mutual friend that when he doesn't want to talk to people he just straight up leaves them on read.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7573534,public,self,Is he (19 M) leading me (22F) on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxv1qk/is_he_19_m_leading_me_22f_on/,all_ads,6,

My partner (37f) had an 30k-ish job she was stressed about every day before mat-leave.  
Just before we found out we were going to be parents, I started up my own business for a passion of mine. (on top of my 9-5).  This was right before covid, so it was slow start to where we are now.  


Before we were kind of income-splitting.  Ive been paying 80% of expenses, and she would provide some which generally went towards groceries and such.  While on mat-leave I took more to 90-95% as she was making less income.  


When her mat-leave was over (1 year), I personally took every monday to take care of our child so she could go back to work FT at her old job.  We had our child in day care 2 days (which i paid), and with my parents 2 days.

Meanwhile I was at my other business/job in the evenings m-Thurs  


Fast forward a year, she moved to a different job (which i encouraged) with less pay.   due to daycare our child was sick and had to be home a lot which was adding a lot of stress to her, so we decided that she would just keep him out of daycare and at home  3 days and my parents for 2 days.  (i also switch companies and could no longer take Mondays off but could not work from home ft and take care of him if he was sick)

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am paying for 100% and she is home.  But she is insistent that her stay-at-home time is 'work' (which dont get me wrong is a lot of effort! she does clean more than i am able to do)  but more in the sense that she should be financially compensated for it as if it was a normal job.  Which she is in a way, since I am covering all her portion of would-be home expenses..  


As someone who's working basically 2 full-time jobs to support the family, I feel this is unfair to me.  I've pretty much provided her funds to do some work for my business which didnt really happen but i am trying to go about her becoming an actual worker on her 2 days off (when our child is away at my parents).

  
Whoa, a lot longer than I thought (sorry might be more of a vent).

  
My business is doing very well now, but not well enough for me to leave my VERY stable 9-5.   


TDLR:

For those with a stay-at-home partner, what can you suggest for how we could best approach our expenses/finances?  


I've currently suggested we get a joint account for home/child expenses, for things like all the kid stuff, groceries and fluid expenses like that.  Where I would keep care of all the static ones (mortgage, condo fees, electrical, internet, insurance etc.).   And make this a 50/50 pot.  
this way she could find or i could 'hire' her and provide her personal income for herself and for her to put into the shared pot.  


She is getting pretty tired/stressed from being a stay-at-home mom, which I can understand but she never seems to understand how much work/stress I am doing to support her no matter how I try and explain it.

We got married young when I had just started studying architecture. My parents paid for my education, thank god, so that wasnt an issue and DH started working in computer engeneering (after taking a 4month course) so that i would be able to focus on school and not have to work. 
Naturally since my DH worked from 9-19 i managed most of the chores and household stuff. DH would wash dishes and cook but at some point stopped.
When our first child was born automatically everything settled onto the same routine just with an added adition. While nursing i was the one waking up ans taking care of  my child mostly alone. My DH would not change diapers unless i wasnt home and there was no other option.
After a year of commuting to wrok DH found a job from home so he was home most of the time. This all made things so much more difficult.
For five years we lived like this mostly content. I was raised in a big family and was used to the chores and caretaking, so besides for a few missteps i didnt mind to much. Besides DH was working till very late and i didnt expect him to start helping around the house after a 10hr work day. During this time DH also started suffering from vertigo and stomech issues. He never fully recovered from both of these cronic illneses. 
After school I started working a 9-15 job and after a year had another child. After my second child was born i had gone into a slight depression. DH had started learning for his computer engeneering degree online. So we were both swamped and super busy. Throughout this whole time I do most af all the cooking cleaning and laundry ect. Taking care of the kids and everything. Whenever i would bring up how hard it is for me DH would say that i just need to be more afficiant. when i would ask for help after his work he would mostly say that hes not working at such a late hr and i should have taken care of it earlier or leave it for tomorrow.
Having DH work from home is hard hes here but not i want him to help but he cant. Its been like this i years. Still sometimes have a hard time.
Last year we decide to make a big change and move upstate to his families ranch. We live on his parents property and i had another baby. 
So we are now a household of 5 and both of us work. I work a 7hr job and DH 10hr. He makes triple the amount of money that i make.
I wake up for the kids at night and in the morning i put them to sleep and pack their lunches i cook i clean i do the laundry. I wake up early and drive to work i drive home and pick them up from school. I manage the bills and food shopping. Anything else that needs to be done my DH passes to me to be done. Tax returns car repairs everything there is to do i do. I go to sleep at around 23-1am so i can spend some time also with DH and  finishing what chores i can and leaving what i didnt do for tomorrow. 
He starts to work at 9am so he wakes up at 8-830 if we make noise he gets upset. So im alone from 530-730 with the kids getting them ready and handeling the noise.
Afew months ago i had a meltdown and told DH that i cant anymore im exhusted i need help. He told me i need to be more afficiant and stop leaving a mess around clean after myself and itll be much easier. He also agreed that on weekends he would wakeup with the kids so that i can sleepin some.
We started this and it really has been a little better but noe DH says he cant handel waking up with them and that we need to find a different arangement. Mind you my ""sleeping in"" is to be woken up at 830am.

I love my DH and i love my family but i just cant anymore. Whenever we fight and its usually because of this issue im being irrational and crazy. We are a team and DH works and i take care of the house and family. I live my job and dont want to quit to be a stay at home mom. The most enjoyable time of my day is work.
I dont want to leave or divorce i want ideas for solutions. How to cope how to make him understand. 
I feel underappreciated as f@#k..
Recently ive been feeling really down and disconcted from DH. Usually our sex lifes amazing and we make time for date nights and hanging out together we have alot in common and enjoy our time together alot.
but recently somethings off hes going on diployment for two weeks during a holiday even though he could have chosed the two weeks after but all his freinds are gonna be the first two weeks. So the whole week of hanuka im gonna be alone. We always celebrate with kids and make a big deal each night lighting candles and giving gifts and just hanging out as a family. This year im gonna be alone with the kids for two weeks. I feel lost i feel like im nothing.

That he chose his friends feelings over mine. but he swears it was a lapse in judgment and nothing else happened. we’re supposed to be married in 6 months and now i have no trust and my guts are telling me that something is seriously wrong.

And I think I have a serious issue with insecurity/jealousy or something  that is definitely unhealthy. 

Essentially, I have had problems with relationships. In the last five years, one of my ex gfs cheated on me. The next one who I was in long distance started completely ignoring my texts and calls for a week or so, and refused to speak well afterwards. Since I was hurting,  I ended it. And the next one, I only met once but we got very close through chats and videocalls (during lockdown) also started behaving funny and I ended it. She did confirmed she has lost interest in me because she felt I asked too much of her time. 

Currently, I am like married but we do not live together and never shared bed. Been around 4 months. And we also do not meet as often, which is her preference. 

But due to her behaviors, I get this strong feeling that she might be cheating on me. But she might also not be at all. There is one single guy she is close with. And she brings him up during most of our conversations like she is obsessed with him. I know they spend time together sometimes since they work together. But there also may not be anything between them and it might all   be just in my head. 

Let's say it is just in my head. How do I stop thinking this way? It is giving me a lot of stress and anxiety and I want to stop feeling this way. Please do not suggest ""open communication "" with her because I tried that. She would probably hate me if I bring up this topic because we had similar conversation before and she didn't like it at all. And also she is simply not good at this. Like really not good. She takes it negatively. It is not her fault. It is just the culture where we are from. 

Would really appreciate your advice/suggestions. I have more info to share but the post is getting too long. Please dm me if you want more info.

My grandparents have some memory issues, which is not so much the problem. Maybe it is an I am just stupid. 

Anyway. My parents have been divorced for OVER 20 YEARS. My grandma keeps asking me very personal questions about my mom. I keep saying “i don’t know, its none of my business.” Then she follows it up with some incredibly judgmental snide comment. 

My G-ma yelled at someone for pushing the elevator button. She said “can you hurry up, I’m in a rush.”
She recently had a hip replacement, she is 100% fine, and she almost started crying when she found out the rehab place was on the second floor. Like it was personal attack ok her.

She keeps making comments about everyone else. “I don’t understand how someone only works one day.” I said “grandma, its none of your business, and some people have other jobs or family take care of. Who cares.” 
And calling everyone stupid for her mistakes. 

And shes NONE STOP TALKING. If you say anything, like I need to go to the grocery store. She will obsessively talk about how her grocery story is the best and then asked if we have fried chicken at our place, or BAGGED SALAD…. Like come on. She asked me if I was taking cookies on the plane with me, like this was 2000…. She was like “i can’t believe your dad hasnt called you. Maybe he thinks you have another way home.” Like what? Im not driving home, he knows I need to take a plane. 

My grandpa…. Oh my fucking god. The meanest man I have ever met. He yells none stop at my grandma, and tell her to “shut her mouth and she has no idea what shes talking about.” And he tells costumer service people to “shut up and listen to their costumers.”

They are insufferable unhappy, bitterly rude people. And this has been an anxiety inducing unrelaxing time.

The relationship is good but over the past few weeks we've hit a situation that has become nuclear. 

She doesn't do well contraception . She's had this problem all her life, but doesn't want to rely on condoms.  She has an arm implant. 

It's been shutting her down slowly.  Her sex drive is dying, hormonal, her body feels a mess.  

She often complains about these things and refires to it feeling like she's been castrated.   Last month she's been dealing with different problems.  

Not huge logistical issues or problems but they have been adding up and affecting her significantly.   Her ability to cope with any forms of stress is limited.  

On top of that she's suffered childhood trauma and abuse in the past.

Shes truly an amazing women that I love and adore.  I understand her struggles and try to be there to support her to the best of my ability.  

A few weeks ago. She was feeling angry at everyone.  She mentioned to me that she just wanted to pick fights.   We was there for her.  We had a nice night ,  she zoned out a little, and relaxed. 

Next day she went nuclear with me over nothing.  We were having a conversation about my business that I was started , she suggested I take certain courses.  I said those courses are not the path I want to take.   

That was enough to her vent her frustrations on me. 


We've had nice times since but their has been growing tension between us.  Basically her pushing me away and shutting down.  

It's all understandable.   I want to be there for her.  

I must admit that it's emotional taken its toll on me.  Being pushed away , feeling rejection (regardless it you know it's not personal)  hurts emotionally. 


We're now caught in a spiraling loop.  I understand the situation.

Im sorry if you dont want to read all of this im so damn stressed out its unhealthy 😔

My girlfriend was at my house a few days ago and asked if we could go back to talking. I was shocked and it hit like a truck, but she said it was because of how stressed she's been with college and that she needs more time to herself. I completely understood that. I was fine with that, but it hurt me alot as it was super unexpected. She also told me this right after I gave her birthday gift to her. This isnt the part that destroyed me....

Fast forward to later that night. I'm a motorcycle rider, she rides on my bike for bike nights every thursday and its always a good time. She has this guy friend we'll call CJ who also rides, but they have known eachother for a while. At the end of bike night me and my girl head back to my place as we normally do to cuddle, share kisses, watch movies. Instead of this though, this time we talk about the conversation we had earlier about going back to the talking phase. At this point it is midnight. She lives 45min away so she said she needs to leave because shes tired and has work in the morning. I was like ok thats cool drive safe and whatnot. I check her location 30minutes later to make sure she was making it home safe and shes 5minutes down the road from my house at CJ'S HOUSE. 

Knowing this I gave her a call asking if she made it home safe and she told me that she just made it home and is getting ready to take a shower. I asked her if she was sure, same answer. I then brought up how her location says shes at CJ's. Her excuse was that she went to grab books from his house on the way out and maybe it didnt update yet but shes home safe. I hung up the phone and when I go back to check her location she had turned it off. Luckily I know CJ and know where he lives. I hopped on my motorcycle and start heading toward CJ's when I see her car heading toward me in the oncoming lane near CJ's street. I was destroyed. I knew she was there, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Seeing her on the road leaving this guys place absolutely fucking killed me man. Thats exactly why she turned her location off. I hit a U-turn and get next to her at a light and she knows she fucked up. Her car isnt nearly as fast as a crotch rocket and she just got caught being at CJs. We pull over and talk and long story short her excuse is that she wanted to vent to him. I know this is probably a lie because 2 days after this she drove 45min to my city to go to the bar with CJ who is supposedly just her best friend. I really dont want it to be a lie. I really love this girl. I do. I just dont know what to do and dont know if she ever loved me. I hate this shit its so stressful. 

While having the conversation about going back to talking she also told me she never truly felt like she meant it when she said she loved me because she feels like we were moving fast. I dont know what to believe anymore because it was so mutual. It really was. Theres so much we've done together. Looking into her eyes and her telling me she loves me and now she wants to say it wasnt real? Im empty. On top of all of this my motorcycle blew its transmission 2 days ago, probably for the best because its a built kawasaki ninja zx6r and all of my emotion went into that throttle and I wasnt scared of dying. Emotions completely took me over every time i would hop on it after this. I enjoyed riding my bike so much, it was like therapy.  Now I have no motorcycle, no girl (i think 🤕), and no money. 

I just need advice. She still wants to talk to me supposedly, but God i just dont know man 😭. I still have feelings but im so torn.

We've been best friends since first grade, twenty years ago. I knew she had changed recently - she's more flakey, less reliable, etc. But I guess I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until recently. We had... not a fight, exactly, but I tried to talk to her about what's been going on lately and she just brushed me off. I felt like I was going crazy, so I reached out to some close friends to get their opinion on the situation and see if I was in the wrong. It was during these conversations where it started coming out. 

My fiancé doesn't like her. Hasn't liked her our whole relationship. He thinks she's disrespectful, rude, and cold. He said she doesn't care about anyone but herself. A good friend of mine from college doesn't like her because she inserts herself into conversations to make them about her, plus all the reasons my fiancé doesn't like her. My work friend has met her one time and has a horror story about her.

After those reviews, I was reeling, but they're right. Everything they said about her is true. I just didn't want to see it. I feel terrible for bringing her around all the time, and I don't want to keep inflicting her on everyone. I'm actually hoping she drops out of my wedding before it happens next year, just to avoid the decision of whether to ask her to step down or not. I just... I don't know what to do. I feel too old for this.

I've been with my girlfriend for four years (we've been living together for a while). I love her very much, she's kind and patient and I have no idea why she's with me. Her mom is a diabetic (I believe its type 4) that just had surgery to do something with veins in the legs to increase blood flow to the feet but had to amputate a foot because a cut got infected and it wouldn't heal. GF has been staying there helping take care of her. Her mother is extremely negative and abusive (emotionally) towards her. Which angers me because I grew up with a physically abusive mother mother (whom I haven't spoke to in almost 11 years) and it stunted me to the point where I am afraid to talk about anything because when I was a kid my mother would call me derogatory things as she would hit me with whatever was nearby. It took a long time to trust my GF to talk to her about anything. Even then, its very hard for me to open up and its a struggle to say anything emotional because I feel weak and vulnerable and I dont like that feeling. However my GF is so patient with me and understanding she just waits for me to stop being an idiot and tell her what's making me upset or mad instead of holding it in like I have been used to doing for so long. 

Anyway, when I do see her (she moved out her mothers house at 18 because of how toxic her mother was but still goes over diligently to help her with groceries, driver her to errands, doctors, etc) about once a week for a few hours, she is so worn down and tired she just wants space to decompress. She tries to talk to me but usually falls asleep quickly. I recently lost my only two friends (one to a rx overdose and another to pandemic). My grandmother who raised me mostly was just diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and she is beginning to become incoherent and I just want someone to talk to. I keep it all in and dont say how I'm feeling because I dont want to pile more stress on my GF. Its been going on for months like this and I feel alone again, so I did what any stupid person would do and turned to taking painkillers off of a specific market online just to numb how I feel. GF does not know about my other friend passing (knows about the one who passed from the pandemic) or my grandmother. I feel like a trash person because I am so selfish and wanting my GF to only pay attention to me, but I dont say a word to her and just keep it in. 

Last month I slipped up and told her she should stop going over there so much (the mother lives about 40 minutes away one way. She snapped (which I have never seen her do before) and immediately apologized and went to lay down. I suggested what if her mom moves into the house so it'd be easier to take care of her. The mother came over a few days ago, GF and I had a spare room with its own bathroom and right next to the kitchen in the front of the house. Almost like a mother in law suite. No stairs anywhere in that area, we spruced it up, everything was ready. She came over and within three hours she was angrily yelling how she cant do this, the lights are to dark, its wood floor, why are there windows in the room, etc. It continued on for hours alternating between crying and shouting at my GF about things that could be remedied easily. GF took her mom back to her mothers house and has been there since. I decided to go over to the mothers house after work with some extra clothes so I could help out. My GF actually smiled at me for the first time in a while and not beaten down smile she used to give after dealing with her mom all week. Her mother immediately started screaming at her how much of a terrible daughter she was for allowing a man into her home. I told the mother I was just going to cook and clean around the house, I can stay in a hotel. I'm just here to help out (GF). The mother screeched at her daughter refusing to address me, how much of a disappointment she is (referring to my GF), etc. Getting flashbacks of my own mother I lost it and yelled at her in a very loud voice that she is a miserable withered (c word - yeah I used the nuke against a women) and thats why she will always be alone and alone with nothing but her disgusting personality and failing body as the only thing left in her life. 

That was a few days ago, and my GF just told me meekly ""I understand what you were doing, but I think you're making it worse, maybe you should just head home and kissed me on the cheek and went back inside where I could hear her mother begin her tirade against her again. For the first time since I was a child, I cried. I actually cried and I feel so emasculated after doing it. I'm sorry for this wall of text, but I just want my SO back.

We were both kinda sad, lonely people who found each other in a stroke of luck, fell in love, and life has been a dream since.

Lately she has gained a lot of confidence, has an active social life and is living pretty happily, while I'm severely depressed and lonelier than before. I'm very proud of her. She loves me and cares for me so much, she is the only thing that keeps me going. But I'll be honest, I'm kind of a burden on her. I have absurd no one except her, no friends, no life, nothing. She is my angel. But I'm not serving any purpose in her life.

She regularly has to make time to cater to my emotional needs. I try not to take any time away from her social life, but I'm a very negative person to be around. I end up crying about being lonely and being a burden on her in almost every conversation. She insists that she will help me get through this, and that I'm not a burden, but I cannot shake the feeling that I'm holding her back from living a happy life with a happy, confident, social guy, who can probably make her happier than I can.

She has gone through something similar in the past, she was suicidal when we initially met. She pulled herself out of it, I tried to help the best I could, and she healed.

It will kill me to see her go, but it also kills me to see her have to put in so much effort to lift my mood every time. She has never once complained about it, but I know it is exhausting. I feel ashamed of myself every time I cry in front of her.

I am looking for some clarity in a fog.  My apologies because this is going to be a long one.  I (57m) and my wife (58f) are the typical long-term loving couple to our friends and extended family.  We have been married for just over 30 years with 2 grown children.  Both have Masters degrees and one is married with 3 children.  I think this is fantastic since I simply have a HS diploma.  To this, I give my wife credit.  In the early days, I worked long hours 6 days a week to establish myself and provide the best life I could for my family.  I tried hard to provide the best life I could for my family.  When my wife and I first dated, I was in the military.  She even went to a big city, slept with an ex, and admitted that to me years later when I questioned her.  Our marriage was great at first.  I grew up in a very compassionate house and was used to affection in the forms of hugs and hand holding etc..  My wife grew up in a house with an alcoholic father and a mother that was nurturing but not affectionate.  

&amp;#x200B;

When we met and started dating, my wife was affectionate and did not display any indication of not being comfortable with it.  We had sex several times a week.  By year 7 of our marriage, my wife was sleeping in another room, and I would have to beg her for sex once or twice a month.  She did not initiate sex again until I agreed to have another baby.  Once she got pregnant with our second child, that stopped. 

Over the years, this has caused issues to the point that I have felt that I live with my children and a roommate.  I have tried romantic vacations, leaving little notes in her car or purse for her to find, etc..  she stated that she had no sex drive.  I asked her to get help and see a therapist or something, and she refused.   4 times in our marriage, I asked for a divorce.  Each time she swore that she would get better and be more affectionate.  She would for a few weeks, and then it would go back to the way it was before.   I stopped asking for sex or bringing up the subject because it ""made her uncomfortable.""   Her response to this was business as usual.  Be the happy couple in front of everyone and ignore me when the kids and others are not around.  She would break down in tears and turn on the waterworks every time I told her I was unhappy in our relationship.  She did not skip a beat when I stopped trying to hug or hold her hand.  We didn't hold hands or hug for over a year until I sipped up and did it accidentally.  She did not hug me back.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that I was duped into getting her out of her small town with little future and giving her the life she wanted while sacrificing mine.  I know you folks are going to say it's my fault.  I agree; it is.  I should have gotten a when she lied to me the first time.  I have never cheated on her, even though I had a couple opportunities. 

There have been times when I thought she was getting her needs met else ware due to her not wanting me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes my ask.  I have come to the point that I no longer care about anything.  I was diagnosed with cancer a couple years back.  After surgery and treatment,it has left me incapable of satisfying any woman if my life depended on it.  I no longer feel like a man of any value, and being around someone that makes me feel like nothing more than a wallet makes it worse.   She says I'm her best friend and she couldn't think of life without me.  I feel like a tool.

He's always been obsessed with the stock market. I didn't understand he was day trading until a few months ago.

I estimate he's lost between 20-20k. It's at the point that he's moved back with his family so he can wake up early to trade with his brother.

I've told him to get involved in real estate but he won't listen and says 'real estate is too much work.'

The funny thing is, he keeps mansplaining this idea of financial freedom to me. I have a high net worth (300k) because I bought really early.

He comes from a very wealthy family and i don't think he feels the pressure if he makes a dire mistake. I come from a poor background and honestly it bothers me how he mismanages his money. He never has to worry about money or retirement because his family gifted him about 200k.

Everything was amazing in my relationship &amp; it was nice once we began living together. I was able to receive Fasfa, so I took the opportunity to become a full time student. That led to me not being able to keep my full time job, so I ended up becoming a SAHGF. I wasn’t ok with being one, as I’ve always preferred to work &amp; afford myself… but he had a decent paying job where he’d be gone most of the day &amp; it was only fair for me to tend to him &amp; the home.  Fast-forward a year later (It’s the beginning of 2022), he quits because it’s not paying well anymore. He’s been at home ever since. I’ve gotten so fed up being stuck at home &amp; doing all the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, etc. I live a fitness lifestyle where I do not eat like most ppl… meaning, I’ve been having to do double the breakfast, dinner, &amp; lunch (2 different meals being made bc my BF doesn’t eat how I do). I recently decided to go work again bc I couldn’t stand being a housewife. He still asks me to make him food after I’ve come home (he’s home all day. He doesn’t work. He didn’t want to work so he could focus on his business &amp; he had money saved up for bills. But after running out of $, he’s been looking again). I’ve stopped working out just so I don’t have to make myself meals bc I have to make all of his. I haven’t kept up w myself (hair, nails, lashes) how I used to when I had my job. This might be dumb, but being a SAHGF with time made me become depressed. I’m always doing chores &amp; cleaning up after him. It feels like my relationship became 75/25% … I don’t even remember the last time he fed our pups. He wakes up late because he stays up late… every day/night. He can’t even make an egg. I’ve told him how to cook some stuff, how to use a washing machine/dryer, etc. He still hasn’t done it. I’m afraid that I will continue this job I’ve started &amp; I will have to come home &amp; still do everything. I had someone tell me I should be grateful to have been a housewife bc I’m living “the dream that most American women would want”. It’s not a dream for me. It’s become something dreadful. He’s an amazing guy towards me, he loves me &amp; I love him. I just realized from living w him, that he doesn’t help out with house chores after being home for months.

This is the most serious and fulfilling relationship I have ever been in and she has stated on several occasions that I am “perfect” and “exactly what she was looking for all along”. 

Over the last 2-3 months this relationship has become less passionate which is largely stemming from her not replicating feelings. I have tried everything from taking her on dates, bringing home flowers and gifts, basically, I never stopped pursuing her even once we were officially together. I moved in with her in May which we both decided was best but pushed by her rather than me. She know feels like this might have been a mistake. We have been communicating and she has stated several times that she “loves me” and “wants me and this relationship”, yet, she feels like the passion or oomph is missing.

I have eventually asked her if she wants to break up which she denied. But now she asked me if I could stay away for a week so she can reevaluate what’s going on with her because in her own words “this is all me and it’s something inside of me and I don’t know what it is.”

Yesterday was the second night away of me sleeping at a friend’s house. I am slowly but surely falling apart. I’m suffering emotionally to the point where I don’t want to eat or sleep or think.

I am granting her the wish to stay away and have not been texting her unless she texts me which she does every day to check in and wish me a good morning and a good day and to tell me good night. She always tells me “I love you.” as well.

We go to work, come back home, one of us cooks dinner and then we watch a show while eating. The other cleans up. My fiancé watches basketball until bedtime. I try to watch it with him despite not being a huge fan, but he's busy chatting about it to his buddies on his text chain. So, I've lost interest as it's not quality time to me. It is to him. So I end up doing chores or reading by myself. Then it's time for bed. Repeat. 

The weekends we tend to be swamped with hanging with other people. I try to make the most of our car rides or errands, but I talk to him and get little response back. I'll ask him about work and family or anything interesting and he will answer with one word answers. Then one weekend a month he goes out of town to visit friends, so then it feels like I haven't seen him in weeks. He's also busy planning a charity event, so I give him space to do that, but still...

I know he's exhausted most days and even if I get him to go out of the house with me the conversation doesn't ignite at all... But it crushes me that with his buddies and family he's animated &amp; has tons of things to say.

So I feel like I just work and spend my evening doing nothing and life is flying by. At work I rarely talk to people, so I feel extra lonely.

We've both been in multiple relationships over the time we've known each other, so there was never a time we could really connect in that manner. 

Over the past few years we've grown much closer and realized how much we love each other first and foremost for who we are, our persons. It's what's made our friendship last so long, never been in heated argument, always been sweet and sincere to each other. 

We've visited each other a lot over this past year and strong feelings started to develop. I've always liked her and always thought she liked me back, but we had put those feelings aside to respect any time we were with someone else. We mean the world to each other. 

Now, pandora's box has been opened. We both confessed our love for each other one night, made out and it felt like the biggest validation I've ever felt. The girl of my dreams loves me, this never happens right? 

My takeaway from that night was I'm worthy of this type of love. I won over someone who checks what feels like every single box for what I want in a partner. She's emotionally intelligent, teaches me things, we bond over music, nature, art, makes me laugh laugh, you name it! She values those same things within me, but most importantly, we reciprocate the love languages we both hold with the most regard. Now that I know that pure love exists and I've felt it with my own heart, I should seek it out in my own world. In the same right, we're going down a dangerous, adulterous path.

I was on the verge of ending an unhappy relationship, I was pouring out more of myself than I was being given back. Obviously, I couldn't help but think of how my best friend makes me feel and through a lot of introspection, I ended what was causing me pain. It wasn't a direct correlation, but it had some influence. I wasn't ending what I had to get with my friend, the focus was on bettering myself and searching for what I deserve.

Things have only gotten harder. Since the first night of my friend and I confessing our feelings, it's only grown. There was another night of heated passion. We are now in love with each other and can't get each other off our minds. She is also going thru similar dissatisfaction with her husband and wants the bond that we have. We both know she has a commitment to working on their marriage to make it work, I support her.

I don't want to ruin what we have, I love her so much it hurts and I want what's best for her. Part of me wants to be what brings out the best in her, she wants to do the same for me. We feel we are getting in the way of each other and will lead to hurting one another.

Before the incident things are going great we celebrated our half year anniversary and have been really grateful to each other. On Tuesday morning she had to go to class at 11AM but decided to not go which is fine and she does it often and would rather catch the class in middle of it. Around an hour later I tell her we should get up and she doesn't really respond so I start wearing my clothes and cleaning things up as I most of the times have to get her out of bed because she is a lazy and likes to have me get her out of bed. When she's halfway done clothing she sighs and says she doesn't want to go to class because her kidney has been hurting which is true and may be acute depending on the severity. The initial pragnosis is kidney stones. And I tell her it's fine we can stay too. She keeps wearing her clothes and starts trying to decide whether to go or not. At this point I am waiting for her to make her decision. She asks me if she is being annoying and I said a little bit. She decides to stay and so I go back to lay on the bed waiting for her to come cuddle. And that's when she just left without a word. I followed her out and followed her to her uni but she said nothing. After I got home I texted her about some home stuff and why she left of course I was angry and hurt by her action of just leaving me there. She said she didn't want to be a nuicanse so she left. And I didn't really get it but I didn't want to turn it into a big argument so I told her I understood. (We both have our own places so sometimes she spends the night with me and then with her family). In the evening I ask her if I could come with her to the hospital and accompany her while she's giving tests as this is something we agreed upon in the morning. But she says she will be a nuicanse so no I can't come along. I was upset by this as well. She was giving me the cold shoulder the next afternoon as well and things seemed to be warming up so we decided to meet. On my way to her house I suddenly realized the way she has been treating me was not fair and even if it was because of her sickness and hurting she should say she acted that way because of it instead of going about it as if it were normal. By the time I got there I was really upset, the plan when I left my house was to go shopping and maybe spend the night togethor. But when she came out I wanted to sit down and talk. She was confused and asked me whatsup multiple times. I explained to her why I was upset she explained herself back to me. The exchange became vicous as I told her she plays the victim card and her leaving me felt like she was dumping me which she didn't understand, and I didn't understand why she left me because I told her she was being a little annoying. After awhile I told her I wouldn't have come if you weren't sick and she took that very personally, and it came out wrong. I meant I to say I understand why you're being mean, it's because you're hurting. We kind of end things off there and we agree that I shouldn't call her annoying and she shouldn't leave me. That was yesterday , now today I messaged her in the afternoon and she said nothing much so I just left it there. In the evening I wanted to patch things up and sent a kissing emoji and she asked me if I was messaging the wrong person. I let it slide and asked if we were fine and she said she doesn't want to play the victim card again and won't explain herself. I tell her what I feel sorry for and regret and the things that upset me. She said sheliked being taken care of and emphetized with while sick but she won't show weakness and tells me I shouldn't ask her about her sickness ever. I thought this will never work.

Me(22M) and my gf (21F) have a relationship for almost 2 years. 
Both of us models , we were working in China for all this time. I can swear this is the girl of my life and she thought the same till recently. 
I had to leave china and go back to my country and she went to her home also(Russia). We didn’t see each other since August and I’m dying to see her like a dog. 
When I left we promised each other that we FaceTime every day when possible but the problem was that I’m a bit addicted to video games… it was not a problem till one day she started to cry because I was not answering to her or I was saying something just to end the conversation. She told me many times how she feels and every time I said I won’t do the same mistake.  I want to say that my feelings for her never changed and I love her like crazy and I can’t wait to see her but I think she lost feelings for me. Yesterday she went to sleep without a saying anything and in the morning I got a long message saying “We need a brake”. I was shocked seeing the message and I called her. She explained me how she was crying at night because she doesn’t feel the same as before and I did all of this. I told her that I’m sorry for being so rigid towards her feelings and I asked her to block me everywhere because I couldn’t tolerate the pain. Usually I’m very dead inside  when it comes to expressing feelings because of my past but being without her for 4 months and all of this made me realize that I was the problem. After I deleted all her contacts, I texted her one last message saying that I can change and I know for sure.
Guys, do you think I deserve a chance? And do you think I will be able to make her feel the same? I don’t want to waste her time. She is the best I could wish but I don’t wanna make it worse.

Right before Covid, I (37/F) ran into a childhood friend (37/M). Over time we reconnected and eventually started dating. He moved in with me after two years, and everything changed. I have never experienced a situation like I am currently, and I cry daily about it with a feeling of no way out. Luckily the only abuse I'm not experiencing is physical, and sadly I'm so grateful for that. He works five days a week, but he abuses alcohol and cocaine on his days off. The outcome of his substance abuse creates a paranoid monster who makes me feel like a prisoner in my own home. He accuses me of not being at work, makes up outlandish stories to accuse me of cheating, is convinced I'm sleeping with co-workers, demands to dissect my phone, verbally abuses me, and turns my home into a drug den for 2-3 nights every week. If I had been living with him in his space, I would have left months ago, but the apartment is mine and the lease is in my name only.

I've tried to get him to go peacefully since July, even offering to pay him to leave so he can have money to move elsewhere. I have been so kind and caring, just someone he doesn't deserve. I know this isn't the lifestyle I deserve, and I'm worth much more. I don't know how to get out of this situation without calling the cops on him. My lease is up in February, and I love my apartment.

So Jake used to like me a few years ago when we were in the same school. At that time, i genuinely used to consider him a friend and it got very awkward when he confessed that he liked me. A few days ago, we met after years and it was genuinely nice. I found him cute. Idk if he still likes me or not but my sister says he does. My sister and Jake were best friends since school and talk once a few months due to busy lives. She knows him really well. So I do agree with her. But i really don't know. Because Jake is just genuinely a caring, fun, helpfull guy. Everyone in his college likes him because of his personality. 

When I saw Jake a few days ago, the first thought that crossed my mind was ""he's cute"" and he was caring towards me in small ways. Like, letting me walk on the inner side of the road, etc. 

It's been after a long time that I've genuinely liked someone and see my future with them. Jake and me have been talking since a few days and we're becoming close friends. I'm someone who doesn't want kids. There's only one way I'll agree to having kids in the future - if I love my partner so much that I want to start a family with them. And even tho I don't ""love"" Jake yet, but I can see that happening. 

However, I'm bisexual. And i do believe in soulmates. And idk why, since a few months, I've been feeling like my soulmate is a woman. I can't explain it ... It just feels like something so natural for me and something that's meant to happen

The thing is, I don't want to waste any more time dating people. I want that, the next person I date will be the person I marry. If i don't see myself marrying that person, i won't even talk to them. 

Anyways, I've done a lot of overthinking on this. I just want to know ... Should I tell Jake that I like him? That i find him cute? Or probably wait for a few weeks/months and see how it goes?? I feel like I'll just keep liking him more and more. 

There's the chance that down the line, we end breaking up ... And this way, our sweet friendship will end too. And after all, i don't really know if he actually likes me or it's just his nature. But I did feel cared for, I felt comfortable around him even after years

My (my m26) gf (f22) has met a guy wo she doesn't feel in love with but she wants to have the experience of being single. 

She also said that she really wants to be able to have the option to be spontaneous about flirting and having intercourse with other guys.

My girlfriend with and I have met about 4.5 years ago and started dating shortly after.

In the first 3 years she was living in another country about 8h of driving distance away. We were only able to see each other every 2 to 3 weeks.

When we met I was in a really dark place and depressed for about 7-8 years. I tried many things form therapy to hobbies and many other methods to make me feel any ambition to stay alive.

Then I met her.

She was like me living with her parents at that time. Her life was also very difficult. She has a brother who is a few years younger which is really getting spoiled while she was never treated well.

She hated her mom and her stepdad and did not have many friends.

She was just waiting to finish high school to move out and start a new life.

When we met for me she instantly was the thing inn life I always needed to feel happy again. I haven't felt happy since i was about 12 and it was almost a nee feeling for me.

I'm a pretty good looking guy and i had plenty of options to date girls I was interested in but I always felt the need of receiving happiness.

So my girlfriend was the girl I chose and for me it was a decision to spend the rest of my life with her.

Many times she told me she felt the same way about me.

We spent all nights face-timing together and we spent almost every second together we could.

After 3 years she finished school and immediately moved to my country.

We got a small apartment and have started to live together happily.

We have lived together for about 15 months now. Still she hasn't made any friends unfortunately.

Adding to that everybody we know always said that I'm the perfect boyfriend. Also she always said that and still does.

I am really selfless, caring and when the situations requires it sensitive.

I always did everything I could so that she got everything she wanted. I spoiled her as far as my financial situation lets me (I earn more than her). I regularly did things she found very romantic and anytime I spent time with friends she came with me if she wanted. My friends see her as a valuable group of our circle of friends and my family made her feel really comfortable. She told me and my mom (separately) that she feels that my family is giving her the feeling of the family she always dreamt of.

The only thing I always asked her not to do was getting a tattoo, because I'm

not a big fan. Other than that i supported almost every decision of hers, or at least talked about why I thought differently about certain things.

5 days ago she met a guy who was visiting her workplace as a promotion salesman. 2 days after that she spent a day with him because she liked the vibe and thought he was a nice person. He approached her by trying to kiss her and trying to grad her waist which she refused. He knew that she is in a relationship and she told him that she refused him because of that. She also told him that she wasn't uninterested either. She just doesn't want to cheat on me.

A day after that she wanted to break up with me but wasn't sure about it.

Besides listing a few things that she doesn't like about me she confessed that she felt a really strong sexual tension towards this guy. And that she is thinking about breaking up because she is afraid to loose the option of having intercourse with him. She also doesn't have any feelings for him besides finding him nice and sexually attractive (This is what I understand the least. How could she want to break up over a guy she has absolutely no feelings for.

We had a long talk and i was really understanding even tho usually this is a big no-go for me. Her honesty made it so that i could really understand her argument of wanting to have the freedom she never had.

She told me she is thinking that she rushed in into our relationship too fast 4 years ago. She always wanted to get away from her parents and was so looking forward to finally be happy. (I think that at that point she really forgot about her diagnosed depression and was believing in a fantasy of just instantly being happy when she moved in with me and never being unhappy or depressed again).

I replied that I'm thinking that she is rushing into whatever she is hoping of having with this guy. And that think that she is is putting a lot at stake for just wanting to try if she liked being single.

She told me that she still loves me a lot but she feels that I can't make her happy anymore. She began to list things that made her feel stressed and unhappy.

Like her doing the majority of the chores (about 70/30, I work more than her tho)

or that I am not improving at things she didn't like about me like sports and losing weight( i have started sport and healthy dod 2.5 months ago and lost 7kg since).

I begged her for a second chance and I'm trying to improve even more,. Since then I started jogging and doing even more home workouts. I told her to go and get a tattoo and generally just do whatever she wants so that she can fully be herself.

I offered some distance, by moving to my parents for some time so she could have sole time to see if she misses me or if she felt like she was better off without me.

Even tho she gave me a second chance I just feel that she is just prolonging the relationship for some time. She told the guy that she was staying with me and quit texting with him.

I started to drop many bad things about my personality. For example I never wore my favourite clothes because I just kept them away in fear of them not being new anymore. She told me on several occasions that she thought that that was a stupid thing to do to which I agreed. But I just couldn't bring it over myself to change it. Now i did. I unboxed my favourite sneakers i bought 3 years ago and wore them for the first time. The same thing with a sweater i never wore and had for over 2 years.

I am very claustrophobic and just started facing my fear and for the first time since we live in this house I started taking the elevator.

Now she thinks I'm overdoing it with the chance even tho i told her that I was only going to chance things about me that I also agree with that they would make sense in any way. Like doing more sport and such. Also i offered her to pay for a tattoo of her choice just so she had another reason to just be herself a little bit more which she happily agreed to.

She agreed to go to couple therapy with me and our first meeting is in 5 days which I am really looking forward to. If she was completely sure about being happier without me I'd let her go without trying to hold her back and just let her be happy. But I am really thinking that she is making a mistake.

What makes me think that is that she is really insecure. Compliments and attention make her very happy.. even more than most people. And the guy who btw is really good looking made her feel very pretty and she felt like he was way out of her league (she feels that way about me too). So I'm just afraid that she is again rushing into something just expecting to be instantly happy.

I told her that and she agreed but said that she wouldn't know except if she tried.

I really would not mind living with my parents for a while and her living by herself to find out and think about what she really wants. But she told me of we took a break she would want to try to have intercourse with said boy just so she knew if that made her happy. And that is a dealbreaker for me. Monogamy, honesty and just wanting the best for esch other is essential for me.

After the talk in some situations she behaves like nothing happened and jokes around with my happily. In others she just looks at me and tells me she doesn't know what she wants. She still cuddles with me and kisses me too like before.

I really don't know what to do.

I feel like i'm losing her and that she is making a big mistake. Not for me but for her. I don' doubt her finding somebody but I was so often told by people that they haven't met anybody who supports and loves as unconditionally as me.

I am now even thinking about an open relationship so that she could experience the things that she thinks would be right for her. That even tho it is something I always thought wouldn't be anything I'd ever try.

Is there something anyone would suggest?

I am really in a tough place and I don't know what to do.

I need some advice as to how to proceed, or not, with my family’s thanksgiving plans. 

I (37F) currently have plans to attend a family thanksgiving next week at my father’s house (70M). My mother passed away when I was significantly younger and my father has been in a state of arrested development since then, especially in regards to myself and my brother (35M). My dad has been married to my stepmother (57F) for about 15 years, but now they’re currently in divorce proceedings (yay) and his state of mind is not well. He’s never ever handled emotions well, but especially lately he’s been extra out of sorts. He’s extremely quick to fly off the handle, and will do so over very small things. It’s very difficult to speak with him, and I also have difficulty handling him as well because I am not a very strong person and do not stand up for myself. He’s also become very much into right-wing politics which is also a source of contention as everyone else in our family and his friends circle is left leaning or bordering on progressive. He constantly talks about Tucker Carlson and the “woke agenda” ruining the country. 

Last night he and I got into a major argument on the phone. I won’t go into details because it’s not relevant, but I stood up for myself and told him at the end “if this is how you’re going to act then I’m not coming to thanksgiving” and I hung up the phone. He tried to call me back and I ignored that, and he texted me “you gonna hang up on me again?” I told him I needed some time. 

I don’t know how to proceed. I want to see the rest of my family, but at this point I want nothing to do with him. I’m so angry at how he’s choosing to behave, as I know he sees nothing wrong with his actions. We have attended therapy together about 6 months ago, and it did nothing for him. After that, he would give m responses that would start with “in the spirit of our therapy…” which was just DRIPPING in sarcasm. It was extremely belittling and felt like my emotions and feelings were irrelevant. 

I want him to understand that his actions have consequences, but I don’t know if skipping thanksgiving is going too far? Shortly after thanksgiving he will be leaving the state for the winter so it will be awhile before I see him again. I spoke with my brother about this who has actually bore the brunt of my dad’s wrath during our lives, and he said that no matter what I choose he will support me.

At least, that's what he told me.

Growing up, my mother and dad battled constantly over his excessive use of pornography and it eventually lead to the end of their marriage, so my view point of porn started out negative from a young age. I have a firm grasp of why men look at porn, and I understand that it is a stimulus. My problem is, I find it to be disrespectful and gross if you're viewing these things while in a relationship.

Last night I had to ask my boyfriend to come out of the bathroom (almost two hours had passed, and fucking hell bro did I have to pee), and he sounded panicked when I knocked on the door and told him, he took a while to come out and he emerged completely naked, and very clearly aroused. The panic was clear on his face, and for some reason I felt the need to ask ""what were you looking at in there?"" kind of expecting ""Instagram, amazon...etc"" but instead he said ""things."" and I'm like ?????? what kind of things, and he proceeds to tell me 3 different lies over the course of 5 or so minutes. Tried to tell me he was masturbating looking at pictures of me, but when he went to open Snapchat the program had an update that wouldn't let him view the app (strike 1) he then tried to say he was just thinking about me and doing things (wrong again, strike 2) and then he said he was just looking at duffel bags on Amazon (strike 3). everything about his body language and the way/what he was saying just didn't hit right. So I said, this is your last chance to tell me the truth unless you want me to kick you out of my house (we're currently in my apartment), and I asked, were you looking at porn? or things you shouldn't be?

Long silence. he stares at me, weighing his options I assume, and then he said, Yes. He told me he was reading erotic boards on 4chan, apparently reading a story about a woman who was tied up and blindfolded, and there was men doing things to her, like using toys on her, tickling her...and this freaks me out, I couldn't believe he'd read something like that.

We’ve talked about it but she usually says this relationship isn’t just about sex. I feel like it has to do with stress because we both have career jobs and go to college so we find it hard to see each other but we have our moments when we are alone and I try to make a move and she always just says not right now.

Title basically says it all.  I get regular massages - weekly or every other week.  I used to go to a massage store chain but a while ago switched to an app service that sends massage therapists to your home.  It is a bit pricier than the chain but not as pricey as a fancy spa, and I like that I can just take a shower, relax, etc., instead of immediately having to drive.

Anyway, I had the same therapist for several months now.  She is really great and has always been super professional.  Yesterday after massage and she was packing up and leaving she casually mentioned that next time, if I was interested, she would give me a blowjob for $50.  She offered it the exact way she offered hot stone massage a few weeks previously.  I was very surprised and said something like ""oh? great"" and she nodded and left.  

Since then my head has been spinning on all kinds of questions and hypotheticals. 

On the one hand - I am interested.  I've been married almost 30 years, and it isn't like I am getting a ton of BJs elsewhere and not to be crude but - the price is right.  

On the other hand, seems like a lot of potential landmines.  Do I have to worry about legality?  If I say no, will that hurt the professional relationship or has that bridge already been crossed when she offered?  What if I say yes and it is bad and I don't want to do it again, will she be insulted?  Is this something that is likely to escalate?  Should I just not mix these and find a ""sex professional"" if this is something I want?  And even if all of that works out, is it going to cause me some other problems if I start getting sexual satisfaction of any kind from someone besides my wife, even if she is OK with it?  And if I am not interested, do I just not bring it up and hope she won't either?  

Let's put aside for now the issue of my wife as that is actually the part I understand.  After 30 years, this will not be in the top 10 or even top 50 of difficult conversations.

He started buying a lot of new fancy underwear, along with toys that he tried hiding from me (this is unusual because I’m not against toys).

I had a bad feeling about all of this, so I saw an opportunity, and looked through his phone this morning (wrong of me I know). I eventually found that he was logged into a Reddit account I didn’t know about, and he had posted a nude photo of him looking very feminine in “StraightToSissy” with the tag “seeking bois/sissies”. This is really bothering me because it feels like a form of cheating. It seems like the tag suggests that he’s looking to engage with other people in a sexual manner, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting.

- he believes it’s normal to be friends with his exes but gets jealous when his partners have male friends. 

- he may or may not have several phone #s, some are through text now

- he has harassed or stalked me and at least one other female friend he has had for a long time. He does this through anonymous social media accounts. He asks for selfies and offers to buy you things. He has sent me cashapp money which I kept and blocked him. 

-he never shared with me who he dated, like their names or pretty much anything about them…

- he randomly told me quickly into dating him he was taking a trip to the mountains to meet his ex and friend and I didn’t question it…ofc I was worried but I let it go

- he pretended to be a female he went to college in another state with and messaged me on instagram trying to get me to text him at his number. When I declined he became pushy asking for selfies and harassed me on/off 5 years..while engaged too..

- he had pics of the girl he was pretending to be in her bra and underwear and sent them to me when pretending to be her and also claimed he was bisexual hoping I’d send a photo 

- he refuses to tell me AS HIMSELF the actual name of the girl he sent me photos of…

- he sent me photos of his and his new fiancés cats a few weeks ago and made the mistake of sending me a photo that had the reflection of the “girl he went to college with” in the mirror in the picture taking the photo of one of the cats…these cats are on his new fiancés Facebook so I know they are hers at least I think so…

- he pretended to be interested in skateboarding to strike up conversation with me on Facebook as himself and was at a skatepark me and my bf frequent a lot…

- he told me he’s engaged and buying a house…that’s how he started the conversation maybe to lie and make me jealous? Idk idc..

- he told me he wants to be my friend and I declined several times and he guilt tripped me into responding and then sent me a shirtless photo. I blocked him and he found me on another platform and was upset with me and I called him out on his crap…

- he asked me MULTIPLE times not long ago to meet him at 2am at taco bell or 1am for coffee and other weird times to which I said no…he even tried bribing me with free food and offered to buy me $200 roller skates…

I (M26) and my wife (F26) have been married for almost 3 years and were dating for about 1.5 years before that.

A little bit after getting married, I made the mistake of flirting with other women online (it's a habit that comes and goes for me, but I haven't been able to completely shake it) and my wife found out. Huge argument, talked it over, and decided to make it better. So I tried for the next year. It felt like it was getting better, but after about a year everything just kinda stopped progressing. Nothing seemed to change but the problem wasn't fixed yet.

This past year I've just felt my motivation to try decreasing. Anytime she asks we talk about it, but it's frustrating because it feels like it's been the same conversation for the past year. She hasn't moved on from it any more than when it happened and she tells me that it's perfectly reasonable for her to be upset about it. Which I agree with, but I don't feel like it should be the same intensity as almost 3 years ago.

Despite what I've tried, it doesn't feel like she's moved on from it at all. She hasn't been working for the past few months and now problems about me have been popping up all over the place because she doesn't have anything else to think about except her family (which is a huge mess) and I finally snapped last week and yelled at her.

Since we've been married I've been paying more attention to my emotions and I'm pretty sure I have depression or possible bipolar disorder or something similar. I wasn't as in touch with my emotions before we were married, so I honestly can't tell whether I had this before or if it's a product of the marriage. I just don't ever remember being this sad or frustrated as often as it's been happening since I've been with her.

Add onto this that it feels like she doesn't do much and it's kinda frustrating. She cooks, and helps clean a little bit. I clean the dishes, do most of the laundry, deal with the trash, take care of the pets, deal with the yard. Then she just wants to go spend money. I'm home from work and she just wants to spend the whole evening together but I want to go paint or read a book or something. We even moved so she could be near her family but her family just frustrates both of us. And now she wants a kid while neither of us have any money saved. 

She's a great woman, but I feel like I need a break and that she'd be happier with another man who can match her energy or something. I don't know what to do and I feel awful for considering divorce, but I'm tired of everything. 

Unless I concede and apologize, arguments can last for 3 or 4 days. It's ""not fair"" for me be frustrated if she was frustrated first.

Bf: 25M, Venezuelan immigrant with asylum status pending. In the United States for 16 months now (July 2021 arrival). Working \~10/wk doing DoorDash on his bike.

We met on Tinder in October 2021 and have been dating about 13 months now.

When I first met him, I thought he was in shock from immigrating/trauma and he had no lawyer or understanding of the process of how to apply for asylum. His entire family was here and had been through the process, but he did not ask them how to begin. He did not have a fake ID or work permit (it takes 180 days after applying, and he hadn’t applied for asylum); his entire family got fake IDs when they arrived and worked as soon as they got here, getting apartments, etc.

I’ve helped him:

* Figure out how to work under my name on DoorDash on an electric bike; I helped him with the bike and he paid me back with his earnings
* Organized a meeting with his sister to talk to her about the asylum legal process/work permits. He ended up being late to that because he “lost track of time” and was playing video games with his ex, online. This prompted a huge fight, as he disrespected her time and my attempt to help him figure out his life. He literally kept playing the game bc it was online/penalty for leaving early and we were already late.
* Find a lawyer, as he was avoiding it. I called many and drove him to his appointments.
* Find medication he needed daily in a pinch where he was completely relaxed about it, it took me hours and a Redditor helped me out of compassion.
* Keep track of his immigration appointments. When I started my full-time job (while in full-time school), I told him he needed to be on top of them. He missed an ICE appointment that I had half-assed saved in my personal calendar I never check, and I happened to check that day. Luckily he did not face any consequences and was able to go the next day, but he could have been deported. This started a huge fight about responsibility.
* Moved to a more expensive apartment after 6 months so that he could DoorDash with the agreement he would pay $200/week to help with rent/groceries. He has not DoorDashed nearly as much as he said he would, often “tired” (although he never goes for more than 3-4 hours a day, TOPS). He averages about $100-150/week, which he can make in 3 3-hour trips.
* How to expedite his work permit - I did a lot of research on reaching out to congressman, that talking to USCIS is useless, etc. and he did not even know the name of his application or work permit, and stated he thought he’d just call USCIS.
* Where to find Spanish-speaking jobs and also how to get a free college education working at Starbucks or Target, and what that process would look like (he wants to be a graphic designer and had to stop bc Venezuela crashed)
* Create and put up fliers for dog-walking and graphic design, all over town. I had to beg him to complete the fliers.
* His family just asked him for us to bring the turkey to his thanksgiving. I had never made a turkey and I thought it was a big ask, but I told him I needed his help figuring it out. I’ve been the one finding the tools we need/timeline for cooking, and it’s annoying he hasn’t taken any initiative.

Basically, idk if I’m doing something wrong trying to figure things out that aren’t mine to figure out. I then resent him a bit because I have never seen him take initiative or try to research a situation that is affecting him or something he can take responsibility for. I have talked to him about taking more responsibility for figuring out his own life, more recently for being more strict with himself with DoorDash (I can’t just not work when I’m tired, nobody can). He also just does not know how to research things and figure them out, maybe?

I know it’s my fault for assuming responsibility when he does not. And I try so hard to be compassionate about his asylum process and the ways it affects his mental health. It’s just hard when I always have to be empathetic and carry the weight, when I am also working full-time and in school.

Her parents are very well-off and paid for her school and living expenses, and would give her money whenever she needs. Since she's finished school she's been on and off employed, with little to no savings. Sometimes she has a job, sometimes she doesn't. In my case, I grew up with parents who were solidly middle-class and valued independence and hard work. I've been employed or in school since I was 16 and have worked for 4 years now in a 9-5 job with decent salary.

When it comes to money and relationships, I've always been the type to look towards sharing mutual benefits and taking advantage of ""economies of scale"" for being a couple. She feels like doing this become a ""money, money, money"" type of talk and she's not comfortable with some things.

For example, I saved for five years for a down payment and bought a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom house recently. Prior to that, we were renting an 1-bedroom apartment together, splitting about $900 each on rent. I asked her if she could pay ""rent"" to me of $700 a month. Currently, I pay close to $2400/month for the house, of which $1700 goes straight to the bank for interest or through taxes/maintenance/utilities, etc. Only $700 goes towards the principal of the house. However, she says she's uncomfortable with me being a ""landlord"" and her being my ""tenant"". She would rather live by herself and pay some $1800 in rent, or with a roommate and pay $1100, than pay me $700 to share a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom house. She was more comfortable paying some random landlord $900/month to share a 1bedroom apartment with me, than paying me $700/month to share a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom house.

I don't get this logic at all. I've tried to explain to her that we BOTH benefit from this. She gets to live in a better place for much less than she would have paid. I get some of my expenses covered. We both benefit because we now live together and don't have to spend time going back and forth to see each other. But for her, the label of her being a ""tenant"" is something that throws her off. 

Another example is we were talking about buying a car to share. I said if the car is, say, $30,000, I can pay something like $20000 and you $10000. She's not ok with that. She said she would either want to wait to save up so she also has exactly half, or that we should just buy 2 cars. 

Again, I don't get this logic at all. If we buy a car together, then we share the car. We both benefit Maybe I paid more, maybe you paid more. That doesn't matter. We have a car that we could not have gotten otherwise if we didn't pool our income. Why would we want to wait? Why in the world would we ever need 2 cars living downtown?

I can't seem to wrap my head around this. Is this an ego issue? Is this a self-pride concern? How can I approach her in a constructive way to discuss how we can both benefit?

He made hints about this when we first got together (been together for a year) but I sort of just ignored/brushed that information under the rug because I really wanted to be with him. 

I am in love with this man and I guess I always hoped he’d fall in love with me enough to not need or want anyone else. We have had a couple of conversations about it and how it’s still something he will want to explore in the future but admits that it might not be something he’ll end up enjoying. I’ve told him i’d consider it way further down the line when we have been together for a long time and I know that he’d never leave me for someone else. 

Here’s my dilemma, I’m in love, never felt this way about anyone before but I’m also the jealous type. The thought of him going on dates and sleeping with other women turns my stomach and I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle it if/when it does happen. 
We have discussed potentially having threesomes in the future and I’ve said that I’m happy for MFM but not MFF, I’m not into girls and I’d get too jealous of him touching another woman. 

I’m not sure what I want to gain from this post, maybe some advice from a couple who have gone through the same and how they managed to deal with an open relationship or if they managed to stay together when one wasn’t so keen on the idea.

I’ll keep things brief.

I matched with her on hinge and we instantly hit off. She was very excited to talk to me and we had a lot in common. We had our 1st date a week after matching and it was amazing. It was a Friday night and she texted me when she got home. She told me I was cute, how much fun she had and “where did I find you!?” I asked if she wanted to see me next Friday, so I agreed but she also said it’s too far away. So I asked her to go to a movie Tuesday since it was cheap movie night.

She vetoes the date idea and says she just wants to talk so I agree. We just go miniputting and talk. It was a good time. I asked her at the end of the night if I could kiss her and she got nervous and said no. She messaged me when she got home safe, apologized and said she got cold feet but wants to kiss me next time adding “you’re so sweet and understanding”.

She gets sick on Friday and Saturday but wants me to go see her Sunday so I agree. It was just a calm movie night in. She wanted another one on Tuesday as she couldn’t wait for Friday so I agree. Keep in mind she is sick so we can’t do too much.

She messages me Wednesday about how much she likes me. We have a good conversation and she goes to bed telling me she’ll talk to me tomorrow (today) and asked me a few questions so she can pick the convo back up.

Today she sends me a breakup text basically saying “i have so much fun with you but you don’t have the chemistry I wants in a partner and it’s a shame I was rooting for you”.

I’m just mind blown at wtf just happened. She tells me she wants me to focus on her not other girls, wants me to meet her family and how happy she is to meet me. And it was all ruined imo because she couldn’t see me just once a week. She rushed the process and ruined it. Also her comments insinuating it was me who fucked it up pissed me off. Her doing all that was the issue, not me referring to her as my girlfriend. She also told me when making out “you’re getting the hang of it and getting better”. 

I’m sad that someone I connected so well with ended up rushing things and blames me. I was so mad at her I just deleted her number before I could say anything I didn’t want to say.

She’s never put forth much effort on getting her license back either, all I really know is that it’s going to cost her quite a bit of money.
I have been giving my mom rides consistently since I got my first vehicle at the age of 16. She’s ALWAYS been terrible at offering any money for gas (every now and then she’ll give me a 5 or so) but I can probably count on all my fingers the amount of times she’s done that in the past 10 years.
I’m 26 now. Drive an old beater that gets me around but has had a fair amount of issues. Every time something happens she has never offered to help me out with the cost of getting the vehicle fixed. She just calls other people for rides and acts like it’s not her problem. But as soon as it gets fixed, she’s calling me for rides.
She calls last minute a-lot when she runs out of something she needs to get a ride to the store, she cleans houses so she relies on rides to her job sites, she relies on rides to the grocery store, she’s a hairdresser and relies on rides to get product… basically anywhere you could think of.
Every Thursday she needs a ride to the outskirts of town to a cleaning site which takes an hour total there and back both times. 
There’s Lyft, there’s instacart, there’s Amazon prime.. she got rid of instacart because paying 10 bucks a month was apparently too much when she pays $10 a day for a pack of smokes. She’s also still a nightly drinker and always has money for that…
I’ve tried telling her to look into Amazon prime, to get instacart again.. idk what else to do.

Started out with casual talk and meeting up, but we ended up hitting it off extremely well. 

In the beginning, we both said we weren’t really looking for a relationship at the moment. He went through a rough breakup with an abusive ex earlier in the year and I also went through a break up around the same time.

After a few weeks and seeing each other a couple times each week we started really hitting it off. We talked about how we like each other a lot, but said that we should take things pretty slow even though we felt a connection and we’re interested to see where things go. It was mutual and I genuinely felt/feel the same. 

We ended up going on a date to sort of solidify that this was more than just a casual thing. It was the best date I had ever been on in my life. The laughs, the connection, the butterflies, it was unlike anything I’d ever felt before. 

A month later and we started having some conversations about a relationship and he said he really really likes me but he’s just not ready for commitment yet. He’s working on himself, finding his independence, healing from past trauma and feels that he just can’t emotionally handle what a relationship is asking for right now. 

I definitely understand and support his feelings and realized that, for now, I think this is best anyway as I’m also still figuring some shit out myself. 

It’s been a little over 2 months total and I have definitely fallen for him. We see each other regularly about 2-3x per week. We go out together, do stuff together, hang out and relax. I feel so comfortable around him and for once feel like I can really be my true self around someone. He gets me on a level that I’ve never had before. 

I want more with him, but he doesn’t know when he’ll be ready (which is completely okay). I went into this not expecting to find someone like him and fall so hard. 

He says he doesn’t want to hurt me. He genuinely enjoys hanging with me and seeing me. He’s just not ready for the commitment. I told him it’s okay and that things can go at a slow pace and that I’d love to continue seeing him still. I want to respect him and his feelings. He told me that he doesn’t want me to be hurt and that if it becomes too much to handle then it might have to stop. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and there’s a lot of differing opinions.

I think right now where I’m also still working on myself a bit emotionally, I’m ok with the way things are, for now. It’s a little emotional but I’m handling it. If anything if anything serious did come out of this I think it would make us have an even deeper connection and respect for each other. 

I read that I should but a time table on it for myself. It’s already been a little over 2 months. I think I’ll gauge how I’m feeling in a few months. If I’m really feeling like I want to move forward with this and it’s emotionally getting harder to manage, I’ll talk to him about it and basically say that if he’s still not ready that it’s completely okay and that he has to do him, but that I don’t think I’d be able to continue with things as they are. 

Does this sound ok? Is waiting a few more months good? I think it could be really worth it. I don’t want to come at him with an ultimatum of basically “I want a relationship and if you don’t that’s fine, but I can’t continue this if not” and put him on the spot or anything, but I don’t know what else would be better.
