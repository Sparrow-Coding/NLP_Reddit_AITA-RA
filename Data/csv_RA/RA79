My husband (m41) of 16 years and I (nb38) have been through a lot in the last couple of years with a miscarriage, infertility issues, family deaths, and life during Covid. At some point in the last year or so I got sick of being yelled at during our arguments while I worked my damndest to keep my voice regulated and calm. It's been happening for years and years. I have tried over and over to point out that he is yelling to no avail and I'm tired of being disrespected. So I started matching his energy-he raises his voice to me, I raise mine. He escalates, I escalate. 

As could probably have been predicted this just ends in shouting matches over issues that aren't that big a deal and hurt feelings all around. 

I feel stuck because I'm not going back to being disrespected any time there's a disagreement. But I hate these fights. 

My husband is a good man, he just learned some toxic behaviors growing up, as did I, and we are having to unlearn them as adults.

What bothers me is that he still kept sending selfies after that ""incident"" so I just went along with it until I got fed up and ghosted him.

Mind you, he reaches out like once a week or perhaps, it takes 2 weeks for him to converse again. He sends messages, then vanishes. This happened for a year, but then, he's really busy due to military school.

Now that I already lose communication with him for almost a month, I see him getting more active with his messages which is like, daily (it's showing up in my mail notifications), which made me sad, because I had to resort to ""ghosting"" just to be noticed. It didn't have to be that way

I have a hunch telling me that he is intentionally waiting for me to do it first so he could bombard me with messages, then flip the narrative, and make me the villain (possibly tell other people I ghosted him [which is true] or some shit).

It occurred to me that maybe he just wants someone to be his sound board and ego boost. If I go back, I'd probably flooded by him talking about himself all over again.

He never asked me questions about myself. He has disrespected me before. He always wants to be validated. He commented on my skin tone and my appearance. He makes me feel dumb. This made me question on why I liked him in the first place now I'm still in the detaching mode.

We went slow, we texted a lot the last two weeks. We went for a short walk. She was getting a little warmer with me. Used 😘-Emojis. I thought, it went slow, but steady and great. Until last night. 

Let me say this first about her: She's like a rocker girl, likes to drink a lot on the weekends with her friends. She seems a little lost sometimes, doesn't know exactly what she wants but affectionate. Her excessive drinking is a bit of a red flag, but I was ready to overlook it for other positives.

Now back to the evening in question: I saw her in town drinking in a bar, she texted me from the other side that her group is going to the club. If I wanted to join. Since my friends went home, I told her ""maybe"", went to the club and she came out, drunk, with her friend trying to convince me to come in. I did, went in, and thought it was cute she wanted me to know her friends.

I had a great time with them, she was a little all over the place, but her friends really liked me they told me, I tried my best. Then, later that evening there was a guy always in her vicinity trying to dance with her. At first she was a little hesitant, but then he even tried to kiss her, on her cheek. She didn't push him away or something, I asked her friend who that was, she told me: ""a guy she knows from school back then"".

We went all back for a smoke,but then she went to the toilet with a friend. Her friend returned alone. I was skeptical, we went to the dance floor and I saw them again dancing with that guy, almost kissing. I was shocked and sad. 

She just saw me and turned away, I didn't understand the world anymore. I told her friend: ""hey im sorry, I came here for her, and not to watch her be all cuddly with another guy all the time. Tell her that, cause I'm going soon"". She understood and told me, she cant explain it, I deserved better. 

I grabbed my jacket and went home. 

The next day she wrote: I'm so sorry, no words are enough to apologize for my actions. I cant explain it even. I'd understand if you dont wanna talk to me anymore. I feel so guilty... terribly sorry.

I didn't text back yet. What can I interpret from that? Was she just keeping on the bench until the better guy came around? Is she just bad at saying no? I dont know what to do. She wanted to take it slow and goes 100 with another guy....what.

New here and I need your help. So I met this girl (22) right before I (21m) had to go abroad for studies and we made out. Even though it was only one date, I felt we really had a connection. After the date, she said she wanted to go out with me the next day (last day in the country), but she the didn´t answer all day. Because of that, I decided to text her on the day of the flight saying it was a disrespectful move. After that, she finally answered saying she liked being with me, but she decide she didn´t want to create attachment for a person who is leaving for some months. Nevertheless, she said she wanted to have a date when i returned.After 1 and 1/2 months i decided to return for 1 week due to family issues. So we went on a date and talked a lot and connected a lot and ended up having sex (my 1st time and she seemed more than okay with it). Two days after we slept together (no sex) and shared a lot of intimate stuff.On that day, she said she had to move (1st to a friends house and 2 days later to the new house) and could only go out with me on her free day from work. She didn´t answer to my texts for about 2 days which is understandable because she also works and she usually takes long to text. When the day arrived she told me at lunch time she was taking care of things and could only go at night. Later she said the day after only (last day in the country again).Because of this, i slowed down and waited for her message the next day and then we went out and had a good time. She knows I will come back in a month for Christmas, and in the end, she told me i should enjoy everything about going abroad (imo girls included), but she also said she wants to continue going out with me when i return and would find me texting her pleasant.Another important details are that she came to my country alone and before she left her homecountry, she broke up with her 4 year bf. Our first date was on her 3rd month here.I would appreciate some advice on what to do now.Before you give advice keep in mind that i get attached very quickly.

I didn't talk to him and how could I . I couldn't bring myself to say hi after what he said.

After few months, there was a program in our school. He saw me there and talked to him.( I had a gut feeling that he will talk to him that day.) He apologized for what he said. I again jokingly said that I knew I was annoying and he agreed.(what's the point of asking for forgiveness then?) He did said that I was only annoying sometimes.... After I asked what terms he wants to be with me or he just came to say sorry. He said that he was confused and didn't knew. After that I really didn't talk to him like always.  I only msg him if it was necessary.

Few months later, I hadn't talk to him for maybe 1 or 2 months straight.  He msg me and asked about a library nearby by house as he was intrested into light novel. While talking he called me friend. I asked if he meant that and he said yes.

Here is my professional life in one paragraph. I grew up solely focused on academics. All day, every day was focused on studying. People laughed at me for being weird and awkward but I didn't care. ""It'll pay off in the end"" I always told myself. And I was right. In high school I achieved a perfect GPA, perfect standardized test scores, got accepted into one of the best (if not the best) universities in the U.S., and in the world. I'm a third year student right now with internship offers from prestigious companies and I am on track to earn \~200k+ right out of college.

Everything went according to plan.

Now here is my social life in one paragraph. I have 3 near and dear to my heart friends from high school that I regularly keep in contact with (I call and play videogames with them almost every day). I am in a fraternity here at college, but I don't consider my frat bros to be as close (all they ever want to do is drink and smoke). I lift every day. I am very in shape. 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, with a 265 pound bench press. Almost everyday is the same. Lift, study, eat, videogames, pray, sleep.

This is my issue. I have never had a girlfriend, and I've never done anything sexual with a girl. I don't know any girls. I never talk to any girls. Occasionally, we'll host a party and I'll talk to one for 10 minutes. Then it gets boring and we drift away.

Above I've stated everything as factually as I possibly could. Now here I will go into my feelings. I feel like a robot. People ENJOY partying, they ENJOY getting drunk and doing stupid shit. They ENJOY going out. I would much rather stay in my room and play video games when I have free time. But of course, what girl would want to do that? I get ""matches"" on Tinder, but whenever I message them like ""how u doin,"" I don't get a reply (I'm not really into over-complimenting girls with weird pickup lines).

I'm really just unsure how to break out of this mundane life routine I go through. I want to get closer with my frat bros. I want to be with a woman.

In a very traditional sense I’ve always been a giver in relationships willing to go above and beyond to make my partner happy, and their lives easier. This involves cooking more often, cleaning more often, and doing things such as giving her a back massage before bed with little to no prompt as some examples. For the first 4 years I was okay with this expecting little to nothing in return for what I do for her. However lately the act of giving doesn’t bring me the same joy that it use to. There’s almost an underlying resentment at times, and this is because whenever I ask for something in return which is rare, she’ll either half ass it, make an excuse as to why she can’t, or tell me she’ll only do it if she gets something in return. 

It makes the relationship feel very one sided with certain aspects, and the feeling that her happiness matters more. Whenever I try confronting her and communicating about something I feel unhappy about, she typically shuts down emotionally, cries and this leads to me comforting her without the underlying issue being resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time posting on Reddit. A bit about me - I'm a 29 yo female, good job, good income, no kids, pretty ""normal"" (not crazy/mentally unstable). 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently ended a 4.5 year relationship with my ex. Almost instantly, this new guy (we will call him ""A"", 25 yo male) acquaintance, who had showed some interest in me prior to my being single, swooped in. He was there for me as a companion and friend while I was newly alone. He built my new build construction home, so I did have to deal with him for business matters a bit. He quickly became more than a friend. He had an anxious attachment style, I later learned (not a dealbreaker, just an observation). He was younger than  I and really truly looked up to me as an individual. I seemingly have my shit together at a young age and this was new and impressive to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the situation and my question:

This man did SO much for me. He mowed my yard regularly, he installed ceiling fans and specialty light switches, hung my tv, oil changes, changed out my wheel barrings, washed my car, took me to and from the airport several times and even went out of his way to pick up my dog from a boarding facility, prior to picking me up from the airport. This was all within weeks of me breaking things off with my ex of 4.5 years. This new man was extremely verbally affectionate and made sure to tell me daily what I meant to him. This was new to me and what I had needed and was missing in my past relationship. A began telling me he loved me within 2 months of us dating. So things moved very very fast. I want to make it clear - he was not/is not a narcissist because he helped not only me, but others as well - almost to an annoying degree. He was always helping everyone with tasks (that is not a narcissist trait - helping others). So I do not believe him to have been a narcissist. 

He did have abandonment issues. When he was 11, his mother went to prison for 6 years. He was primarily raised by his bio father and step mother. Bio dad was and still is extremely emotionally neglectful and very dismissive of A. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, things were great until mid-October. There were a couple occasions (only a couple) where I thought of my ex, and what he was up to. I didn't miss him or think of him sexually, but I just thought of him and wondered how he was. My sister told me if I was having these thoughts I should reach out because ""It's worth having a conversation"" since we were together for 4.5 years. But first, she told me I should take a break with A. To be fair to him, and myself, and to be true. 

I texted him saying ""I need to talk to you"". He immediately calls me. I tell him I think I need a little bit of a break. Room to breathe a little. He is shaken, and we end the call. He texts and says, ""I guess I should come get my stuff"". I agreed. So I packed up his things for him, very respectfully, and had his things bagged and ready to go when he got to my house. He was visibly shaken when he walked through the door. Total and utter shock. Devastation. He sat at my kitchen island and we talked for a while and I backtracked a bit, deciding we didn't need a BREAK, but just to SLOWWWWW down. He left in agreeance. 

That was 3 weeks ago now. He has, however, done a 180, and now says he wants to just be friends. Even after I have gone back to him and told him I messed up and that I'm sorry and that this time away from him has made me realize what we had and how special he was. He isn't having any of it. He says ""My walls are up, especially with you"". 

He has told me several times now that he only wants a friendship from me. He has even been mean about it. So my question is, did I permanently emotionally damage this kid so much that he will never turn back? Or is there still hope? Because I can honestly say I am madly in love with him and it has taken losing him for me to realize this. I recognize he, and I, have emotional baggage to deal with at individual levels, but it is my wish to do this together and not reject each other through the process. He has said he has made his decision and is sticking to it, even if it is selfish. 

So, what do you guys think? How much time do I give him before reaching out? This has been an absolute roller coaster of emotions and interactions and I think we are both exhausted from it. But the difference is - I miss him terribly. Does he miss me? If not, how is that possible when 3 weeks ago he was telling me he loved me?

So, i (22F) met my boyfriend (21M) not too long ago, in august, to be specific. Since day one, he has expressed the need to hang out with me before and after my work, which i obliged to, for i truly enjoy his company. After two weeks, he started sleeping over every night, leaving the following day when i'm off to work. Eventually, he asked if he could continue sleeping and wait for me to come back from work. I had nothing against it, as i fell head over heels for this guy. A few days after that he brought his stuff and moved in, to which i consented, as i live alone and he was a student who was looking for an apartment, and happened to be the guy i grew very affectionate of. He is a quiet and introverted guy, but he is so sweet to me, he showered me with future plans, ideas and compliments. Prince charming, it seemed. After 3 full months of me doing everything i could for him. (washed his laundry, made him all the meals he could ask for, listened to him, helped him resolve father-related issues, let him game for 7-10 hours a day, thinking it would give him all the freedom he needs) I also didn't make him pay any expenses, i truly wanted to help him and be there for him, also found him a job, so he can have money of his own and not feel stupid when i offer it to him. Suddenly, he became a bit distant, cold, didn't listen to me when i asked him if we could at least watch a movie together. After i pressed him about him being off, he finally confessed that he felt overwhelmed and that he needed alone time, as that was the only way of life he knew, so he proposed moving out and breaking up, thinking i'm way too attached to just let him move out and date like couples usually do. After convincing him that i would be okay with it and that there is no need to break up, basically begging him to stay (out of sheer fear of losing the one person who killed my loneliness and melted my long-frozen heart), we settled on me actually moving out and going to my parents' place, and him continuing to pay half the rent here, while i help him with the other half.

I have a fairly large pool of mates. I only have one true friend. Usually it takes a new person anywhere between 3-6 months of just acting like a good friend, not betraying me, not disrespecting me etc. to go from being considered a mate to a friend. 

Last year I met a guy. Not sure what it was - but we became very close very quickly. He speedran ‘friendship’. We would have spoken a lot over text and spent most of our time with each other. This lasted 2-3 months. 

Come the end of December of 2021 - we had ‘soft fallen out’. We were still cordial with each other - but we weren’t on ‘good terms’. Few weeks pass and I am given irrefutable evidence of a violation. He was formally declared an op. This was in early January. 

We didn’t speak at all or even see each other on the street for a solid 10/11 months. This obviously upset me greatly because I did love the guy a lot. Platonically. The upsetting thing was HE had initiated the friendship, and when we were on good terms he often shared with me that he felt the same about me as I felt about him. When he was declared an op - I had just assumed he was bullshitting the whole time. I just accepted that as fact.

Cut to the other day - I was needing to meet with a guy (local ‘florist’) and he informed me he was with the op, and that the op wanted to shake my hand and ‘settle beef’. 

I was just speechless. 11 months of radio silence and now I was being offered a truce? It was fishy. I was thinking things like ‘is it a setup? What does he want? Why does he even give a shit anymore? I suppose if it is a setup, he doesn’t give a shit…’ that kinda stuff. 

I went to meet them and… all went smooth. The guy was polite. Bit shy. Didn’t talk much. Didn’t shake my hand. I left assuming the ‘florist’ must have told him to behave and THAT’s why he said he wanted to settle beef. To make the sale go smoothly. That was fine by me, I didn’t think too much into it.

Now fast forward to yesterday. I ended up with a group of people and both the florist and the op was among them. As I was leaving with my boys, we exchanged fist pumps and handshakes. I shook the florists hand, some other folks, then the florist approached me and held his hand out again for another one. I realised he was holding out the op’s hand, and the op wasn’t resisting. He just kept his head down. I, of course, shook his hand. 

I was visibly confused as to wtf was happening, so the florist clarified. He said the op was just too much of an ‘anxiety bug’ to ask me for a handshake himself. In that moment, my whole perception was kind of shattered. 

I’d been looking at the op as a guy who didn’t care for me whatsoever, and who very intentionally pretended to be nice all that time for self gain of some sort. When I saw this little handshake stunt though, all I saw was a little boy who was struggling to muster up the courage to ask his bipolar mother for an extra cookie. My heart broke for him. It was this moment of just ‘oooooh. I have this whole thing wrong’ for me. From that point on he was chatty, back to the guy I remember him as.  

I don’t know how to process this at all. I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t even know what I’m asking you guys for - I think I just need a place to tell this story and hear some other peoples analysis of the situation? I know I’ve left out many details - so I’m not expecting much, but I would really appreciate just some answers to some questions I have. 

Was I just being a dick this whole time? But if I am - why did he fuck me over early this year? Was it just a mistake on his part that I overreacted to? If it was - why did he never reach out? Should I even be giving this so much thought - or should I just take the situation at face value? 

I’m so stuck rn. We had a profound effect on each others lives for the few months we were friendly. He was an op for nearly a year - and now everything just solves itself? Is that like some kind of cruel lesson from the universe for all the time I spent trying to ‘work out’ how to put everything right?

New here and I need your help  
So I met this girl (22) right before I (21m) had to go abroad for studies and we made out. Even though it was only one date, I felt we really had a connection. After the date, she said she wanted to go out with me the next day (last day in the country), but she the didn´t answer all day. Because of that, I decided to text her on the day of the flight saying it was a disrespectful move. After that, she finally answered saying she liked being with me, but she decide she didn´t want to create attachment for a person who is leaving for some months. Nevertheless, she said she wanted to have a date when i returned.  
After 1 and 1/2 months i decided to return for 1 week due to family issues. So we went on a date and talked a lot and connected a lot and ended up having sex (my 1st time and she seemed more than okay with it). Two days after we slept together (no sex) and shared a lot of intimate stuff.  
On that day, she said she had to move (1st to a friends house and 2 days later to the new house) and could only go out with me on her free day from work. She didn´t answer to my texts for about 2 days which is understandable because she also works and she usually takes long to text. When the day arrived she told me at lunch time she was taking care of things and could only go at night. Later she said the day after only (last day in the country again).  
Because of this, i slowed down and waited for her message the next day and then we went out and had a good time. She knows I will come back in a month for Christmas, and in the end, she told me i should enjoy everything about going abroad (imo girls included), but she also said she wants to continue going out with me when i return and would find me texting her pleasant.  
Another important details are that she came to my country alone and before she left her homecountry, she broke up with her 4 year bf. Our first date was on her 3rd month here.  
I would appreciate some advice on what to do now.  
Before you give advice keep in mind that i get attached very quickly.

TLDR:  
Feeling to attached to a girl, because i felt a real connection and also lost virginity to her. Not sure if she wants to go slow or just to have fun.

I (23M) met my current GF (22F) 8 months ago, while we were sharing a cab from office to home. I was on Notice period and had the last 2 days in the city and was moving to another city. We had ONS and she was very much into me. She was expecting a relationship after that but I wasn't sure because of the long distance mainly. But I was ready to give it a try and we started talking on the phone.

We started having a good time talking and we decided I'll go to her place for a week. One day she told me that she met her past FWB guy (she's had a big crush on him) in a cafe, and she was happy that she's finally over him, I was in her mind all the time while she was with him.

Fast forward I had a great time with her when I visited her and we told each other that we are in love. One day I was scrolling through her past photos and I got a little bit doubtful about a photo which she shared on the day she met that FWB guy. When I started asking questions about that photo she made some believable story. But I found a background matching the hotel room in the area which she lives in. When I confronted her she told me she was very frustrated that I was not showing much interest in her (which is not true as we were sexting and planning to meet ) and wanted to get over me but when she started getting physical with that FWB guy she felt very uncomfortable as I was in her mind and came to home (which I do not believe in).

I don't wanna give her a chance because In the past relationship as well she used to do sexting with this FWB guy. But she was very guilty about this act and told me that she'll work on our relationship and she loves me very much. So I decided to give her a chance but I'm feeling very bad that I'm giving the cheater a chance and wasting my time and energy for the same outcome and can't trust her anymore.

So me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been together for seven months. We met at a party and we both felt things for each other at first sight and started dating shortly after meeting and getting to know each other. 

Everything was great until several times, a situation wich I detailed in a previous post occurred.

I tried to breakup three times now, and I will try to detail what happened each time.

The first time I went to her house, she was in her room and blatantly refused to get out of bed, her room or her house, so I enter and told her that the things that had happened recently left me disappointed and hurt to a point where I decided we should separate because It has happened several times. She began crying and crying to the point where she was almost vomiting and couldn't breathe well. I told her to calm down, to take her time, and after hours and hours she told me to give her a second chance, to which I agreed, she wanted to be intimate afterwards and I told her that I didn't wanted and she felt bad because of that, I told her that I just didn't wanted and told her to just be in her bed with me. 

After this day the next week I visited my brother (33M) because I wanted to see him and my niece of six months. I told her that I was at my brothers house and she got angry because I didn't came to see her but I did with my brother, and we had an argument that same night and the very next weekend I told her I wanted to talk about something, and it was the same thing as the previous weekend, she then took an attitude of ""no, we won't breakup, we're going to get married"" and grabbed my arm, told me to go to her house, I refused and told her that I made my decision but she just wouldn't take it, she cried, yelled, said everything to me, in one instance it was getting late and cold, so I told her we should finish this and go home, then she says ""I will stay here until you say to me that we're going to be together"", the hours passed and she was shaking and crying from the cold so I told her to go home, when I was at her house there was her mother and I hated that because I didn't wanted to breakup with her with her mother there. The day finished by us having a break, which to me was false because she kept texting me the whole day, but I followed along with it.

We see each other again after a week and a little more, and everything is ""fine"" from here I'm in a constant spiral of being alright with her and wanting to be alone to clear my mind. She would constantly say how I'm not being the same I was before, how she is doing everything and that I'm letting the relationship behind. Because of this I told her by text, even though I hate the idea of breaking up by text, that we should breakup because we weren't working, she then came to my house after the message and I told her that it was how I really felt and even though I do love her I no longer want to he with her in a relationship, she then literally said ""no"", I was confused but told her that it wasn't a decision made by two, she only said ""no"" over and over until it was late, started raining and was really cold, she continued with saying ""no"" so I got really angry and screamed at her saying ""no, that's it, we're breaking up"" to which she began crying and begged me to stay in my house for the night because she couldn't go back home at that time.

She slept in my house that night, the next day I woke her up, made her coffee and told her that I need to go because I had a test that day, we said goodbye and I told her that I would like to meet another day because I was really tired, she agreed.

The very same day, she ask me if I could go see her at her school, I told her that it's okay but only from her school to her house, I'm at her school and she takes me to another place to get something to eat, and I told her that I really want to get home and rest, she asked me over and over to stay with her because she didn't wanted to be alone and sad at her house, that made me feel bad but I told her that we agreed  to meet other day, and that if I go I would be doing it out of shame. We've got another heated argument in which she cried a lot, I tried explaining that things couldn't be the same now, that I didn't want to hurt her anymore by doing this so many times and making it so long, but she didn't listened, she told me that I should change my attitude towards the relationship and that I should put the effort when I made it very clear that I no longer want to be in it.

I don't know what I can do.

My mom was told in preschool that I needed to get tested ASAP because I was struggling socially and missing many developmental milestones. My mom switched preschools and didn’t mention it for ten years. 

I learned how to adapt, but if you know what to look for, it’s super obvious. I found this out when I went to a psychologist to get tested for something else, 20 years after the preschool comment, and *they* told me to get tested ASAP. Problem was, not only were we balls deep in the pandemic, I was also in school and struggling with my relationship (more on that in a minute). My mother, being *so* afraid of having a disabled child, never told me what autism was, so I didn’t really have that sense of urgency to get tested because I had been living with it up until that point and I had too much else going on. 

Fast forward to now. I’ve been out of a full time job for years. I didn’t know what autism was, so I couldn’t really explain why I couldn’t do a 40 hour week. (And holy hell that took a toll on my self esteem because I’ve been calling myself a lazy sack of shit for years.) But I tried; I’ve been Doordashing for three years now to try and help make ends meet and I think I’ve done a good job. I made 14k last year

Recently I briefly connected with someone else who has autism. To be blunt, they pointed out to me how bad it really is. I’ve been struggling through things that I thought was normal for *years* (like putting on socks and eating food). Ever since, I’ve been trying to get booked to be tested but our insurance is crappy and everywhere keeps dropping us. The wait list is already out until Mar/April2023

Which brings me to the current situation. My husband has been the financial breadwinner since we got together, and he doesn’t consider DoorDash ‘real work’. In his eyes, I’ve been unemployed and unwilling to help to our finances for three years. He literally doesn’t care that I made 14k last year because isn’t good enough, and he strongly fails to see me as an equal in our relationship because of it. He thinks I’m self diagnosing the autism (and I’ll give him that, I am to some extent) but when I point out the obvious symptoms and evidence, he pretends he can’t hear me. I know that he’ll respect me when I HAVE the diagnosis, but all he sees is me doubling down on ‘sitting on my ass’ (I truly don’t make money in his world) and things finally came to a head last night. I often get suicidal when I’m overwhelmed and I can’t take it anymore, and he told me that he’d be free if I died. It wasn’t an encouragement or anything, but he was clear that if I died, he would see not having to support me as the clear benefit of the situation, even if he’d be sad I was gone. 

And I can step in his shoes and see it. I haven’t known that autism was what was keeping me from working, so it probably does look like I was just trying to mooch. He definitely feels taken advantage of and that feeling isn’t unwarranted either. Wanting to be in an equal partnership isn’t an unreasonable request. He isn’t a bad guy; he’s just ripping his hair out because of our finances and blames me because I make less (or, nothing to him). 

So… what do I do? Despite how it probably looks in this post, me and my husband love each other. He’s just tired of drowning because of me, and he snapped and made that comment. 

I can’t get the diagnosis any faster, I can’t make our insurance work. My financial contribution means literally nothing. I’m complete dead weight, and I know it. My husband, however horribly, is right to some extent; he would be free without me. And he’s suffered and struggled so much over me and that I don’t work, that he deserves that happiness. He’d certainly be able to find a much better partner, one who met his needs in a way I can’t. I want what’s best for him, and it isn’t me. 

What if I just sucked it up and died so he didn’t have to pay for me anymore? We literally can’t afford for me to live, and me being alive is draining my husbands happiness. I’m not exactly a saint in our relationship either; he’s put up with a lot. But the bills are adding up. I have over 5k in collections spread out over about 45 bills. We’re 1k behind on rent, have been for six months, I’m worried about getting evicted. I have 5k on my single credit card, owe 1.5k to the IRS for my job. US debt collectors can’t go after the loved ones of the deceased, it’s against federal law, so all of the financial strain I’m causing him would literally go away overnight if I died.

We talked for a couple of months online, asked him to meet up a couple of instances and he talked about how crazy his schedule is.  Eventually he had a day that was going to work for him. Planned a first date a couple weeks ago to meet up today.  Last weekend he said the plan we originally had wouldn’t work out because he had to take care of his dog as no one else would be home.  I suggested another plan that was closer to his home.  He didn’t respond till today and apologized saying he’s been too busy and hasn’t kept track of messages.  Meanwhile, during the time he didn’t respond, he posted a couple of stories on instagram and looked at my stories.  Also he didn’t even answer my question about the alternative plans.  

I’ve been in lots of these moments when I never know to give the benefit of the doubt or think they’re bullshitting, but I feel this case is more of the latter.  I also don’t want to assume things, so I just thanked him for the apology and let him know for the future, people tend to overthink these kinds of things when it comes to meeting up with people and it’s not always good for one’s mental health, especially when looking for a genuine connection, and to be considerate and more direct with others going forward.

I actually confessed to him back in July and he responded vaguely. So I took it as a rejection.

What bothers me is that he still kept sending selfies after that ""incident"" so I just went along with it until I got fed up and ghosted him.

Mind you, he reaches out like once a week or perhaps, it takes 2 weeks for him to converse again. He sends messages, then vanishes. This happened for a year, but then, he's really busy due to military school.

Now that I already lose communication with him for almost a month, I see him getting more active with his messages which is like, daily (it's showing up in my mail notifications), which made me sad, because I had to resort to ""ghosting"" just to be noticed. It didn't have to be that way

I have a hunch telling me that he is intentionally waiting for me to do it first so he could bombard me with messages, then flip the narrative, and make me the villain (possibly tell other people I ghosted him [which is true] or some shit).

It occurred to me that maybe he just wants someone to be his sound board and ego boost. If I go back, I'd probably flooded by him talking about himself all over again.

He never asked me questions about myself. He has disrespected me before. He always wants to be validated. He commented on my skin tone and my appearance. This made me question on why I liked him in the first place now I'm still in the detaching mode.

We've definitely had our ups and downs but the past year and a half has been particularly challenging. I feel so unsure at this point of what to even think of our relationship, if it's good, if it's a train wreck, if it's a mix of both and pretty on par for a 10+ year marriage. I'm not a person who likes to tell my friends about the arguments and frustrations in my marriage because I feel like that often leads to them hating or bashing the other person, so my brilliant idea is to lay it out for some strangers on the internet and see what you all think 🤣🤣. 

Right off the bat I'll say there's NEVER been any kind of abuse or anything near there. 

A bit about my husband:

He lives with chronic pain and I definitely give his moods a lot of leeway because I can't even imagine what it must be like to live inside his body. That said, he tends to be very moody from my perspective. He wakes up most mornings in a foul mood, picking fights over the smallest, stupidest shit. For example, this morning he came downstairs and said ""let me know when you want help taking down the Halloween decorations later"" and I said ""whenever is convenient for you is fine, I don't have anything specific planned today"" and this irritated him. He started grumbling while he poured himself some coffee, making comments about me making things difficult. Then, he took his coffee down to the basement and I'm sure I won't see him for another few hours. He says he's just not a morning person, but I ended up sitting on the couch crying, thinking what it would be like to be married to someone who would spend Sunday morning sitting and drinking coffee together, maybe chatting and having a nice morning. So, my first question is are my expectations just rose colored? Maybe no 10+ year marriage is like that? 

Some other major points of contention between us are how often I'm on my phone and me being more of an extrovert. 

These are where I'm sure I'm being the difficult one in this relationship. I have ADHD and on top of that grew up in a large, chaotic, noisy family. Last year we found out we can't have kids (it's my body's fault, not his) and it has weighed on me a lot mainly for the fact that the idea of a quiet house with just the two of us forever feels unbearably depressing to me. Since there's nothing we can do about it, I've tried to find other ways to deal with it, like by traveling more, seeing friends more, finding hobbies, etc. So now we argue constantly, he says he's not enough for me, he says he's boring. I've never said either of those things to him. I'm trying to fill my life up, but he's taking it so personally. 

as far as the phone issue, like I said, I have ADHD and frankly it's unbearable to just sit. If I'm not playing aobile game or scrolling social media I get very agitated very quickly. I don't know what he wants from me, but I do set aside specific time to just be with him. 

We've tried marriage counseling but I have yet to find a counselor who understands/respects my ADHD. You'd think mental health professionals would, but most don't. 

It just feels like walking on eggshells now. I watch everything I say and still we end up bickering frequently. 

I don't just want to dump all the bad things so here are the absolute highlights of my marriage:
He's the most supportive man I've ever met. When I realized I was bisexual 2 years ago, he went out of his way to learn and understand about it. Same thing with my ADHD, when I was diagnosed as an adult, he read books, watched videos, learned everything possible to understand and support me.

After our fights 99% of the time we sit down and calmly discuss things and listen to each other. All the counselors we've seen were very impressed with this. But it never seems to actually resolve these underlying issues.

We started texting during the lockdown and we had to wait for a year before we met in person. It seemed like the perfect relationship for a while. Both our parents knew about it. He used to come home and stay for a couple of days and stuff. In general, everything was going well. About a year into the relationship, I saw these messages on his phone where he has texted his friend about how slow the relationship is going in terms of physical contact. It seemed like he was a little too upset about it. A little bit of background here. Before we started dating, I made it pretty clear that I am someone who prefers to take things slow and would take some time. This came as a shock to me since he never mentioned anything to me about how it bothered him. He had been venting about it pretty extensively to two of his friends even going into extreme detail about how far we had gone. This was after I had made it pretty obvious that I'm a private person. Also, we knew each other's passwords just cos we trusted each other. And I saw these messages cos the friend had replied while I was using his phone to order food. I had never checked any of his messages before this. After this I obviously got paranoid and I went through more of the messages that night when he was asleep. He seemed to have been flirting with a girl who had made it clear that she likes him. This one time when he was with me she had drunk-texted him to which he had replied ""I am with my girlfriend"". This was before any of the problems had started. But when I went through the messages I realized that's not how he was not talking to her when I'm not around. Also, this isn't like a close friend of his or anything. So after all of this, I confronted him and I was so mad. He also admitted that he had met his ex and didn't tell me intentionally because he thought I would be mad. This was kinda funny and hard to believe because I had absolutely no trust issues before the fight in this relationship and I would have had zero issues if he met his ex. He then said it was because of his relationship with the said ex and how she had major trust issues and that's why he assumed I would too. He had a lot of baggage from this relationship and I was more than willing to work with him on it. I kinda felt soo worthless and hurt after all this as I was so loyal to him and this is what I got in return. I  wanted to break up. But he begged for another chance and said he would change. After this, I kinda made it clear how his talking to a lot of other women would make me anxious because he had triggered all sorts of insecurities in me. He said he would never do anything to upset me. So I told him he can talk to whoever he wanted but without crossing a line. I also asked him to not talk to girls from our college from younger batches. Both of us went to the same college but we started talking after he graduated while I was still in college. When my friends got to know about him, a few of them told me that he was a flirty person and to be careful. Before the fight in the relationship, I was an extremely secure person with absolutely no trust issues. So I brushed it off aside then. But since I saw the messages, I realized one more person saying it would trigger me. So I asked him not to speak to anyone from my college except for his existing female friends. And he agreed. I was so in love with him that I decided to give him one more chance. Another year went by and I felt like he had changed and I was happy. Fast forward to a month back and I see these messages popping up in his phone from a girl from my college. 7 years younger to him. Precisely belonging to the college population I had asked him to stay away from. And I know she is currently in a relationship. But they were talking a lot every day and I kinda felt weird that he was talking to her. He did not have a problem with me reading the messages and the messages were all platonic. He also said she knew about me and both of them were respectful about each other's relationship and I agree with it. She is into the same kinda things as he is and he says that's why he talked so much to her. But none of this comforted me as I still found it weird that he was okay risking our relationship to talk to her. When we were talking about said issue, he also said that he noticed that I was upset. So he decided not to reply to her in front of me and decided to text when I was not around. And he said he intentionally left the phone behind so I could check the messages and be sure that nothing was going on. I found this very hurtful too since I would have probably asked him if he was okay if I sensed something was bothering him. I sure as hell would not have gone behind his back to text someone I know he would be uncomfortable with. At this point, I am confused if my expectations are too high or I am justified in feeling hurt by all this and wanting to end the relationship because I honestly feel so tired of constantly being paranoid about who he is talking to and the manner in which he texts. I also want to add that if he ever mentioned that he was a flirty person in general to me at some point before I found out on my own, I could have lived with it. Instead, he said things that insinuated that he was an extremely loyal person while in a relationship. I am not some girl living in a hopeless romantic fantasy where I think being attracted to another person or even a healthy amount of flirting while in a relationship is wrong. But making the other person feel like you are against all of it and giving off this image of being extremely loyal is kinda deceptive IMO and that was technically the dealbreaker for me. He also admits to having been flirting while at the beginning of the relationship and said he enjoyed the attention but that he changed so much and became a better person after the fight. And that he had no wrong intentions while talking to the girl in question in the latest incident. I am so confused if ending the relationship was me overreacting or due to my insecurities thanks to the relationship or if it is justified. The other aspects of the relationship are really good - He is extremely understanding, always makes me laugh, is very patient, and gets along with my family. He has never ever gotten mad at me in the relationship or insulted me. Idk how to weigh in all of this and if Im letting go of something good just because of this one incident. Because deep down, I did think that he had changed but this latest incident has set back all the progress that we made over the past year. And what do you guys think about couples therapy for situations like these?

She says she doesn’t say this often, that I should be careful with him, that she gets bad energy from him, she tells me to stay away from him, that he looks like he owns me/doesn’t treat me like a princess, that he doesn’t have a pure heart and like he knows all my secrets.

Just think it is a weird thing to say. She has met him once, and seen me together with him a couple of times. Normally she doesn’t talk like that. I don’t know how good her sensors are anyway.

Around the time I was 16-17, I was bullied by my classmate Elly pretty relentlessly. I was already struggling making friends so I became easy target for her to single out and make fun of. Most of my classmates distanced themselves from me for the last 3 years of my higschool. I was really miserable for much of those 2 years to put it lightly.

Mike was the only one that stood up for me in our class whenever Elly was actively harassing me. She eventually toned down her bullying and the frequency of it once she realised Mike was serious, but it continued on with her accusing me of 'using' and 'manipulating' Mike which prompted more isolation from my classmates. Mike and his small friend group was positively the only friends I had in my class and actually made the rest of highschool somewhat bearable. They introduced me to some video games that I'd still revisit from time to time till this day, so we bonded a lot over that. They helped me a lot to take my mind off school stress but kinda went our separate ways after that.

Anyways for college Mike and I went to a university 4hr drive away from my hometown and I began somekind of a self journey there. Like a fresh start. I began to make some more friends, focused on my studies and just generally built up myself more and I'm entirely thankful to him for that. I met new people through him as mutuals and we studied together a lot and eventually we became super good friends.Part of my 'journey' was to get over all my past hurt with my bullying and Mike helped me a lot in that regard too. I unloaded a lot to him and that's why he was super supportive and helped me shape myself throughout college and again, I am forever grateful to him for that.

Around a year from finishing my degree I decided that I'm fully content with the growth that I made and thus decided to build my life in the state I was finishing my studies in because I was pretty much fallen in love with it by that point. Lots of good memories in a short time. Plus I dont think I can go back to my hometown permenantly without feeling like my past creeping up on me. When I told Mike about that he felt down a bit, saying ""That sucks"" but I promised we would keep in touch. And thats what we did for the past 2-ish years. Since we're busy nowadays, its been slowing down but we still at least catch up via text once a month or so. Plus every time I come to visit family we usually hang out like going for coffee etc.

On to the dilemma:
A month ago I asked Mike if we could hang out since I was going to visit some relatives in November and he said that'd be perfect for some 'reunion' type gathering with our highschool gang so I excitedly agreed. He also mentioned that he had a surprise for us saying he wanted us bring a special guest. Never in a million years could I had guess Elly would show up last week.

She arrived like 30mins after everyone else was already gathered and were catching up and basically having a great time. Mike essentially did a little 'I gathered you all here today' speech and looked really excited and somewhat giddy. He then texted Elly and less then a minute later she walked up to our table. I was honestly stunned. I havent seen her since highschool and havent given her much thought since around college. She sat down with us and Mike began explaining that they have been dating for the last 2 years and they celebrated their anniversary a couple days ago.

I dont know what came over me that evening but I honestly felt numb for the rest of it. Eventually Elly started to engage small talk with me on the side while the others talked about hometown nostalgia and whatnot. According to her, I was the last few people from our old class and circle to know about their relationship. Dave(25) was the only other friend from the group who didn't learn about it until that very day because he had only settle down in our country a few months ago after studying and working abroad for a bit. I guess she noticed me being distant from the group and basically said ""I'm sorry for highschool. I was an asshole fully and I hope we can start fresh now that we're adults"". She said she'll text later for continue the conversation and continued enjoying the rest of the company. 

I could only last around 20 mins after that so I made an excuse to leave early (something about needing to see my relative) and said goodbyes and pleasantries to everyone except Mike and Elly because my emotions were all over the place. A few hours later Mike texted me if everything was ok with me and my family. I didnt answer him for two days to which Elly reached out to me via insta asking if everything was ok. A few hours later she sent a long text saying she's very sorry for how she treated me and she understand if I'd like to distance myself from her for now. She sounded genuine enough idk. Still havent replied to her as well.

I have absolutely ZERO idea why I'm acting like this. I thought I'd spent all that time healing and moving on from my past and was all over it. She does sound like she's changed enough and I'm willing to build that bridge maybe in the future, but I could have never expected that she'd reenter my life in such a way. Dating a close friend?? Maybe if it was a more neutral situation I'd be less confused? This feels SO embarrassing to be giving 'silent treatment' like this especially since everybody else seems like they've grown up and moved on. I feel childish and like I'm throwing a tantrum over nothing. I dont know how to engage with both of them now and I need and outside perspective on this. Am I crazy or overreacting or something?

It got worse when I went to college and started pulling away. I’ve worked really hard on becoming a better person, and I have made strides in our relationship, but it’s not enough. 

She’s very Catholic and Trump turned her into a super Republican who hates liberal values as evil. I don’t go to church and am leery of organized religion in general, much less Catholicism, and am a Democrat. I don’t have a problem with our differences. I respect her religion and view points. 

But I have an issue when she talks about how my behaviors, such as not going to church or acknowledging Jesus or having premarital sex, won’t get me into heaven or when she calls Democrats idiots. It’s hateful. She uses the excuse that these aren’t her ideas, their God’s, and she has to tell me the truth as my mother. It’s so exhausting and I’ve asked her over and over again to stop because it makes me feel shitty. 

Two days ago, she did it again and I snapped at her (which I shouldn’t have done) and she retaliated by going on a one-hour rant about how horrible I am to her and in general while I was trapped in her car. The rant ranged from my disrespect to her, to scorning Jesus, to my liberal university ruining me, to how she hates all liberals. Then she forced me to go to dinner with her and acted like none of that happened, telling me to “grow up” and forgive her and forget it happened. 

The whole thing was traumatizing, but she said I pushed her to that limit because I have a problem. I’m really hurt and confused. I recorded part of the conversation and showed my boyfriend because I needed some validation; he said on a scale of 1-10, it was a 9 and there’s no way it was my fault. But obviously he’s biased. 

I feel ashamed that I can’t have a good relationship with my mother and am left wondering if this really is my fault. But I also feel like she’s twice my age and should know that this behavior is abusive. And I resent that I continue to improve and try to make things better, but she gets to behave however she wants because she’s the mother.

The party becomes gross later on with screaming, broken property, drugs Im having ptsd flash backs and crying histerically, ive had enough, I really still belived in him when he said it was a get together. he takes me home comforts me then forces himself onto me for sex eventhough i keep saying i dont want to outside of a realationship. I would have snapped if it went for the fear that with him being this drunk he may go back and fuck her.

Its now 2am ive expressed i want to be in bed by 1am and he told me before going that if im umcomfotable wed leave together. now he wants his cake and to eat it too. threatening me and saying he wants to hang w his friends. he always said he wasnt a party guy and i am breaking down sobbing feeling terrible for being used and that my guy wants to be around that drama and grosseness and that he was willing to abandon me when i needed him…

he tries to guilt me saying he cant even sleep over at his friends… it crosses my boundaries, they are all drunk and it is irresponsible and disrespectful to put yourself in that position.

so…he comes back at 4am, we go to bed, the next day we were supposed to go to the pumpkin patch and actually do something i would enjoy for Halloween a proper date. but turns out he never booked tickets and hes “unsure” about us again..

I find out that he was actually seeing her and her friends the other week before we broke up. when confronted he thumbled over his words saying he never promised there werent any girls then saying it was a diffrent trip then saying it was before we broke up or it was one of the weekends we werent talking. All of this is impossible as I know where hes been each weekend. The “friend hangout” camp, family. etc he then says it was during the week which is also impossible as he works late and it was a nature hike. he says he skiped work. haha right. hmm and coincidentily she went to halloween haunt that exact same weekend that the hangout was- Anyway he never admitted to this he claims that she likes his friend but that doesnt change his inappropitate behavior. around the time of the hangout he randomly says to me that i can use him as an excuse if i get into a situation. but now im thinking thats what his buddy mustve said to him abt this girl.

we were supposed to meet this following weekend now he is saying he doesnt want to travel (were a little long distance durham- gta) and he just wants to be alone this weekend but turns out he is seeing his friends again..

I adore him and we are on the whole very happy together. I have never been accepted by my SO's mother (70F), he is an only child therefore I wonder if anyone would have been good enough. She plays the silly forgetful old lady very well, however it is not convincing, at least to me. I find her manipulative and hateful. As an example of this, when my SO told his parents last year that he was serious about me and planning to propose she said a number of inflammatory things, including assuming I was pregnant and telling my SO that he shouldn't feel forced to marry me if that was the case....we have a mortgage and two dogs together, a little late to imply he is being forced to commit but ok. There have been other really horrible things said about my background etc but I have been trying to be the bigger person for my SO. He has had a word with her a number of times and she has apologised to me in the past but ultimately this is who she is as a person and she will never change.

Anywho fast forward to now, my SOs long suffering dad (75M) is seriously ill in hospital. We are all devastated and visiting as often as we can. It means seeing his mom every day of course but ultimately it is worth it to be there for my SO, until now. I was at the hospital last night with my SO and his mom when I got a text from a childhood friend that a mutual friend had died that morning. I was telling them (but mostly my SO) the message I just received. I can't remember how but it came up that my friend who had died was gay (I think I showed my fiancé a worrying Facebook post of his and his picture was him and a girl and I think he asked if that was his girlfriend but can't remember for sure) and immediately his mother was like 'oh well I don't agree with that' etc...my SO tried to interject but she shut him down and said she wasn't having that conversation, it was clear from that that they'd fought over this topic before.

I said nothing and stayed on for another hour or two before leaving. In the car on the way home the gravity of everything hit me and I burst into sobs. My SO had never seen me like that. He apologised and apologised while I just sobbed uncontrollably. I sobbed for my friend. I sobbed for my future FIL. I sobbed grieving the healthy MIL relationship I will never have if I go through with this. My SO is pissed at his mom but I know that ultimately nothing will be done. If he confronts her now she is a sad old lady who is about to lose her husband. If he confronts her later potentially (God forbid) when her husband passed as she is just a sad grieving widow. 

I am really questioning if I want this negative voice in my ear, in my life, as I navigate life, as we have children...it is giving me serious pause. What do I do? What should my SO do? He adores his dad and to visit his sick dad he has to by extension see his mom...it is unavoidable. Would really appreciate any insight at all. Thank you

Everything was going well at first, but it turns out he has 2 kids. If I knew this up front I wouldn't have gone out with him to begin with.

He introduced them into my life very slowly. At first it was every second weekend he visits them, but then it turned into they stay over every weekend. I didn't know how I feel about this situation, they are lovely kids and I don't mind them in my life but at the end of the day I'm 19, and these aren't my kids.

I have been looking at going into nursing recently, which of course means me studying full time and most likely getting a part time job. This is completely manageable for me with student loans (i'm in the UK). I have told my boyfriend my plans and he seemed thrilled for me. 

But he has now decided to fight for full custody of his kids. He hasn't outright said it but has heavily implied if we move in together, it would be easier financially for all of us and that he is more likely to get his kids. I definitely don't know how I feel about this. He hates the mother, but I know her through friends of friends. He doesn't know this but I met up with her a while back for lunch and keep in semi-regular contact with her, I see her kids regularly it's only fair imho. She's had a bad start in life but she is genuinely a good mum and I highly doubt my boyfriend will get full custody.

But it feels a bit too coincidental that my boyfriend wants full custody and make life a bit difficult for all of us as soon as I make quite big plans for myself. 

I dont know what I want from this situation. I'm 19 I should be making dumb decisions not tying myself down like this.

I have always read reddit stories, but never written one so im really new(sorry in advance).

I'm 15 and I have a horrid/good relationship with my sister(20) who we'll call X,
X is always going through my room when I'm not there and generally is really mean to me but then sometimes we are like the best of friends. it feels like I can't be myself at all and I have to pretend her low-key bullying isn't happening.

I'll make a list:

1. Whenever I saw i want to try something as hobby X said no, and made it seem like I was rude for being upset, but on the flip side she always complains that I'm always on my phone.

2. X always tells on me to our parents and she lies to make me look worse.

3. X constantly puts me down(even of it is a joke it still hurts) and constantly calls me a 'stupid cow' (I'm on the skinner side now but I was always iffy about my weight)

4. X always pretends to hurt me or actually does.

5. X always makes me feel wrong for wanting to change my appearance and got mad at me for saying she doesn't have a say in my decision, and she spun it to seem like i was being rude and ""so you don't care about my opinion"" and ""I'm just looking out for you""(I wanted to cut my hair and she said i couldn't. though our mum said I could)

6. X makes it my fault for being in multiple toxic friendships. 

7. And if I upset her enough she won't talk to me for days. 

8. X still jokes about my mental breakdowns when I was 5 even when i asked her to stop (when I was overwhelmed I would smack and punch myself, I don't know why?)

I'll elaborate on the seventh one and forth one, 

7. My mum told me we would get a pet. I was ecstatic, I've always wanted a pet and my mother only really likes dogs, so that's what I expected but instead we got some very cute and adorably round guinea pigs (sadly we no longer have then because of my and my fathers allergies to hay and their fur). Me and X were hyped. my mother told us that the guinea pigs were mainly for me... a late birthday present, X didn't like this at all. EVEN THOUGH I didn't even say anything or agree with my mum at all. She didn't speak to me for a whole week, for something I didn't even say, I was doing everything in my power to try get her to talk to me. (I feel like I spent majority of my childhood crying).

4. X always points knifes at me and makes jokes about skinning me and wearing my skin, killing me and eating my body or just always pretending to punch me when I say something she doesn't like.

Once she came into my room while I was on my phone, I said hello and she did too, nothing unusual. Then she picks up my pillow and holds it over my face, not too hard at first (i thought it was just a joke). THEN SHE HOLDS IT DOWN REALLY HARD so I can't breathe. I'm starting to panic and shout, when she didn't listen I just flail my limbs trying to pull the pillow off, but I'm not very strong so nothing is working, then she removes the pillow and just leaves. I had never been suffocated before and i never want to happen again, sat in my room and cried for a while, that was a year ago when I was 13-14 and I still to this day have nightmares/struggle to fall asleep in my bedroom.

Generally I'm a little afraid of her but I can't do anything about it, extremely slowly i think my family are beginning to understand but the rest of the time they think I'm just being a baby about it and it's all jokes, but I'm so depressed, I constantly think that nobody loves me and I been extremely close to killing myself (instead I just cried). My dad is the only person who I think actually loves me.(he always calls out my sister for staring at me because it makes me extremely uncomfortable) but he's always overseas for work and I can't only expect him to help me forever. 

I'm afraid that I'll just have to move out as quickly as possible. But I love her, she's my big sister I just want to have a normal relationship with her, I just need some advice.

So thank you in advance

This weekend I have a long 5 days with my LDR boyfriend. We have been together for 7 years. I love this man oh so much. I believe we are each other's soul mate. We are hand in hand bonded with each other. Yesterday we had sex it's the first time in a month I've seen him. Anyways he had me orgasm and he didn't finish which wasn't a big deal to me. We were relaxing and he then tells me that he believes he could be bisexual. I am in no way homophobic or biphobic as I have many friends and family who are LGBTQ+ but I started to have a panic attack. I had an intense fear that I could lose him. This year has been really rough on the both of us. He lost his father this year and I had started my career which has declined my mental health immensely. I had an anxiety attack this year while driving which since then I've been on edge worrying about my health and we'll being. I was medicated but the pills I had were causing extreme side effects that I had to stop. Anyways, I had a horrible reaction I assured him that I accept him for who he is and that I love him dearly as I have never loved anyone before him. I have an intense fear of losing my boyfriend as we have been together for so long and that we are planning to move in together and to get married. He told me that he is isn't sure about being bi as his reasoning is only based on his porn habits. He told me that within the past couple months he had been watching gay porn and that it had become enjoyable for him. He told me he does not see himself being with a man but he just wanted to let me know about this as it's a side of him he feels I should know. After this we had gone to one of our favorite stores and planned to see a movie. Everything was great we were our usual loving selves until I had 2 more panic attacks that night. He calmed me down each time letting me know he wasn't going anywhere and that he feels this doesn't change anything. I know it doesn't change how he feels about me and he wants to be monogamous with me but I'm scared it could end up changing. Today we are going to a Renaissance fair and I'm honestly afraid we won't have any fun because I'm still riddled with anxiety over my reaction from yesterday. I am thinking I should see a doctor about my anxiety again as I feel I shouldn't feel this way. I am willing to fight tooth and nail for my relationship so I am going to call the doctor Monday and schedule an appointment.

We've met (me 23 her 25) over our moms in 2017, and were working a summer job in another city, she and her (then) boyfriend were together for around 8-9 months at the time, and super in love. Her day, even then, was all about him. Ofc she tried to be nice because I'm a daughter of her mom's friend, but there wasn't a moment in the day that he wasn't there. Before work, after work, she was never in her room, mostly in his. They soon left because they got a better offer somewhere else. Ok, I tried to maintain contact due to the respect for her mom finding me that job in the first place.

At first she was kinda ignoring my messages, responding every 3 days but over time I started telling her about my problems at work ( I was seriously bullied by guys) and since she was 2 years older I found her somewhere more serious and experienced regarding the issues. We started texting more and eventually got really close. She was so kind and really helped me A LOT. Fast forward 5 months, she got back, both our jobs finished, I was thrilled to see her, and she was as well. She then tells me that she's pregnant, they are getting married and  wants me to be the maid of honour, which I gladly accepted.

I was kinda sad (selfishly, I know) because we had so many plans after the summer and now she's pregnant. But oh well. They were living together so we weren't texting that much at the time, and I tried to convince myself that it's not a big deal. We would text 5 messages per 1 minute, and I was, again going through some shit. She was all ears and always giving me advices, and she was always saying how in her life nothing is going on and she doesn't mind listening to me. But the second she would put down the phone she wouldn't answer for days and days. After they got married, it was even worse, I couldn't even understand why because, they were living with his parents and she didn't have to be the ""housewife"" neither did she work, she was just -there-. They would come to the uni from time to time, for some exam and we would see each other. After she had her baby, our contact was minimum of minimums. I understood because I know that it's not easy. I didn't have the money to come see her in another town, that often, and his parents didn't like the visits too so we were limited to only texts. She was engaged in my life but it was simply different. From texting every day we would get to texting every couple of days. After two years they had another one. At that point she was still my ""best friend"" but our closeness was non existent. I stopped even trying because I would wait for a text back for even 10 days. I too had a job and I too was studying, but I always found the time to text her.

My mother was telling me that I was selfish because ""she's a married woman I can't demand from her to give me the time that she should devote to her family"" .. I always defended myself by saying that I know that little kids are difficult (all my sisters have little kids so I've basically watched them grow up) but nobody can tell me that she doesn't have the time to text back, when her mother in law was basically taking care of the whole household (which even my mother confirms), and that she simply doesn't care to text back because she reached the safe point in life. A working husband, two children taken care of... It's like a celebrity saying how motherhood is hard and all she does is play with the children in her free time.

Fast forward, 2022.

 I started my master's thesis, and have my own algorithm and way of life that I'm comfortable with. 

Her husband bought them a new apartment for themselves, which is finally ready for moving in, but- they separated and now she's living there with the kids (now 2 and 4 years old). I was devastated when she told me (half a year later) but she told me that I shouldn't be sorry because she's over it, it's for the better, etc. I was asking if there's a chance for them to get back, but she says it's literally 0%. She's not working, he's still paying for everything and that's it. Ok, what now? Well what happens is that she's now ALL OVER ME. what are you doing? How are you? What's new? When are we going out? Where can we meet some cute boys? At first, I was thrilled that I finally have her for myself, because we have the same personality and we get along pretty good. When I finished my summer job I went to stay with her a couple of days and it was great. Kids were with father, we went out to parties, went for walks, talked about boys, everything I wished for, for the last 5 years. But, I don't fell that good now.

My mother (yup) slammed me with facts (once again). ""Oh she's Calling you now to party? Why didn't she call you when she was married? She had kids back then too! But she didn't have the time for you! Her husband was the center of her life and she didn't have the time for you!!"" Etc. At first I was defending her but I figured out My mother is right. And I feel so used. I went to my bf""s again yesterday, and she's already planning another party next week. I'm trying to explain to her that I can't go out that often, neither do I have the time, I have to save the money etc etc. I always tell her ""Well why didn't you want to party when you were married, because now I don't have that much time"" and she just laughs and says that she couldnt do it back then bla bla. But it really started bugging me. When I was leaving she told me ""what will I do when you leave??"" I responded ""What will you do? Well what did you do with all that free time when you were married? Do that again"" and she's like, ""Oh I was usually sleeping or playing with kids Bla Bla"". She even mentioned she thought about getting back together with her ex husband because she's so bored when I'm not there.

Well it's not my problem that she has way too much free time now. Nor is the fact that now I'm interesting again. I realized that she doesn't necessarily want my company (sure it's better than any) but still, she just wants some company. And that hurts. I don't know how to find words, how to tell her, to please do something with her life because I'm not there to entertain her. I want to devote myself to my master's studies, to my friends who were there when she wasn't. I can't explain to you how much it hurts now when she talks how she can't wait for me to get back, and I know that the only reason is that she just doesn't have anything else to spend time doing.

His response “oh I don’t know why I did. I don’t know what you want me today”

It's been so long since having it (7mo) that I gave myself some self image issues and don't know how to talk about it with him anymore.

Throw away acct because we sub each other on personal accts. Also on mobile.

Ok here goes.

Dear diary: I'm convinced my boyfriend hates going down on me. We've been together 4 years, everything is absolutely remarkable in our relationship, and to top it off, he's my best friend. We finish each other's sentences, we speak in our favorite tv quotes, we're happy, healthy, 2 peas in a pod. On top of that, sex is great! -Though sparse.

He's the type where sex isn't everything, he prefers the emotional connection over the purely physical stuff, and I appreciate that about him regardless of my generally high drive (I can just rub one out if I'm ever that desperate). I always feel safe with him, he's never too aggressive, I'm never objectified, we even have foreplay, and he's really good at what he does so I don't mind the action being few and far between because in my opinion, the wait is worth it. *He* is worth it. Plus I know that when we go the whole way, it isn't in order to feel close but *because* we feel close. But nonetheless, I miss receiving oral.

It's become one of those ""birthday only"" occasions. Now I personally have no problem putting my own face down in his business, he doesn't *need* it which I know - but he also doesn't have to ask because I'm eager to do it for him! I know he enjoys it and I'm ecstatic to have learned how to please him well. But… there's no reciprocation.

I want to talk to him about it and sort all this nonsense out but when we talk, he usually makes an effort later that same night (which I'll explain here shortly), and unfortunately it's gotten to a point where I'm *afraid* to let him down there. Maybe I have a ghost down there and that's why he avoids it! (I don't, fyi). I make sure I'm clean and very well maintained down there all the time, too - just in case this night is different from the other nights! So I know logically that I'm not gross there, but I still feel like I'm gross there because he doesn't initiate without a complaint. He'll put his hands down there (we do foreplay) but not his face.

The rarity of the act has allowed me to slump into a headspace of extreme insecurity. I feel like if he tried tonight to go down there, I'd be in tears because I'm afraid of the idea that he's potentially forcing himself down there. What we've talked about is my insecurity due to fear of him not liking my business, how it seems like I pressure him into it, and the infrequency of the act itself in the past - he always does it the night I initiate such a talk, but that isn't helping the ""me"" of it at all. It shouldn't take a big huge talk to see that type of deed coming from my partner. I don't like feeling as though I have to badger someone into doing what i sexually want, that isn't consent!

When we talk about it, he says he feels like he isn't good enough at it but I'm nearly convinced that's just an excuse. He *is* good at it, I've told him this countlessly, and I've even openly discussed my enjoyment of his techniques, which ones are my all-time favorites, and where to touch most/less etc. Regardless of my reassurance and info though, he apparently isn't confident and I've grown increasingly nervous over the years because it feels like he avoids doing it. I've explained all of this over and over to the point that I stopped bringing it up to him altogether a couple months ago. Perhaps I wasn't tactful enough though, I often get my vernacular mixed up (unless I'm writing but it's my actual job to write).

In a lame attempt to tell myself it really isn't that few and far between, I started marking these things down. I say ""lame"" because it showed me how distant the occurrences really are. The last time I brought it up and we talked about it was in September, and I only brought it up because the last time he was down there was in April. I didn't get the regular birthday one this year either so this is the longest stint yet.

April was the last talk we had that led to that particular deed. Not to mention, feeling like I pressured him into it made it fairly unenjoyable. I just wanted to talk about what the stigma of it was that time (and during the last talk in Sept), I even told him when he headed down there that night that he didn't have to and how it wasn't what I intended to happen. He said he wanted to but… c'mon. You *want* to do the dishes after your mom complains that you haven't done dishes once that year, yea right. It's clear we're on different pages with this, even he has voiced that. I'm just not sure where to go from here.

I know there's gotta be a way to get the point across that I do still appreciate and desire this from him but also that I hate feeling like I'm forcing him down there. I'd like to inform him that I want to seek a way back to feeling normal about having his face near my business. Maybe there's a way to try easing back into that sort of thing after all these months of me being in my head about 'the Ghost of My Undercarriage'!

Extra info: I know it's going to be suggested but I don't think counseling is an efficient use of resources since it really is only this 1 thing. I'm not embellishing when I say that *everything* else is going incredibly well. This is the man I'll be spending my life with, we're both introverts, we own all our things outright, bought a house together, have no debt, both make good money, have pets and are holding off on kids, we talk about everything (except for this since September) and he definitely is not cheating. Aside from this discrepancy, we're pretty rock solid; he's helped with my baggage - and I with his, any issues we have are discussed and tackled successfully, and our arguments aren't ever left unresolved (except this one thing).

I’ve (F21) been dating this girl (21) for a couple of months now, not too long, but I thought we had a pretty good relationship that is on the right track. But yesterday, we were fooling around on each others phones, and I decided to look up my name in her texts for shits and giggles as I am sure she was doing similar things on mine. Now, she has this group of friends that she’s extremely close to, and they have a group chat together where they’re pretty consistently texting. My name came up mostly there, and although I didn’t look too hard for too long, a lot of it made me quite upset. Firstly, anytime we would have any minor hiccup she would tell them everything about it. Of course, I completely understand talking to your friends about stuff but I felt like it’s a bit unfair to me to tell them everything. Secondly, she’s told them every personal detail of my life that although I don’t believe I necessarily told her not to tell them about, but things like my SA story that I just expected her not to text other people about. Thirdly, there were a couple of times where I believed her to be upset with me and she fully reassured me she’s not, just for me to find out she really was but instead of just communicating that to me she just told this groupchat. Fourthly, I told her a while back that I have Borderline-Personality Disorder, and again not something I told her to keep a secret but also not something I expected her to go around spouting, just to see that her and her friends have made fun of me/made jokes about it on multiple occasions. She and her friends also made a couple of jokes about me being inexperienced sexually with girls, which was a bit hurtful because she made it seem like she really didn’t care. I must say, she’s someone who’s always joking and making light of things, so a lot of this I’m probably reading too much into, but I am not that way so it’s hard for me not to. I’ve been pretending like nothings wrong but I am not sure I can look at her the same until/if I talk to her but I’m not sure how to bring it up nonchalantly. There were also a couple of weird texts, such as her saying “I actually really like _ despite not acting like it all the time.” (this was like at least a full month into our relationship.)

My boyfriend of three years who I live with just flipped the switch on me seemingly out of nowhere. Nothing happened, no fights. Just I felt like something was off with him one day and asked him what’s wrong and he said he didn’t want to do this anymore. I cried, I begged, I told him I didn’t understand. His reasons were all petty and made no sense as he was just spending time and telling me how much he loved me few days before. I have taken such good care of him our entire relationship. He’s not a happy person or someone who exhibits joy but I excepted that about him as just the way he says he’s always been since a child. I’m devastated as I still love him and don’t see any reason to not continue to be together. But he won’t budge. He wants me to move out since I cannot afford our current place on my own and he can. This gets even more painful because my daughter is involved and I have to rip her out of her home to gods knows where and it’s destabilizing to our entire lives.

I thought I had finally found my person in my late 30’s with him and was ready to ride this out and stick together forever. Like I said he’s not the most fun or outgoing person, but honestly neither am I half the time. And I don’t expect perfection from anyone. 

We were pretty well matched physically, financially, personality, we have some different interests but who cares we didn’t need to be the same. It just blows my mind why he would do this. Now I’m scrambling to find an affordable place to live in town so my daughter, who has been through so much can at least stay at the same school. 

After a few days of just crying all the time and trying to change his mind I’ve just gone numb and we are not even speaking unless it’s about splitting up things or bills and such. I want to hate him but it’s just not in my nature. 

He’s spending as much time as he can out of the house, going to the gym, he works a lot. I really don’t think the break up is because he already has someone else he wants to be with. I’m just very hurt, upset and confused and don’t have anyone to talk to as my family has never been there for me. I’m trying to keep it together for my daughter and get us out of here asap. Nothing is worse than being somewhere your not wanted with someone who used to love you so much and now cares nothing for you.

I (29M) understand we’re in the age of technology and im a part of it for sure. My GF (26F) is constantly on her phone. I know shes neurodivergent and she likes her social medias and im fine with it, to a point.

It seems like every night i come home or every day im at work and she’s off, its nothing but tiktok/IG. 

Last night, it really pissed me off. I got home somewhere after 5PM, excited to see her, and she was on her phone… from then until I went to bed at 11:30/12.

Now dont get me wrong, im okay with scrolling and liking stuff and sending things to me, hell i do it too. But i got 25 tiktok notifications while i was at work from 12:30PM until I left… 

Its like she spent LITERALLY 14 hours on her phone. I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie and, when she said yes, i picked a movie or two out and she said she liked one, and as im about to put it on, she keeps scrolling!

I said something to her later about me being upset about it and she said “you should’ve put the movie on, i said i wanted to watch it”. So I apologized for not putting it on, but honestly just gave up.

Im at a loss. I feel no connection with her because of this sometimes and honestly, i have a gut feeling something else is going on to keep her on her phone all day and night.

Both in early 20's
3 yr relationship 

I know this sounds super weird.
A quick catch-up on
My ex has a bf, I told her I want a second chance. Being friends made her uncomfortable so we went NC. 

Reddit doesn't send notifications when I message and she doesn't use reddit outside of talking with me. So I figured it was a safer place to send her messages I want to say to her but don't want to hurt her more with, I realised that's hypocritical. She blocked me on Reddit for a while, I kept sending the same kinds of messages, then realised at some point she unblocked me, I didn't change my pattern.

Recently my missing her got really bad, she's been on my mind everyday bad. And my feelings for her don't fade no matter what I do or how much time passes. So I sent her a message on Reddit saying that I still feel just as strongly and idk what to do, I miss her too much. So I said I'll try going NC for as long as possible. I also said if she's properly moved on, and doesn't feel anything to ignore me and basically to block me.

A few days later she changed her avatar from a crying face to a happy face, for the most part I'm thinking its her essentially leaving a read status like on Facebook, do you think I'm reading too much into it? Or am I not reading into it enough. She definitely wouldn't just change it just cause, as I said she doesn't use reddit outside of talking to me.

Thanks!
