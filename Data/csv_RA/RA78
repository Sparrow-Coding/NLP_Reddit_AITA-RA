Two years into our marriage, when she was just 24, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a single mastectomy, went through chemo and radiation, she lost her hair, the whole 9 yards. It was terrible and traumatic, but since the date of the mastectomy, she has been in remission--about 8 years now.

In the last 8 years, we've been massively lucky for her to be healthy, and we were able to have two children, now ages 4 and 2. Her body has been through A LOT and if she had not had the health issues she's had, we'd probably try for a third kid, but we are completely happy with just having two and know how fortunate we are to even have been able to have kids after her cancer treatments.

Birth control options are limited for us. Although it hasn't been confirmed, based on the type of breast cancer she had, we suspect it's likely that birth control pills are what gave her cancer, so all forms of hormone-based birth control options completely are off the table. She tried an IUD after her mastectomy, but it made it so that her period didn't stop. She bled for three weeks and showed no signs of slowing down. It only stopped once she went to the doctor and had the IUD removed.

With that said, I'm considering getting a vasectomy. Her going through all the cancer treatments and having children has been very, very hard on her body and really at this point it's only fair that I undergo a pretty minor procedure for permanent birth control. But, with her health history, I'm scared that she'll pass away at a young age. From what I understand, if breast cancer comes back, it's most likely to do so within the first 10 years of remission--after that, the chances of it coming back are drastically lower. Considering we're at the 8 year mark, things are looking good and overall she is healthy.

But I'm still scared. She is my best friend and I love her more than I can describe. But even after 8 years, I still have intrusive thoughts that she could pass away at a young age. And if she were to die young, in all honesty, I'd probably want to remarry at some point. I'm not saying I'm eager to remarry--I'm just saying I don't want to live the rest of my life without a companion. And if that were to happen, who's to say that we wouldn't want children of our own.

One option would be to have sperm frozen prior to the vasectomy. I told my wife that if I were to get a vasectomy, I'd like to freeze my sperm ""in case anything changes."" She didn't take this well. She said that we decided already on two kids, so there's no reason I should freeze my sperm. She pretty much realized that the only reason I'd need to freeze my sperm is if she died and I wanted kids with another woman. I never explicitly said it, but if I did, it would really hurt her. She hates the idea of me remarrying if she dies.

I feel like I can only commit to getting a vasectomy if I freeze sperm as part of a worse-case scenario. But doing that will break her heart. Again, vasectomy is really pretty much the only viable birth control option for us. Please help.

TL;DR - My (34M) wife (32F) is a cancer survivor. We have two kids, ages 4 and 2. Vasectomy is really the only viable birth control option for us, as hormone-based birth control is likely what gave her cancer in the first place and an IUD caused her issues. I'm afraid she'll die young, I'll want to remarry and I don't want kids to be off the table if that were to happen.

Lots of love, positive communication and honesty. It was her idea to be exclusively dating, and she made sure to mention that she's been cheated on in the past with guys she's had faith in.

The other day, we both went out with separate groups of friends in my area. We haven't seen each other in a week so I wanted to make the effort to meet up with her at some point in the night.

We were 15- 20 minutes apart. 

At 1:00 AM she asked if she could take an Uber to my apartment. I said sure, and Uber'd home alone. She didn't want my Uber to come pick her up at the bar she was at, although it was on the way to my place.

She did not answer my texts for almost 2 hours. At about 2:45 AM, she called and said she was on the way over.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the next morning. We both wake up substantially hungover, and I was asking questions of how her night went. Who she was with, what kind of bars they went to, etc.

At one point she goes ""You're asking a lot of questions."", which I found strange.

I have never snooped on her phone before, but she went to the bathroom and left her phone unlocked on my bed. I opened it up and saw that she sent a lot of intimate texts to a guy last night. Not like ""I miss you"" but things you would say to someone you're in love with. She made it seem like I was blockading them from being together.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen her texting and Snapchatting this guy before, and she told me they were just part of the same friend group. His name would always pop up on her phone but she'd ignore him whenever we were together. I'm not a paranoid partner so gave her full trust to be casual friends with guys. 

When I confronted her about the texts, she told me that they had been together before we started dating. She also told me that they'd been texting intimately this whole week, which is ironic because we did not hangout once during this timeline. 

Later in the day she told me that the friends she went out with went home early, and she stayed at the bar with this guy alone. 

She said they were flirting but didn't do anything physical. That she could have gone home with him but came to me instead. (I think this is setting the bar extremely low)

When I confronted her, she said she wanted us both. Later in the day, she said she would cut everyone off and never talk to another guy besides me again. In the evening, she was saying how I rushed her into this relationship, and I've been perceiving it differently than her the whole time. She ended by saying that she needs me in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended things with her but I'm heartbroken. I miss her deeply and thought this relationship was evolving into something truly special.

More into than anyone I’ve dated in a while. We met at work over video chat this spring. I was leaving my job and the talking really took off. She found me on instagram and we basically messaged back and forth everyday for months until we met in person. We live in different cities about a 6hr drive apart (1hr flight), but both spent the summer in another city where we both have family. This wasn’t really coordinated, it just worked out that way.

The summer was awesome. We went on dates and hung out pretty consistently. We were intimate. We have a lot in common. This was full on dating. We were texting daily and hanging out when we could. I was really interested in her and she seemed really interested in me.

At the end of the summer, we were both headed back to our respective cities, so I kicked off a conversation to talk about the situation. I didn’t really have an end goal in mind. I know part of me wouldn’t have been at peace with long distance. I did long distance before for 2 years in my last relationship and told myself not again. I also didn’t think the relationship quite had the foundation yet (still too new) to work long distance. I never said I wanted something specific, just acknowledged it was a hard situation. I wanted to know what she wanted. She eventually said she wasn’t looking to have a long distance relationship. She had also just came out of a long relationship that spring before we met. So we ended under very clear terms that there were no expectations.

We also knew we would see each other again soon. I was going to be her city in a few weeks with friends and then again a month after that for work. She was going to be in my city a month after that.

We still messaged after the summer ended. When I visited her city with my friends I stayed with her for the weekend. It was a good trip, but then I left. I went back again for work and things felt different. We got dinner once and I tried to set up a plan for us to hangout again before I left. She responds to my plan with, while she likes spending time with me, she’s worried the situation is becoming confusing for her because we don’t live in the same place and don’t know when we’ll see each other next. I responded saying that makes sense, and change the plan asking if we can do something quick like get ice cream and talk in person while we’re still physically in the same place. She’s busy and can’t. She expresses being really sorry and asks if I want to do a phone call or FaceTime in a few days after her upcoming trip. I’m cordial and say we’ll play it by ear. 

At this point I think I get the message. I feel like she’s not into this anymore. Time for me to try to move on. She texts me a couple more times after this about some random stuff we have talked about, and I respond nicely, but not with much content and slowly. Why put myself through the pain of still talking like we used to? Eventually all communication stops. A couple weeks ago she visits my city and doesn’t tell me she’s here. Makes sense, we’re not even talking anymore. 

Recently my company had layoffs and she reached out to checkin with me and see how I was doing. We had some fun back and forth exchanges again, but it eventually stopped.

Here’s the problem. I still like her and before she reached out to me recently I had been thinking about sending her a message letting her know how I feel. I don’t have a solution to distance. I know she wants to be in her city right now and I want to be in mine. Is it worth saying something or should I just let this die, take the rejection, and move on? Do you think I read the situation correctly?

I(29 F) don't have the best relationship with my (49) mother. For a lil back story my mom and dad weren't together when I was born. It didn't bother me too much till I got into 1st grade when mom started dating,at that time I didn't know who my dad was so I just thought ok I don't have a dad. Till he came out of the blue when I got into 2nd grade. Now I have a Rocky relationship with my dad too but that's a whole other story I may get into at a later date.

   So my mom has always dated and the guys are... To put it nicely... Not tasteful. G1that she dated for 8 years was a drunk and scared me to where I needed to keep a pocket knife under my pillow, she did get married but it didn't last long because she cheated on G1 with G2(enter my siblings) we had to. Move in with G2 because of my mom's cheating. Not soon after having my sis was born she got preg with my brother and we had to leave because he this G2 was abusive  and through my sis.

    So homeless now and I am at the time going into my sophomore year and I have troubles at school. Everyone knew about my mom's affair and kids said my siblings should have been aborted and my mom was a... Night worker(trying to keep from using certain words) I would get into fights defending them so much that three teachers had to hold me back(I would release stress by punching a punching bag and lifting weights in the weight room at school.) I had to transfer schools because of the bullying

   I'm now in my Jr year at new school and everything is going good till we find my brother has health issues. I love my siblings to death and would do anything for them. It got to the point my mom told me I needed to stay home from school to watch my siblings when sick because she had to work. Ok she's a single mom and we are a large family. O big deal this one time. It became a habit, so much so my grades where affected. I almost didn't graduate because of it and my guidance councilor was concerned. He worked it out where I could get my degree and walk if I did one month of summer school.

  So I'm now fully out of school and mom found G3 and has been staying there with siblings while I stay at our house 3 towns away. (mom still pays rent at the house so im just living alone) fast forward it gets to where we move and i go live with uncle (he has been like a stand in dad to me) mom get in trouble with court and ask me to take my two siblings for a lil bit. (she is now preg with with G3 baby)  I do and they stay with me at my uncles house which is already too many people in the house but he is supportive and his wife watched my siblings while I went to work. So I kinda became a step in single mom. Mom eventually gets my siblings and I go to visit for thanks giving. I then find out abuse is happen to my siblings( third sibling baby brother is noe already born)  I tell my mom this isn't right and she needs to think about her kids and not about the guys. We argue a lil and she says"" I want atleast one of my kids to have there father in there life""that hurt me because it wasn't my fault my dad didn't want to stay with my mom or any of that.

   Fast forward mom breaks up with G3, I meet my fiance and things are going good. But mom noe uses me as a built in baby sitter again. I get calls from school having to pick my siblings up when I'm at work and or calling into work to watch them. My fiance helped out as well ((he's amazing and can't thank him enough he has helped me get a back bone))

  I finally move out of state with fiance and I also find out mom is with CG. She tells me again she in court trouble because of CG history and I get upset because I have this mentality of i have to be the mother so my fears kick in. I tell my grandparents and they are older and can't really do much which I understand. So I do the next best thing. I tell my siblings if anything happens they can always come to be regardless and I wouldn't judge them. I'd be there for them. Well as time goes on mom tells me what this CG dose and how he takes her money and I tell her to leave him. Your a strong woman and have been a single mom for so long. Thing of your kids, but no work. It geta to where CG buts into mine and my moms convoys, and tells me when I can talk to my siblings. He talks bad about me and my fiance too.

   This already really long but basicly my relationship with my mom is so bad and I long to have that mother daughter relationship. My mom dose have some good points but there few and far between.

I almost can't relate at all with the feelings I had of needing to break up.

The funny thing is when we broke up the first time, I had these same feelings. Then when we got back together, I quickly started to feel the feelings of wanting to end it. We had communication issues that were just not being resolved. She was highly disagreeable when we had a problem to resolve, e.g. I rarely felt like we were 'on the same team' when discussing a problem. She was also a high emotional/reactive person, and I'm much more subdued and unenthiusiastic which aggravated her. This led to many arguments.

I know. I'd probably end up feeling the same feelings. But fuck I can't stop thinking about her.

I (24f) have been seeing this guy (24m) for about two months. We met on bumble and met in person after a few days. We’ve been on a few dates (rock climbing and bar), after the second we just started going to his house to watch movies. He comes across, at least to me, as a shy and cautious guy. He didn’t touch me once our first time meeting, would even apologize for brushing hands or something, until we kissed later that night. The other “dates” or whatever that we’ve had have been kind of the same way, he won’t touch me unless we’re kissing and I can tell he’s just kinda leaving it up to me, which I don’t mind, it’s a bit of a challenge i guess. Well this pass month we’ve both been busy and haven’t been able to see each other due to existing plans (I haven’t really been keeping him in the loop to be honest). I was free for one weekend last week (I’m out of town now) and told him we should hang out (not gonna lie, might’ve been a bit awkward about it). He said he’d like to, he was busy on Saturday but he’s free the rest of the weekend. I said okay and kind of left it at that. Well Sunday rolls around and I wait for him to snap me, he never does (he never snaps me first in general honestly). I end up telling him later that night that he could come over if he wanted (first time I’ve invited him over). He said he’s grading currently and will see when he gets done. I wait around for a while but end up going to bed since I was tired. He texted me around 10 that night saying he wasn’t ignoring me and had just finished up. Since then we’ve been talking a little bit, less since I’m out of town, but he never really said we should hangout a different day or anything. I’m wondering if maybe he was making an excuse and just being nice so he didn’t out right reject me. But then his wording made it seem like he did actually want to hang out.

Whatever. This is a long rant about the drama in my life, so I do just want to get it off my chest some more, but also I do want advice.

The last time I saw her (I'll call her B) was Sept 21st. We slept together, she went through my phone, went back to sleep, and then in the afternoon asked if I slept with my ex (call her E). I said yes. She told me to get out. I talked for a minute, but pretty much immediately gathered my things and left. She stayed sitting on the bed as I left. That morning, before she confronted me, I helped her by watching her kitten as she vacuumed her room, which was the agreed upon reason for my visit. We had been having issues for a long time at this point, and after we kissed she asked me what it meant. I said it meant that I love her.

On the 23rd of Sept I begged B to stay friends with me. I eventually gave up and told her that she's right, she can leave my life if she wants. A few days later her friend's husband attacks me on Instagram for being a cheater. B texts me and tells me she felt vindicated. The next day I text her to arrange a time to talk about our stuff, when can I drop it off, etc. I become upset and tell her I want to keep some things. She asks me if I even care about her and then says ""fuck you."" I block her. On Oct 19th I unblocked her and reached out. At first I just said I miss you, can we talk, but she wasn't available for that, so we ended the conversation talking about her stuff. She still hasn't picked it up or had someone else do it.

When I unblocked her I accidentally saw that she had gone on our traditional pumpkin patch/carving date with another guy. I immediately recognized this name from a notification that came up on her phone several months ago as I was grabbing it for her. I have not looked at her social media since.

In February of this year, the night before Valentine's Day, B told me that she didn't love me anymore. We fought and cried a lot in March. Eventually she decided that she wanted to find someone that could meet her needs better than I was. I begged her to stay friends even though she had told me that if I were to see someone else that she could not bear to be friends with me. I was and still am devastated by this.

In April, B asked to open the relationship. I agreed, as it was something I had always believed would benefit her and was hopeful she may begin to accept us both moving on. She told me that if I were to see anyone else I couldn't confide in her about it, and that I was banned from seeing exes. Within a few weeks she had gone on several ""tinder"" dates. One was with someone who had asked her out when we had first met, and that she got ready for while staying with me (we had sex the night before, and when I went to ask what we were doing the next day she said she had 'plans' and I had to pry), and another was with a greasy man who went too far with her and upset her. We ran into that man because he ended up working for a store we frequently visited. She cried to me after the SA happened. We went to a park by her house late at night to talk things out. The relationship stayed open into the summer, but B eventually asked to close it in July when she realized I was getting closer to E again, and that E and I had sexted. Neither B or I ever talked about anything we were doing, she only found out about the sexting because she went thru my phone. It's worth noting that was not the first time she went thru my phone. Our first big fight in Oct 2020 (that ended in her leaving quietly, confronting me via text, and blocking me for a night) was because she went thru my phone and saw I had snapchat installed with some naughty names on it.

E and I first dated in 2016. I was her first sexual relationship. She dumped me for my toxic bestfriend at the time and they dated for three years. It was an awful experience. E was awful to me. In early 2019 E apologized to me. It took a few months, but I eventually agreed to meet her. We hooked up but it didn't feel right. Later that week in 2019 B and I met and had our first date. At the end of the date, we kissed, went back to my place, and hooked up. I fell in love with her, head over heels. E and I texted once or twice after that, but both agreed that I was more interested in B. At first B wanted to just be casual, and I was totally in agreement, but after she found out about me hooking up with E she demanded we be monogamous, and I said yes. B would later recognize that she felt threatened and jealous. It's worth noting that at first I only admitted to just kissing E. It later came out that we hooked up, and B was upset. It's also worth noting that I brought up my exes on the first date in an uncool way that I later recognized and apologized for.

B and I lived together for the most part. Over the summer we worked together too, so we were together basically 24/7 from June to September of this year. This was not the first time we had lived together for an extended period of time, or even worked together. We ended this summer with a vacation. I thought we had a very romantic time together and was excited to see where the relationship went, but one night towards the end we got into a huge fight. At this point we had met up with my family who was also on vacation (this was according to plan, our romantic get away was the days before), and they asked B to help with an arts and crafts project. B procrastinated, and then when I wanted to join in when she got to it she didn't like how I was participating so she told me ""why don't I go watch TV with my brother."" At this point I could tell she wasn't feeling or acting right. I didn't navigate the situation as best as I could. I was offended we didn't get to do this together, she didn't really care, I tried to confront her about her behavior being irrational (something she had asked me to do in general), but she said I was gaslighting and then stormed off. I followed her, didn't handle the situation well some more, was provocative tying to prove a point, eventually said fuck it, went for a midnight run, and told myself I need to get away from this.

At the beginning of September I confided in some friends and decided to break up. I told her that I needed space, and a break. She didn't give me space, or a break. I met up with E, didn't kiss or hook up, wasn't even tempted, and she and I just talked about our lives. Then B tells me that she doesn't want me to visit E, she's worried that I am, and that she doesn't trust me not to hookup. I, stupidly, lied to her and told her I wasn't going to see E. Well, I did, and I guess I gave her something to be upset about. A few days later I called B and told her we needed to make this break officially. We cried on the phone and agreed to meet a few more times.

I never stopped loving B. I'm still in love with her despite everything, and especially despite her telling me she wants nothing to do with me. I'm so upset with her for discarding and abandoning me. We were practically married for over two years considering how much time we have lived together since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Even before that, she spent Christmas 2019 with me, and stayed over for more than just the weekends as she had been doing since the beginning of the relationship. I cant stop crying and missing her. I miss her so much. I've lost my bestfriend and my lover. I have accepted this change, and have been doing so much that this past month has felt like a year already. Even knowing this I am struggling a lot. In a way it still feels like a dream.

Thanks for reading all of that. Again, this is kind of just a rant, but I really am struggling and would appreciate advice.

I had a talk with him a while back about how I want him to stop doing this with me, and he stopped for a bit, and now he’s doing it again.

This girl is great, in almost all ways but one. She is negative, like all the time. She’s got anxiety as well as OCD, but that’s not all of it. For a while her anxiety was really bad and I almost left then, because I just couldn’t handle all of these things she was constantly telling me about and how awful she felt.

Me (25f) and my bf (27m) have been together almost a year and a half. We’ve bickered here and there, but last weekend we had our first big blowout fight. The worst part is, I was so drunk and barely remember any of it. I know know how bad it was because of what he told me. There was some generalized name calling and I pushed past him to go down a hallway, which I would have never thought I would do. That’s not who I am. 

The fight started over absolutely nothing. Basically I was being stubborn and drunk and he was frustrated with me. It turned into me voicing insecurities (while yelling) that I really thought I had gotten past - but apparently drunk me wanted to bring that shit up again. I know if I was sober I wouldn’t have, because honestly I don’t feel that way anymore. 

I rarely drink. Usually I’m a lot of fun when I do drink, but apparently I got to a level I never have before and I was acting a fool. I acknowledged this and apologized for it. It will not happen again.

When we talked about it the next day, my bf was very understanding. He said he was disappointed, but he knows that’s not the person I am. He says he has done some stupid stuff while blackout drunk and knows how it can make people not act themselves. But I have carried this guilt over the past week, and I sense my bf has been more distant. I am a worry wart, so there’s a chance in reading a little too into it though. Im worried I ruined the image he has for me in his head. What if he got the “ick?!” There’s been time when he’s more quiet, kind of down. And I just don’t know what to think. I ask he’s feeling down because of me, and he says no. 

Last night I pointed out that I’ve felt he’s been less lovey towards me since it happened. He told me I should stop thinking about last weekend and stop worrying about it. I asked if I changed his view of me, and he said “I don’t have a different view of you, i just thought we were in a better place than apparently we are.”

I don’t know what to do now. He is still telling me he loves me and we’re making plans for the future, but he is usually so happy and chatty, over the last week he’s more mellowed out. 

I’m committed to not drinking like that ever again, and won’t lash out again knowing now the guilt I feel over treating him poorly - he doesn’t deserve it. 

Thoughts? Will this get better with time, meaning him get back to his normal self?

Everything was literally perfect for the first 6. Like i have NEVER in my life felt so comfy and attracted and motivated by a s/o.

A month ago I found out he was secretly paying SW for full service massages. He legit ended up like going down on these women, even tho a condom was used for sex. The thing is, I literally wouldn’t have been mad about this if he would have just been honest with me. I love massages, I get that monogamy isn’t sustainable (6 months in tho??) and I am sexually open. In fairness, I didn’t make this *totally* clear bc he was very nervous the first time we slept together so I didn’t want to scare him off by mentioning how sexually open I am.

However open, I INTENSELY value honesty, integrity, and loyalty. Loyalty literally just involves being honest about what you want and maybe being willing to compromise.

The issues started when I called him out on it and he piled on the lies not knowing how much I knew.

I told him, and then he continued to lie about it until he finally came fully clean (I think..it’s bothering me bc I feel like there are still details he lied about and I will never know bc there is literally no humanly possible way to).

Not only that, but he was actively pushing me away and not making any effort to talk to me or even really respond or see me. I get that he was embarrassed, but I told him SO many times that the only thing he had to be embarrassed about was the lying.

We then tried for a few days to talk things out/go back to normal ish, but I wasn’t in the best place in my head, and he forgot about a few conversations that we had and it made me feel so worthless and not important to him, so I did something dumb and made an account online to go on a *mutually beneficial* date with some rich guy. This was spiteful and childish and I shouldn’t have done it. I told him everything the next day and asked for some space.

I didn’t really want space, tho, which I realized like 3 days in. It was especially hard bc he kept sending me the occasional text about work (he recently joined the same field Im in) and a meme here and there.

I tried talking to him more about stuff, but he seemed weirdly distant, esp bc he was still kind of sometimes messaging me. By the end of that week, I ended up sending him a nude and he literally didn’t respond. I felt so dumb. I then learned that he was talking to his ex from several years ago who we talked about in depth when we first started dating. We had such deep conversations about our past. He said she reached out to him bc she just broke off her engagement with her abusive fiancée who she actually left him for like 7 yrs ago. That was also a lie. *he* reached out to her. He told me this in a conversation where I doubled back and asked him again, and he said his knee jerk reaction is to lie about these things bc no one has ever been understanding or open w him.

It’s just so weird bc we went from spending every day together to barely seeing each other at all, and when we do, it’s for like 2 hrs of being awake and then we go to sleep and I leave for work in the AM. it’s hard to do that with a person who you thought you could trust but now you don’t know AND you also are spending less time physically together.

I’m so tired of shitty relationships where there’s no true honesty. What’s the point in looking for a life partner if you can’t be totally honest with them?

I thought I’d be single until I was 30 before I met him. I told him that. I wanted to be by myself bc I’d been burned so many times and just wanted to enjoy what was left of my 20s. He was so sweet and amazing and kept asking to be exclusive so I ended up giddily agreeing. I thought I found my person to get old with.

At this point, I’m dating to literally grow old and die together - I don’t want to waste my energy on fucking around w getting (emotionally) involved w men otherwise. He knew this from the rip. 

We’ve known each other for almost 3 yrs, but we haven’t been dating for a year yet. I can’t tell if it’s too early to actually be certain that all the other parts of him are as amazing and perfectly fitting for me. I don’t want to stop trying, tho, but I’m literally going to ruin this relationship myself with how much I distrust him.

He recently said he’s super into my whole ‘Bonnie &amp; Clyde’ outlook on our relationship as he put it, but I’m not sure if he’s just going to lie to me as much as he sees fit about things I can never know about.

The final week there was no communication or anything and continued into the first week of November. 

A part of me thought he ghosted me but also I know that he has a lot of gigs that week which required traveling (hes a musician) so i was trying to be understanding as well.

She is traveling tonight, coming from abroad, and is staying at my place.

I kinda like how she looks lately and want to hook up with her.

How do I approach this situation so that I don't ruin the friendship?

background on how we got here:
a mutual friend of outs has her birthday tomorrow and we wanted to organize a pre-party at my place. the birthday friend said she can't make it tonight since she's going out with her bf. so this got canceled.

i asked my long time friend if she's still stopping by

she said:

""we can go out
i'm staying at lisa's
i broke up with my bf 😂
if there is space i'm coming at your place 😂""

For the last 4-5 years we've have quite a few struggles in our relationship and we have both had personal health issues. I have become very depressed and exhausted, especially in the last 3. Having our son was my greatest joy and I love our son dearly as well as loving my boyfriend dearly. But in the last 3 years we have also fought a lot. His mom moved in to help me with house work and the baby when I first had him, but unfortunately she did neither. I would get yelled at if the house was dirty but his mother? Radio silence for her though she was supposed to be here only to help me since being pregnant with and having my son was quiet rough on my body and I actually said yes and accepted help from someone for once instead of doing things on my own till I broke, but that was a mistake. She made more messes, cost us more more to have here (money we couldn't afford especially after having a new born baby), I received no help, I was the only one that got yelled at if things weren't done.
Once she moved out we did okay for a while. I worked some till he got upset and I became a stay at home mom because that is what he wanted. It was easier to give up though the money was needed. He got let go at one job due to Covid. He found another quickly. The manger there got on his nerves after a while, so he quit. He went through some health issues but continue to say he would get another job, 2 months go by though. Our savings is gone. I finally get the balls to say I'll work instead. He allowed it. Wow. After making me quit like 3 other jobs over our relationship because ""the men are meant to work"". I take over though. I get a job at at place that's high paced, lots of physical work, etc. I come exhausted. A lot. He worked retail, it, customer service, which is respectable but far less physically. When I get home I am tired, I am still the one that has to cook and clean everything but the dishes. He does the dishes at least I guess. But that's is. But I am so tired. I am not going to yell at him. I remember and think about the phrase ""I wanted to died and you were yelling at me about the dishes"" a lot because after I had our son I had terrible PPD and was exhausted and I have lupus so my body was constantly fighting itself because it flared badly has child birth. Over the last year especially I have come to realize that I am the only one he he yells at for things he lets everyone else get away with, including himself. But I get yelled at or berated and never once have I done the same to him. I have talked to him, but calmly. From time to time I have cried from the stress of needing help while talking to him and he can't stand people crying. But lately within the last year I have no sex drive or well more so no will to engage with it. I am tired, exhausted even, depressed and feel best down, I don't even think about myself as attractive at all, not even when my makeup is nice, I don't think about sex really. I used to all the time and was happy to engage or whatever. But recently... Radio silence. He is upset but this. I have tried to explain. I don't know what else too do. But now it's causing issues as well that I don't ask him for sex. He solely has to ask me, because it doesn't cross my mind and if it does I don't have the energy or will to care enough to try .

Ian let them know that we will be able to come on Saturday morning but he had to leave 30 minutes to get a haircut (as other days were not available since he had to leave the city again on Monday) and another 1 and a half hours to a footbal game (he has joined a football team and has games every satuday). This wouldn’t have been a problem as Sam and Anna had plans to make sushi and it would have taken around 2 hours anyways (which we suggested we can make it during Ian’s footbal game). Well, Anna wrote Ian a really long message which was wrapped in sugar telling us exactly this “we understand that it wasn’t up to you that you left town, but we decided we do not want to watch GOT anymore and we will decide Friday what we’ll watch. Please understand that the one’s that will spend more time at the house will decide what we will watch. We appreciate that you did not cancel the weekend with us, but we won’t be upset if you decide to just come to us for a chat and you wish to spend more time with your gf as you were away. Don’t get me wrong, you are more than welcome to either a chat or the marathon, but make it be good for you”. This triggered me so much as 1. She was sounding like she didn’t want us there anymore, and 2. She basically said that we had no choice is the matter of choosing the movie/show as we had to be missing 2 hours and the ones that were staying for the whole time were choosing. I started a whole argument with her due to the “we have no choice regarding the movie” part and I went too strong on her, and I apologised after as I know I should have been nicer. She said that she didn’t mean that we had no choice in the matter, she meant that we didn’t have the majoritary vote and that no one said we couldn’t choose something else if we were not ok with what they chose on Friday. Also she said that I should not be upset and that I interpreted everything. I told her that I did not interpretate anything, as I just told her what she wrote Ian, which is “the one’s who spend most time at the house will decide the movie”, so we, that had to leave for 2 hours, had to accept their choice and not be upset about it. I assumed that us being a group, we will chose the movie together, as this is what I think it is right.
A week after the argument she texted me to “apologise” which I think it made it worse as her apologie was “I am sorry you interpretated it wrong, I asked my brother to be objective of this and he agrees with me. I cannot apologise for saying it wrong as I do not belive I did anything wrong”. 
My bf tels me to let it go as she is known to be stubborn, but I really do belive that she was bossy and mean and it really hurt my feelings. I know this whole argument is silly and a stupid reason to stop being friends with someone, but I felt that my feelings are disregarded and I hate being bossed around. It's not about the movie, it's about her not giving us any choice. 
How should I manage this?

Me and my girlfriend have been together for three years now. We started long-distance around three months ago since she went to college out of state. When she first got there, her text between me and her were very dry. She would barely text throughout the day and would barely call. In the span of almost 3 weeks, she only called me four times. In the time I just thought she was trying to make new friends so I gave her the space she needed. But after one day of only sending me one text throughout the whole day, I got frustrated and told her how I felt. we talked about it, and she said she understood and sees how it would bother me for what she was doing. A week goes by and everything is good. She talk to me on FaceTime and also texted me more often. But once it came to the weekend, she went to parties and would only text me when she leaves her dorm and when she comes back, and even then she would only sometimes send me a text. I got frustrated once again and brought it up the weekend of Halloween. The reason I got frustrated was because she wore something that I always said that she should wear, but never wanted to in front of me. I found it very weird how she could wear something low-cut in front of other people but not in front of me. Every time I used to ask why she wouldn’t wear stuff like that in front of me. She would say that it’s not comfy and it’s a hassle to wait for her so I always dropped it. During Halloween weekend she texted very briefly, and then went to parties and didn’t text me for the rest of the night except for one night saying a good night text. When I brought it up to her, she said the same thing as before saying she understood where I was coming from and can see why I feel this way. Again a week after she still does the same thing with not texting me over the weekend and if she does text, it’s very brief and dry conversations. When I say she doesn’t text me for long periods of time it’s between five hours or longer.

I understand how in moments you can be having fun especially for Halloween. But I don’t think it’s that hard for someone to text, even just an update on what she’s doing. She could leave me unread for hours and not want to talk and if we do talk on FaceTime sometimes she’s doing other things or is not really giving me her full attention in the hour of FaceTime if we’re lucky.

I love my girlfriend very much, and I would never want our relationship to end. I just feel that she lost her feelings or just doesn’t care to put in more effort anymore. I feel communication is a key part relationship and I feel my girlfriend lacks it over the weekend since she wants to have fun I’m assuming. Don’t get me wrong there’s nothing wrong with having fun but I don’t see why it’s so hard to just send a simple text back over the weekend to keep me informed on how shes doing.

Since this is happening, almost every single weekend, I just feel my girlfriend doesn’t care about my feelings. Since I’ve told her already a couple times and she still does it the week after. Since she moved to a college across the country, the only person I would know is her. I trust her completely, but there has already been a couple situations in our relationship, where I have caught her in a lie. Although the lies were not big they were weird situations to lie about. I honestly believe my girlfriend won’t cheat on me, but there’s a small chance that makes me think that she might since the way she acts in all the situations.

I love my girlfriend very much and I feel sometimes me wanting some more communication over the weekends it’s selfish of me. Since during the week she does keep in contact pretty well. It hurts my heart every week how she can go so long with what it seems to me is not even thinking about me since she can go so long with not sending a text or even wanting to talk to me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7537678,public,self,Me (23M) feels that my girlfriend (22F) doesn’t put effort in our long distance relationship.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yu6u5l/me_23m_feels_that_my_girlfriend_22f_doesnt_put/,all_ads,6,,,

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for around four years and he is actively playing GTA on his computer with his friends. For him it's a way to cope with stress. He is also in a Discord channel for his gaming. Since I think two months now he also downloaded Snapchat and has been using it regularly for his gaming.   
I told him, that I think Snapchat at his age is kind of weird and for me Snapchat is a platform for cheaters or to cheat more easily. He told me not to worry but yesterday I saw that he got a message on Snapchat from a female and I worried (no I didn't went through his phone). I asked him about it and he told me, that this was a girl from his GTA group. 

I don't know how to react to it. Any advice there?

Also with his discord channel, they have an online meeting every sunday and in the beginning he would do that at my place but now he wants to get home early every sunday to take the meeting there.

And last for a month now he was telling me, that he felt 'down/ depressed', so I was giving him space for himself and told him to contact me, if he needs anything and if I can help with anything but that I won't push myself on him.  He is not really communicating with me, what is going on and also that he doesn't even know what is going on. He grew distanced with his texting just small messages and sometimes only like two messages a day. We now only see each other every other weekend because he feels depressed at these weekends and doesn't want to spend time with me. But then I see how his online status on discord changes from online to invisible to sleep and so on.   


Any advice on how I can communicate my worries to him? And am I paranoid?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year and she is a really sweet and kind person, but i just worry about her and what a future with us would be like.

Heres the thing, she doesnt really do a whole lot day to day. She has never lived away from home, never had a job, doesnt drive, and is currently taking just one online class and is struggling with it. 

Im pretty much the only person she talks to outside of her family, and most uncomfortable experiences are unmanageable for her. Like recently she went to a dentist appointment just for a routine checkup, and she ended up leaving without having anything done because she got so scared she was crying.

It just really sucks, i love her and she loves me, i try to support her and push her to do things, but it doesnt really go anywhere. I just dont know what to do and honestly i just start to feel less attracted to her. 

Like i said, she lives with her family and she doesnt really get along well with them. If i left i feel like i would be a monster. But i dont know what to do. Shes already in therapy and has been long before we met.

I worry like, if we ended up moving in together, i would not be able to support us both, and i wouldnt really want to. I will probably be moving around the state soon too so picking her up from her parents house will be more difficult.

I began to spiral and make terrible decisions, and one day while my gf was at work I met up with a girl off of a website (I won’t say what one) and went over her house. She attempted to give me oral but I couldn’t get it up and realized what a huge mistake I was making, and so I left. Every night since then I’ve felt nothing but guilt I can hardly spend time with my gf without feeling like I’m gonna break down. I want to come clean but this would absolutely crush her and I’d end the relationship but without a proper reason she won’t accept it, I don’t want it to be over and I wish I realized this before I fucked up, I’m at a loss for what to do, I just don’t wanna hurt my gf.

He's 27 and I'm 24. Recently, he's been dealing with a lot mentally and has been super stressed out. I've been trying to help him and be there for him to vent to and just be in his presence to let him know he's not alone but I have not been pushing myself into his personal space. I spent the entire past week over at his house and everytime he expressed that he felt overwhelmed or wanting to distant himself I would ask of he needs me to step out and let him have his space to himself and he would say no. I very rarely show up without asking first and sometimes he would when push for me to come over. 

However my problem is that he just leaves without telling me. For example, yesterday I went out with him and his mom and after a while he left the store without really telling us. Sensing that he just wanted some time to himself I waited a few before following him outside only to not find him anywhere. I'd ask the security, and I searched the entire compound and didn't find him. I tried to call and his phone was off. He eventually came back but he didn't tell me nor his mom where he left off to and honestly I was a bit worried. He usually has a business he runs in the evenings until at night and sometime in the week he just up and left without telling me not his parents and I had to run things until he eventually came back 2 hours before closing. There have been other times in the week where I would be returning to his house after work only to find that he's not home and he was by a friend but he didn't tell me even though he knew I was on my way home. 

I know the first reaction is that maybe he's cheating but I really don't think he is. At least I hope not. I've been through his phone, knowing his mom I know she won't allow anything like that to happen and she always has a track on where he is because she's a very attached mother. 

He says he's very stressed and sometimes he just needs a break to be by himself and take a walk or to just gather his thoughts which I've been very understanding of or at least tried to be very understanding of, but I just want him to tell me when he's leaving and where he's going so at least I know nothing's happened to him or that he hasn't hurt himself. Just this morning he was getting some stuff done around the house while I was still in bed and I felt like he was taking a long time so I went to look for him only to find that he wasn't home and when he called he said he left to pick up something from his dad's house that he needed for an event he was going to in a few hours. He didn't even pop in the room to just tell me or shoot me a text or a call to let me know and when I brought that up he just said he has a lot on his mind and didn't think about it or something to that effect.

He would comment things like, ""I saw this super hot girl in a bar"" and when I confront him, he would look me dead in the eyes and tell me he never said that. When I press further by giving him details of when, what, how, and where he said it, he would simply tell me that he doesn't remember. 

This time was the last strike. We were going up the escalator when I caught him glancing at an attractive lady going down the escalator (the escalators were side to side). I understand this behavior because even I tend to steal a glance when I see an attractive face. The problem was, however, how he reacted when I addressed this situation. Once again, he completely denied looking at this lady when I literally caught him. 

I thought he might have denied it because of how I initially reacted. I was visibly upset and he noticed, but I started to joke about it to lighten the mood. I even told him it was normal afterwards when we decided to talk things through. However everything turned upside down when he told me he did not see the lady. He started saying how he never looked back in the first place and that I was making things up. I was taken back by his comment. I was shocked that he would even try to deny it. He told me I was looking for a fight with him as usual. 

At this point, I was done. I asked him again whether he was 100% serious about him not looking back. He said he never did and he gave me a dialogue of what he was thinking during that moment. He mentioned how he was zoning out while thinking about work. I had enough and started to pack my things. I am currently at my own place and I just wanted advice on how to deal with my situation.

I would have believed if he told me he zoned out, but he went as far as to say that I am making things up to start a fight. This is the furthest thing I would do to him because I truly cherish him. This really hurts.

I still do love and care for him. I even called him and said I wanted to talk things through and he sarcastically said that he's sorry and  he called me back saying he never looked back at her.

So I'm (30f) currently in a relationship with my boyfriend (36m) of 6 years, he's sweet and everything. There's some flaws in our relationship yes and we both have our quirks but we're human. Anyways, like a month ago, I saw my crush (33m) from junior high on Facebook and I thought, oh I'll send him a request and just message him to see how he's been. You know, to catch up. Well I messaged him and omg we could not stop talking. We have so much chemistry and I did tell him I had a boyfriend and he was just like, ""well thats too bad because I would have loved to take you out."" And we kept talking like maybe a bit flirty and then he completely ghosts me for about 10 days. I hit him up everyday without wanting to seem creepy just telling him that he's been on my mind and that I hope he's okay, etc etc. Well, we both have a mutual friend from childhood and I messaged him and asked if he knew what was going on with my Jr high crush because I haven't heard from him and hoped he was okay at least. Our mutual friend said he will let him know and then proceeded to message me the next day that my Jr high crush wanted me to stop messaging him and stop bothering him. Dude, my heart sank. I had no idea what was up. So after carefully considering the situation I founded that I needed some type of closure and I needed to talk to my old crush one last time. So I sent him a message on Facebook and I asked him why did he ghost me and that I needed closure and he said that he does not want to try to build any closeness to me because I am in a relationship already. He thinks it's messed up because he's been cheated on and he doesn't want to be that guy to break up a relationship. He said he wants to be with me and that he cares for me but the fact that I can't be his is just messing with him so he wants to strictly be friends until I become single then we can pick up where we left off. I literally felt like I went through a break up. I never meant for this to go as far as it did but to be clear, we never met up in person, he lives an hour away and we never exchanged I love yous and what not. But the chemistry was immaculate. Like wow. And for him to respect my relationship made me like him even more. So that's where I'm at. 
The current situation with my boyfriend is that we do live together, I have 1 kid of my own and he has none, my family loves him, his family loves me but I'm so confused. Like I understand the situation is wrong so please don't come at me, but the chemistry we had was just incredible. I don't want to risk the comfortable life I have to try to be with some bad boy but I always wonder, what if? Also my Jr high crush just got out of a 10 year relationship, has a crazy baby momma, has 1 kid with her, she shows up at his place causing havoc and drama and I looked them both up and they have both been to jail like a dozen times. Anyways, that's all I got. I'm not looking for any specific advice, but maybe input. I already know I'm in the wrong so please let's not go there but omg why am I like this?

It’s been a few months.
We also happen to have very similar interests/hobbies (both kinda geeks) and have this project we want work together on. So, after a few discussions and plans, I naturally I invited her to my house to make it happen. 

This is where it gets complicated.

We both come from stricter households so we don’t assume sexual intentions unless explicit. Recently, I suggested if she was cool to come over to my house when I have it all to myself (when my parents are out for the month). I didn’t expect a comfortable reply (coming from strict parents n all) - but she was thrilled! She seemed to very much like the idea! She told me her parents rlly didn’t mind and she’s open about me with them…

Then few days after she’s dropped some semi-serious lines on text that she’s “open-minded” likes to “try new things and “seek new experiences 😉” (yes with that emoji). 


Now I was completely confused.

Since we haven’t put an official name on our “thing” AND that we’re both from stricter households I don’t know how to expect when she comes over.
Now, is this situation being overthought or are we all on the same page here in terms of what’s gonna happen when she comes over home alone (not looking just like “project work”, although I’m cool with that hah)??

He was in hospital recently and was very ill. The doctors think he might have a type of kidney disease. This has instilled a vast amount of anxiety within me and triggered various complexes that I have.

I have very insecure attachment issues. I fear losing him, which is causing me to want to overly control what he eats since I want him to be healthy. I am anxious that he will die prematurely and my brain has driven me to obsess over his health. To me, I actually think this is rather selfish as I don't want to be left alone. I am prone to thinking of death often and want him to be with me for a long time because I love him. I feel like I'm often just grappling with the inevitable.

 I've also been encouraging him a lot to exercise. Unfortunately, I openly show my disappointment when I believe he makes unhealthy choices. I don't necessarily say he can't eat this or that, but it's implied when I show my dismay about him wanting to eat a certain food. I also get sad when he says he cba to exercise with me and thus he feels an extreme amount of pressure to exercise and eat what I want him to in order to keep me happy.

I can see that this is very controlling behaviour which I want to put a stop to. Clearly my own insecurities are causing this projection and obsession with us being healthy. Sometimes I do get confused because I don't know when it gets too abusive and controlling and when it's just caring about his health to prevent any underlying health conditions in the future? What do I also do when he sometimes chooses to be unhealthy? I don't want him to feel anxious all the time and feel like he constantly has to please me. Could anyone help and advise me on the best way to approach this? He has actually done really well and eats healthy the majority of the time - I guess when you're insecure and anxious like me, perhaps it never seems enough ?


It's hard to accept sometimes that he can make his own decisions. I'm too wrapped up in my selfish behaviour of me wanting him to be healthy and here with me. I love him too much and it hurts when I think about him not being here with me. This is obviously an extreme anxiety and insecurity that I understand I must address.

Unfortunately soon after this he had to go overseas to his home country to visit family. The internet there is very shoddy and the time difference is a lot so we haven’t been able to talk too much. We’re using WhatsApp, either we’ll send messages, call, or video chat. 

Prior to this I asked if he wanted to go with me to visit my family on Christmas, since he’s not doing anything. Yeah yeah this was probably way too soon but whatever. He seemed totally down. So while he’s overseas, I learn he hasn’t bought his plane ticket yet and now it’s too expensive. He says we can drive there but it’s over 30 hours, but okay I just say that could be fun. I have limited PTO though and don’t want to use it on the road when I can be spending time with my family. So I do some research on airline cards that offer points for signing up (I’ve done this a lot and figured since we talked a lot about traveling, he would be interested in getting a card). 

The same day he messages me saying he definitely can’t make it and apologizes. He offers to do something on New Years if I’m interested.

I should have called him, and been open with about how I feel. But I was angry. It felt like he hadn’t taken my offer seriously from the start, If he did, why didn’t he buy his ticket already when it was more affordable?? Likewise, we talked about New Years twice already before he left, and I said twice I definitely want to do something - why would he ask me “if I’m interested”? Of course I am, wasn’t he hearing me the last two times we discussed this? 

My stupid sensitive emotional ass wrote back if he was serious about driving or just joking, and when he asked why he would joke, I said because I can never fucking tell when he’s serious. He often jokes around and says things where it’s hard to tell how serious he is or if he’s truly interested in doing something. 

Since that message he hasn’t responded to me. I’ve messaged him a few times, apologizing and wanting to talk, and called, but WhatsApp shows he hasn’t read my messages and he hasn’t answered my calls which show “ringing”. 

I haven’t heard from him for a few days, and I know the internet and time difference is shit but I’m really worried about him. Even if he doesn’t want to talk to me, I just want to know he’s safe. But I don’t have the contact info of any of his friends to check in and see if they’ve heard from him either. I’m so worried and anxious, and know I could have communicated my frustration in a better way. 

I don’t know what to do other than just wait now. We talked everyday before this so even though it was difficult to connect, we still were able to at least shoot messages to check in with one another.

I don’t know what to do other than wait. Is there even anything I can do? I know I was an asshole and I want to apologize and talk about it, but I don’t know if he’s just not able to get internet or if he’s purposefully ignoring me. Either way, I just want to know he’s safe. He’s coming back around Thanksgiving - given this, should I just stop trying to contact him and wait for him to get back? I don’t want to ruin his time with his family, and if that means we don’t talk for a few more weeks than okay…but I just want to know he’s safe, and we can discuss anything else when he’s back.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7537556,public,self,Haven’t heard from my (29F) boyfriend (34M) who’s overseas,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yu6c6y/havent_heard_from_my_29f_boyfriend_34m_whos/,all_ads,6,,,

A little back story. Partner and I have been together nearly 8 years. Bought a house last year, coming up for one full year in the house. 

Had ups and down about trusts etc and how I have been made to feel about how I look based on what's he's said at the start and his actions. He's told another girl he had feelings for her. Strip clubs, messaging other women they're pretty.

I'm insecure. Some of this on fully on myself. Some has begun with stuff he has said and done. 
In the past he's been to strip clubs (paid for private) I don't agree with and he said he wouldn't again but did a few more times. 
Screenshot girls he knows etc
Basically stuff that makes me doubt how attractive I am as I feel he wouldn't need to if he liked me enough. And that's just not how I'd respect a relationship.

Anyways. His friend recently blurted out that he'd been at a strip club and got another private dance when he knew that it hurt me and it was crossing a boundary for me. Especially given he'd promised time and time again to not do so again.
We fall out, I leave the situation and later that night he cheats on me. This was about 3 months ago. A few days later, I have a gut feeling something happened and I call it out. He admits it. (said he doesn't know if he would have told me ever, though he was feeling guilty.)

This broke me. And I found out he slept with me a couple days after before even having an std test. I felt violated. 
He left for a few days, came back and we said we would try move and and make it work. He promised me he would stop all his bad behaviours as he didn't want to hurt me ever again. I've recently seen he's been searching girls on Facebook again, and it's gotten to me. I ask how he knows to search them and why he done so and it's just ""I don't know, I don't remember"" but they're attractive. We all know why he's done it. I'm questioning how he knows their names as their not friends and I'm worried he's been cheating again. Or about to.

I'm trying to not be insecure or controlling. But I keep getting called stuff like ""mental"" and insecure. Saying other guys do it too. Etc. 
Has it gone too far? I don't think he gets how to build trust. I love him and don't want to leave, but I'm just so sad.

Sorry for any typos.

With that being said I genuinely have nothing but respect and love towards them, I’m just not blind to the fact that some of people, men and women, can just be bad people. I’m a very opinionated person, if I see something I don’t like I speak on it. She even jokingly tells me “you hate women” and we laugh about it. Well there weren’t any laughs last night.

She told me “maybe we shouldn’t have daughters”, Implying that I have so much resentment and disdain towards women that I would bring those negative emotions and views onto my own child for being born as female. 

It has me feeling very weird and uncomfortable. I’m upset, but I’m more so disappointed and hurt that the person who claims they want to start a family with me doesn’t have faith in me being a good father to a daughter. I’d be in the wrong if I took the negative things she’s said about men and say “you shouldn’t have sons”, because I wouldn’t even fix my lips to even say something like that.

We work inside a retail store; I’m working in the Optical center and she’s working as loss prevention/security. 

It started about 3 months ago after a brief interaction I had with her. Whatever I said or did really impressed her, because afterwards I noticed her watching me from a distance and then she started walking by the Optical center and giving me hardcore F-me eyes. This happened for a few days before I approached her, and right away I noticed some red flags that signaled her to be toxic/immature. A part of me lost interested after seeing certain things from her, but she kept on giving me those looks/chasing after my attention, so I couldn’t just ignore her completely. I must admit that my actions towards her became toxic and I know it only created a deep tension between us. For a month, everything between us was Hot &amp; Cold/Cat &amp; Mouse. Eventually I got so frustrated that I just stayed hot towards her even though she was still after my attention, and then one day I was so hot towards her that my intuition kicked in and told me to make a move because I had pushed her away. Well, the next day I tried talking to her and got rudely &amp; loudly rejected. I saw it coming a mile away, but I wanted to show her I was still interested, which I guess worked. This was 2 months ago. 

We hadn’t talked since, and I feel like she felt bad about something between us, whether it was how rudely she rejected me or maybe she felt like she’s missing out, because I’ve seen her a whole lot less, but when she does walk by I notice her look at me with this sad look on her face. This went on for 2 months. 

Well, just two days ago we finally walk by each other and there was a ton of tension. At first I tried to avoid her, but either she noticed &amp; decided to get into my path or was trying to avoid me as well, because my evasive maneuver didn’t work and she was right there in front of me. We both walk slowly past each other and I’m staring at her while she’s looking in my direction (but not looking at me) with these extremely sad look on her face. Not long after, I’m sitting in the Optical center and notice her start to walk by, but she hesitates and turned back the other way. Then she does this again a couple minutes later. Then boom, she’s walking back and forth in front of the Optical more than she has in 2 months, but I noticed her making a conscious effort not to look at me. The fact her pattern of behavior changed just moments after we walked by each other, tells me she noticed &amp; decided something in regards to me, now I’m just trying to figure out if that something is good or bad. 

I want to approach her. I want YOUR opinion on what you’ve read about this situation.

The last couple of years have been relatively tough for our marriage, we have been constantly getting into arguments over seemingly silly things that can be easily avoided. It has now come to a point where even when we are not fighting or angry at each other we don’t seem to be coming to a common ground on anything.

I love my wife and want to make things better but right now anything either of us does just seems to boil the blood of the other person. This is taking a toll on all aspects of our life’s including parenting.

We have never had any major issues in our marital life, even the issues over the last couple of years started because of lack of intimacy and both of us working from home and spending 24x7 together.

I cannot pin point to anything that could have caused us both to become such bitter people, I hold myself accountable for the things I have done wrong but she is not willing to take ownership of her side of the problems. Whenever I try to discuss this all she has to say is that I have changed but does not elaborate.

I am really tired and exhausted with how my life is going on, I still love her as much as I did when I fell for her. Just clueless what I need to do.

We are a Indian couple living in USA, we do not discuss any of our issues openly either with friends or family.
