We’d had an issue recently where he’d done that but had gone all the way through to penetration, and lately we’ve had some tough conversations about how that crossed a boundary; I reiterated before we went to sleep that it’s ok for him to wake me up for sex, but the method shouldn’t be via penetration as step 1.

So he woke me up at 3 am for sex. I was down. After about 10 minutes of foreplay, he patted me on the head and went quiet and said “love you” and settled down like he was going to go back to sleep. I asked if he was going to go to sleep and he said yes. I’m frustrated with him. You never owe anyone sex, but I wish he hadn’t woken me up and then not followed through for several reasons:
1. He knew I had to get up early that morning (around 7).
2. He didn’t seem to care that he’d interrupted my sleep and gotten me sexually frustrated just to go to sleep (and not clearly tell me he was going to sleep and not continuing sex until I asked) 
3. This was our first encounter of this kind after the last one which had left me feeling kind of violated, so it was important to me that this was a positive experience.

Our sex life is really dysfunctional generally, and it’s the only real issue in our relationship. I’m worried this also says something about his sex drive—maybe I’m being unrealistic, but we’re so young… if he was really that into me, and I was clearly down to have sex with him, wouldn’t he have followed through? He doesn’t work any manual labor job or have to stay up late for work (I.e. no reason why he’s especially tired). 

He rarely initiates and he doesn’t masturbate but maintains that he’s definitely NOT asexual. I’ve asked about his libido and he claims it’s “medium to high.”  He says he’s just too “nervous” that he’ll be “bad at sex” so he rarely tries to touch me, and when he does, he’s so hyper fixated on “doing it right” that he completely forgets to touch me how I ask or instruct him to. He’s started losing his boners before sex. We’ve been together 7 years and he’s never given me an orgasm.

He maintains he was just “sleepy” and he “feels bad” that he “wasted my sleep” but this says nothing about how interested he is in me. I can’t help but feel like he’s just not that into me—and not to be conceited, but I am conventionally attractive, and I’m meticulous about hygiene, so I don’t think it’s that. 

I just feel like I get a lot of mixed signals. I just feel sad because I love him and I feel like this is driving a wedge between us.

The point is that he was behaving really childish- the one situation was that he didn't want to get some documents I needed (regarding my mother's health- he studies at a medical university) from a place he literally goes everyday, he was making such a bullshit excuses. The other thing is that I planned my upcoming birthday and I needed him to drive himself and his friends to the location because I will drive my other friends and there's no space. He said that he didn't want to drive he wanted to get drunk there (mind you we are staying the whole night at a villa and we are leaving the next midday there's enough time to sober up if you dri k carefully). Not only he didn't he said they can't come because there's noone to drive them there. And I just lost it because it's not true at all and he just can't be responsible and do this for me.
 That was a month ago. I thought we talked it out he said he'd change his behavior and be less childish. But to get him take this seriously I was at the edge of breaking up with him cause I didn't want to put up with this shit. So there were lots of upa and downs that month. Tbh I can't break up with him I love him very much and I can't imagine my life without him. But I threatened him that I will do it if he doesn't change. 
The other issue we have is that we don't spend a lot of time together- just in the weekends cause I work full time and I live outside the city which really is hard but I get excited when he messages me or when the weekends are xoming up because I know I'll get to see him.
Fast forward to last Sunday. He came to my house with his car (we were at most of the time in the car) and you know this female intuition. I had it for a while but when i saw him that day I could feel that he was distanced. He kissed me after I asked him and it was just light smack on the lips. He seemed alittle annoyed that I wanted to hug him. And he didn't say ""I love you"". He said that the past weeks since our arguments he has been thinking and he has been confused and he didn't know what he was feeling. I felt that I was about to cry and I went home where I cried peacefully. Then we texted and he said that my intuition was right that he really was cold and distant lately. He said that the arguments and the fact that we see each other not quite often made his feeling for me lower. When I asked if he loved me he said that he was attached to me. He tried every way to run away from the word ""love"". He said that when we are rogether this thoughts and confusion about his feelings are gone and that he knows that when he's with me he's feeling good and he has feelings for me (still didn't say love mind you we are a year and a half together and he did say it often before). I felt really hurt by this who wouldn't tho its not nice to hear that your bf is losing feelings for you and he's not sure that he loves you. I just can't let him go.

Sorry, posting from a throwaway account. 

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 8 months and are both college students in our senior year. When we met (during our junior year), we both had a fair bit going on. I am studying engineering, as well as working \~20 hours a week + extracurriculars. She is studying education, and last semester was doing classroom shadowing, working \~20 hours a week + classes. With these schedules, we still went on dates 2-3 times a week and often spent the night at each other's places.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now and nothing about my workload has changed.  However, she is now no longer working, as her parents (who are paying for her school) told her not to as it was a detriment to her academic work. She also is no longer shadowing classrooms (it's only a 1-semester thing). None of these changes are her fault, but it's been hard for me to deal with her newfound time. She usually calls me once an hour if she knows I am not in class or at work, and would hang out all day every day if it were up to her.

&amp;#x200B;

What she chooses to do with her time is her choice, and I know she isn't doing anything truly wrong. Despite this, I find myself wishing she would spend more time doing more ""productive"" things instead of spending her days in bed scrolling through social media (very ironic for me who is writing this on Reddit). I really love her, but I have really been struggling with this aspect of our relationship since it started. We still go out just as much (2-3 times a week), but now it feels like she wants me to fill the gaps in her time. I know it is coming from a good place, but I am starting to find it really unattractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure of how to approach this. As I said, she isn't doing anything wrong, and I can't just say ""Hey I think you should get some hobbies lol,"" but at the same time, I really wish she would.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7558401,public,self,My (21M) girlfriend (21F) is significantly less busy than me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywb27n/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_is_significantly_less_busy/,all_ads,6,,,

Im looking for a long-term thing.

TLDR: I think Im starting to catch feelings for this friend of mine(F) but she sees me as just a friend. Not sure on what to do.

It was the 1st day of high school back in 2017, I, 15 at the time, was an antisocial nerd who wasnt comfortable meeting new people. But I vividly remember seeing this girl the first day. She was a bit late getting into the classroom but when I saw her, wow, I thought holy shit shes gorgeous. But of course me being me, the scrawny nerd I thought I dont have a chance nor will I ever have a chance with her.

Just for some context, I had a crush during my last year of elementary school. I asked the girl if she wanted to be in a relationship with me and she said she sees me as a friend and she couldnt see me the same way I saw her at the time. Because I was shot down like a Nazi fighter I said to myself, Im just not gonna try anymore cuz whats the point of even trying if Im just gonna fail. That was my thought process at the time.

Maybe because of that I never actually tried to get a girl, the thought of being with a girl comes up in my mind sometimes but I just dismiss it probably because that became a habit in the last 5 years.

So during high school I didnt go around and socialize, I had a close group of friends and that was it. I had like a, I dont know how to say it, the relations with my classmates were mostly like they were my colleagues at work if that makes sense, we were primarily colleagues then friends I would say.

That being said my relationship with this girl was something like this, we were classmates all thru high school and thats it. Then college comes around, I had to move from home in order to go to this college. Currently living with a roommate whos also a friend from high school. And guess who also goes to college here. Yeah, havent seen her in a year and now we are seeing each other most days. She often comes to our place to hang out, watch movies, we make dinner sometimes, drink and so on. She often spends the night on the couch in the living room and she sees us as friends.

Shes bomb, objecitvely speaking an 8.5/10 and Id say im maybe like a 5/10 at best. When i told this to my friends they said the whole ""out of someones league"" thing isnt a thing. I would love to believe them but I just cant seem to do so. Shes really the only girl I can have a deep conversation with. But I just know for a fact that nothings gonna happen between us because she treats me as just a friend. Shes nice, funny, really good looking, smart, a bit whacky and just a nice person to hang around with in general. Just think about all the ways a girl might friendzone a guy...Yea I think most of those boxes can be ticked in my situation.

From a rational point of view I dont want to catch feelings for her because Im most definitely going to get rejected but its hard to think rationally when emotions start flowing.

Been typing this for ages gonna end it off here. Looking for advice. What is the best thing to do in this situation?

To be clear, I love him and KNOW he is a great person. I am still attracted to his appearance.

These feelings are dragging me down because I feel so nasty. I feel like a real horrid bitch for feeling this way. And I don’t know what’s changed.

Hello, so I’m here with a not so serious concern/ post, but it’s something that bothered me. For context its my birthday soon

My boyfriend asked me if I like surprises, which I do UNLESS it’s a surprise birthday party cause I like to be prepared. That’s what I said. But I’m also really curious, so my boyfriend has been teasing me. During a call he told me he spent a lot of money today and didn’t want to tell me on what or how much, so I said “ohh is it my gift”? He also asked me to guess what he is looking at. After not guessing correctly he said nvm it’s for the best, and that he wont tell me with good intent. I got annoyed cause he kept going at it and not telling me, so I hung up and later texted him asking why he does that even tho he knows I hate it, and that he probably meant my gift.

So he told me I’m weird cause I say I like surprises but at the same time wanna be spoiled. He then brought up last Christmas when I ended up telling whim his gift. He said I need to learn to handle surprises cause I’m not making sense. And proceeded to say “I haven’t bought you anything yet but If you wanna know I’m gonna buy u a ring”. 

So now I’m sad cause I firstly was annoyed of the non stop teasing, and now he ruined the surprise. So I told him that he was lame for that. He said that he doesn’t understand why I kept asking “is it my gift” cause supposedly I was ruining all the fun and the feeling of him having surprised me. And that he played my own game.

So now he said “sorry it turned out like this but it is what it is”. I told him I felt he wronged me which he said “same”. He said he maybe dragged the joke for too long but that he got tired of my annoyed reaction.

I don’t know what to do now.

I was hoping to vent some of my frustrations and see if anyone out there has experienced a similar situation. My current partner (26M) and I (24F) have been together a little over 5 years (our anniversary was in June), we met through mutual friends while at university. He’s incredibly kind, gentle and compassionate and we have a very loving relationship. We went through some tension when he decided to take a job and move back home at the beginning of the pandemic (I wasn’t happy about doing LDR, but it I knew this would be good for his career). We were apart for about 2 years until he moved back to be with me (I had started graduate school in the meantime). Marriage and family is extremely important to both of us (we come from somewhat religious homes and backgrounds). We’ve discussed marriage quite extensively and he’s told me many times how much he is looking forward to a life together (family, children etc). I’d brought an engagement up at our 3 year anniversary (before he moved for a job) as I wanted to know whether or not we were going to be committed to one another moving forward – at the time he told me he hadn’t thought about it happening so soon and of course wanted to get married but not for some time. I was a little anxious and disappointed but I accepted that he wasn’t ready and respected he needed more time. We did long distance for 2 years and he managed to move back to where I was living in September. We would see each other once every few months and a part of me hoped he would take the opportunity to ask me formally but he always told me he didn’t have enough time to plan it and wanted it to be planned well.

I’ve told him that I would want to get engaged by our 5 year anniversary because at that point it felt like we’d surpassed the dating stage and didn’t have anywhere else to grow in that area. It was also very important to me to not stay in the dating stage more than was necessary as I believe in the sanctity of marriage (and he’s also told me a few times that he also is excited to finally be engaged). Since moving to be in the same city as me, he’s pushed a lot for us to move in together (we’ve quasi lived together at this point, so we know each other’s habits and how to co-habit peacefully and respectfully) I’ve told him I wouldn’t be comfortable moving in together formally until we were married. (I want my married life to look somewhat different than our dating life). He flew to see me for our 5 year anniversary and I expected a proposal (all our families were there and met for the first time), and he got too nervous and didn’t go through with it. I was really disappointed but understood because he was stressed at the time (stressful time at work and he said he wanted to see how our families interacted before actually proposing and they only met the night before he was flying home). He said he didn’t want to propose and then have to fly and leave me, which I didn’t really understand as he was planning on joining me soon anyways. I told him it was really important to me that and that I didn’t feel comfortable just dating (in my eyes you date to determine compatibility and then try to move towards marriage). Fast forward to September, he starts a new job in my city and takes me ring shopping (he seems involved and excited). It was an amazing moment for us and I was over the moon. I have told him many times that I don’t particularly care for a ring that’s expensive or anything (he is a bit tight for money since he just moved here and had a lot of upfront costs). What matters to me is the intention behind the committment and I’ve told him I’d be happy if he asked me without one if that’s what’s holding things back. He’s told me he respects that I don’t want to live together until we’re married but has somewhat tried to convince me to move in earlier. We spend a lot of time in each other’s homes and essentially do “informally” live together – largely out of convenience (which is what I was trying to avoid but I’m also doing this out of my own volition so I have myself to blame). He keeps promising me that the proposal will come soon. We have a little trip planned for this weekend (we’re going back to the city we first met and fell in love) and his family is also flying in to see us. A part of me expected it he would ask me then (it’s this weekend).

I’ve tried to gather whether it’ll happen this weekend (to plan outfits LOL) and he’s told me very blatantly that it won’t be happening this weekend ( again he says he hasn’t been able to plan it for this weekend) 

I’m pretty pissed off, not because it isn’t happening right now, but because he’s promised me that it would be coming soon and I’ve been hearing this since before June this year. He knows how important it is for me to be formally married under law (and God) and says he cares for that too – but I don’t understand why he is stringing me along like this. I was so excited when he took me ring shopping 2 months ago but don’t know how to feel. My excitement going into this weekend has dwindled, and I’m not looking forward to a 10 hour round trip drive. A part of me regrets not breaking up with him after our 5 year anniversary when I told him very explicitly that if he wanted to continue this we needed to make it official.

tldr: My boyfriend keeps telling me he's going to propose ""soon"" but doesn't seem to make any headway / use nice opportunities for it (we spent our 5 year anniversary in Paris and it was hard to not dream of how romantic that would have been).

I've recently passed my driving test. I have not done a lot of hours, passed with luck I guess. I've never driven my bf's car before - only on parking which was not pleasant at all. But I thought, if I pass my driving, he would believe in me more and try to be less hard on me. 

Since I've passed, we've been going on a quick rides around the village or to the shops that are just behind the corner. Which is fine, because me alone do not feel like driving in the city yet (as it is busier than the city I was having driving test in). But anyway, the drives make me so anxious and stressed like nothing else. 

I worry a lot about not breaking his car or hitting something/someone. But I feel like I started 'feeling' the car better, so I think I am gaining more confidence. Which would be awesome, if not the fact that my boyfriend is making me so anxious behind the wheel. I got yelled at to look out for curbs - even tho I am far away from them - I got yelled at by being in 1st gear instead of 2nd right after pulling out of the corner. I am being yelled at whenever I do something that is not perfect for him. 

He has a lot of experience and I have very little - especially with his car. He seems like he understands but also does not. I am trying to tell him that he makes me stressed, which makes me drive worse. He says he will try not to overact as much but then it happens again! 

Today I stalled at the traffic lights but I managed to correct that just in time - well not good enough for him as he got so nervous, got me a silent treatment and I saw so much disappointment on his face. I slowed down on a bent (that he usually drives on normal speed) - and I have been questioned why I even did that - because visibility was reduced. And good I slowed down as there was a fox running just behind the corner. He said sorry, but still - was questioning my careful driving. 

I do not know what to do anymore. I need to drive as we will be moving away and I have to have a transport without being dependent on him. But I feel like this is an issue - which I am not sure is because of me or him or us both. 

I don't really know how to talk, what to do with him as nothing helps. 

Please, I would appreciate some advice on it on how to fix things.

We only make $20k per year and usually advise incoming students to take out loans if they want a certain standard of living, especially if they're not used to being poor. One of the other students in my lab, Brent, has been here for a couple of years and has decided not to do that.

Some background on the dynamic of our relationship: I noticed when Brent started here, that whenever I would try to share about my life or background in conversation, his immediate response would be to make the conversation about him. We are typically pretty open with each other about our lives and childhoods in my lab, since we work together very collaboratively for many years (and sometimes for decades after grad school). But, I figured that meant he wasn't interested so I stopped discussing these things and instead listened and responded when he talked about his life. I learned that he grew up in a house with a handful of siblings in an expensive part of the country.

Here is the thing I want advice on: Whenever I mention anything about money, something I bought (even a small treat at the grocery store), or something I'm planning on doing (not involving him, e.g., my weekend plans), his immediate response is to mention in some way how he can't afford that or that he is too poor to do the thing I am talking about (which had nothing to do with him).  It irritates me, because it comes off as judging my financial decisions or judging me as spoiled (I don't do or buy anything extravagant), and it makes the conversation awkward, pretty much ending the discussion right there just as any discussion about me ends up being about him.

I recognize that I might find this more irritating than other people might, because based on what I know about his upbringing and his current behavior, he is not what I would consider poor. He has a middle/upper middle class family that will be a safety net for him (e.g., they gave him the car he drives, they fly him out to visit them for holidays). He also seems sheltered in a way poor people are not, for example he doesn't have some basic life skills like jumping a battery, changing a tire, and is overwhelmed by grocery shopping. 

I find it especially awkward when he does this, because if he had cared to learn anything about me he would know that I grew up very poor (and in an abusive household). For example, I didn't always know if I would be able to eat, have no familial safety net, and I've been homeless a few times before I was an adult. It makes me very uncomfortable when the first thing he says about a story I'm telling him is how poor that makes him feel. I figured he is just not used to living like a grad student, and/or specifically had a problem with me because he doesn't know much about me except that I live with my boyfriend in a house and that I don't complain about money (because I've been poor my whole life and this is nothing new or notable to me).

Since I thought it was an issue he had with me specifically, I decided to never bring it up and to try to avoid talking about my plans or recent things I've done/bought. But the other day, he did the same thing to our newest lab member. We were talking about our Thanksgiving plans, and she mentioned she was going home to see her family. Instead of saying how nice that is or anything normal, Brent immediately said, ""I wish I could afford to ever see my family"". It was palpably awkward and the other student and I kind of just turned around to our desks and got back to work. Conversation over. 

Should I ask him to stop doing this? I can't tell if it's my own background (I am proud of overcoming poverty and abuse to get a PhD and do cool stuff) that I might be too bothered by this.

First off, I'm aware this sounds awful and I sound like a pos but please hear me out. I(M23) have been dating my girlfriend(F23) for 2 years and it has been good for the most part, we've had ups and down like any relationship but around the 1-year and 6 months mark we had a massive fight about one of her best friends (M23). They dated in the past but broke it off, anyway she spent the night at his place which I wasn't aware was going to happen, she later told me they slept in the same bed. Obviously, I was upset, because I would never do the same thing, and this caused a fight that almost culminated in a break-up. (To give some context gf suffers from anxiety and BPD). She swore nothing happened between them that night and that I was the only one she loves since she doesn't feel anything for him anymore but I just couldn't believe it. She then called me saying that it was a mistake and that if she didn't have me, there was no point in living anymore since  I was everything to her. I became extremely worried she would do something extreme so I forgave her and tried to forget about the whole incident by rationalizing that she wouldn't lie to me. 

Everything returned to normal for a while but ever since small issues that shouldn't be a big deal turn into fights and arguments are now the norm when they used to be incredibly rare. She gets easily upset at me when I try to talk about our issues and reverts to saying that she would rather die than keep having fights. I have recently also realized that she has lied to me about multiple things in our relationship which has made me doubt about her telling me the truth about what happened that night with her ex.

I have known my friend(F23) for about 3 years but we became closer after I asked her for her point of view. I have always only seen her in a platonic way but recently I have found comfort in her words and advice. She treats me with extreme kindness and consideration, she is always giving me advice and looking out for me saying that I'm a kind person which at this point I was starting to doubt. She is always there for me when I'm feeling down and I can spend hours talking to her but it feels like minutes. I feel guilty and like a hypocrite, because I am starting to develop feelings for her. I'm honestly completely lost and I don't know what to do next. Should I distance myself from her? Any advice?

I walked over to the teachers' desk and asked her if I can go to the toilet, but she declined because you're not allowed to leave the room during the test.

I sat back down, trying to think of some happy thoughts until class was over. However a couple minutes later I felt a large stabbing pain in my abdomen and before I knew it, I had crapped in my pants. A stench rose around my seat as diarrhea spilled out of my anus. I felt the warm, wet diarrhea fill my underwear and it began dripping down my legs into my socks. My legs felt very slippery and lubricated to the point where my shorts were sliding down my legs. My underwear was so overwhelmed with the weight of the diarrhea that it dropped into my chair. I could see that something was off amongst the people next to me however still planned to leave the room discreetly as shitting my pants in front of the class are genuinely my worst nightmare. 

I stood up and took my underwear, shorts and shoes off and tried to make it to the door. As I stood up, I let out a HUGE, deafening fart and poop came rocketing out of my butt. Everyone in the class had heard and turned to look at me and I could see the disgust in their face. I stood at my desk for a further couple of minutes shitting myself. Everyone began salvaging their belongings and moved to the very back of the classroom with their shirts over their noses.

I let out another huge fart and more poop spilled out. Chunks of poop spattered the desks behind me and covered a girl's knapsack and binder. Chunks of beans and chicken floated around in the massive puddle of brown diarrhea.

I felt a massive hot flash and my shirt was soaked from sweat so I took it off. I was bare naked by this point. I tried running over to the door and tripped on the floor as more diarrhea spilled out of my butt. My entire bottom half of my body was brown from the poop. I then left a muddy trail as I stumbled all the way to the door, still pooping myself. By this time, the teacher had called the nurse to come and get me and told her that I was naked/having diarrhea and everyone could hear. 

I tried opening the door but I had no strength left so I collapsed to the floor. As my body slid down the door, a huge pain feeling occurred in my stomach. I then let out huge farts and more diarrhea came rocketing out of my body, which went all over the place and partially covered the front desk. Explosive diarrhea came out of my butt like fireworks, all over the desks and walls. Green chunks exploded out of my butt, then yellow, then brown, then green again and so on.

Nobody could evacuate the class because the floor in front of the door was covered in my diarrhea. I heard everybody laughing at me and I started crying in front of everybody. Even the teacher was laughing at me, but luckily stopped when she saw me crying and told the class that I was sick and should stop. The nurse came up and opened the door for me and helped me off the floor. As she helped me up, more diarrhea came out. It was all watery and multicoloured, and the nurse looked visibly disgusted. Other classes (my age group) nearby had heard the racket so they opened up their doors, gandered at what was happening, also saw me naked and blurted it out loud so other people could hear. 

Luckily the nurse helped clean me up and gave me some new clothes (my mum picked me up) but practically my whole year saw me like that. What do I do? I am dying with embarrassment and have been crying all day. The nurse said that this will impact me and people will be laughing for months, and considering my class is majority popular girls I won't be able to get a girlfriend.

I would appreciate some advice on going low contact with my brother and sister in law this holiday season 

I won’t get into a ton of detail, but basically I feel like my brother and sister In Law don’t really like me anymore. Another possibility is that they are both struggling with depression, which is as far as I know is undiagnosed and untreated. 

My brother and sister in law have been together for about 8 years, since I was in my early twenties. I used to love hanging out with them. I would have long talks about life with my SIL, we would go out drinking and dancing, and overall I truly enjoyed spending time with them.

In the past few years this has changed, and I find my SIL to be pretty toxic. If she’s unhappy, she will ignore my brother and everyone for literally hours. It’s incredibly awkward. I’ve seen her ice my brother out for an entire day because he reminded her which sponge to use in the kitchen. 

I survived a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, and the way she treats him triggers me. I’ve tried to discuss this with my parents and sister, and the general consensus is “we can’t do anything about it, we have to accept her because she’s Brother’s wife”

For me this situation has escalated to the point that I don’t even want to be around them. Last thanksgiving, my now Husband and I spent the evening with my immediate family. My brother and SIL barely spoke to me the entire night. They basically said hi, and then spent the rest of the evening talking to other people (there were only 7 of us at the table). I tried to join their conversations several times and was ignored. It was terrible and really upsetting. When i brought this up to my mom she listed like 5 different reasons of why it was MY fault that they ignored me. I communicated to my brother that I was upset and he said it was unintentional and that was it.

A month ago I got married. It was a tiny, immediate family only wedding with only 17 guests. Again, my brother and SIL barely talked to me. The night before my wedding I dropped something off at my parents and my brother and SIL’s reaction was pretty much “what are you doing here?” No excitement to see me, no “hey you’re getting married tomorrow!” Pretty much nothing. I felt awkward and left. At the wedding neither of them really took time to even have a conversation with me. It was a huge bummer. 

I just feel like I don’t matter anymore. My SIL didn’t even text me happy birthday (they used to get me a card and gift). As far as I know I haven’t done anything to offend them, and I can’t talk to my parents about this because they just get upset 

I know that the next step is to talk to my brother about it, but I just don’t have the emotional energy for that right now. I also don’t think it would be productive.

They are both coming to my parents house (30 mins from me) on Friday after thanksgiving, and my mom wants me to come with my husband. I don’t want to, and I don’t think I will. I work 6 days a week, and I’m exhausted. Plus I would rather hang out with my husbands family (my NEW family) where I am wanted and acknowledged and appreciated. 

So, to my question- (sorry for the long post). Do I communicate this to my family? Or do I just make an excuse and say I can’t make it Friday for the hangout? Do you think it would do any good to tell them all of this? My mom can be a little manipulative about these things and doesn’t seem to understand or believe me (even though she has 4 big brothers of her own). If you were me how would you proceed?

She actually told me that she had a crush on me after a few weeks of talking. She was my first kiss, first date, even lost my virginity to her. I had actually invited her on a vacation with me and my family before she said she had a crush on me. Vacation was great, closest we had ever been. After getting back from the trip, she stopped hardly looking at me and we stopped talking (well she stopped) then she told me she really needed to take time and be single because she just gotten out of a relationship.

I'm \* genuinely \* typing all of this with a tear in my eye. I'll do my best to try to keep it as short as I can though it's gonna be a little difficult:

I'm a 20 year old guy, I grew up without a family. Mum died of cancer in 2008, my father has always been too tough, borderline abusive and very barbaric, he has always supported me financially, but he just has never seemed to care. All my relatives live in other cities (or even countries), they treat me like a stranger, they don't even call me on my birthday. I feel a little lonely, I have friends/acquaintances my age, but they're just people I occasionally have fun with. Very shallow relationships. I feel a little lonely because there's nobody out there who actually loves me unless I do something. Like, my friends hang out with me because I'm cool to be around, but still, this is still an effort. I won't just look out the window and think ''there are people out there who care about me''

I met this woman a few months ago(I know her in real life). I'm not trying to magnify her, but she's so attractive she could model, she's a legit 8. Just to make you picture her, I'd say she *sorta* looks like Taylor Swift. And she's taller than me, an inch taller, she's 5'11. I did find her super attractive when I saw her, she looks a little intimidating but once you talk to her you realize she won't bite so I just asked her out.. she turned me down, but we've stayed friends. I'm happy to have a platonic relationship with her, but the fact she's very pleasant to look at is still.. nice. But I genuinely don't want to cross the boundaries and ruin everything.

I gradually opened up to her and I explained the story of my life, she showed a lot of compassion. She probably thought I needed attention, so she started with small gestures. For example.. just a little memory that stuck with me, she once said ''text me when you get back home safe'' and it was enough to make me emotional because these are the little things I grew up without and I smiled all the way home because of that simple thing she said. 

We've basically become friends. I like the way she treats me, it's a little difficult to explain in a few words/paragraphs, but basically, she treats me like I'm her little brother and she gives me attention without asking for anything in return. She always says ''if you want some advice, someone to talk to, or even just a hug, text me. I'm always glad to talk to you'', and she keeps calling me ''puppy''. It seems like she thinks about me even when we're not texting each other or spending time together. It was my birthday a few days ago, she didn't forget to wish me happy birthday, she even said ''I couldn't do it this time, but I've come up with a good idea for Christmas. I'll get you something really nice, I'm sure you'll love it'', it was very cute. I try not to be a burden, I usually text her a couple of times per week, and unless she's busy, she replies quickly. Sometimes we talk for hours, so she clearly likes me as a friend.

I like having her in my life and her presence has had a very positive effect on my mental health. Like I said before, I have a few friends my age, but they're all shallow relationships. Nobody really cares about me and even if they

 Now that I have her in my life, I kind of feel.. unconditionally loved.. by someone older who takes care of me and makes me feel reassured. Like, she just gives me the feeling that I can totally trust her because she cares. I'd had never experienced this before and I'm genuinely typing this with a tear in my eye, it's very beautiful.

I'd honestly really like to tell her how I feel about her. I realize she's not my mom and that she's just a stranger who's being a very good human and kind to me, but still, I'd like to tell her that she's like a mother figure to me.

I am using mobile, also I apologize if this isn’t allowed, please remove if necessary. So here’s the Tea! 

So this isn’t a complaint against MY MIL, I was very blessed with a normal and loving one, but it does involve her and my BIL’s MIL. So my BIL(DH’s brother) and SIL got married this year, and I have met his MIL (who I will refer to as Beatrice) twice.    

When I first met her, my husband and I got her a small thank you gift for hosting us in her city during one of the events for the wedding, just some nicely wrapped tea from the city we are from. She opened it and just said “oh that’s…nice” and quickly put it away, without a thank you. Now before I bought it, I asked my BIL if she liked tea and what he thought of the gift. He said he thinks she would love it and thought it was a very nice gesture. So I was rubbed the wrong way with her reaction, but dropped it as I’ve never met this woman before. My DH also commented to me later that he felt it was really strange and kind of a rude response. 

The second time we met was at the actual wedding. I went to tell her congratulations and commented that her MOB dress was beautiful to really just be nice. Still, she completely ignored me and brushed me off to wander off to someone else. At this point I was over her, and had it set in my head that this woman is just incredibly rude. She also kept referring to my husband as “family” but not me. Not that I care, it was just so absolutely ridiculous and inappropriate. 

I should also add that my husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and married for 2. I’m significantly younger than my SIL and BIL. A comment was made by Beatrice that I must’ve not had many boyfriends because I’ve been with DH for so long, which is frankly just a weird comment to make. I told her that her assumption isn’t necessarily true but also very odd. 

Fast forward to Christmas- which will be at my MIL’s house. It’s the first time in years that she’s hosted it and had both of her children home for the holidays. My DH and I take turns with our families during the holidays- last year we did Christmas with mine, and thanksgiving with his; this year we are doing it vice versa. BIL is doing thanksgiving with Beatrice and their family, and was planning to do Christmas with his parents and us. 
    
Well my MIL came to visit us recently, and after a few glasses of wine, told us that Beatrice is ALSO planning to come for Christmas at MIL’s home and is staying there for a week! MIL was absolutely furious because she now has to share this time with her son with Beatrice, who is already spending 3 weeks with BIL &amp; SIL for Thanksgiving. It should also be noted that Beatrice was not invited by MIL- an invitation was given to come visit at the Wedding, but she never said to come over Christmas! She was very frustrated at the imposition, and also commented that the lack of social manners was strongly felt. 

 I also came to find out that I will have to buy yet another gift for Beatrice, who I thought I’d never have to interact with again, just for her to yet again not tell me Thank you. It will be a VERY interesting holiday season, and I’m not sure how to entirely handle this scenario.

Where as my partner is very emotional and quick to use snap judgements. Her motivation and drive are also significantly lower than mine. This is something that concerns me. 

Neither of us are perfect. We’ve both had bouts of depression and anxiety and so on and so forth. We’ve had failures and success. The only real difference between us is how we handle these things and move on. I tend to examine what happened, fix it, and move on. Where she tends to fixate and repeat. We have had numerous conversations about these things and our goals and expectations of each other. We’ve made strides to better ourselves and yet there is still this hang up. 

I am looking for excitement and challenges and experience; yet I feel based on observations that my partner is content with routine and leisure. In so many ways we are similar with life experience; but our perspectives and ability to deal with things are so very different. This leaves me confused as to whether we should keep pushing through with our relationship, or if I am forcing something that doesn’t fit.

She's married and I'm single, so there wasn't any sexual tension between us because hitting on a married woman goes deeply against my morals, that's why it is purely platonic.


I started working at our company in marketing after graduating from college, so this is my first workplace. She followed the same path a year later, so I kind of mentored her from the start, helped her with everything and taught her a lot of stuffs. None of us had a car so we took the bus instead, usually at the same time, that's how we started to talk more and more, and eventually became friends. Later down the road we ate lunch together most of the time, took coffee breaks pretty often, and around the end we even had outside of work programs. Don't think about anything special, we went running a few times, had other sport activities and grabbed Subways a few times. Other than that we didn't talk much outside of work, just sent a bunch of memes every day. She even invited me to her wedding, and I was the only one there from our workplace so I don't think that I'm overthinking this.


Let me talk about the dynamics for a bit. I'm a really introverted person, while she's the exact opposite, an extroverted talkative girl. Most of the coworkers likes her, while I'm usually just doing my job quietly. I think that's why this whole thing worked. She told me she likes me a lot because I always have a calming presence, and as an introverted guy I love if someone actually likes my company. She told me about deeply personal stuffs, so she earned my trust and I also talked about personal things, because I knew she was interested in what I was saying. There's a huge difference between listening to someone, or actually hearing what he / she tells. I could ramble about stories for hours, but it's not essential now. Let me jump to the problem.


A few months ago, one morning she started crying and told me they're going to get divorced. My stomach clenched. I knew a lot of things are going to change. Til this point I felt safe because our dynamics were simple, she's taken, and that's it. But what now? If I keep being close I may look like an intruder, like someone with bad intentions, and that would poison the whole thing. Anyways, she became really distant with everyone, even with me, we barely talked during the bus rides, listened to music instead. I wanted to be there for her without giving weird signs, so honestly it was a rough period. She even asked me if she would live at my place for a few days til she finds an apartment for herself, of course I agreed. Eventually she became more chatty with other co-workers again, but our friendship is not the same since this whole thing. We don't eat lunch or drink coffee together anymore, we don't meet, talk or send memes outside of work, and barely talk at work. This whole thing is weird, and it hurts losing a good friend like this, because as an introvert there aren't many peoples I trust and I can talk with seamlessly like with her.


Recently I bought a car. I promised her a long time ago if I'll do it, I'll happily take her to work since we live a few minutes away from each other (the bus takes roughly 3x more time so honestly it sucks). First I thought I'll wait if she'll ask me if she could come with me, because that would be a sign that we are okay, but I offered her to bring her on the first day, so the plan is ruined. Good job, Nick. At first it was weird, because being locked in a car forces us to talk, and we didn't talk for 2-3 months. But since then, things are seemingly going back to ""normal"", slowly. And here are we now.


This became much longer than I wanted it to be. Summed up, my question simply is, what now? The dynamics are clearly shaken up, and we have to reestablish new ones. I don't know what would be better, trying to return back to where we were before this whole stuff, or accepting the fact that it's in the past.

What happens is we’ll usually be having a discussion about something, and he’ll suddenly change his tone and start speaking to me in a way that has this angry edge to it which I’m super sensitive to. When I ask why he’s speaking like that to me it’s nearly always because I apparently ‘questioned’ him in our discussion and he doesn’t like it (i.e. he wants me to always accept everything he says). 


I’ll give an example of what happened just now. We were looking for a sweatshirt of his that we couldn’t find. As we were trying to figure out where it was, I suddenly remembered I last saw it the day we went on a specific walk with our friend. He said ‘no it can’t be then, I wasn’t wearing it that day’. I said he wasn’t wearing it but it was definitely in my car as I remember seeing it on the back seat. We establish that’s correct. He then says to me ‘it’ll be in my car then’. So I replied ‘no we didn’t take your car that day, we took mine’. He then says (in his angry tone) ‘it’s in my car, I moved everything in the back seat of your car to mine as I had a load of my stuff in there’. 


Then he continued to talk in an obviously annoyed tone, and when I asked why he told me it’s because I questioned him and didn’t just immediately accept that the sweatshirt was in his car instead. 


I feel like this is a bit ridiculous - I wasn’t deliberately defying him, it was just a part of what I believe to be a normal conversation. In fact, he had only just ‘questioned’ me beforehand by saying I didn’t last see the sweatshirt on that specific day. I pointed this out to him and he just walked away and refused to engage further with the discussion. 


Reddit, how do I approach this subject in future/prevent this from causing arguments? I hate when he gets that tone, it really affects me, but at the same time I feel like it’s his ego causing it and the way he reasons with me makes it sound like he wants me to just bow down to him like he’s some kind of god and never question a thing he ever says!

I see him as in ""father energy"". I'm extremely grateful to him but we are not cozy or in a loose communication relationship. With this said, I need advice.

My boss is a type A personality. He's a very hard worker. Employees respect him bordering on fear, however, he's not abusive or the type to humiliate.
We have a strong partnership with a company led by a woman, Leyla ( f49). She's strong-willed and shrewd. We work with her company when we can't reach a certain amount of leverage with third part companies. This is a lot to say, since our company is rather large and my boss has consirable power and leverage. Their company equally reaches out to us for back up.

Miss Leyla is very well respected and very professional but I would say she's a bit shy. She does use her authority but she's kind of an introvert. 
Last Friday, we stayed until late at the office. We are closing an important business deal so I was asked to help finish the last details. Plus, the overtime is more than welcome. 

We had our zoom calls, I worked on all the drafts and statements, and said my goodbyes. I stayed for a while trying to organize my schedule and to regroup to have  the energy to go home.

I overheard an argument coming from my boss' office. I heard the word "" pendejo"" (Spanish curse word""). The rest was in English. My boss said  "" cabrona"" only to correspond but I'm sure he's not bilingual. I was shocked and didn't know if to make my presence known until he said ""baby"". 

So in other words, he and Miss Leyla were having a lovers quarrel because he wanted something from her and he wasn't receiving it. I guarantee you no one in this world would get away with disrespecting my boss. Never, I'm my life, could I imagine that my boss would act fastidious and pissy because he didn't get whatever daily physical affection he gets from her. I mean, it was cute, but I was under the impression that they hardly talked.

It gets worse. Their whole conversation was accidentally recorded to our system. He was angry until she said ""honey just come home"" and mentioned other things that make it obvious that they live together. 

I was able to delete the file, but I really need to let him know so that they are more careful next time. I don't like the idea of  telling him that I know about their "" thing"" because they are obviously keeping it private. I feel the need to warn him but I don't want to come across as nosy.

In addition, she picks up about a shift a week for more money, which in turn puts those responsibilities on me more. In regards to the money aspect, we both put the same amount away for our monthly bills, this doesn’t change based on weekly pay. We both equally cover nights out or activities.

I now have to wake up early, walk the dog, go to work being on my feet all day doing a physical demanding job, go to the gym (for anxiety &amp; health) then go back home to walk the dog again which I've counted as roughly 10 hours a day moving minimum, it's extremely exhausting. She works from home 4 hours a day mon-thursday, never walks him, sometimes forgets to feed him &amp; doesn't play with him which adds to the frustration. It's the only issue in our relationship &amp; some of my friends have said I'm overreacting but I genuinely feel it's torture &amp; putting a strain on our relationship. 

I can't force her, she won't come on walks with me or her friends, she goes out frequently to the gym, dates with me or with friends/family but she literally refuses to walk the dog, who she still claims to love &amp; wants to keep. 

I don't know how to resolve this as it's like talking to a brick wall currently,  I've tried not walking the dog myself to prove a point but the dog will be in need of some love, attention &amp; exercise so i felt awful and gave in immediately he started crying next to his lead. 

TLDR:  GF wanted a high energy dog, now refuses to walk it for no other reason than she doesn't want to, it's frustrating me as the sole responsibility on top of my busy schedule is causing me fatigue.

Me(20M) and my girlfriend(18M) have been dating for almost 3 months. Until we hit a rough patch and are struggling but want to get past it. So I know we are both young and haven't dated that long but understand this is still important to both of us and any and all advice or insight would be super helpful.

So before we started dating we were really good friends for around 3 years of on and off talking. She was always planning on going to the same college as me but as she was 2 years behind me she is a freshman while I am a 3rd year college student.

For some background we both just got out of a relationship the summer before she started college, we knew that it was not good to jump into something but we thought since we liked each other for years now it would be okay since our love was not just a rebound. 

When she got to college we both had a moment where we confessed our feelings for each other and how long we've liked each other. Obviously a moment like thay is heaven on earth but still scary that it won't work out. Turns out we ended up dating about a week later and things were incredible, we would spend every moment we could together. She would wait for me to get out if class, get off work, we got food together for almost every meal we could, and she spend the night in my dorm every night she could. 

Well for about a month things are going great, however one of thr biggest points of argument was about my ex I just got out of a relationship with a few months ago. The way we broke up kinda got rid of any room to get back together in the future but since it was a 4 year relationship we wanted to stay in touch as losing contact with each other would hurt both of us. However my current gf thinks it is inappropriate for me to be talking to her at all and should just block her but it just hurt too much and I didn't want to burn a bridge with her.

So I ended up not replying to my ex which made my ex upset so she unadded me which of course made me pretty sad, so my current gf stands up for me and messages her angry that she unadded me saying it was unfair and whatnot. And my current gf also started saying things like ""you clearly still like him and are just desperate for attention"", and those comments set her off and my ex started telling my current gf all the bad things I've done to get back at my gf for telling my ex off. Including the reasons why my ex left me in the first place which ended up triggering my current gf, i was subscribed to a girls patreon while i was in a relationship with her and that obviosuly crossed a boudnary and ended things. My new gf has even more strict boundaries(like no porn in a relationship which will br relevant later), so she was upset with me but she understood that it was a while ago and I'm trying to move on and be a better person, which is true. The biggest downfal to me was I thought she was upset about paying for porn for a specific girl not just that it was porn in general.

However, ever since then she was paranoid that I would do something like that again, this justified insecurity was made worse when she found dms on my phone for nude trading with someone else using the previous pictures I had from patreon, the time period I did stuff like that was while I was broken up with and genuinely did it once and forgot about it until my gf found it. This made her upset that I did not tell her about it and just made her more insecure about me doing something like that again. But again my downfall was thinking the issue was me trading another girls nudes without their permission not just the fact I had nudes of other girls and wanted more.

Unfortunately my understanding of her boundaries were not good enough, and she caught me watching porn about a month after this all happened(last week). I did not think that it would affect her the way it did and that the specific type of stuff I was watching was free and not about a specific girl but just for a kink thing so because of that it would be okay. But I was an idiot and didn't realize that she saw all porn was cheating, any kind of looking at someone else in a sexual way is cheating. Which I'm okay with in a relationship but what I did crushed her and broke her trust. She said it was okay and she forgave me but just not to do it again and I planned on being completely clean from everything like that from then on which I have still held true to this day. 

However, I think the damage was done. She was anxious 24/7 afterward and what made things worse is there was a new guy she met who made me insecure she would leave me which I'm sure just pushed her away more. A few days after the incident she says she needs some time to herself to process everything. Since then she has moved out of my dorm, all her stuff was in there since she basically lived with me, said she is too sad to even see me and would have a breakdown if she did see me from just being too sad. A few days ago we apologized for everything and made up, she said she wanted a future with me. But she said she is still really hurt and can't see me right now and has moved everything out of my dorm. I have promised to leave her alone and to talk to me when she is ready. And that's where we are at now. To me it seems like she is just trying to move on, but i still hold onto hope.

I feel genuinely lost without her in my daily routine, I talk to friends and family to try to help but it really is just a temporary distraction from the loneliness I'm feeling stuck in my dorm alone with not a whole lot of good friends at college with me.

I understand it may seem we just shouldn't be dating at all, but like I said understand that this is very important to both of us and we want this to work out. All the other times in our relationship were amazing and we took care of each other and were amazing companions to one another. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I also started seeing a therapist to work on myself and making sure this thing does not happen again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m obviously not okay with this at all because Byron is just as much my dog as he is his. 

Before I get into what caused this here’s some background info: 
-Jake and I were together for 2 1/2 years (on and off I’ll be honest) 
- We moved in together in January (yes I know dumb mistake, I was 19 and thought he was the loml)
- Jake is a lawyer and works at a firm his dad partially owns (this will make sense later on)
- We broke up last month and are currently still living together until I can move into one of my dad’s properties which will be by the end of this month. 
-We paid for the Byron equally, and split the bills on whatever is necessary for him. 


The reason I’m making this post after so long is because last week was reading week and so I traveled back to my hometown to visit my family and friends. I decided not to take Byron with me to avoid conflict, something I now realize was a big mistake because when I got back last night, Byron (our dog) was nowhere to be found. Jake wasn’t at home so I figured he took him on a walk or something. When he got home, Byron wasn’t with him so I asked him where he was and he told me he took our dog to his dads place in whistler until “we can sort things out”. Jake has obviously done this so 1. I can’t see our dog and 2. have a hold over me. I’m gonna be honest and say that I don’t believe Jake has ever loved our dog as much as I have and that’s why it was so easy for him to just leave him there. He knows how I feel about Byron and I can’t help but feel he’s doing this to upset me since we aren’t together anymore. 

Before all this happened I brought up ideas on how we can manage a custody like agreement with Byron so we both could see him after I move out. Jake never said much in retaliation to this and now after having this huge argument he said we’re just gonna have to take this to court. He’s saying all sorts of things about how I stand no chance against him since he’s a lawyer, has more than a stable income, his dad’s firm to back him up and I’m still a “young and dumb 20 year old college girl who parties and lives off of her parents and can’t take care of herself let alone a dog” (his words- verbatim). 

A few of my friends said to leave it but they don’t understand. Byron means the world to me, we’ve taken him on our trips and everything and losing him would break my heart and Jake knows this. I have no idea what to do and the last thing I want to do is go to court over this but do I really have a choice? I really just need advice on how I can approach this matter in a reasonable and calm way. I don’t want drama, I more than anything would love to just move on from this.

I was always very clear with her that we’d never do anything she wasn’t comfortable with and in the heat of the moment she’d want it then after we’d have the same discussion. Anyways, after a lot of consoling and some general getting used to, she became much more comfortable being the sexual person she is and found herself liking women, and I don’t mean in a bi-sexual way, like she can only manage to find any attraction to men when they’re hyper-feminine. Even as I’m writing this she still thinks I’m completely ok with it because initially I was, she would watch lesbian porn, she said she loved me and enjoyed having sex with me, but it wasn’t out of an attraction, it was just because she likes the intimacy. For a while that was all I needed. 


Then she went to college, only 45 minutes away and I’ve been doing the commuting since I’m not in college, I’m a volunteer firefighter working on becoming an EMT. After a couple weeks at college she told me about this one girl she thought was super hot and eventually would not stop talking about her and it led to her getting a short crush. This was the first one I wasn’t entirely comfortable with but as the crush faded so did my worry and all was well.


The next issue happened over the weekend when we went to a restaurant, she thought the waitress was hot so she decided to add 20 bucks to the tip I was already paying and spent most of the dinner talking about how attractive she found her. That night back in her dorm she asked me if she could start hitting on women and promised that if she did she’d never let it lead to anything. Again I joked and told her she could but as I’ve been thinking about it all I find myself less and less comfortable with it all


I know everyone’s gonna tell me to just communicate with her and I’m sure I probably should, but my issue is that communicating with her won’t shoot these feelings down, it’ll just lead her to not tell me about them because she’d worry about hurting me again. I just don’t know what to do. We’ve been together a year and a half and it’s been amazing but sometimes I just feel inadequate because I know she’d 
prefer if I was a woman. Any advice?

We don’t have any kids.

Background: Jack doesn’t have any female friends and believes that a male and a female cannot be close friends (if they are both heterosexuals). He also has a history of lying to me. He was at a meeting out of town 3 years ago and told me that he was having dinner with a male colleague that I know of. Later I found out he was actually having drinks with a girl that I told him that I am not comfortable about him having any non-work related interaction with. Mind you they were in a bar in Las Vegas… That incident, him lying to me about it especially, created a big trust issue in our marriage. Eventually, he convinced me that nothing happened that night, he walked back to his hotel room alone, called me on the way, and went to sleep. I believed him.

Now back to today’s issue. He has a side business that requires him to travel and have a 2-3 day intense working schedule with different people in their area of expertise. He once worked with this lady whom he said is “our age and very good looking”, which was weird of him to mention since it was an irrelevant information (also why would your wife need to know that?). When he was working with her, I had this weird sense that he was getting uncomfortable when I asked him questions about her (we always talk about people he works with so it is not unusual for me to ask those type of questions). I know he is uncomfortable mostly because of his demeanor: when he doesn’t want to talk about something or when he is lying, he gets super weird and his body language tells (scratches his eye, tries to change the subject abruptly, and doesn’t look me in the eye etc). Anyway, I brushed it off, and we moved on — I didn’t think of their interaction being anything more than a professional work relationship. But I know that they kept in touch after they worked together which is also weird because he does not keep in touch with anyone else unless he actively works with them on something. When he was at a meeting in a different city last summer, they also had lunch or something. Again, keep in mind that he doesn’t believe in friendship between a guy and a girl. According to him, there is always a sexual interest if a guy and girl is interacting as “friends”.

Back to today. We were talking about what he was up to tomorrow and he said he had a zoom meeting in the morning. When I asked if it is related to his main job or side job, he said side job and added he was going to have a meeting with that lady. I asked him if there is a new work related opportunity through her, and he said “maybe. Just catching up” and then got super weird again: Tried to change the subject very abruptly and the same body language. Another interesting part of it is that he scheduled the meeting at a very specific period of time that he absolutely knows for sure that I won’t be around (I have to be somewhere for an hour tomorrow) even though his day is wide open.

Something just doesn’t feel right. My gut tells me this is not just work related. Again, my husband is not someone who just calls the people he works with to “catch up”. 

As a side note, our marriage is going through a difficult time as I am on tons of medication for a treatment and I gained a lot of weight (he doesn’t think highly of overweight people either even though he didn’t say anything directly to me). Our sex life is dead because of the medication I am on. And this has been going on for almost a year now. So I am thinking maybe because of these side issues, I am insecure about myself, and our relationship and that’s causing me to worry about his interaction with this lady.

Im a female. Ive been in a 3 year relationship with my boyfriend. He's great but there is one thing that is effecting our relationship. I did not have the best childhood, which resulted in a lot of insecurities and trust issues. I am actively trying to work through them, but it is incredibly difficult and I don't know if i can do it myself.

I want to trust my partner and I do everything I can to reassure myself that he is not lying to me but sometimes it is harder than usual and I need his reassurance as well.

I never straight up come at him calling him he is a liar, because I know more likely than not I am just overthinking and he is not lying to me. I just question some things, which I guess can feel like Im pressing him.

I'm 14 F. Recently I switched schools and am now going to my ex boyfriends (15 M) who I dated for half a year from the beginning of December till the end of April. It was on again off again and we eventually just broke up because of our friends who kept interfering with us and we were fed up with everything, we were just teens fooling around and everyone took it way to serious. 

Anyways fastforward to the present. Recently my ex, I will call him J, called me up around 2 AM, telling me he got kicked out for the night because he had a fight with his mum and no one else would take him in. Ofcourse I agreed, I'm not letting someone sleep outside and we are on pretty OK terms. So we had a really good night. We just watched shows and cuddled and it was really nice. Around 8 AM I fall asleep in his arms and after a few hours I wake up to him kissing my forhead and stuff and he was so sweet. He left eventually and we just kept meeting up during lunch at school. I have the feeling that we would be flirting whilst going to our little places where it is just us two and we just talk and have convo's about life stuff.

A week back he asked me to hang out again sometime at my place and I right away agreed cause feelings started to grow again and I really wanted to see him.

Now we just chat a lot on snap where we make jokes like ""Omg I want to see you so bad come over lol"" ""omg yes omw"" that kind off stuff yk so I feel like we've developed some kind off talking stage.

So anyways I asked him when he would come over and he said I don't think that's gonna happen soon so now I'm just really confused. I talked to this about a mutual friend who told me that J has been talking about me some more recently and that he is getting a feeling that he might like me again too but I don't know.

It just sucks I want to tell him how I feel, tell him I really want to see him and love talking to him and stuff but it might ruin it all.
