My boyfriend and I have known each other for 8 years, we have been dating for 3. We met online and have only met twice since we started dating.

Recently he has developed a high interest in IT and tried to get an internship but unfortunately he didn't make it in. 

Since then, he has set goals for himself to study and take coding courses so he can apply again for the internship in february, with better knowledge on the subject.

I must stress that I fully support him deeply and I try to show it in the best possible way I can.

With that in mind, I can understand that he is busy studying and trying to focus on his plan, but since the internship refusal, I feel that there has been a huge change in his behaviour towards me.

I feel very left out, most days pass and we hardly talk, I try to make conversation but he is very dry and takes so long to answer, even when I text him during times of the day/night when I know he is free. He only shows interest in me/us when he is horny.

He also attends university (as do I) and he mostly spends his breaks with his female classmate (they have lunch,they go on walks and spend lots of time together overall, while he rarely texts me at all) 

It just bugs me a lot. I tried bringing the lack of interest issue up to him but he just brushes it off completely.

I can understand that he needs his time and he might feel bad about the internship so I don't want to intrude and be pushy at all.

I'm just left wondering if maybe I'm just overreacting and I should give him more time &amp; space? Any advice will be appreciated!

Rant: im not really sure what to do or how to feel anymore. The guy that I love has never asked me to be his girlfriend although everyone in our lives sees us that way and still doesn’t know if he wants to have a relationship with me. Over the past four years of him knowing me he has taken me on a roller coaster of his emotions. For a couple months I am his everything, then he’ll start getting distant and say he wants to take a break and isn’t sure if his feelings for me-and talks to a couple of girls. We stay friends and then a Couple weeks later he says he loves me and says he knows he wants me. About two years ago I got fed up. I told him I can’t do this anymore, I can’t be his friend and pretend to be okay with it because I KNOW what my feelings are. I gave him an ultimatum (sucks, I know.) basically, if we’re not together I will not be his friend. I was sick of giving him exactly what he wanted while he was able to text other girls, toying with my feelings. He chose to stay and said he was sure that he wanted me. Same thing ended up happening over time. Now it’s been another two years and it’s been a couple of months after he said he would fully commit to me and he KNOWS he wants me to be in his future. He told his mom he was ready to become serious with me, all of it. For a while it was great and perfect and I think we both felt really happy. He didn’t go back to doing what he did in the past, it was a straightforward and healthy spot we were in, one we’ve never really been in before. Now, tonight, he hit me with it again. He says he isn’t sure he knows what he wants but he knows he doesn’t want to lose me and that’s what’s certain. He says he isn’t sure what his true feelings are anymore since when I gave him the ultimatum, he felt obligated to stay? I’m at a loss. My emotions are all over the place yet again and I’m exhausted. I don’t want to lose him either but I know that for my sake I couldn’t be “just a friend” to him, I wouldn’t be a good one to him and it would rip me apart.

I have known him for over a decade but we lost touch. The first time we met he says he knew he wanted to be with me and so when we reconnected and we both were single, it was easy to talk about things and we built a strong bond. He had told me he had been single for 6 years and she was married to someone else already, that was pretty much all I knew about his past relationships. We both lived in 2 different countries when we started talking and planned to meet after a while. When we did meet, I had sex for the first time with him. It was a difficult decision to make because I had wanted to wait until I was married but justified it because he had never stopped telling me how much he wanted us to spend the rest of our lives together. So imagine my shock when someone kept calling him that night and wouldn't stop texting. I found out to my utter dismay that he had a whole life with someone else. I confronted him and he downplayed that relationship. Over time my curiosity led me to find out really disturbing details about that relationship and I called her to know what was going on as he wasn't being open. I have been deeply scared from that period and especially because we had an unbelievable fight about it. He kept justifying his actions and did not really apologize for them. I have carried with me the mental pain from that deceit and tortured myself about giving myself so wholly to somebody who has no respect for me. I have also questioned his love since then. Very recently she sent me insulting and rude messages but I decided to respond with love because I knew she was bitter from being ghosted. She has tried to get in touch with him for the past year and he has been avoiding her only to message her asking why she wanted to meet him and that there was no point of their meeting. When I looked over his computer he had typed ""maybe the next time I am in town we can meet"" but had not sent it. I got furious and questioned what his motives are since then. He turned round and blamed me for interacting with my ex's family even though that was false. A message was sent to a group I was on while we were dating years ago and I exited immediately and I told him about it. He did not find out himself. How he could use that as an excuse to blame me for his action is beyond me. I had a panic attack and couldn't breathe but he kept saying I should stop causing drama when I was struggling to breathe. I have been deeply hurt and just questioning myself. Whenever he asks what is wrong with me and I start to talk it ends in a huge fight because he looks for the pettiest things to blame me for. He claims he did not send the message I saw so he committed no wrong and I told him that opened up a lot of wounds because I am still trying to heal from being cheated on with her and here he was keeping the door to that relationship open. He doesn't understand why I should be hurt or does not see why I brought it up at all.

I had never met him before but I had seen him so many times at a dining hall I visited frequently because I lived in the area. conveniently my friend knew him because they were coworkers. so I asked her to give me his number so I could shoot my shot and I simply sent him a text saying "" you're so fine bro, I want you so bad"" mind you during my confession we were in the same place so I could see his reaction. he thought it was funny at first... he asked who I was but I was too afraid to tell him. instead of saying who I was, I told him that we had a mutual friend and we were at the same place, at that moment. he called me weird thinking I was stalking him and then blocked me....

looking back I agree it may have been a little weird but I was nervous and he was out of my league, so i didn't wanna tell him who I was. a few hours later he unblocked me and I got a message from him, asking who our mutual friend was. I didn't tell him who it was because my friend wanted to stay anonymous which I told him. he pressed me into telling him who I was and to send a pic of myself which I gave to him just to let him know I wasn't some creep watching him and that I just wanted to tell him he was cute. he wouldn't let up on asking who my friend was, and after almost an hour I told him. once he got his answer I was once again blocked. I blocked him right after and kinda went on with my life. I still saw him at the dining hall I went to cause like I said I was always there before, but the only difference was... now he knew my name and what I looked like. anytime i'd go in for food he'd just look annoyed like he absolutely despised me.

I was pretty successful at first at ignoring him, that is until I got a new job. inconveniently that same friend recommended me to her job a while back and I had gone through the process of getting the job. this was way before I had even confessed/ known the guy. a few days after the whole ordeal I was hired to my new job where the guy worked at. I made my schedule so that mine didn't align with his just because I knew it would be awkward. he definitely thought I was a stalker now cause I was always at that dining hall and had conveniently gotten a job at the same place he worked....

I had completely forgotten about him over the summer, but fast forward to the next semester I had to go back to work and knew id have to face him. the first day we worked together, the moment he walked in I was so nervous. my hands were shaking so bad, and we didn't make any conversation whatsoever. it's currently November and we've been coworkers since late august and we still can't talk to each other. every day, he'll come in and speak to everyone but me. not even a simple hello. I really thought with time, after working w each other he'd see I wasn't as weird as he thought. honestly, I was wrong. because he's my supervisor he usually schedules breaks for us and he'll ask me when I want my break but other than that he will not speak to me. I as well will not talk to him if I don't have to.

it is a little complicated tho. I always catch him staring at me. like, ill be serving food and in the corner of my eye I can see him staring, or if we're in different places I can see him looking at me from across the room. he'll either look away super fast or we'll hold eye contact before I ultimately look away. while we're working he'll move in silence. like he'll carry out a task for me if he sees I'm struggling or if I'm lifting something heavy he'll take it away from me instantly. and hell go out of his way to kinda make sure I don't do something I don't wanna. I know he's literally doing his job as a supervisor but it just makes me overthink things. it's just so confusing cause some days he'll be cool and then the next he's like pissed at me. for example, he'll randomly crack jokes with me and kinda tease me.  one day he asked me to help him stretch his arms out. so I stood behind him and lifted his arms up to help him stretch. he literally could've asked anyone but he asked me. and another day I'll be talking to him and he'll completely ignore me.

There’s a lot I need to unpack. 

My (F23) boyfriend (M31) and I have been together for 10 months now. The relationship overall has been great. We’ve of course had our ups and downs, and only ever had one intense argument that lead to a week of needing space, but that was the only thing (not that that matters too much, I’m obviously aware that relationships have their problems sometimes, as long as we work through it). All in all, a great relationship and we love each other dearly. 

Over the past couple of weeks, it seems as though he’s a bit on the fence when we talk about our future. A few months ago, he was adamant that he would love to marry me one day, but a few weeks after that he came home from hanging out with his mates (he was also very drunk) questioning me as to why marriage was sooo important to me and why I wanted to marry him so bad, it’s illogical etc etc which broke my heart at the time. I ask him a couple of days after and he just says “babe seriously? I was drunk..no it didn’t mean anything” and just brushed it off, slightly annoyed that I would even imply that. 

Sometimes there are moments where he’s all sweet and cuddly with me, and tells me how much he loves me, and then there are abrupt moments where he’s cold and distant and I’m not sure if it’s because he’s unsure of us or if there’s some other underlying issues he’s dealing with that he doesn’t want to talk about (he’s not good at dealing with his emotions, very much an old-school kind of guy if you catch my drift)

He doesn't want to go to therapy and is talking less because ""everyone else is"".


*This is a small novel, so thanks for taking time out of your Friday night to read!

My boyfriend of five years has been moody for the past few weeks. I started around the time he found out his best friend is buying a house with his new girlfriend. It came to a head when his other friend's team won a championship game last weekend, which my neutral boyfriend apparently didn't want to happen.

It finally came out when I asked why he was so upset after the game that he didn't feel like he could be happy for any of his friends for a number of reasons, including:

-This friend specifically had addiction issues and was a less-than-stellar person for several years (though he stayed friends with and helped him out), so he doesn't deserve good things

- He feels like no one prioritizes him like he does them, and that he wishes they could all be as close as they were in middle school ""before girlfriends came along""

- He feels like he performs for everyone and now other people are taking that attention from him

- He takes it personally when he finds out about a life event from someone other than that friend

- Friends have cancelled plans on short notice but he can't do that to them because he's ""too good of a person""

-He gets mad when people say he should just move back home (we travel for work) because he feels he's better than that town and hates it when he goes back, both because it's dying and it reminds him of happier times

-He feels like I don't give him enough attention sometimes, mainly because I don't talk much on my own

I reminded him:
- I wouldn't be here if I didn't like him, and that we've both discussed that his extroversion and my introversion is a big part of why we work, and that I would communicate if I was upset with him rather than being quiet

- His friends are still suffering in some way from their pasts and that they would probably give up a lot of what they have now to erase that part of their lives. 

- He isn't and shouldn't expect to be more important than family or romantic relationships

- He has money and a good job and could buy property whenever he wants. He said he knows that but doesn't know where he wants to settle down.

- If moving back home isn't the answer for him, then he especially needs to work on making new friends. He is reluctant because they'll never be as close as his old friendships because they're adults.

- He sounds somewhat jealous of the houses, kids, and relationships when it comes down to it, but he's the only person standing in his way if that's the case.

I also said I was concerned with how much his anger is directed towards the SOs and their kids. He's talked about wanting kids since I've known him, and I told him that it's worrying that he feels like he is more important and that I hope he wouldn't view his own kids that way. He literally said ""I know it sounds weird, but it feels like it should still be bros before hoes, you know?"" He wrecked his marriage with a good woman on that logic, and even she was part of this massive friend group. 

I feel blindsided. He's always been a little immature for his age, but in that ""kid at heart"" way. This wasn't him one month ago, but he swears nothing has happened to trigger this.

I told him he should talk to a therapist, but he said he knows he needs to just accept that he's getting older and get over himself. My issue is that he has no real plans to fix it, he just says he wants to be quieter ""because everyone else is"". That simply isn't true. His friends text and call him every day, and we do the same when we're apart.

As such, we've barely spoken in a week, and when we do, it just feels so forced. I'm totally lost on where to go from here. I want to help but don't know if I can.

A while back I asked her to remove a guy on snap who was making me uncomfortable as he kept sending her snaps and messaging her (they met on an app known for dating originally hence why she has his snap). I brought it up with her and she was extremely reluctant to block him even though I had a valid reason and made relevant points. I ended up letting it go but mentioned her to tell me if he messages or sends a snap of him to her. He did, but I only found out because she left her phone down and a notification from this person popped up and I checked it and saw other messages. I then asked her to remove him and was met with the same reluctancy but she blocked him and there hasn’t been an Issue since. 



Current Day: (A year later)


We were having a conversation recently when she brought up one of her guy friends and then went on to explain “He’s like a brother to me” Now I don’t mind her having guy friends but what I do mind is her saying something like that especially when she has told me before they have talked about intimate/private things together. She also has 2 brothers. She mentioned that there are boundaries in place and if the guy were to cross them she said she would “talk it out” with him but not block/remove him which I think is unfair. 


I have not asked to block this guy and I will never ask unless he crosses a boundary but I am not sure if she would even tell me that he has due to previous history mentioned above as my reaction would be to block/remove him which I believe is fair and respectful to me.

One of the things they needed to be in a relationship was that I went sober so I went sober after being on drugs and alcohol for about 2 years straight. It was really difficult but I am now sober and have been for a week. Now I have a  thing against nicotine because my dad was addicted to it since he was 12 and is now barely able to walk because of a stroke he had because of his smoking addiction. Today I had a conversation with M about her nicotine use and how I would like them to stop. I had explained to them that I would not support their habit but I will still care for them but because they don’t have a job they said that they would just suck dick for the nicotine and I did snap a bit by saying stuff like I would just sever all contacts and went quiet for a few minutes but then they just left and haven’t texted me since.

Me (25f) and my bf (27m) have been together almost a year. We love eachother deeply.

I recently heard some stories about his past, and learned he had an extensive sexual history, or as he says he “lived a full life” before meeting me. He’s lost count of how many sexual partners he’s had, and he’s had threesomes.

While I have my own past (single digits) I always felt shy, and felt like I probably could’ve had a lot more fun than I did in my younger days if I was more confident. Hearing about his past makes me feel a little jealous, and slightly insecure. Which I’m not proud of. 

Can someone give me some advice on how to get over this? Tough love works good with me.

Thanks!

The relationship was fine, when it came to weed we both occasionally smoked weed, but since 7 months ago my GF has started smoking weed all the time and she's high 24/7. We both work, but she works from home selling her art so being high 24/7 doesn't affect her job. 

The issue is more our relationship. One example, I kind of don't like doing things with her now, like watching a movie, or a tv show because there's no point since she will just forget whatever it is that we watched by the next day, which I understand, when I watch movies or TV high I tend to forget what I watched as well, but it's hard to take that into account when she's high 24/7. This also applies to hanging out and doing something together or going on dates, she forgets a lot so it makes me feel like the memories we're making is only one sided. 

And that's if I can convince her to do something together, if I want to spend time with her and do something together she would just rather stay in the bedroom and smoke weed all day and eat snacks, she's barely likes spending time in the living room, or in other parts of the house. 

In general she feel like a different person when she's high, like a shell of her former self, which again I can understand because I'm similar when I'm high, but when she's high 24/7 it's hard to deal with. I feel emotionally disconnected form her, every time I see her she has lazy bloodshot eyes, she can't focus and is lost in her own world. I don't remember the last time I've seen her sober.

She's also lazier in general, so a lot of her responsibilities like her taking care of her cat (That cat is her pet, not mine) falls on me, so I gotta feed the cat, clean the litter box, clean her fur. Also she doesn't even bother smoking outside, or opening the window, so a lot of the smoke gets trapped inside the bedroom, and she does this while the cat is inside the bedroom so the cat is inhaling a lot of that second hand smoke, which I told her it's probably not best for her cat to breathe all that, but she tells me it's not a big deal. I don't even like cats and yet I'm more concerned over her cat than she is.  

When I've tried talking to her that I missed her sober side she got mad at me and said I was being judgmental and defended her weed habits. It doesn't seem like she's gonna change anytime soon. 

I honestly am wondering if maybe I should just move on and break up with her at this point, but I don't want to feel like I'm using the break up as an ultimatum to get her to change, I don't want to manipulate her to give up weed if she ultimately chooses to be a 24/7 pothead.

ago, we did take a 3 month break, as I was traveling
for work and things were beginning to feel very
serious which I have typically avoided.

I have an avoidant personality, which I know, and it
has definitely affected our relationship so I'm not
placing the blame squarely on her at all.

Anyways, during this time, we both dated a bit and
she ended up with a guy for a month or so, let's call
him R. So her and R ended up having sex, bunch of
dates, the whole thing. We weren't together so l
understand, even if it's hard to come to terms with.

After my work trip we talked and decided to give it
another shot. This is where it gets hard. When we
started dating again, she told me that her and R had
kissed once or twice, been on a few dates, and that
was all. For the first month, things were great. But
one night while drinking, it came out that she had
lied about the extent of their relationship (having
unprotected sex, multiple dates and activities) and
two weeks after we had started talking again, she
had kissed him when he showed up to her work. She
swears she wants nothing to do with him, and that
she angrily told him to get out of her life, which I
believe to an extent. There is no way to prove
anything as she has deleted any messages.

My issue is the trust now. I've never been an
insecure person but I find myself stressed and
worried when I don't hear from her after a few
hours. And I find myself suspicious of her and
untrusting. Is this something that will resolve with
time or am I wasting both of our time?

I do love her deeply and once we started talking
again, I was all in. But I feel like this almost gave me
a reason to pull back again and be distant and
scared to jump in. It has affected our sex life, daily
interactions and things have been distant, even
though she just wants to forget it and move on. Any
advice is appreciated, thank you.

She's said that she's not ready for a relationship as she has some healing to do from previous abuse (quite horrible), and I'm totally ok with that, neither of us are interested in anyone else and we spend most of our free time together, we click on so many levels and the sex is really good, so I don't feel I need to push anything.

She also has mainly guy friends, which is o.k, I knew this when I met her. . . however, over many of our conversations, she's mentioned that she's either hooked up with some of them, or, she knows they're interested in her (she has an awesome personality, and is super attractive, so I can see why)

Her main friend has hooked up with her in the past (not sex) and has told her he loves her and has feelings for her, he's also just lost his father who was the only family he had, and txts her saying he's suicidal, or drinking and driving, then when she worries, or tries to help or visit him, he won't talk or seek help. (He doesn't know we're hooking up, she's worried to tell him because of his current loss etc)
I am ok with her spending time with him, he was there before I was, however, it really stresses her out when he's in a state, and I have to talk her down without telling her that he needs to stop this BS feeling sorry for himself behavior, and talk to a therapist. . .I guess the best bet is to keep biting my tongue and just try and be there for her

My other issue is that she's lied to me twice, (she's blamed it on a horse riding head injury which was quite severe 2 years ago) 
The first lie was about a guy she'd told me about early on in our friendship, she told me that they'd had sex a few times and then went separate ways but still keep contact. Then, the other day, she said that they'd never done anything more than hug. . .I asked her to confirm this and she said it was true. . .then I reminded her that she'd already told me they'd hooked up, and she back tracked and said that she'd got story's mixed up and it was a head injury symptom. . .I kind of feel like an asshole for taking issue with this, considering I don't know much about head injuries

The second lie was about some random house when we were out walking. . .their pitbull terrier dog escaped through a gap in their gate and wandered onto the road. She escorted the dog back onto the (rough looking) property even though I was saying it's not a good idea to jeopardize her safety. . .no one was home so she wrote a note saying what'd happened and left it in their letterbox. . .I happened to catch a glimpse and saw that she'd signed her full name and phone number. . .I thought this was reckless, however, I didn't want it to seem like I was spying on her letter, so I asked if she'd given this stranger any personal details. . .she lied and said no.
I brought this up after a day of total anxiety and she'd said that she'd lied to protect me and that she knows I'm super protective, and she apologized.

I don't know what to do. . .I have feelings for her (they're mutual) however, I'm noticing more and more little half truths etc. . .I can see a future for us, however, I'm trying to discover if im going to be ok with there being good reasons to lie, my previous long term relationship was filled with lies and manipulation, and my current FWB is the opposite of my ex in so many ways. . .I don't know what to do or think",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7522033,public,self,A reason for lying,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysqtqc/a_reason_for_lying/,all_ads,6

My gf’s mom was sitting down at the table when she started saying how the entire family would beat me up for bringing a coca-cola to the table, supposedly because they don’t drink beverages with sugar (which I didn’t even bring, it was my gf’s brother who did).

I took it as a joke, despite the comment being weird and uncomfortable for me and didn’t say anything.

She kept saying off putting things and tried to provoke me.

My gf also got mad at me for no reason at that moment, and I kind of had enough for that night and decided it was a good moment to leave, I was ordering my uber to go home, to which my gf reacted by saying she was sorry and getting nervous.

I try to be patient, and I wasn’t upset with my gf, but her mother was disrespecting me, and I felt like enough was enough for that night.

A little while later, her brother started getting upset at me for making her sister apologize I suppose, and started saying I was being a manipulative asshole, saying he wasn’t going to let himself be manipulated by my bullshit.

Things escalated over nothing, all I did was call it a night (it was 10:11 pm), and I tried to be courteous and not make a scene.

Then my gf started crying and left for her room.

I see her several times a week, but her mom is almost always rude and crass, and she’s harsh even with her children.

I felt like things got out of hand way too quickly.

He’s dating a woman who has a kid, and he regularly asks us to entertain their kid for them, which is their job.

Me and my girlfriend even take their kid out to go see kid’s movies when it’s our date nights, and they still have the gall to call me manipulative.

I felt terrible when I left, I was crying and surprised that all this had happened so suddenly and over nothing, and sad that I might not see my gf again.

This was unfair, they treat me like I’m the villain, when I pay for plenty of meals we have together, take care of their brother’s kid with my gf, and I treat my gf respectfully and nicely, I even buy her gifts on a regular basis.

Right now my gf and I have been talking about what we can do to see each other again after what happened, because supposedly her family isn’t letting her see me.

We’ve been planning for ways to get her family back on our side, but we live in Mexico, family dynamics are different and more strict, and she is dependent on her mom.

She still wants to see me and we’re both sad about the turn of events.

I feel bad that I may have lost the person I love due to bad circumstances.

She kept yelling out jokes and I noticed he would say a joke and look at her to make her laugh. I would feel and see with the corner of my eye that he was looking at her especially whenever she was singing along with the songs in the movie. I was high though so I’m not exactly sure and it bothers me. He would keep touching me and kissing me as if he knew I might have been uncomfortable about them interacting or he felt guilty about having an interest in her?? 

He would stare at her in admiration with a smile. She would stare at me with a mischievous type smirk like she knows that I’m feeling uncomfortable since I became quiet. I don’t know if I was going crazy and it was just one of my usual insecurities about him wanting someone else or was the weed influencing my insecurities???

At times, it seemed like she was trying to impress him and I feel he would do it at times. 

Me and my bf really love scifi movies and that’s how we bonded when we first met. After the movie finished, my bf asked if I still wanted to watch this one movie we were originally planning to watch but since I was uncomfortable about that situation, I said I was gonna go home. As me and him were leaving his place, her and my bf’s roommate were looking for a movie to watch and she yelled out “LET’S WATCH SOMETHING SCIFI” as if she was trying to get his or my attention. 



I did tell him about the situation and he said that he wasn’t staring at her or anything like that and that it was just my insecurities, that he loves me and only me. He said they never talked back when they had a class together. 
He wasn’t acting defensive or angry of my assumptions. For body language, He did make direct eye contact as he was holding me letting me know and didn’t fidget or anything. 

In general, he doesn’t hang with her and prefers to be just with me in his room, while everyone is out in the living room partying. He’s kinda asocial and prefers my company. I just realized that before this whole (movie night) situation, he didn’t interact with her. It was just that specific situation that really stood out to me…

I don’t know what to do. I still can’t stop thinking about it and trying to solve it. This was all from a month ago. I’m not sure if this is just ocd plus the weed or it actually happened. I don’t remember much and it’s bothering me.

Short summary for those who don’t want to read a whole ass essay: I like a guy who’s been giving me a load of mixed signals and now he’s being distant and I don’t know what to do

—————-———————————
I’m not going to go into too much detail just incase I get exposed but-

I, F18 really really like this guy. We have no mutual friends so I find it difficult to think of excuses to talk to him. Since we arm ce still in school though, I get to see him everyday. About 2 months ago it was so obvious he liked me.I’d always catch him staring and smiling and there was exciting tension. Sometimes though we would chat while waiting outside of class and the convos were great and we would look into each others eyes and smile loads and online we’d have the odd talk and he would kinda mildly flirt . 

Basically, it was clear that he was into me but the problem was I am not a confident person and have been hurt before by people I’ve never dated so I was scared to make a move. ( and also this rlly specific situation happened which probably made him think I didn’t like him but I cannot say other wise if he saw this he would for sure know it was me. So pm me if u want more context). 

So for weeks we just sent each other blank snaps on Snapchat(I know, it’s dumb) and had rare little conversations.But then for a month straight I had been going out a lot and drinking with friends and I would send pics of my friends to him. He’d say something like ‘hi friendsname’ and I’d mostly just say hi back and then there’d be a short meaningless convo.

But then one night I took it a bit far mostly bc I knew I wouldn’t see him for a week. I am still so embarrassed but anyway my friend and I started sending him videos... like keep in mind I barely talk to this guy in school ands now these monstrosities of videos come out of nowhere.And the next morning I apologised for be annoying him and he gave some shitty reply. It kinda got worse after that because throughout that week I didn’t see him I was like right this is my time to make a move I’m gonna be brave and do it. I’d send him funny pictures of me doing stuff and pics of my cute little dog and I did get some good responses to be fair but not enough to feel like he wanted to get to know me. And the snaps he sent me were with a permanent frown. I am guessing it was to do with the videos. 

Then when I saw him again this week I was just tired of his confusing signals and so I tried to ignore him. It is rlly frustrating for me to look in his direction bc every time I do I just melt. But I didn’t wanna give up completely so I started a convo online again and it was actually reciprocated and continued by him but I was the one to stop it. Also this guy is such an introvert so it’s a miracle he’ even talks to me at all. I rarely see him talk to his own friends. I understand him in that sense. I like being alone a lot and I don’t usually interact with people unless I am spoken to first.

Also another problem is that I think that he believes I like my guy friend(let’s call him S)whom I do not at all. And me, S and another friend(let’s call him G) were joking around while he was nearby and I think he overheard our convo where G was trying to hook me and S up but idk if he knew it was a joke.

And now for the fist time in more than 3 months, he has left my Snapchat left on open. And it doesn’t look own he’s gonna reply anytime soon.

I understand that I am a huge factor in the miscommunication but I am also very confused about what he’s thinking. I’m begging I need advice ???

She's convinced that the UK is going to be nuked any day now, and because we're in quite a rural area, she doesn't think that it's going to be a quick lights-out ordeal; I think she's imagining a sort of survival apocalypse situation where we're without all modern amenities, and need to survive on our own.

Ever since our wedding in the summer, she's gone full survivalist. Tins of food, vacuum-packed meals, first aid kits, torches, bottles and bottles of water. She's talking about buying a generator, and oxygen-equipped carriers for the cats. This girl has vaguely lost it. Obviously, the rest of those are just money (and, I say just money, but in the current climate that's not brilliant), but she's also decided that she needs to be as fit as feasibly possible in the time she feels she has.

Now, she wasn't fat. Or isn't. But, she's certainly carrying some extra weight, which I have never had an ounce of a problem with. But she's decided that this is going to be what kills her. But personally, I think what might end her is this new exercise routine she's on. She's gone from fuckin' 'bout the house 6 days a week plus a quick walk, to deciding it's absolutely imperative she's jogging for 40 minutes twice a day. I have NO problem with her deciding to get fit, but the fact that it seems like so much all at once, and for such a silly reason, makes me feel really uneasy about what she's doing. I worry that she's going to crash, or hurt herself. She's also barely eating, and frequently coming home feeling really unwell after a too-long run. When I point this out to her, she accuses me of not taking the state of the world seriously, and that I should be putting in more effort.

Additionally, we always said that we would start having children once we'd got married. Neither of us is getting any younger, and it's something we always wanted. She hasn't said that she doesn't want them anymore, but I get a strong impression that she thinks the world is ending, and there's no point. She refuses to talk about it, and despite getting off birth control a week before the wedding, she insists on using condoms. I was wondering... If there's anything I can do about this? I mean, on the one hand, she's trying to get healthier. Which I suppose is good.

We have been exclusively dating since month 2. We’ve even recently been on a trip abroad together. She has made it very clear she doesn’t want to make it official. She has only very recently posted me publically on instagram, Snapchat etc. 

In person she’s usually fine, we get along well. But sometimes a flip switches and she completely ignores me, even on the trip. Because she “doesn’t want to interact with me”. 

On text, most of the time she will reply with one word answers. For example I could ask how was work and she will say “fine”. Not even a fine, you? Just fine. I then might say, How did it go with x thing you were telling me about ? “Good.” Then I might say “what are you up to? “ “watching Tik Tok”. She’s always on her phone, but rarely puts any effort into conversation with me. 

Whenever I ask her to come over it’s always “maybe”, incase something else comes up or she doesn’t “feel like it”. 

I don’t believe she is doing anything with anyone else. 

However, I suspect maybe I’m just something to do. And if I don’t fit her plans or her mood at a given time, then she is uninterested in me completely. She says she wants something long term and can see it with me, but she has also ended it previously because she said she could not.

Breaking up is not at all on my radar. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years. I’m worried about his health. He is quite overweight for his height and now that we live together, I’m seeing his eating habits more clearly. He played football until college, so I think he’s just never changed his eating habits from that time in his life. He over eats, snacks and doesn’t work out at all these days. He doesn’t seem to mind, he’s kind of always partially based his personality around being a ‘big guy’, 6’3” 320lbs. But I know it must bother him a little. 

I’m noticing it more and more that his weight is becoming an issue. He can’t shop at ‘regular’ stores, he can’t fit on carnival rides. He always keeps his shirt on during intimacy. Most recently, he wasn’t able to do Indoor skydiving with our friends. His dad has sleep apnea and was recently diagnosed with pre diabetes so weight/health related issues isn’t uncommon in his family.

My concerns are growing and I just don’t want him to continue down this path. How can I bring this up as delicately as possible? I just want him to be healthy and not go down the same road as his dad

I've been with the same guy off and on for almost 4 years now. The whole relationship has been one of the worst I've ever had. Lies, cheating, violence, and stalking when I would leave him. Complete disrespect in so many instances that I've never experienced as much with all of my prior exs' disrespects combined, compared to his. 


He constantly lied. Was caught cheating multiple time, but somehow I was convinced to let it go because he didn't have sex with them, he was just trying to meet up with them and making dating apps. I beg to differ that it didn't count as cheating, but none the less, I loved him and forgave him for the lies and such. 


The guy really didnt have much going for him in the beginning, but has at least by this point, kept a stable job for nearly a year and starting to take care of some of his legal matters with his drivers license and car. There were still the lies though.


I lost feelings for him the last go around. We lasted from May to July of this year, when I found out so much more that he stabbed me in the back with. As of a couple of weeks ago, I fell into a hard time with my car. He just so happened to find a way to reach out to me again after I went full no contact. 


So I admit, I leaned on him for a moment to get a ride so I could buy a part for my car. We started hanging out again (he was just a ride, didn't help fix it) . Started gaming with him again, went out a couple of times, and he started telling me he loves me again and I'm all that he wants. The thing is, he's said all of this stuff before all the while messaging and meeting up with girls behind my back, so honestly his words don't mean anything to me. 


Sure enough, the last time we were out, I went to the restroom and came back. I see snap chat wide open and him messaging another girl with hearts and all, while we are on a date. He quickly closes it as I sit down. I know his argument would be as it has before, ""well, we're not Facebook official"". So I didn't say a word. I had several messages from guys I never read or responded to because of how much he would flip out over a guy simply asking how I'm doing.


I proceeded to respond to a couple of them right in front of him. I knew they weren't interested in me like that, so I didn't try to stir up anything with an innocent guy just to prove a point. He went off, of course. I told him I saw the girl he was talking to and of course the whole ""we're not official"" came up, so I told him he has no right to say anything to me then. He actually shut up.


I do not have feelings for this guy anymore, like at all. I'm no longer even physically attracted to him enough to have this Fwb situationship. He offers nothing positive to my life, yet keeps chasing like I'm the only one he wants. I finally told him today, verbatim,


""I just want to say, this fling has been fun and all. I enjoy gaming with you, chit chatting throughout the day, and going out on occasion, but I'm wanting something a little more serious/deeper connection with someone. The sex has been okay, but I'm looking for more and I just don't see that happening with you. ""


He then says that what I'm saying is that he is not good enough. I didn't want to belittle or argue what I've been over several times, so I said"" it's not that you're not good enough, you're just not a good fit for me""

He asked why, and I've yet to respond. After everything I've went through with him time and time again, we've discussed this so many times it nauseats me to even think of having this conversation ever again for the rest of my life.

I have an avoidant personality, which I know, and it has definitely affected our relationship so I’m not placing the blame squarely on her at all.

Anyways, during this time, we both dated a bit and she ended up with a guy for a month or so, let’s call him R. So her and R ended up having sex, bunch of dates, the whole thing. We weren’t together so I understand, even if it’s hard to come to terms with. 
After my work trip we talked and decided to give it another shot. 
This is where it gets hard. When we started dating again, she told me that her and R had kissed once or twice, been on a few dates, and that was all.
For the first month, things were great. But one night while drinking, it came out that she had lied about the extent of their relationship (having unprotected sex, multiple dates and activities) and two weeks after we had started talking again, she had kissed him when he showed up to her work. 
She swears she wants nothing to do with him, and that she angrily told him to get out of her life, which I believe to an extent. There is no way to prove anything as she has deleted any messages. 
My issue is the trust now. I’ve never been an insecure person but I find myself stressed and worried when I don’t hear from her after a few hours. And I find myself suspicious of her and untrusting. Is this something that will resolve with time or am I wasting both of our time? 
I do love her deeply and once we started talking again, I was all in. But I feel like this almost gave me a reason to pull back again and be distant and scared to jump in. It has affected our sex life, daily interactions and things have been distant, even though she just wants to forget it and move on. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

Trent is a pretty quiet man, keeps things to himself. When he gets upset or angry, he slowly shuts down and kind of disassociates. I understand, I've done it. 

We started off as FWB for a few weeks then we slowly started talking. I went with him to his brother's apartment, briefly met his nieces. He and his sister held a bonfire out at their house so I met two of his friends and I ended up drunkenly admitting my feelings for him. 

Now, for the past like 3-4 days he's been acting different. I've brought it up numerous times. He was over last night after I'd made a post somewhere about this situation and we talked, I yelled, nearly cried. But after everything was over, he held my hand and we kept talking about different shit. He laid over on me, his head in my lap. I felt loved again, like I meant something. 

Today everything has fallen apart again but after letting the dust settle in my mind and being able to see clearly again, I've kinda realized I'm not ready to give up on it yet. I want to try harder, I want to fix this. I want to be a permanent person in his life like I want him to be in mine. I'm determined to fight for this until there's nothing left to fight for, it's worth it. 

My problem is, I don't know how. I don't know what I'm doing. I've always just let people go but he makes me finally feel safe and I want that. Shitty parts aside, there are so many good parts to our relationship and being able to see them again makes me want nothing more. *What do I do? How do I fix things?*

I saw this as a good opportunity for team building and agreed.

When I asked my boyfriend (27m), if he would be fine with this, he initially was hesitant and uncomfortable.

I am not familiar with the rules and the lingo.

My partner - let's call him Daniel (28m) and I have been together for almost 2 years. We have lived together for a year and a half and have 1 child (11 month old female) together and one on the way (I'm in my last trimester of pregnancy). 

I really loved him when we started dating. I was living my best life, thriving in my single life, I was pursuing IVF because of fertility issues, and had no intention of entering a relationship. But when we met each other, we both immediately caught feelings. I felt like he was a good man (he seemed kind, he wasn't a player, he made me feel special, he didn't play games or mind tricks, etc.). 

Daniel is an apprentice electrician which means that he works full time (unionized, working 30-40 hours a week) with great pay and benefits and 5 times in 5 years will have to pause his work to complete college courses (in 3 month increments). 

I am a mental health worker and I have always worked since I was a teenager and I have also been in post secondary education for the last 11 years. When Daniel and I met, he made about double what I made, but now we make about the same. However, I have always and continue to pay most of the bills, even when I made less income than he did (and I have substantially more debt than he does because of all of my schooling). I pay all of my own bills, some of his, and I am the primary provider for our child (I pay for her RESPs (education savings plan for her future), formula, food, diapers, toys, clothes, books, extracurriculars/classes, etc. although when it is Daniel's turn to do groceries he will buy her formula or diapers if we are running out). I have spent thousands on Daniel's bills and I don't mind doing it because I consider us family. The only thing that bothers me is that I feel like Daniel doesn't share the mindset of providing for the family like I do. I wish we both shared the mindset of providing for our family. 

The only two times he messed up in the beginning of our relationship was when he lied to me about 2 girls. He didn't physically cheat on me but lied about a girl who was actively pursuing him, knowing he was with me and another girl who he was pursuing. He apologized profusely and said it would never happen again and really fought to keep me so I stayed with him. 

All of our problems started when he moved in with me. I was about 4/5 months pregnant when he moved in with me. I was working full time, going to school full time, and completing a practicum for school. I worked lots of overtime so that I could save for the baby since I knew I wouldn't have much of an income during my maternity leave - between 130-140 hours biweekly (12 hour shifts, overnight). I still did all of the cleaning, cooking, packed his lunch for work, did all the chores, groceries, just everything. I am very vocal about my wants/needs/expectations in a relationship and communicate when I am unhappy and why. I told him he needed to start cleaning up and doing his share around the home. He kept saying he would but it never happened. 

We had renovations done in our apartment and I had asked him multiple times to please help me move the furniture out of a room so a wall could be broken down but he never helped me, so in my final weeks of pregnancy (I was maybe 34 weeks pregnant then), I had to haul all the furniture out by myself with my big pregnant belly (heavy dressers, the bed, tables, everything). 

I kept telling him that I really wish he took care of me the way that I took care of him. Again, he kept saying things would get better but there were no changes. (For example - I rub his back for him every day after work, but even though I am super swollen due to the pregnancy and ask him for help with my legs and/or ankles - he doesn't help me).

As we lived together, I began to realize that he was really racist (he is white, I belong to a racial minority). He made many racist remarks and started calling people aliens just for speaking another language (they were not undocumented people, they were citizens). 

It doesn't help that his mother absolutely hates me. She has constantly tried to break us up. I have never done anything bad or disrespectful to her. I have always tried to treat her kindly in the beginning of my relationship with Daniel - cooking for her, bringing her flowers, etc. But when she found out I was pregnant with our first her response was, ""That baby is going to be the death of everything."" When she found out I was pregnant with our second, she said, ""Oh no."" She tried to stop Daniel from moving in with me, saying that the baby and I could ""visit"" him from time to time at her apartment. Daniel's mother and brother both made me feel extremely uncomfortable to the point where I stopped going over to their home. Also they smoke a lot in the home and it just wasn't great to be around because I was/am pregnant. Even though we live 20-30 minutes away, she has only come to see her grandchild 3 times in the last almost year of her existence; she didn't even come to the gender reveal. 

The last time Daniel went to school, I had just given birth. I was still a full time student and completing a practicum even though I was on maternity leave from work. Daniel was not working so he could complete school (which was mostly online because of the pandemic). Even still, I made sure I did everything to support him with his studies, which still meant taking on all of the house work, cooking, and raising the newborn. 

This summer, I was accepted into every graduate school I applied to (except for 1 which I was waitlisted). I had talked with Daniel about it and decided that I wanted to complete 2 of the graduate programs I was accepted into. I want to work to further my career to help people as well as be a good provider for my kids, and role model good work ethic for them. I had spoken to him about it and came to the conclusion that if I were to attend both programs (full time for 1 year), with practicums, I would also have to return to work early so that I could afford everything. I also explained that I would be needing his support and his contributions to the home and the baby during this time so that I could complete everything. I didn't return to my original job because I didn't want to be away from my baby for 12 hours at a time, so I found 2 part time remote jobs so that I could still be at home with my baby. 

At this point, I work 2 jobs (I need to, as I pay most of the bills and have a lot of debt), I am completing two graduate degrees on a full time basis, I am completing a practicum, I am the primary parent of my baby, I am pregnant, and I am still doing all of the housework - unless I ask Daniel specifically to do something (which sometimes he still does not help with). It makes me sad that I have to stay up late (around 1am) to get all of the work done. Because if Daniel had helped out more, I would be able to go to sleep at the same time as him. Plus, the baby wakes up multiple times through the night, sometimes for an hour at a time before she is fully awake at 5am (which means my day also starts at 5am). In the last few months, Daniel has started to help me with the baby during the night when she wakes up, but I don't let him tend to her too long because he gets easily frustrated and yells at her and I don't like that because she's just a baby and that's what babies do.

I have always begged Daniel to take me out on dates. I don't think he had taken me out for a date until I was in my third trimester of pregnancy with our first baby. And it stopped after that until I kept asking him and we finally went on a few dates this year. He has done some sweet things like bring me chocolate and flowers on valentines day. But I am the best gift giver - every occasion, I always spend hundreds of dollars on him on thoughtful presents I know he will like, I bake him fresh goodies, and make him something by hand (I am a little artsy). Daniel is not a good gift giver. And this isn't even a ""it's the thought that counts"" sort of thing, because there is no thought behind the gifts he gives me. I don't need expensive things, and I have given him gift ideas with things that are substantially cheaper than what I spend on him, but he doesn't even get me anything from the list. Last Christmas, I bought him things he had been searching for for months, made him things, and spent hundreds again. He bought me a mug. I have so many, I didn't even have anywhere to put the one he got me. 

His birthday is the day after mine. For his birthday, I always bake him his favourite cake, shower him with presents, cut cake with him exactly at midnight and decorate the place like crazy. For my birthday, he didn't even get me anything until I asked him if he got me anything (he bought me socks that were too small and stickers that I still have not used until this day). He didn't even cut cake with me on my birthday.

Throughout the last year and a half (since he moved in), I have been telling him what has been making me unhappy, why I have been depressed, what I want from our relationship. I even told him that if things didn't change, I don't see a future for us. Over time, because there were no changes, I told him I was starting to tap out of the relationship, and more recently, I have told him that I have tapped out completely. I've told him that I am starting to resent him, because he only makes my life harder for me. I have supported him with work and school and raised his kid(s) as though I was a SAHM even though I'm not (mad respect for SAHM though, don't know how you do it!). It's ironic because throughout out relationship he would always tell me that I make him a better person, but now I tell him that I don't like the person I am with him - always tired, bitter, angry, depressed, sad, disappointed, not as caring as I used to be, etc.  

Sex is really important to me, but I don't think we have even had sex in a month, because I'm really not attracted to him. Firstly because of how he makes me feel and how I resent him and secondly because he has no sense of personal hygiene (he will shower maybe once a week and brush his teeth maybe once a month). 

He has been really incompetent with our daughter too. I have gotten TOO pregnant to go in the water with her for her swimming lessons, so I asked Daniel if he could please be the one to go in with her for her next lesson. It took some convincing. But my poor baby was so miserable the entire time. She is not a crier and she was crying. In previous lessons, parents would tell me, ""I'm so jealous of your happy baby."" With 1 lesson with Daniel, parents came to me and asked, ""Is she okay??"" He dropped her in the water, he lost her headband so her hair would get in her eyes even though i specifically asked him to keep an eye on it, she kept losing her boat toy and crying for it and he would leave it and swim away form the toy, her bikini kept riding up and he never fixed it once, she loves to splash and play in the water but he held her so that only below her belly button was under the water so she was probably freezing cold (she wears a floatie). I don't want to take her back to lessons until after I give birth and can be with her again because I don't trust him with her and I never want to see my baby upset like that. Even at home, whenever he is with her, I feel like he just leaves her in the playpen so he could be on his phone. I only use the playpen for her when I have to go to the washroom and park it in front of the washroom with the door open so I can keep an eye on her. 

I keep telling him I want to end things, but he keeps saying things will change. I really did love him in the beginning and I know relationships don't stay in that beginning stage for long. I'm not sure if it's the pregnancy hormones or if I have a valid reason to not be in this relationship. I'm starting to fantasize about other men (I would never physically cheat or talk to anyone or act in that way at all) and for me this means I have totally checked out of this relationship. I was willing to work through it for my kid(s) but I'm not sure it's worth it anymore. I have just felt so unloved and uncared for for so long and he has always been fully aware of it but done nothing to remedy the situation. I feel so alone.

This is going to be long and I’m not sure if all of this is relevant information, but I want the whole situation out so I can get the best advice about this.

 Me and my friend who I’ll call Marie and I met when we were in middle school. The year before we met, she met a guy I’ll call Dennis. From what she told me, he was normal that year. But when we met, he was incredibly mean to her. He would flip-flop from being her friend and being nice to her one week to screaming in her face to leave him alone and ignoring her the next week. She excused it as him having a tough home life, but all I saw was him taking his anger out on her. This was all throughout middle school and into a lot of high school. The whole thing was really ridiculous; he was basically her bully but then the second he showed any kindness she was back under his spell. It was the only thing we’d ever argue about. 

Marie had a tough childhood growing up, as well. Because of this she was at my house a lot. She’s basically my sister, and my family loves her like their own. We’re 24 now, and around a year and a half ago I got into a serious relationship. I’ll admit that prior to this, we were in a codependent relationship. We spent nearly all our time together (We had issues last time I was in a relationship because she said I was ignoring her). She went from spending 4-5 nights a week at my house to 3 nights a week. We were discussing our codependency issues throughout the entire first month of my relationship, and I genuinely believed we were working through the issues…

And then she reconnected with Dennis. Within a month of them talking, he moved in with her. It has been a year and a half since then and I’ve seen her maybe 5 times. We went from spending most of the week together, to not even seeing each other every other month. Marie sent me a picture at the beginning of their relationship of a hole in the wall, and she said Dennis punched the hole in the wall because something had pissed him off and she kinda played it off as something cool or a joke. I have tried to plan things with her multiple times, but it never works out, and I think that’s because of Dennis. I invited her to my birthday and she canceled the day before. We planned to go out to an event last month: me, my boyfriend, Marie, and Dennis. But, again, the day of she canceled. It would have been the first time in several months I’d even seen her. She told me Dennis had just woken up on the wrong side of the bed. My boyfriend and I went to the event ourselves. 

He doesn’t have a job and basically refuses to get one, he sits at home while Marie goes to work. She’s bought him hundreds of dollars worth of gifts, like video game shit for him to do while he’s home. She started drinking with him, when before she never wanted to drink due to a history of alcohol abuse in her family. She’s cut off her other friends, due to issues I think Dennis caused(at least one I know he caused due to exaggerating the situation to her). The only friends she does have are her work friends, and that’s only because she needs to see them to get money.

I don’t know how else to reach out to her. He’s now causing issues with her sister, who she lives with. I feel like he’s isolating her from her support, and I believe he’s been trying to get her to cut me off since they started dating. I don’t know how to help her, she’s with him all the time and shows him her texts. I feel like I can’t call out his behavior without being cut off as well. How do I help her? I care about her, she’s like a sister to me. Aside from the codependency that we were working out, she’s my best friend and I love her. I don’t even think she sees this as a bad situation, all she has ever wanted is someone to love her, and I know Dennis showers her with affection.

He's an artist. Our dates are great and in person, he's very lovable, I saw his friends after an event for 10 mins but he holds my hand and everything in front of them.

But right now I don't feel like I can completely trust him and feel safe around him. I saw that he was active on 2 dating apps (one of them being just for sex) . I asked him about it. I found out about the fucking app after the conversation so we didn't talk about that, just tinder. His reply was that he's not really looking to see if the grass is greener somewhere else. He doesn't go on a lot of dates, that I'm the first person he's been on dates with since June and that he had a few hook ups but that's all, and it was before meeting me, he also said that he starts to appreciate me and want to do many things with me (but still didn't plan anything yet...). But he said that he's been using Tinder for a long time and that's one of his habit, he goes on it like me when I watch YouTube but isn't looking for anything.

I told him it makes me feel uncomfortable and for me , I need to feel safe and that I can trust him, even if we're not together yet I want to get to know him more. He said that for him exclusivity and commitment takes time, he really needs to be sure about the person and then, once he takes that decision, he sticks to it (he's been in long term relationships before - the last one ended a year ago). And he said he can't give me a reply yet about that but will think about it. For me, one month is enough to , at least , know if you want to continue to see someone or not.

He also always said we're going to have diner at his place and he will cook, will go to exhibitions,.. but we didn't do it so far. I'm kinda tired of this situation where there's no trust on my side. My vision is that he can try with me and if it doesn't work out, he can go back on the apps later. I know from my friend that he said on the sex app to someone (I saw), that he's ""up for everything and he can host"". I find it disrespectful.

I decided to stop texting him, we were supposed to have a diner with my friend on Sunday but I won't text him about that. I don't know if he's going to talk to me again or not (we only text every 3-4 days, and now I'm more the one who engage it). If he doesn't text me, I'd let him go on don't say anything. But in the case he texts me, do you think it's worth explaining him how I feel and that if nothing change, for me I can't continue seeing him. I can respect his rhythm but I think he can also respect my limits about not hooking up everywhere. And my last question is do you think that he can be serious ?

When I checked the browser it said “re-open closed tabs” and I selected yes, and a conversation she was having with a friend of hers popped up. It really only grabbed my attention because I saw the words “big dick. energy” and my wife asking what it meant. 

I shouldnt of but I read through it a little and saw her friend sort of teasing her for being a “one hit wonder” aka only slept with one person her entire life. 

I asked her about it later and she turned bright pink. Shes a horrible liar and started stuttering and fixing her hair, and admitted that since I didn’t ask for details so she let me carry on with my assumptions and she didn’t tell that she hadn’t been with anyone else before. 

By assumptions, she had an ex boyfriend that was obsessive. Called every month years after they had broken up, sent emails etc. 

The time we had sex was after a few months of dating and on a out of town trip, so I asked where she got her “skills” from because she’s by no means a starfish in bed. A very fun opposite of that. She shrugged and said she wasn’t having sex but she did figure out her own body pretty early on.

Our conversations aren't very long extremely friendly nothing more but yet he can't speak to me when other people are there he won't even call me on the phone and we used to talk for hours before he met her and once we talked all night. But now nothing and when I tell him I miss talking on the phone even if it's just for a half an hour once a week and he puts me on speaker, his fiance joins the conversation, and we all talk I would be more than happy/ would not mind that at all. 

He'll see that and say maybe one day we can. Maybe one day when my fiance is gone for a girls night out we can talk. He also said maybe one day you can meet her. I mean what's with the maybe wouldn't you want your friend meeting your fiance and wouldnt your fiance want to meet them too? I don't get it. Like he told me that she knows we speak and is okay with it so what's with all the conversations when no one is there and not when they're in the room? He even said if she picked up the phone and saw our conversations she wouldn't have a problem so make it make sense to me. 

On top of that he said he talks to me just as much as his fiance that I'm an amazing friend and he really loves talking to me he trusts me and we can share things as friends. But something I don't get about that is how can you talk to me as much as your fiance when I don't live with you 24/7 like her? He also said he talks to me more than he talks to his other friends and if that's the case he must talk to his friends barely at all because he talks to me very little. So I just really miss my friend or should I say who he was before he got into this relationship and how much we used to talk. Now of course I have other people I talk to and have my time with them. 

But I'm not as close to them as I am with him or used to be. Also before anyone says wait until you get into a relationship you might see things differently I am an ace and don't think I'll ever find anybody who would want to spend the rest of their life with me I mean that'd be a f***ing miracle if it happened and I'm not that lucky. So what say you all am I a secret friend? Is what hes doing okay, normal and if you were in a relationship would you be talking to a friend this privately? (If that's even the right way to describe it.)  Even if it is friendly conversation and nothing more. 

And last but certainly not least there are so many things I want to say to him and get off my chest but I don't know if that would be okay to do because he's in a relationship and I don't want to cause issues so I keep it to myself and don't bother him unless he messages me first and if he stops talking I stop talking.

But then she messaged him again saying that she wants to know I’m okay and She’ll always care and love me. Sooooo I reached out and asked why she kept reaching out to my friend. Then she told me she wanted to know I was safe and needed to know I was okay but then asked a question why my friend followed her (didn’t tell him or ask him to) so then I just said okay to which she replied “you never had any intention of moving here. You never wanted to and it was obvious” which is far from the truth.

I am 21, and I am starting to pursue my second degree program, while my boyfriend is 23, and is not yet halfway done with university. He always blames it in the school that he belongs in, and how he does not feel the need to grow being part of the institution where he is in. When we were new in the relationship, he promised that he would do his best in school. I guess that changed.

Our relationship was fun at first, since we got to talk about a lot of things together. After three years into the relationship tho, all I have been feeling is boredom, as if we are not aligned on the level of thinking. I have been working really hard to achieve my goals one-by-one, while he gets lazy about attending one class. When I share to him cool stuff about a theory I loved and learned, he tries to put aside the topic, saying that he is too dumb to process what I was explaining.

Aside from those things though, I would say that he is unlike any guy. He treats me well. I really would like him to be part of my future, but a small part of me says that I have outgrown him.

I’ve been struggling with mental health issues and have caught him on some lighter lies lately (ie, said he would quit smoking, had been doing it behind my back until I caught him, lied about his whereabouts etc). When I’ve seen these lies, I “split” and get really emotional and really rely on his reassurance, something that hasn’t happened in my prior relationships. Needless to say I’m very insecure in the whether this will last. 

Over the past month, he has been really distant and giving up, saying things like he doesn’t love me, can’t guarantee he will be there for me when I need him even said he wouldn’t cry if I died. He used to be so sweet and communicative, now he’s doing everything as he wants with no regard for my feelings.

I am always the one trying and don’t know how to convince him to. He puts me dead last in everything.
