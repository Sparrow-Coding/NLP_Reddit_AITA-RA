**Preface**
August 2020. The heart of the pandemic. Alone. soul crushingly alone. I am essential at my job, but work in isolation. I had never watched the show, but Avatar the last Airbender became a great comfort to me, sprinkled lightly with ancient Chinese proverbial wisdom, I watched the show perhaps 7 or 8 times.

At this point in my life I’m a student, but on an extended break. I made a grave mistake of “waiting” for my ex in college and messed around at community. I took classes I didn’t need, because I thought we would go to Uni together. This is my Cardinal Sin #1: waiting for others, because I’m afraid of getting left behind. I was too late to sign up for classes, and I had managed to convince myself that there was no point in this pandemic. I think it was at this point I mistook peace for stagnation. I was stuck. 

All in all, I probably would’ve emerged from all this okay, as the pandemic did in fact resolve itself. At the time, I did not think it would. About 3 months after the break up with my ex, around this same time I made a series of choices. I suppose you could call them bad, but I struggle with that a good deal. I want to call them human choices. I think we all want to feel loved and want to feel affection and warmth of being with another human being, and what’s more, I think we all deserve to. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, with two happy people being affectionate with one another, and having sex or being intimate outside marriage. For some people, that may sound like “yeah what a concept?” But for me, this was not only a recent understanding, but very difficult to grasp and understand, because of my upbringing. I thought for the longest time this idea would send me to hell. My distant past is another story, but that stories not important right now. I’m telling the story of my lack of ability to form a healthy relationship; because I want one more than anything right now. Even typing that is making me realize I’m somewhat out of my mind. Perhaps I need to focus more on other aspects of my life now, but I can’t help but feel this sense of urgency, that something is passing me by right now that will soon be gone forever. And I do not know how to remove this feeling of dread, of racing against the clock. I’m in my mid 20s and my best friend and his gf are well on their way to marriage and settling down for good. I envy them terribly. I have no one. I felt this way then, and I still do now, even today. 

 So I started working out a lot. I was trying to take pictures of myself, and use dating apps. I also starting hitting up girls I used to know. I landed on one girl that was an old coworker. We had a history, and one that’s really key to this whole story. We’re going to have to go back in time.

**Part 1**
2017: I am 19, so naturally, I’m pretty dumb, or at least somehow more so than now. I’m struggling with trust issues with my girlfriend I met at my job at the time, and go through her phone. It turns out my intuitions are correct, and she’s cheating on me and talking to another guy, who I approach and he confirms. I confront her, and she denies it and bawls. We break up for about a week or so. This was super awkward, because by this point we were doing everything together. We took the same classes this semester at community, and our job schedules were almost the same. She ended up quitting from our job, and avoiding me at school. she also struggled immensely with depression, and she tells me she might kill herself if we don’t get back together. Now, I know my brain has developed, because today I see that I never should have gotten back with her after she said that to me. But I’m 19, and pretty dumb, so I did. But I didn’t forget what she did. At this point, I started harboring a lot of resentment for my significant other, despite us dating. Which actually makes no sense in real life, but my parents did it, so it seemed normal to me. It seemed normal to me to stay with someone you hated because that’s what my parent’s parents and their church made them do. I thought it was what I had to do. I thought I was “doing the right thing” staying with her. 

I met another girl at my job almost immediately after all this happened. It felt too perfectly timed, like a movie script. I thought she was cute and I could tell she liked me. And I liked her. We started hanging out. A lot. At this point, my life becomes a good bit like this older video game called Catherine, and my best friend points it out. In fact, he even forced me to play the game. If you’ve never played the game, the protagonist is forced to choose between a long time girlfriend and a new girl he just met. Catherine, with a C, is the new girl, a bubbly fun, wild personality that drags the protagonist along through the story and ends up being a succubus. The old girlfriend’s name is Katherine, with a K, a down to earth, moody girl that’s a bit depressing and attached, and wants the protagonist to settle down and marry her already. The choices you make through the game end up dictating which one you marry.

My friend makes me play the game, and, I pick Catherine. And then I did the same thing in real life. I confessed that I liked her, and we ended up having a one night stand. At this point I get immense guilt. I never necessarily meant to get revenge by fucking someone else, but I did, I made the choices I made and I had to bed with them. I wanted to break up with my Katherine, and make it official with my Catherine. After this however, she tells me that she’s actually already dating someone, and she also tells me that she never wants to marry or settle down. She doesn't believe in marriage, and that she wants to move to another country for school soon anyways. 

All of this information shouldn’t have been devastating as it was. She had already painted a pretty grim picture of her home life and her personal situation. Her parents were separated and were brutally abusive to one another when she remembered them together. She had told me about the colleges she was applying to, but honestly, I didn’t think about it, I was too enthralled. 

I swallowed the pill, and I told her if she ever changed her mind, I would be waiting. We kissed one last time, and then nothing else ever happened between us other than a very occasional “hey what’s up, not much you?” Conversation. For now. 

Plagued with guilt, I continue on a distant relationship with my Katherine for another few months, until I simply couldn’t take it anymore. I told her the truth, and i suggested we go our separate ways. It was at this point that the worst possible thing happened; not only did she not break up with me, she begged me to stay with her. 

Now the most toxic relationship imaginable where I basically word for word mimic my verbally abusive father plays out for the next 2 years. I belittle her constantly, and she takes it because she’s so passive by nature. She had a good heart, and while I can never say it’s a good idea we ever date again, the only thing I wish I could do is apologize to her properly for how I treated her. Even 2 years of treating someone the way my father treats my mother is not something anyone deserves. I also can’t emphasize enough how much we should have not been dating at this time. We were just both extremely insecure and afraid of being alone. I had also gotten accepted to a semi prestigious 4 year school, but turned down the offer because she was struggling to pass algebra. I was basically doing her homework for her so she could pass because i thought we had to stay together. I missed a really important milestone and I’m honestly still reeling from how awful of a choice that was, and I still feel like I’m behind today. I’m in my mid 20s now, and still working on my bachelors because of those choices I made. Having to pay for all my schooling out of pocket on my own has always made this even harder, but my parents could never afford it, so I don’t fault them. 

**Part 2**
Fast forward back to 2020: I tell my Catherine I’m single again. We meet at the mall, and there’s no way around the fact that she’s gained weight and let herself go. It turns out she’s actually fallen on hard times and was doing hard drugs like coke and couch surfing, and getting black out drunk every night. but she’s really good at only explaining the good things happening in her life, and maintaining a happy, cheerful exterior for the world. it’s somewhat frightening once you’re able to see through it, which took me a long time. I couldn’t see it yet though, and I figure it’s just life. I’m still deeply attracted to her. She comes back with me to my place after a few drinks and catching up and we almost immediately start having lots of amazing sex. She stayed over for almost a week and every single day of that week was hours of going at it like rabbits. Without the guilt of my ex looming, I felt like a king and I fell madly, deeply in love with her.

She ended up not going to another school and she had admitted to me that she moved back in with her parents and was doing online classes. I suggested she move in with me, but she declined, saying she’d burden me. This confused me a good bit. I had a really spacious apartment, it’s a suburb that sprawls kinda towards the middle of nowhere, and I had plenty of space, an extra closet, and told her she could either stay for free or just pay what rent she could. 

But she slowly pushed me away again. This time, I pushed back. I thought there was something wrong with me. I couldn’t figure out why I was missing something. I was confused, and hurt, but the harder I pushed, the harder she would put up the walls, and not respond. So once again, I let her go. “I’m not sure if I did something wrong, but if you need anything I’m here.”

Until,

11pm a month later;

“Heyyyyy”

She’s absolutely hammered and she wants me to bring her a pizza. I used to work for a Pizza Hut for a bit at community, and she says she “wants the cute delivery boy only 😜” I think she just wants to catch up, but the minute I open the door she’s naked. We start making out and are all over each other almost immediately. I pass out, cuz my job has me up very early, and when I wake up she’s made me breakfast. It’s a beautiful scene, with a topless beautiful girl bringing me a plate of eggs, but I’m also confused. Around her room is pictures of her and what I thought was her ex. 

I didn’t know a lot of her ex, but what I did know was things I didn’t like. He was a drug dealer, from a hyper rich family, 7 figure+ affluent home, and I envied his wealth. I grew up in a trailer park, and worked honest jobs my whole life to scrape together college money, and thought it was dumb for someone from such immense wealth to still think they need to make more money through immoral means. 

When questioned she dismissed it very off handedly “ohhh yea I need to reframe these.” 

Shortly after this, she also started introducing me to weed and psychedelics. Now, I should add, I don’t think weed is an addictive drug naturally. But I do think it’s possible for someone with an addictive personality, like myself, to become addicted to a feeling that’s brought on by a chemical like THC, and that’s exactly what I became; addicted to the feeling. There was one night that we both did shrooms and she told me to impregnate her during sex, and I felt like my soul touched her soul. Our orgasms on psychedelics were so intense that it was a feeling I was addicted to capturing. I wanted this girl to have my children. I wanted to give us a home and fuck and raise our kids and have our happily ever after. 

But she couldn’t see it. She couldn’t see what I saw. She kept taking plan B. I suggested one time she didn’t, half joking. she slapped me. It stung. Not physically. But in my heart. I thought maybe she thought I wasn’t committed. So I took her to a beach and proposed. She said yes at the time. But later she basically explained, “I can’t ever marry in the sense that you think.” She still didn’t want kids. I was fine with no piece of paper. I didn’t care. I just wanted us to move in together. Maybe kids someday. When we’re ready. 

She thought I wanted her to give up on her dreams, her career aspirations. That was never the case. I respected her career dreams a lot and told her that often. But she saw my ideas of her going through motherhood as an attack on her ability to have a fulfilling career, which was more important to her than anything, coming from where she came from. 

I became paranoid, either from personality traits or too much weed and psychedelics, or a bad cocktail. I started going through her messages in her phone with her ex. I always thought I wasn’t good enough. I thought I was the problem. She caught me. We fought. Bad. Kicked me out. Blocked. 

Silence.

“I’m so scared”

She starts texting me from a friends place. took too much acid she says. She asks me to come get her. I come pick her up, but she doesnt look like she’s that intoxicated.

(TLDR START)
“Will you hold me again?” 

I wake up next to her after not talking for months. 

I do this again.. several more times. It’s now become a pattern. We don’t talk for months. She hits me up. We have sex and do drugs together. But we always end up with a cataclysmic fight that causes us to block one another and remember why this is never going to work. Because we just don’t want the same thing. 

But it sucks. So much. Because I really truly did love her and wanted to be the father of her children. It hurts in a way that is so immense and powerful, I can hardly put it into words. It’s probably just the weight of my overactive imagination, seeing the imagined life being ripped away, but it feels so real. So painful. When we weren’t fighting or fucking, we always had fun together. Always. Her laughter was what I sought at every moment, and I’d be an absolute goof to see that smile everyday.

But then on other side of the coin, the dark is so dark. It outweighs the good. But I’m lacking conviction, because nostalgia is an evil, painful drug. 

Today, I got the next “hey” text. 

And I don’t know what to do.

I know what I should do. I know the cycle needs to end.

My friends are going to probably beat me over the head at this point. My best friend wants to me stop talking to her so bad, but he’s almost given up. My family wants me to move on but..

Im only human. My heart desires this thing that makes no sense to me. This illogical lull that pulls us both together.

She is my drug. One of several that I can’t seem to quit, but I’m trying to desperately. The problem is, I can’t parse anymore if she also has to go.

I live alone now in my 1 bedroom appartment. About 2 months ago, my boyfriend's father passed away. So my bf got 3 bedroom appartment from him. My bf wants me to live there with him. The thing is, he is comfortable about how it looks. I don't wanna sound rude but I hate how it looks right now.


 Everything is old, ugly, not matching. He doesn't want to get rid of that ugly 40 years old living room furniture even when it's outdated and blocking the whole room. I just want to renovate it so it will look pretty and feel like our home. He wanted to put our bed to the living room because bedroom is full of crap he doesn't want to throw away. We still sleep on 30 years old sofa that he wants to keep. He throwed away some stuff but it's still not enough. 


I'm trying to be patient and respectfull about it. He said that our compromise will be that I can renovate bedroom where we will sleep but the other things are up to him. But I don't want to live like this. I'm only 24, I don't want to live like 70 years old grandma. On the other hand, I want to live with him. I want to move in bigger place too. I get it that it takes time and money to upgrade your living space but he simply doesn't want to and I'm loosing my mind about it.


He have money from his father too so he can renovate it if he want. I showed him some furniture online that would match the vibe of the appartment and I told him what old furniture would look good if he wants to keep something. He told me once that I can buy some furniture too. But that's ridiculous because it's his place and if we broke up I would't take anything with me besides my things obviously. Yesterday, his friend came to visit him and even he told him to throw almost everything away. My bf told him no and that if I didn't move there he would't change a single thing.

Before we were officially together he went on holidays with his friends. There, was a girl at the same bar as him and a few days later she uploaded a tik tok, where she was filming him, with the caption "" Please, find who he is"". His friends saw it and tagged him. She added him on insta and messaged him. I saw the tik tok and when i asked him about it he said that she was messaging him but he was not interested at all and she lives far away(10h drive). I let it go since we were just starting to know each other. Fast forward to now, 5 months into the relationship and she uploaded another tik tok (with summer memories) where between other video she added the same video of him saying ""when we were searching to find who he was"". I saw it on my fyp and got mad. She definitely doesn't know that he is in a relationship, so asked him what's going on. He said that he doesn't talk to her and she just uploaded it without him knowing. Then i kindly asked him to delete her. I know it's not appropriate for me to ask that from my partner but it's a matter of respect to our relationship. (We haven't uploaded any pictures together since we're both not really active on social media.) He said he would delete her. He never did. I aksed him again. He never did. He, also, has liked some pictures that she's uploaded in the last few weeks. Now I'm mad. Why is it so difficult for him to delete a girl he doesn't even know in person? My friends tell me not to stress too much about it and that he probably felt flattered that a girl was searching for him. An ego boost. 
He, also, follows daily insta models. But not the very famous ones. Local girls with 5-10k followers. I told him that it bothers me and if he added one or two i would be okay but daily just seems too much. He said its nothing and he just looks, but he will try and stop following them. He did reduce it but still adds 2-3 girls a week. They don't follow him back. Only one model did.
I think he likes the attention and feeling wanted. I know i might sound kinda controlling but I'm just honest with my feelings. He just seems to brush everything off like it's nothing. If he talks to her, that's cheating to me.

We have been living together for the past 5 years.  
I have not been the best partner at times and she wasn't really there for me many times, but we got through most of it. We say we love each other very rarely and there is barely any affection between us. I would need it, but whenever I ask, she shuts me down.  


From the start we have had troubles being intimate.  I wasn't enough for her needs and she wasn't really open to try anything to change the outcome of our intimate sessions. About a year and half into our relationship intimacy faded, we barely have sex once or twice a month or for even longer. I still have the desire even after 6 years, but she does not at all. This has bothered me quite profoundly for years now.   


About two years ago we were driving home and she was in the passenger seat very drunk. This barely happened throughout the years and I wasn't bothered, but she confessed to something that had me stunned. She said she thinks she might be asexual, that she has no desire to have sex, like at all. She sometimes sleeps with me, so I stop nagging her.  The next day I didn't bring this up and didn't bring it up for a whole year, waiting for her to come clean. She never remembered what she said at that moment. About a year later we had a fight and I mentioned what she said. She was surprised about this and told her when she told me this. She says this might be true, that she feels like it is the case that she is asexual, but that doesn't matter. I said it does, because I need it, but she didn't care and argued that our relationship works well because we do not let the lack of sex to ruin it. I have kept everything to me and just accepted this, but I cannot really go on. This has never come up since that fight.

For other reasons among this one, I have battled depression for a few years, went to therapy but didn't really work out. I didn't click with the therapist and based on what I have discussed with my partner she said the therapist was not worth it, because they did not give good advice or weren't helpful. After about 6 months of therapy I never returned or found another therapist.  


I can't say that I deeply love her, I do care for her and our relationship has become something familiar and comfortable but I am unhappy, very much so, at the same time. She considers everything is fine and she is proud that our relationship lasted while many in our friends circle have not the past few years. I am silent in my suffering and every time we have a fight I want to end all this, but I just can't muster the courage to say it out loud. I am afraid of the consequences, of being alone and that I will hurt both of us. I am also not sure it would be the best decision.

I would love to be a friend of hers. I help her get better and not think about thing’s so negatively but her family has deeply rooted some stuff in her and she doesn’t see it. She’s a good person and I love her. I don’t know how to break up with her. Currently she has apologized to me many times about talking about my friend like that and she doesn’t let go.

We have both stopped talking to this girl since earlier this year but he still brings her up when I don’t mention her at all. Is his hate for her actually underlying attraction or am I jealous and concerned based on previous trauma? 

I had a roommate with whom I fell out with for multiple reasons including she wasn’t really my friend, disrespectful to my personal things and jealous of my boyfriends relationship with me while dating his best friend. I stopped speaking to this girl in February and my boyfriend confessed to me that he hated her. She teased him a lot (her way of flirting). I caught on early that she liked him bc of my intuition and then she exposed herself when she compared her relationship to mine saying hers was better bc of something romantic her bf did. My boyfriend told me he mentioned how weird she was to his coworker and his coworker came to the conclusion she liked him too. I didn’t like this bc why mention her to ur coworker but I let it go and didn’t say anything. Anyways that “friendship” has seriously traumatized me because before we met our boyfriends we spoke and hooked up with the same guy. It’s a messy situation but in short. She spoke to two guys at a time which they found out and I made a connection with one of them (stupid but I wasn’t looking for love) bc she said she didn’t care about the guy. Then one night we hung out alone, he talked a lot of crap about her and continuously kept asking about her to get me to talk shit and then goes on the next day and hooks up her. She claims she didn’t know but saw us talking and never thought to ask until after she hooks up with him. I should’ve known she wasn’t my friend right there but I didn’t. Afterwards she’s still took special interest in the men I’ve talked to and eventually we stopped talking.

Months later, my boyfriend still brings her up even when I don’t mention her at all. I’d like to put that in the past. But we’ll be chatting and the topic makes him remember something that reminded him of her and says he hates her, she’s insane, she’s annoying etc. He brought her up three times in the past two months. One time I got mad bc it’s weird he has so much hate for her and they’ve interacted 5 times. He in return got upset with me for even being mad over such thing bc he does not want this girl and doesn’t like her at all. Next time on our date night, I say something that reminds him of an tease she gave him that he was offended at and he says “see girls like that I would shoot myself if I had to be around her.”

I engaged him by talking crap about her myself but it rubbed me the wrong way bc why are u still bringing this girl up after we haven’t spoken to her in months. My jealousy caused me to flip out on him and accuse him of being attracted to her which he got defensive and angry towards her. He said he finds her ugly and a goblin and I need to stop saying why is she on his mind when she’s not. But I can’t understand why someone who’s supposed to be unimportant to us is still being mentioned. I feel like when men really hate a woman but talk about them, they’re secretly attracted to them or want them. Am I basing this off trauma? He hasn’t reached out to me and I don’t know if my accusation and jealous is going to ruin my relationship. Or if he’s in the wrong and I shouldn’t let up.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7621679,public,self,Why does my bf keep mentioning a girl I hate although we’ve stopped talking months ago?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2ne8x/why_does_my_bf_keep_mentioning_a_girl_i_hate/,all_ads,6,,,,,

As the title says I don’t know how I can communicate any negative feedback to my girlfriend. For context this is the 1st long term - longer than 3 years - relationship I’ve ever had and because I don’t want to burden any of my friends or family with this question - as they all have met my girlfriend - I decided to turn to Reddit. 

My girlfriend and I have had a rock solid relationship since the jump however, once she finally unrepressed some of her childhood trauma (neglect) that her caretakers gave her, a few months ago she’s changed in quite a few ways. Primarily her love language has dramatically changed.  We were both very physical with our show of affection we had tons of sex and make out sessions anywhere and everywhere we could that essentially froze to a dead stop with us having essentially no physical love since she unrepressed. She claims she’ll go to therapy for it but keeps putting it off and the one time she did have someone to meet with her regarding her mental health she blew it off. 

Obviously, I have made attempts at trying to talk to her about what’s in her best interests, but anytime I suggest she needs to make a change in her life she almost always emotionally shuts down. She does this by crying and doomscrolls on Twitter until she feels better. If I bring the subject back up she goes right back to crying and scrolling until I give up. I have even brought up that escaping into your phone when you feel like you are about to or in the process of receiving negative feedback is very unhealthy she shuts down the same way. 

Now at the beginning of the relationship she never did this only after she realized what trauma she went through as a kid so I have tried my best to listen and understand what she has been going through during this time. However it’s been very hard on me as well during this time as I mentioned earlier my love language is very physical but she hasn’t kissed me - or done anything further with - me for over 5 months and it’s making me severely worry if this will be my new normal now for this relationship. As my view of myself worth has greatly diminished because of this problem to the point where I am seriously considering therapy for myself now that I know how to do it all when I tried setting her up for it all. 

However in the end I still love her so much I’m quite the introvert and she has been breaking me out of my shell and during the earlier stages of our relationship. She has been my light in this this dark world I just hope she can get better for for her sake and for the sake of our  relationship. I just need some help on how to communicate and suggest things without her shutting down. I would greatly appreciate any advice given thank you.

I just want to hear other peoples experiences or maybe some advice. I really want it to work out with him. 

My partner and I have begin dating right after we both got out of relationships. I was broken up with because my ex did not want to hurt me. He broke up with his ex because he didn’t know if he loved her anymore. He immediately after fell in love with me and wanted to be with me which I said I don’t have feelings in return but I did mention I was willing to test the waters. He pursued for 2 weeks and I said I wanted to date. I did warn him I wasn’t over my ex and he said that was okay. He told me he was over his but I knew that was a lie because I knew the pattern for the people who initiate the breakup.

He ends up saying he misses her and I totally expect it, but I did not feel hurt so I just told him I’d be there for him. I saw us as rebounds and nothing more. 3 months in and we actually started becoming more serious but then he breaks it off saying maybe he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was obviously sad but I let him go, 5 hours later he wanted me back telling me he just needs to throw away the past, which I did not understand.

Another month passes by and he breaks up with me again, telling me he feels bad because he was confused with his emotions between my his ex and me. I tried to beg him to stay but he told me he was numb and didn’t want to hurt me. I ignored him until he finally talked to me a day after about not knowing what he wanted. I did not influence his choice at all on who to choose but He chose me in the end because he believed I was worth it. I told him if he dares leave me once more I wouldn’t take him back and he understood. We had a talk on what happened, to sum it up, he did not understand the concepts of emotions and didn’t want me to get caught up in the hell fire, he told me he never got to feel his emotions and being with me made him scared because I listened to how he felt. 

He has done nothing wrong after that. He told me he was stupid and held himself accountable every chance he got. He told me he would get therapy (he never did because insurance problems). So he researched ways to become a better boyfriend for me. He was honest and transparent with everything he felt, when he though about her he would tell me but he would say “the past still lingers but I know I want you.” 

He never thinks about her anymore and when brought up he would reassure me that he hasn’t thought about her for a long time because she wasn’t worth it at all. He does everything for me and whenever I cry or accuse him, he’d just take it because he knew I was hurting from it. I always apologize right after though.

It was 2 years since but I still suffer the affects of this now, the feelings just come in intervals and I just hate this gutting inside me. He told me hes patient and will wait as long as he can, constantly reassuring me. I can’t trust him but I want to, I just feel worthless sometimes, constantly comparing myself to her. He will always reassure me that I’m perfect but I just can’t help but not trust it. I also have extremely bad mental health and I currently take medication for it. I blame my current situation on that too. I want to trust him, he means so much to me and I don’t want us to end but I just get scared of us breaking up and I don’t trust that’ll he won’t leave me like that again.

I (M19) started dating this girl (F18) a little more than a month ago. She’s such an amazing person and we have so much in common. when we hangout and go on dates we have long and deep convos and she always talks to me about her plans for future dates and stuff, we’re also past the ‘just talking’ stage you could say we’re official.

I once sent her a text in the late afternoon saying: “hey we didn’t speak all day I assume it’s because you are busy or maybe your going through something.” (she deals with a lot of depression &amp; anxiety) so she replied that she was depressed all day and was emotionally tired and then she asked me how my day was and all that. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said no, that all she needed was some space and I respected that and gave her the space she needed anytime. But I still don’t know what I can do I always tell her that I’m always there for everything she needs if she wants to talk or laugh or cry or whatever.

My brother(24) and his ex-wife(22) were married for around 4 years before all of this started. About 1 year ago I(18M) was hanging out with my brother and his wife (who were married at the time) and a couple of other friends. We were all at my brothers house at around 10pm. Later that night my brothers ex-wife started trying to hold my hand and hug me and stuff like that. I immediately told my brother what was happening and he saw it happen as well. He then say something along the lines of “no it’s ok…let her…go ahead…”
I didn’t, and kept my distance because I thought it was kind of weird.

The night was ending and everyone had went home except for me, my brother and his wife. She really wanted to hangout with me and go somewhere. It was about 1 am. I told her no and she kept bothering me and annoying me until I finally said sure. I was annoyed and she wouldn’t take no for an answer. She then went and asked my brother if me and her could go somewhere and hangout, I was in the room and heard him say yes and that it is ok. 

We drove around for a little while and talked. She said that she wants me and she thinks I’m cute and other things along those lines. She said it was my brothers idea for his wife to have another relationship with someone. I don’t know why or why me, and have never asked in depth about it. I took her home and she wanted a kiss but I was a little wielded out so I left. 

The next night we drove around and hung out, with my brothers permission. She wanted to kiss me and I was really hesitant and nervous. but we eventually kissed and made out for a while. We went back to her and my brothers house and I started cuddling on the couch with her. My brother woke up and saw us. I asked if it was ok and he said yes. After a little bit me and his wife had sex. 

My brothers wife and I have kept this relationship for over a year and we have really became attached to each other. We love each other a lot and have kept this secret relationship from both of our family’s and friends. 

There has been no intimacy between my brother and I involving threesomes or anything at all. Completely separate relationships. This has not seemed to affect my relationship with my brother at all until…

My brother and his wife got a divorce due to alcoholism problems with him. But I have still been seeing his ex-wife. And he is not happy about it and doesn’t think its okay. I understand why, but it’s really hard for us to break up after being together for that amount of time. She has recently told me that she doesn’t want our relationship to be a secret anymore and she wants to be a real couple. but I am not comfortable with it, and she is going to break up with me if I don’t.

Context: I (19 M) have been thinking of getting my mom (42 F) out of my life. My parents are divorced and have made new families now.
When I was 16, I went through some gender identity issues, and I thought I was trans. I was always very very secret about personal stuff, and afraid of bringing up that kind of topics with my mom and dad. However, with my friends' encouragements, I decided to come out to my mom; The following months were a disaster.

She secretly set up parental controls on my phone number, and ended up finding conversations I had with people I met online, nsfw conversations to be precise. The results were immediate: She cancelled the internship I had at my school so I would have to stay at home, took my phone, and went through everything, including discord conversations (sfw and nsfw) and other social media. She read out all my text messages to me, and I had to tell her exactly who it was I was texting and why. I felt completely naked, vulnerable, and it scarred me with this fear of being honest with my mom ever again. After that, I was stuck using a dumbphone for a while, until around 3 months later, she let me come back to the internship. I didn't know if she was still spying on me, I was paranoid about having a private life again; Not to mention that the time I had to spend at home with so much less contact with my friends was probably my lowest point in life. I eventually ended up not feeling trans anymore, as I grew and understood myself better, but the sheer shock of all that happened might also have played a role in that.

Fast-forward years later to a few months ago. I moved out at 18, but kept contact, and kept coming for the holidays, as I was (and partly am) still scared of confronting her, fearing she would emotionally manipulate me, villainize me, make me feel horrible. After I turned 19, I came out to her as gay, which is something I know for sure, having been in a serious relationship once, and multiple short term relationships, beyond the fact I simply cannot envision a relationship with a girl.
I tried to place my trust in her again. I came out as if everything would be alright. And it seemed so at first, until the evening where she wanted to talk more, and got into privacy invasive questions again. I tried to circumvent them, she got pushy about why I didn't try having sex with a girl and that I should do that before saying i'm gay, and I did my best to avoid conflict, but the conversation turned to sour as time went on, and she started telling me about how she doesn't think any kid should be let out of the house before 20, how she regrets letting me go, how she's gonna keep my brother and sister (3 M and 7 F) at home longer and keep them away from the internet as she still thinks it's the reason i'm ""this way"". She had already come to my house without telling me in advance before, which was probably one of the most stressful moments i had since moving out; she said she would do it again too.

Despite all that, for her sake, i've been pretending to be happy around her for a long time. Because I was afraid of what she would do if I told her the truth of what I think of her, because even though she has done all this I still don't want to make her sad, because maybe I'm making a big deal out of something that should be in the past by now. But as the topic of holidays is brought up with Christmas coming, and I tell her I want to go with my dad, she gets angry, saying it'a ""her turn"", and have been to my dad's for three years in a row. I would have thought she would have maybe understood the message that I don't want to spend that time with her, but maybe she is too dense for that... So to calm her down, i told her i'd be coming at the beginning of the holidays, and promised she would have the next Christmas. But now, just the thought of having to go there again after what happened with my coming out just... Makes me sick.

That's why I want to be honest with her, tell her I stopped looking up to her as my mom years ago, tell her i've been forcing myself to be in her company, to smile in her company, and that I simply don't want to see her again.
My plan is to ask my dad for support, as I know he will side with me (he didn't divorce my mom for nothing), and then call or send a message to my mom explaing all this. But what do you all think I should do, if it's even right for me to act?

I have a girlfriend (23F) who's back at home and working, who I've been with for two years.

I moved away in September (coming back in April), and since then we've been texting through the day and usually calling twice a day (when we wake up and when we go to sleep). I love my girlfriend, truly, I fantasize about marrying her, but the constant contact is starting to get a bit much and I've caught myself ignoring her messages a few times or lying about being busy so that I don't have to call her.

I hate that this is how I feel, because I know how much she misses me and I should want to spend more time with her, but I've always been really independent and I like my alone time and this feels extreme. I want to bring it up with her and talk about it, but she has some pretty intense trauma from past relationships where her partners rejected her and stopped wanting to spend time with her and the last thing I want is to make her feel like I'm doing the same. I know that if I try and keep this up for much longer I'm going to get burned out and frustrated, but I don't know how to broach the subject with her without upsetting and triggering her.

So once I hit that 2nd week I know if I really have romantic feelings for someone. 

And I utterly adore him. I've made him several small gifts, drawn him several pictures, etc etc. He isn't on my mind 24/7 because life gets in the way but if I had absolutely no responsibilities and would just lay here in bed he'd be all I thought about. 

This man - has me to the point where I will willingly one day have his children. Before he and I started dating it was unfathomable. I'd rather have eaten glass than have a baby. But if he was there I would. 

I'd marry him today if he asked.

He and I are basically the same person in two separate bodies. From our birth months to our favorite movie genre. We understand eachother and we're open and honest.

I'd live for this man if he asked me to. Id die for him if he was in danger. I'd happily spend the rest of my days with him and never be bored.

So i M(18) had to re-do my grade 10 year in High school due to having to help my parents run and pack up there 3 business in 2020 with covids lockdown (that were in high risk due to being in the entertainment and tourism sector).

And this is how i met my now GF(17). She was this amazingly kind hearted girl that always wanted to help everyone around her. Even tho it was obvious she was used by them. Never the less we started talking for 6 months in 2021 (mostly over message) and started going out in February 2022. 

Threwout this entire time we were mostly around family, my friends or just us 2. She did not have any friends.(she cut them of for being toxic)  so i never met the type of people she was interested in as friends.  
Up until 3 months into our relationship, she met this really amazing girl. They started being friends and she hangout with her new friends group(the rest boys) all 17. Which made me relieved because my group was the nerdy type and not really her type (she was still kind and interested in our nerd talk) 

Dropping the bomb. These friends were the drunk, smoking, cheating and overall 'bad boy' type of group in most schools.
 Which bothered me a bit because i came from a strong and well mannered background. My dad and aunt being the only smokers and drinkers. 

This group(2 boys in particular) being the reason of alot of arguments about jealousy and  trustworthyness. Due to my secrets and opinions getting out who i only trusted my GF with (sourcing back to these 2 boys) the one liking and hitting on her and GF obviously denying it. Until 2 weeks later she got furious and telling her sister just for her sister to take my side. And then her mom...brother... Other friends in this same group all agreeing to my accusations.

Her friend cheated on her bf with one of these same 2. And then having to leave this group to save her 3 year relationship. Them switching to a friend group(1 other guy) where he had scammed and cheated on some of my personal friends. 

A week of her accusing me of just being jealous. This 1 guy in the same span of 2 weeks cheated on his girl. Grabbed and lashed out on my GF and friend (3 times even tho i warned her this would happen and to stay away)over acting caringly towards him.

Me threatening to leave her, she talked less to him(more to friend) 
After a 2 months of pure arguing about her friends. She made friends with... I kid you not a 16 year old  who got kicked out of school and his house over weed selling and using on school grounds(weed is illegal in our entire city) 


I am well assured this is her choice of friends. And i im tired of arguing and warning just to be ignored and see this the exact thing happens and having to comfort her.
I never had controlling or jealousy issues in past relationships and im known to be nice and happy person. But i dont even find myself wanting to go outside my bedroom, to friends or even study for my year end.

We can't get enough of each other at the office, always joking and laughing together. We have some deep heart to heart chats about things too in between the fun. I'm pretty sure a lot of our colleagues think we are dating (a couple have said it to me, but others I just know are thinking about it or have made suggestive comments). 


In the past we've been through phases of her calling me late at night, chatting away until the early hours of the morning. This stopped after she was going through a very rough time and then shortly after she started dating someone. She isn't dating anymore and is through the very rough patch, however things haven't picked back up for us outside of work. She pretty much never messages anymore and never calls me. 


However in work, she's flirty and fun. 
Nothing really seems to be off limits when she's talking to me, all kinds of talk comes up, which honestly a lot of close friends wouldn't even discuss, especially not just colleagues.


To be honest, after being at the office with her quite a bit the last couple of weeks, I can't stop thinking about her. She's been acting in a way that I can only describe as more intimate (in a none sexual way) and close. She's always saying my name, watching my reactions to things (and I don't even see her watching me). She does make sexual remarks too, but manages to somewhat play them down into something more subtle. I lost count of how many times she talked about the size of her boobs and asking if I'd noticed them, though this past week.
I had some crazy dreams about her again last night. My whole body has a tingling feeling today. 


We are so right for each other, but she just doesn't seem to want to explore that. She shows every sign of flirting and being interested, yet at the same time doesn't seem to be interested or at least doesn't want it to show.
I feel like nothing will ever happen between us, but my body is just telling me that's not the way it should be.
We want the same things in life, we have the same weird sense of humour, same opinions and mindsets. 
She's never had a serious relationship, no one can handle her for long. I never get tired of her and her energy. Even colleagues can't handle her at work for long. One of my older colleagues even said that to me, he said, 'No one can handle her, but you can, I see it in the banter between you both'. He asked if we are dating and when I told him no, he asked why not, we should. 


I feel like a different person around her. I can just be me. I think that's what makes colleagues think we are together, as they see a more open and fun side to me when she's there too.


As for being colleagues, that doesn't bother me at all. Maybe it bothers her a bit? Our workplace has hundreds of other issues to worry about than this. There is nothing discouraging relationships and to be honest HR are useless and wouldn't care anyway.

I know when we met she told me a few little white lies about herself, things she didn't think I'd remember, as honestly neither of us thought we'd last as friends longer than a week. Here we are months later, having met in person 3 times, planning to move together when I finish uni. (She's already working)   


The issue is I thought that at this point, we've known eachother for 8 months, and she's still telling me these little lies. I am absolutely in love with her and don't care - I can easily see through them at this point, as I know when she's lying and not, and I can use my head to see when things make sense. For example she showed me something new she purchased last week, supposedly. I thought it was cool and was talking to a mutual today - someone who lives near her- about it. Well she didn't buy it. It's on loan to her instead. I understand she lied because owning it would make her seem cool, and impress me, and technically she does own it, its in her posession, but she mislead me and told me she herself bought it. I asked her about it and she admitted she lied about it. I'm approaching with caution and not confronting her however as her mental health is in the gutter so I can't outright tell her I know she's lying to me.   


The issue here is I grew up in a downright abusive household, I was, as a mid teenager in an abusive relationship for a year and a bit, and I recognise the pattern. But I'm fine with it? I love her so much I'm willing to let her lie to me about everything if it means I can keep her. What do I do? How do I talk to her about this, and get her to stop, without hurting her mental health worse than it already is (I do not want to be responsible for her death!) and how do I tell her I'm alright with the lies as long as she doesn't do it again?

To start off with, I know the age gap is concerning. I am very confident I wasn’t groomed and the age gap was considered during our whole talking stage.

I have been with him for long. I am very in love with him. We discussed things like long term plans and incompatibles early on to ensure it was even worth it to start dating.. but I am now running into a huge issue. He is having a mid-life crisis where he feels like he’s behind compared to his associates.. they are getting married and having children. He keeps bringing it up, not in a pushy way, and I told him that he can’t just change his mind this far in. He’s very trustworthy and a really great partner, he doesn’t nag or beg but he brings up the idea of “stopping birth control” and tries to warm me up the idea.. I just think it’s so selfish. I am not even through college yet. There’s so many things I haven’t done yet. He has eight years ahead of me, he got to live his life happily and now suddenly he feels.. behind? Due to his own actions in life? I can’t say these things straight to his face but I feel so lonely. I tried bringing it up, that I don’t want to settle down in such a young age. I want to have fun in the careless way. I want to go to festivals, I want to have sleepovers with my friends every other week.. the freedom of being young with no real responsibilities.

This is where his manipulative side came out for the first time. He called me selfish and accused me of wanting to “sleep around” when I never mentioned that but apparently to him people who go to festivals are only immoral people. He doesn’t see why I can’t just settle down and have a family with him if I am truly in love with him because me loving him means I would end up having kids with him anyway, which is true. I brought up the idea of parting ways then.

He refused the idea. He started crying, saying he doesn’t want to lose me but I feel like this will just lead to resentment. He wants something now and feels ready, that I want a bit later in life. I feel like he just sees me as a possible incubator but I know it’s not like that.. but then I get second thoughts. What if he only started to date me to get this? Thought he could persuade me into having kids for him? Or is he truly just realising it now that he wants this. I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to break up with me but I feel like we reached a wall.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7621397,public,self,I (20F) am scared of settling down of my long term boyfriend (28M),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2m44z/i_20f_am_scared_of_settling_down_of_my_long_term/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I wasn't looking for anything serious as I was only staying for a few weeks and there's no point looking for a relationship, however open if I potentially meet someone that could develop into something else. 

I match with this guy (25M), we started chatting on instagram and he seemed super interested, a lot of talking going on, him being funny and sending selfies etc. A few days later we went for dinner. What was meant to be a one night stand turned into me thinking this is someone I could potentially like. We seemed to have a LOT in common. We went to my place and had lots of laughs, we didn't have sex but fooled around a bit which I think made it more special. The next day he goes back to his hotel and messages me a few hours later for us to meet. We meet at the beach, go for lunch and then join his friends who were surfing. We spend the whole day together and then around 5pm he drops me home and we agree to meet for dinner because it was his friends bday and that he'll text me. I found him to be a bit distant and acting strange but I shrugged it off. A few hours go by and he hasn't texted me with the dinner informations so I text him and he replies a bit cold, I get a gut feeling something's off, but I go to the dinner anyway since I liked him friends and I was alone on the trip anyway. 

Dinner's finished, he offers me a drive home and I ask him if he wants to spend the night and he agrees. But he doesn't kiss me or barely touches me and when I try to make a move he pulls away, I asked him if something was wrong and he said no and kissed me on the forehead so I just accepted it and go to sleep.

Next morning he's leaving for another country a few days so technically it would be our last day. He gives me a few kisses and cuddles and we say goodbye. I felt sad because I wasn't expecting to feel a connection with him as I usually don't with most people and now I probably won't ever see this guy again. I posted a pic later on on insta and he liked it. And then, after a few days, I posted another one and he didn't like it but I also noticed he wasn't posting any more stories and I went on to my business account (call me psycho if you want) and realised he had blocked me from his stories AND posted a picture I sent him as if it were mine which I found super strange. Why would he block me if he didn't want to be with me anymore? To me, I'm indifferent if I don't like a guy, I'm not gonna go out of my way to hide things from him simply because I don't care about him, so I'm super confused. And I felt a bit hurt as well. I apparently got it all wrong and whenever I feel like I have a connection, it's not only one sided, but the person apparently despises me and I'm still not sure what I've done. 

This year my dating life has been a mess. I can't seem to get at least one person to go on a few dates with let alone develop something and when I start moving on from whatever person, they come back. I've had an ex from EIGHT years ago come back this year and still to this day messages me. I've got guys in my DMs who ghosted me or only ""used"" after I seemingly moved on and even ignore them, yet when I want them, they treat me like shit! It's so exhausting. I'm tired of playing games. 

I'm at a moment in my life where I'm working on myself, pushing myself out of my comfort zone, like climbing a volcano or learning how to surf lol, I've stopped indulging in drugs and alcohol and party like I used to in my early 20s as an escape for my anxiety/depression. I now turn to nature, exercise and healthy eating. I'm at a stage where I'm really loving myself but seems like I have no clue how to put aside how a person treated me. I've let this guy I met on this trip mind fuck me and even more so after seeing he blocked me on his stories but still follows me. It's ok not to like me, but going out of your way to blank you?

We’ve been married for over 14 years. While fairly at the begging of the marriage we discovered chat rooms and engaged in virtual sex chats for fun. After finding a decent guy to chat with, husband convinced me to share my normal picture with face because we trusted this guy. Then after few days when I was not around, once while chatting, that guy has begged for more pictures of me and without thinking it through my husband shared 4-5 more pictures again fully clothed, but without asking me. The very next day without me asking anything, my husband himself confessed sharing the pics and even showed me the chat. At that time I did not think much of it, may be because I myself had shown my face to the other party earlier or may be because they were not any nude or sexual photos.

But it’s been several years now after that, it is slightly bothering me now that he shared these pictures without my consent. Although he himself admitted to sharing and I know it was just a one time thing and emotions got the better of him. He hates that he did it himself and has deeply apologized for it. Our relationship is great otherwise, and I trust him completely. But this incident bothers me inside my head sometimes and I have all the space to discuss and be mad about this whenever it bothers me. He never denies my emotions and always hates that this happened, as much as me. Now I want to Move on from these thoughts. That my wonderful husband did something like this without my consent. Especially when there are no such repeat incidents and he had sincerely apologized.

I know we’re all humans, and that too they weren’t any kind nude photos, so technically he did not cross the hard line. But I’m just realizing how important consent is and even things we did as immature people can bother us even after years. I want to forgive him completely although we both may never forget the incident.

The girl in this situation (19F) is one of my friends I've gotten to know since last semester. This is the issue and I was not sure if I was supposed to go to the roommate reddit forum or this one, but here it goes. This girl, let's say J for now, has been doing things. Ever since we moved in, J has been hanging out in my room almost every night. I even have videos of her just in my room, lying in my bed, and playing games on my PS4. We are both theatre majors and we ended up casted in the same show, meaning we go to rehearsal together. Every night after rehearsal, which was pretty much daily, she has come in my room to study with me or just to hang out late into the night. Even in the day time when we did not have anything to do, she would come in my room to hang out and talk. Now, I do think she has a reason as to why she chose me, mainly because she used to talk to one of the roommates about 3 years back I think, but he ghosted her randomly so I can imagine that would be awkward for her to hang out with her. To add on, he was talking to another girl when we first moved in, so yeah. She has also talked to me about other guys and even the roommate, and how she felt about dating and whatnot. She has even told me that she does not like dating apps because she is demisexual and has to know a person before even considering them. This is the weirder part. When I would go hang out with my other friend (20F) who is gay, J would text her every single time we would hang, which was a daily thing. So everyday, J would text her and ask about me and when I was coming home, and the weirder thing is that J has my phone number and socials, so she can ask me simply where I was. J has also told that it freaks her out when I leave the apartment because she doesn't know where I am and that she stays up just to make sure I come home. The finally straw hit when I came back to the apartment, J told me that she texted another person that lives with my friend if I was there. My friend asked her roommate about it and he confirmed that it happened. It just seemed really obsessive, but now J hangs out with the other roommate she used to talk to back then in his room and she doesn't really ask me or anyone if I'm out or not. I thought about confronting her about it, but since she made that sudden change, I don't really see the point. My friend told me that it is probably because J likes me because she checks on me like she's my mom or girlfriend when she's neither of those things, but I don't understand that if she did, why would she still say that she might have feelings for the other roommate and tell me about how much she wants a relationship.

So when we first started dating my mind was in no marriage, I was scared that he would change too after marriage( He didnt know at the time why, again trust issues). He seems surprised and said he wanted to get married one day but since we just started dating so he didn't pressure much about that topic. We took things really slow, and he was always so accepting and caring that I couldn't believe that I found the prince charming, I always read it about it in books but he's truly a perfect man and more. After 3 years together, I had this thoughts of being married to him wouldn't be that be that bad it would be perfect! So I told him, since I couldn't keep it for myself any longer that I would love one day to be married to him, I went full on speech why and he smiles at me and said yeah that would be amazing and also had a little speech about it.

Now to the issue, he just got an incredible job offer to his hometown and since we would be moving soon, I ask him if he has any plans planned for his future? He said normal stuff, hanging out with friends and family, finally buying a house and maybe to get a new cat for our cat. And so I said, yeah that's sound great! Maybe we can finally build our own family and become one. Immediately he went silent and ask what I meant, I said oh just you know, get more fur babies (we're childless) and maybe get married... He ask me since when I wanted to get married ? And so I told him that I've being saying this for a long time now, that he change my mind. He immediately wanted to talk to me, and said to me that he hasn't really had thought of marriage and maybe he's not a person that wants to get married just because the society tell you. I was shock since he always told me that he wants to get married too so I ask him, he said he change his mind since the society has being really pushy and pressure him to get married when I ask who? He just said society and he leave it at that... I didn't know what to said..

So now I'm thinking to give him an ultimatum, he either proposed to me one day  or I would not be moving with him to his hometown. Do I sound pushy/ manipulative or unreasonable..  please tell if I do. Thank you

I’m 26M. 

My whole life I’ve been very fitness orientated. Growing up like many blokes my goal was to be a pro athlete. I came close and was totally obsessed with training and lifting weights. I still have been till recently. 

My move to another city recently and lack of good gym around me has suddenly got me questioning what the benefit of it is anymore. And it’s got me really confused. 

Me and my ex split up for a few reasons but the main one was conflicting opinions on fitness. I loved her, but her way was to not bother. Just only do things that kept her in her comfort zone fitness wise and she started to get quite large towards the end. And I struggled with attraction. 

Me on the other hand is someone who really values being fit and healthy. I like looking my best and feeling like I can run a mile any time I want. Now I’m questioning the benefit of it, it’s got me really really confused. 

I haven’t trained in 2 weeks and that’s the longest I’ve gone without for years. I’ve eaten like shit. It feels like I’ve lost a part of who I am and im questioning why me and my ex split up now. I’m also worried i won’t attract a girl without going and being fit.

Back on the dating apps, swiping away, and not really feeling attracted to guys photos on there. Decided to give a guy a chance, he looked friendly. Had a great time, but it just felt completely friendly, there was no flirting from him or myself, just felt like we were good friends.

I don’t look at his body and have any sexual attraction, which makes me feel I’m broken. I’ve not felt it for anyone since my ex. My ex was tall, long hair, beard, broad shoulders, slight dad bod/muscle, and weirdly I loved his big hands. But I’m not feeling that same attraction to anyone else which is starting to make me worry I’m asexual or something.

My ex was also very chatty over text, amazing convos, texted me how beautiful I was after the date and that he can’t wait to see me again, but I, barely get any communication with the men I go on dates with outside of dates. The vibe was amazing with him and I’m actually scared I’ll never find that again. I loved his personality, we just clicked, but when he dumped me, he said he dated me out of loneliness which made me doubt what was real

Recently, I brought up several issues I have with my relationship with him. One of them is that whenever I express affection verbally, he just scoffs/heavily sighs and will say something quickly to dismiss me. This makes me feel like I cannot confide in him and I have to tip-toe my interactions to avoid irritating him. When I brought this up to him, he said that my feelings were valid but I was overthinking and that his negative responses were just how he reacted because he's not used to a lot of affection and who he is as a person. If he truly had an issue with me, he would tell me. I asked him to be more mindful about how he speaks to me because while he is entitled to feel whatever he wants, I would appreciate for him to communicate it in a nicer way that is considerate of my feelings. He says that he'll try to be better and work on the things I have brought up in order to make me feel more confident in our relationship. 

Of course, I also know I definitely have a tendency to overthink things among others which I am working on for sure. I think he can do better with his communication but I do cut him slack as this is his first proper relationship, and I do see and appreciate his effort so far in trying to address the issues.

Basically, I thought he was hitting on me. We both seem the same age (late twenties).

I've been a regular at this small grocery store for more than two years, and I can see how differently he treats me compared to other customers.

When I go in Id greet him hello. And before I leave we'd fist bump, high five and wish each other a nice day. The other day I decided to leave the store without saying bye to him, and I saw him glance around the shop looking for me

He stares at me repeatedly when he sees that I'm in the queue

He use to squeal a bit when he saw that I was next in line

He would open the unmanned register and ask me to go to him

And the biggest of all, everytime I go to his checkout and hand him my stuff, hed always touch my hands. I don't know since when that has started, but since June/July this year he hasnt been subtle about it.

So on saturday I wrote him a letter since its unprofessional on his side to take out his phone while working. I asked him to read it when hes alone. In the letter I said I wont be able to go to the shop so often and if hes interested in being friends, he can contact me via my number, but if he isnt, he doesnt need to contact me. I'll still treat him the same.

I gave him that letter on saturday and now its Wednesday (so four days) and I havent heard from him. I feel like I should give up on expecting a response but a small part of me thinks I should wait longer.

I really liked him and I thought due to his behaviour he would want to be friends. Doesnt seem like it now though:(

I'm in a 1 month long relationship with a girl. She wants it to be a long term relationship. And honestly, the relationship seems to be going great. 

But I have had a very bad gut feeling about it since the start. 

And now she's showing some red flags. She hates all my platonic lady friends. She calls them my 'girl squad' and I keep them around as FWBs. And also, she gets upset when she sees me talking to them, and I have to spend a lot of time reassuring her. To ease things, I've even introduced my lady friends to her. She still does this. 

And I injured my leg recently. Was at the hospital without my phone for 2 days. I still contacted her and kept in touch as much as I could. Yet she got upset that that was not enough. 

She also doesn't understand my need for space. 

I feel like that bad gut feeling is also making me be a bit flaky (never cheated on her though) and questioning whether I really want this relationship. This is also making me not wanna talk to her that much. 

I've been in relationships before and all those girls I've liked and cared for way more than I do for her. 

She's a great girl and my guy friends always tell me what a catch she is. But I don't feel that way. I flirted with her for fun and never expected her to want a long term relationship. 

Hell, I even wanted to break up with her on the way to a date with her. 

I guess I answered my own question there :)

I called them out on it and we all agreed to communicate better. Yesterday, one of the girls suggested birthday plans for her and another girl in February. I'd already suggested birthday plans for myself in December, but everyone's too busy. Feeling left out is starting to wear me down as I've experienced this in previous friendships. Is it time to let go?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been friends with these girls for about a year, there are four of us - me (26F), A (25F), B (25F) and C (28F). We met at dance class which we all still attend weekly. I feel like they're closer to each other than I am to any of them. I've noticed small things that make me feel left out, like not telling me about updates in their life when I've missed dance due to work, getting funny with me if I bumped into other friends while we were out, not asking to hang out one-on-one like they do with each other, celebrating each other's achievements but not commenting on mine etc. It had been going on for months and was starting to get to me, so I called them out on it after the last time something happened. They tried to pin it on me, saying I never responded to messages. I said I stopped responding to messages because I was already upset that I had been left out, I didn't know what to do and it was easier to let them get on with it. We all agreed to be better at communicating.

Yesterday I saw a message in our group chat from A. Her and C's birthday is in February, and she suggested a plan for a big night out to celebrate. But my birthday is in December, and when I tried to make plans everyone said they couldn't make it. I've attended all of their birthday plans this year, but nobody seems to care about mine. I fully understand that December is a busy time for many people and money is a big issue, I usually celebrate in January anyway for this reason. But we only had this conversation about feeling left out around a month ago...

This probably sounds really petty, but I've been in friend groups before where them forgetting my birthday has been a sign that the friendship won't last. I think it's bothering me because it feels a bit targeted. It doesn't seem malicious, more careless. But why would I want to be friends with people who make me feel like they don't care about me?

The logical thing is to talk to them about it, but we've had this chat recently and I don't feel like I should have to tell someone that forgetting their birthday isn't a nice thing to do. I've spoken to my partner and mum about this who know of the specific examples of things that have happened in the past, and they agree that it seems a bit shady. They've both suggested taking a step back, keeping them as ""dance friends"" and focusing on other friends. I see these girls multiple times a week though, and this will almost definitely trigger another conversation. 

It's really starting to burn me out, and I can feel myself starting to force myself to be happy around them. Sounds extreme, but this has happened to me before and it feels awful.

My last breakup over a year ago was pretty bad and it took me aaages to somewhat get over it even though we only dated for a few months. I usually take my time getting attached to someone, because it hurts so badly when things end, which they always do. 

So two months ago i met this guy [M27] and i actually liked him. The thought of him made me happy. However, he already told his family about me and was very clear about how he wanted a relationship with me right from the start. Naturally, this caused me to freak out and i talked to him about it and he agreed to take things slow and do everything to make me feel comfortable. We had like 3 dates in total and texted all day every day. 

A week ago i had nightly panic attacks and intrusive thoughts telling me to end it (""i don't want this, i can't do this""). I always have this in relationships and i am having a hard time differentiating between my anxiety and my intiuition. During a panic attack i talked to a friend and i decided i wanted to end things with him because i am not ready for a relationship and don't want the pressure of someone waiting around for me to commit to them. 

So yesterday i ended things and he cried a little and asked if there was anything he could do so i would try with him. I cried so hard and said that i can't give him what he wants and i want him to be happy because i care for him so deeply and i would only fuck things up in the long run and don't want him waiting around for me to get my shit together. 

Ever since then i can't stop crying, i am not eating. I feel bad for myself, bad for hurting him. I don't know what to do. Was this a mistake? What is wrong with me? 

How do i know if this was a mistake?

I feel as though I'm not ready to be in another relationship. I'm 22f and my boyfriend is 20. We've been official since Halloween this year and everything has been amazing. He's incredibly kind and caring, attractive, we share the same friends and are interested in allot of the same things. He's everything I could ask for, but I'm feeling so unsure of what I want. We started this relationship out as more of a friends with benefits, as I have been to afraid of getting into another romantic committed relationship after my last boyfriend of three years, unfortunately it was a very toxic relationship. 

My boyfriend understood this and wasn't pushing for a relationship, but after about a week or two he was definitely starting to lead us in that direction. As bad as I felt continuing to reject the idea and keep things as they were, I felt as though I was letting him down and that it was wrong of me to put him in that position. I had never really done FWB before and this was my first shot at it. He fell for me very fast and I thought, he's been such and incredible person to be around and maybe it wouldn't be so bad giving this a chance, despite my discomfort. Since Halloween we've spent everyday together, be it at my place or his. Only since Monday have we been apart, and here I am, really feeling as though things are moving much to quickly for me and I want to be on my own again, and to have my space. I love him, and I care greatly about him, but I don't think I'm ready, and he's head over heels. I want to be emotionally there and romantically ready for this but I'm just not right now. This is the first time that I have ever felt more content with being on my own and single than to be in a relationship. I don't know how to bring this up to him and I don't really know why I'm feeling like this, it's never happened before.

I've been seeing this girl (36F) for a little over a month now. We met at a bar, which I love because I hate dating apps tbh. The relationship hasn't been defined or labeled yet, but we have expressed that we enjoy each other's company and that we haven't been seeing other people.

Or are these major red flags that I'm overlooking simply because I'm head over heels for this girl? Thank you in advance!

Concerns:

- Has lots of male friends (some who she's had sex with in the past, but says they are just platonic now)

- She's still friends with her ex boyfriends

- She's going out of state for a trip and will sleep at house of male friend who previously expressed romantic interest in her (she says that she doesn't reciprocate feelings and that they're just friends)

- Seemed like she was using me for coke at first (though now she wants to cut back)


Positive(?):

- Has told her family about me and invited me to Thanksgiving

- Told me a guy asked her if she was available and stated that she told him she was taken

- She's been hanging out with me and staying over at my place about every weekend

- She gets along with my friends and I feel like I get along with hers
