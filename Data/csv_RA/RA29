I work in the middle of nowhere and live in shared housing with a majority of everyone I work with. 

I am GOOD friends with 3 people I work with. We’ll call then Natalie (f,21), Tommy (m,21), and Amanda (f,24). Natalie and Tommy used to date. They dated for almost a year up into the summer. It was rocky because they both had to live together and share the same friend group. 

After Natalie and Tommy broke up around June thing were pretty peaceful. Until a few things. 1, Natalie hooked up with a guy who we also work with. 2, unbeknownst to anyone, Tommy and Amanda were having late night emotional chats and hangs. You now the deal. 

Now Amanda unfortunately got closer to Natalie because we shared the same VERY small friend group. Natalie had no clue Amanda was having hangout sessions with her ex. 

Unfortunately these two secrets all came to surface during Tommy’s last day living at the housing and working. It was a very chaotic day and evening to say the least. For all of them and also me as Tommy, Natalie, and Amanda are my closest friends. 

I let everyone feel their pain but I also stood up for Natalie because she is one of my closest friends and I was somewhat understanding to her pain as Amanda was close to her and she had no clue she was doing anything with her ex. 

But I also understand why Amanda and Tommy did what they did. As well as Natalie hooking up with the guy we also are friends with (although Tommy and him arent nearly as close as Amanda and Natalie were). But this is KEY info. Natalie fucked someone before Tommy and Amanda did anything(which I’ll assume isn’t much as Amanda hasn’t had sex before). 

Now I’ve stood behind Natalie and Tommy as they’re my two closest people in my life rn. But. 

I ignored amanda and I talked to her intensely but briefly during the night the truth came out. Hadn’t talked to her since and yesterday we briefly worked together and it was just awkward and today I talked to her because just how this job worked and I was working with awful people and I made a funny face at her and she giggled and my heart instantly hurt. 

I missed Amanda. I get why she did what she did. Too much to write her as I think it could expose her if someone who knew her were to read it but. 

We talked and it went well. The thing is Natalie told me if I were to ever be friends with amanda again she doesn’t think she could be my friend. 

Me and Natalie are supposed to live together (no official housing yet) in January. I’m scared because I don’t want to loose my friendship with Natalie over Amanda; I want to be everyone’s friend.

So much just goes into this. Natalie was just immature in the sense that I couldn’t tell her hey let’s not bang on Tommy’s walls(ofc they share a wall) during his last night when he barely has his shit together and was trying to pack. 

I didn’t feel comfortable telling her that, but I’m comfortable with Amanda, who as the age stated has 3 years in her, and telling her what’s up and having open and honest discussions. 

I talked to my mom earlier and asked her advice, although I take her wise words as a grain of salt because she’s a bit all over the place, but she did say to me a few things they stuck. 

1. Natalie and Tommy were broken up and Natalie had arrest hooked up with Tommy’s friend by the time Amanda and him did anything.

1 1/2. Were ALL in our prime, middle of nowhere, tiniest dating circle ever, no shit we’re gonna fuck each other. 

2. How much do I wanna live with this girl that is clearly lacking maturity. 


The second one hits hard. How much do I? Do you think Natalie has been immature. Do you think Amanda is?

He’s still in the process of trying to “clean” the money. 

Apparently a female friend of his had this happen to her when she posted on Reddit so he got an idea from it and they started the scam together.

When we first became friends, I was aware of her liking anime, but it was basically the only asian thing she liked. We didn’t talk for the year after that due to covid and online school. Last year we became friends again. I didn’t really get why she called me one of her best friends at the time because I didn’t really think we talked enough prior (although this may just be my insecurity). Her two best friends were me and our other Asian friend, us being the only two Asian people in our entire friend group. I thought this was kind of weird, but I just looked over it. Her interests included anime, vocaloid, Genshin Impact, Yandere Simulator, Sanrio, and gyaru. I can’t really think of something she likes that isn’t Asian. The entire year she identified as a trans man, but this year she identifies as feminine and no longer trans. This makes me wonder if she possibly identified as queer to get away from her white identity. 

This year, she has the same interests and always talks about them to me even though I don’t know anything about them. Is this because she assumes I know and care about things that are Asian because I am? I looked at her pinterest boards recently and almost everything is Asian, mostly Japanese. A few weeks ago she had a small birthday gathering, and the three guests were—you guessed it—Asian. Another nonasian guest was going to come but couldn’t, though. In every picture she takes of herself it gives me weird EA baiter vibes from the poses to expressions. She has talked about wanting to dye her hair black but worried it wouldn’t suit her enough. She has expressed that she doesn’t want to seem like an EA baiter or to cultural appropriate, but I feel like it’s possible for her to just be saying that to seem better. 

On the other hand, I might just be overthinking this. I know it’s possible to be interested in Asian/Japanese culture in an innocent way. I don’t know what to do. She is one of my best friends; she is fun to talk to and affectionate. I would talk to our other Asian friends, but to be completely honest they’re closer to her than they are to me, and I don’t want them to judge and leave me.

We have obviously had our ups and down, but this has been a pretty constant down. 

I have always had an extremely high libido (like at least once a day) but my husband has never been that sexual, which was fine. We found a middle ground early on and we're both satisfied. Until we got engaged (a year before we were married). Then the sex dwindled down quite significantly. When I asked about it, he always had a new excuse (stress; not been to the gym so not feeling great about his body; still living in my parents house together so lack of privacy etc.). Once the one excuse was no longer viable, he would move onto a new one. Eventually, he just stopped using excuses and said that he simply doesn't want sex as often as I do (which I have accepted - but having sex twice a month was never the norm). 

We went to a couples therapist for a while and did some intimacy training and during that it got better. I felt wanted again. But recently, it's dropped again and no matter what I say or do, he just asks me to wait and be patient, but its now been 2 years of me waiting and it's just not getting better. When I expressed this to him, he clearly took it to heart because he initiated sex one evening but I could feel he wasn't into it at all and when I tried to talk about it after, he got frustrated and basically said that even when he gives me what I want (sex) I'm still not happy. 

I know he loves me, I feel that everyday, I just don't feel like he wants or desires me.

However, when we were dating she got to meet two of my closest friends. My ex met my cousin and my other friend who I will name Ben for the rest of this story.

So I have this thing that I never keep a close friendship with anyone I used to talk to, as a matter of fact, I unfollow anyone I dated, had sex with, or been intimate with. It's just something I have done for a long time and I don't like the idea of seeing someone I used to date on my Instagram. If they are my ex I want to forget they exist and pretend like it never happened. 

Anyways after I break it off with my ex I immediately unfollow her on Instagram. We say our goodbyes and end it respectfully. A couple of days pass by and I noticed that my cousin and my other friend Ben are following my ex on Instagram. I asked both of my closest friends that I consider like brothers to unfollow my ex and respect the ""bro code"". Ben immediately said yes and understood my request but my cousin was against it. 

I was so confused as to why he wished to keep being friends with her.. they have only known each other for 72 hours whereas me and my cousin have spent our whole life together. I was upset because my cousin was going against what I was feeling. My cousin is supposed to choose me over some girl he just barely met. He told me that they were both texting each other a lot and that he feels bad just unfollowing her. I told him that he shouldn't even be texting her, to begin with, and that there are so many girls he can text why does it have to be my ex? 

I told him I felt uncomfortable with him keeping contact with my ex and following her on Instagram. He chose to keep following her. I think it is so fake of my cousin to not respect my request and that he would literally risk my relationship with him over a girl he just barely met. Me and my cousin debated for a full hour about this until eventually, he said he will unfollow her. 

The following day I told him that I am very disappointed in him for debating with me. For going behind my back and texting my ex. I told him I did not want to see him for a while because of how hurt I was. He kept apologizing and making excuses for why he was hesitating on unfollowing her. But I just feel like a true friend wouldn't have to debate. A true friend would simply unfollow the girl and move on to respect the friendship. 

A couple of days passed and I saw that my cousin and my ex kept following each other and keeping in contact on Instagram. I got very upset with my cousin and I told him that if I can't even trust him to do something small for me as to unfollow a nobody then how can I expect him to do something big or small for me in the future? 

I told him he lost me as his friend and cousin. He lost my respect and love towards him. I blocked him from everywhere now. 

I won't lie it hurts a lot that he goes behind my back like this because I love my cousin a lot. I really believe my cousin is in the full wrong here. Right now it just hurts that he cares so little.

My girlfriend and I were hanging out today as a typical Saturday. We both go to college in the same state and I'm about 45 minutes away from her. I had full intentions of spending the weekend with her. However, we somehow started talking about our relationship and how I didn't seem to respect her. I'll admit I have not always been the best boyfriend, but I have never cheated or done anything to make her suspect anything would be going on behind her back. She knows I'm very busy with my academics as I'm pursuing Grad school this next fall and have been writing letters and applying like crazy.

So the conversation takes a turn and she says that because I haven't been as active on social media around her, but have been when I'm away she wanted to go through my phone. I denied the request initially because I knew where this was going. I told her I didn't think it was wise and that she should trust me. Essentially I was given an ultimatum that I either give her my phone or I leave. I obliged and gave her my phone and she looked through my Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and Camera Roll. This went on for roughly 30 minutes and nothing was found she wasn't already made aware of. She proceeded to search through conversations I had with other girls some were colleagues and it made me somewhat upset. 

After she was done she started crying and told me to leave. I was confused as to why and I said ""There was nothing on my phone. Why do you want me to leave?"" She responded by telling me that she doesn't believe me and knows I'm up to something. I tried to comfort her and tell her that there was nothing I have to hide. She told me to leave and I drove back to my apartment where I'm now writing this... 

What do I do? I tried texting her reassuring her of my love for her, but nothing seems to be hitting.

I wish I could give more context than what I’m going to give but it would take to long and kind of deviate from my original question. 

Recently, he and I have had issues in relation to a woman he used to “work” with, talking to him still after I expressed my concerns and dislike of the behavior. 

This was someone he explained to me on more than one occasion, is strictly just a friend. He no longer works at the workplace she does. They also didn’t technically work for the same dept, they just I guess… happened to meet through mutual work friends in the various depts of our work force (leaving work vague to protect our identities). Her and I still work for the same dept. I have never liked her given that she flirts with male employees and is into fucking married and taken men, hence my concern.

So, I found deleted messages on his phone (I know it was silly of me to check but my gut instinct told me I should) between the two of them. Not necessarily of cheating nature or flirting, but she constantly would text him, saying she was drunk, asking him out with their old coworkers, etc. He even mentioned in a text that he had her text notifications muted so that I wouldn’t see, which I found awful odd. 

He and I have discussed this in depth and I have set boundaries; he will stop texting, insta msging, and any other form of communication with her if he respects me and our relationship, which he did immediately and without issue. 

SO, given some background into the “struggles” we’ve been having lately, I want to get to my question. 

He started a new job which requires him to travel for a few days. The most recently time he traveled, it was 3 nights, and the company pays for a hotel room for him, all of that jazz. During that trip, I had noticed when he’d returned home, he had shaven his whole body (???), to include his junk. He hasn’t done that since we first started dating….

I got home from work this evening (I work nights) and he had cleaned the bathroom really well but had obviously shaved his whole body in my shower and attempted to clean it. He left the trimmer on the counter in the bathroom. He had also texted me while at work saying he’d cleaned the bathroom for me, to be nice. Now I realize why he did. 

Given the recent road bump with he old coworker friend and the deleted/muted messages, I have a horrible feeling in my gut that he’s hiding more than just her? I really don’t know how to approach it with him but I honestly feel like my trust has been shattered due to that with her and some other things I don’t have time to get into in this thread. 

Any advice would help. Even past experiences would help too. Thank you so much. 

TLDR; Bf of 7 months shaved his whole body and junk prior to leaving for work trip (second time he’s done it). How might I bring this up to him and should I even be concerned?

She also showed a screenshot where he was seemingly jealous about her talking to another guy. I saw she tried to end the conversation and he was badgering her to keep the conversation going.

Women show love differently than men, men show it differently than women. There is no one fix standard...having said that, both needs to have developed all the good and positive qualities of the heart.

Beyond that, on a day to day basis... Kill lazyness at physical, mental and emotional level...it is the number one cause of issues in relationship. Women stop apeing men, it is not the way to change men and embrace feminity. Men take responsibility of your own shit and be helpful.

After few years of sex...the relationship has to eventually evolve...men either becomes friend, brother or father and women become mother or sister or friend....depending on life circumstances and mental maturity. Ultimately everything boils down to companionship.

Decide which one works best for your own circumstances. Accept your true... If you can manage multiple shades of relationship with the same person for the life time you would be less cribbing and more evolve human.

Women sexual drive starts to slow down after touching 25th birthday. And then she wants to move up to heart and mind..not remain in the lower realm. Men are sexually active upto age 50, they will think sex weekly twice or thrice unless they are satisfied with good food and care shown by his partner. Hence women has a power to transform man's sexual energy into heart qualities by satisfying him with good food and by taking care of him emotionally and mentally.

This disparity creates lot of misalignments of sexual expectation and mental and emotional stress... understand this basic nature between the two and find your own balance.

Men wants sex, tasty food and emotional and mental care. Women wants attention, affection and teasing/flirting. Truth for human creatures we are.

Men has to become more attention giving, more affectionate and flirt with your own women. Women become chef, give amazing sex once weekly, and take care of him. Both help eachother become a better human being.

Women if you want children, become really good a home management. Your man can support you but it will be your responsibility. Become leader. Don't look down upon home management as some labour job, you can develop great management skills of people management, become more organised and disciplined, developed lateral thinking and creativity, etc...

Men if you want to have a happy old age, start supporting your woman and develop feminine qualities i.e. qualities of heart. 

Both men and women develop good mind and heart. 

Avoid negative and toxic behaviour completely- 
Don't control each other, don't blame each other, act maturely, take responsibility of your own health - physical and mental. Support each other and your extended family. Don't have tit-for-tat attitude. Don't become selfish natured, Talk straight forward, don't play emotional and mental games with each other and your extended new families.

Happy relationship.

I love my boyfriend and know he’s a good person, but sometimes he tells me little lies. He always fesses up when I ask him about it (female 6th sense always tells me when something’s up yk) and it’s not too often, but it is something I would like to stop. For example, today he was supposed to get paint to paint our living room. I was out with friends all day until about midnight, keep this in mind. He told me he was starting painting, and that he had gotten the paint we needed. something felt off to me, so I asked to see a picture of the paint on the wall so I could see how it looked. He then told me a bunch of run around that basically ended in him saying he mistakenly got a sample size instead of the big size, and he was too anxious to go back into the store and ask for the right size. When I arrived home, there was no sample size. after some more pressing (asking once) he told me he never got the paint and he just didn’t want me to be angry, because he has this idea in his head that I think he can’t do anything right and that he’s incapable.  he says he knows those feelings are unfounded and can’t figure out why he feels that way but that it’s not just me , he’s always afraid he’s letting everyone down. What ACTUALLY happened was that he got to Home Depot and realized he forgot the gift card he was going to use for the paint, so he just went home. he got caught up hanging out with our friend (let’s call him N) and when N left he just showered and made dinner before heading out to the studio (he’s in a band) with my friend who is his drummer because they had an appointment from 8-10. he told me he just didn’t want to make me angry and that he’s terrified of being seen as incapable. Things like this will sometimes happen, and I know those are legit reasons, but I get very upset about it. I told him I would be willing to work things out if he agrees to get some therapy, does this make me a push over? before we dated a mutual friend told me bf had a history of lying when he’s scared or wants to avoid having to speak up for himself so this isn’t a situation unique to me however i was told the issue is millions of times better than it once was. I really love him and he really needs therapy. some side info- his mother is a horrible person. she has made him horribly insecure and conflict avoidant so the therapy isn’t just because he lied to me about going to home depot lol. I guess what i’m really asking is am I a pushover for agreeing to move past this ? or should I bite the bullet and leave? i’ve seen posts here saying if people lie about small stuff they are lying about big stuff but i REALLY don’t think that’s the case with him and trust me I am sensitive to that sort of thing and would’ve found out by now unless he’s a secret evil genius that I haven’t been able to sniff out, and those posts didn’t include the context of how the person grew up, that’s why included the bit about his mom because i feel that that has some relationship to this behavior. I  really don’t want to break up but i’ve been burned so many times before by liars and cheaters that i just can’t stand the thought of putting myself in a situation where i’m at risk of feeling those ways ever again. sorry for the convoluted post, I just want to make sure the course of action im taking is a productive one

TLDR; boyfriend has shitty mom that made him insecure and avoidant and now he tells white lies because he thinks i’m going to think he useless and be very angry at him if he tells me the truth about mistakes he’s made. am I a pushover for agreeing to remain in the relationship as long as he goes to therapy, or should I just leave before I potentially get hurt",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7594941,public,self,my boyfriend sometimes tells little lies to me out of fear. did I go about this the right way?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzwoum/my_boyfriend_sometimes_tells_little_lies_to_me/,all_ads,6,

Recently though, since about 2-3 weeks ago, I couldn't help but feel he's been a bit more...distant. Just generally less talkative, sometimes responding to my innocent questions about his day etc. or even an ""I love you"" with a completely unrelated meme or something, basically cutting off the conversation right then and there.

That was bad enough but yesterday it culminated into what i *think* was a deliberate lie to make me not message him. Basically, he told me in the morning he was going to work (and i typically don't text him when he's at work), but when i checked Discord about 2-3 hours later (and for the rest of the day), he was still online, playing a new game that just came out. Didn't confont him about this yet, it just seemed so..pointless? Like I would've totally understood if he said ""Hey, new game came out, I wanna focus on that uninterrupted today!"", so why the lie??

All that made me paranoid that maybe I'm just annoying and bothering him, but is a small conversation inbetween ""Good morning"" and ""Goodnight"" messages really too much to expect?

I don’t know what it was this time but I made a comment when we stopped having sex and he didn’t finish. He then said well he had “jerked one off” earlier before coming over to see me and that was probably why.

This really upset me, the fact he would do it knowing he would be seeing me later. I guess I felt he should’ve had some more self control, knowing damn well he would initiate having sex with me. 

He didn’t really argue back with me other than him apologizing. I don’t love the idea of porn but I’m not one to stop what anyone does in their free time, it’s just the timing of it that really bothered me?

6 months in I had caught him texting other women on an app and he stated that it was wrong and he just wants to have conversations with people. The dates slowly stopped and when I had asked to go out he stated that I just “wanted to be seen”. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I had caught him texting his ex and he took my phone and shattered it. I had also caught him on the BLK app and went through his phone and saw the others too and confronted him about it. He instantly ignored me and when I tried talking with him about our relationship, he stated that he seriously only started talking to other women because I was the one starting our arguments. So it’s basically my fault. 

Everytime he gets upset he calls me not only ignores me but has called me out of my name. I don’t know how to feel or how to move forward because we are staying together now. The intimacy hasn’t been the same and I have not been up to being intimate which makes him ignore me even more.

I (M30) have been dating a girl (27F) for about six weeks now. Things have been really amazing. We've talked 5 out of seven days of the week, and shared all of our values, hopes, and dreams with each other. We are aligned on basically everything, and we've both expressed that we have never had partners that made us feel this cherished and happy. We made it official, and she expressed that she is still nervous, since she hasn't had a relationship go on for longer than a few months since guys seem to lose interest and disappear. Me, being the ding-dong that I am, said: ""well, I know this is kind of soon, and I don't want you to feel any pressure or obligation to respond, but I think that I love you. Just want you to know that, so that you know how much I am excited for this to keep going."" She was very kind, and took it in stride, but (to no one's surprise) did say that she wasn't ready to say that yet. We continued with the day, had a lovely evening of it, and made more plans to see one another.

Now, I am not going to ask ya'll if you think it was too soon to drop the L-bomb. I KNOW it was too soon, but we were in a very emotional moment, and my brain didn't do its solemn stupid-filtration duty. I do feel very strongly about this woman, and I genuinely think she is unbelievably special, but I also totally get that saying ""I love you"" can be a red flag early in a relationship. So I wanted to ask you how I might play this out. Currently, I am trying to just not make a big deal out of it, and continue as we have been, but does anyone have any advice for how to proceed from this, and how to downplay the crazy-vibes I might have given?

We've pretty much always been just platonic friends, with me not having any romantic feelings for him, just friend love. 

However, lately, Toby and I have been very close, closer than just friends should be probably, and I have found out he likes me and wants to date me. 

I've been going back and forth on my feelings for months now. I've tried my best to be completely honest with him about my feelings, which has resulted in my telling him I liked him, then I didn't, then I did, then I didn't, and now we're back in the I like him stage. I feel like I do really like him, more than people like someone who is just a friend. But I can't get myself to say I want to date him. He's been incredibly patient, just telling me it's ok and to take my time figuring out my feelings.

I suppose it's all really kind of weird for me because I've always just been friends with this person. Literally never thought of him in a romantic light at all. And now all of the sudden it's like I've realized he is a male, could be a potential romantic interest, and I might be attracted to him. 

Here are some things I like / don't like about him: 

-He makes me feel so good about myself, I can talk to him about anything, he makes me feel comfortable and safe, he understands me and wants to understand me even more, he knows me and likes me, we have so much fun together goofing off, I like being around him, I trust him completely, and I know he would be good to me. 

-But, he is shorter than me. (I've dated a shorter guy before, but really it does bother me, and I admitted to Toby that it bothers me). He also isn't the most attractive, but isn't ugly. I was not attracted to him at all when we first became friends, but I am now somewhat, I think. We cuddled and it was really nice, and I do think about kissing him or being intimate with him sometimes. It's almost as if I feel some sexual attraction to him, but am not entirely physically attracted to him, if that's even a thing. 

-I also don't feel any butterflies with him. I just feel completely comfortable. 

So I guess, I don't really understand my own feelings. I'd say I'm leaning towards wanting to date him right now, but can't get myself to commit and say it.. and I'm not sure what is holding me back from dating him.
 
Thoughts that have been endlessly bouncing around in my head: 
- Maybe physical appearance what is stopping me from saying I'll date him. If so, is that shallow, or does that make sense that you should be really physically attracted to a romantic partner..
-Or does maybe personality matters the most in a partner, and my attraction to him will grow. Because I'm at least somewhat attracted to him now when I wasn't at all before, so it's already grown a bit...
-Maybe I cannot commit because of the lack of butterflies. I feel like I want a partner who gives me crazy butterflies. Or do butterflies not even matter and it's more important to be comfortable.. And maybe there aren't butterflies because we've been friends for 5 years. 
-Maybe I don't want to date him because he's my best friend and I'm afraid of messing up our friendship.
-Or it could be all the things I like about him just things you can have in a friendship and we should just stay friends.
-Or maybe I am just afraid to date him because I don't have much dating experience and I'm scared. 

Anyways, it's clear I don't know what's going on in my own mind. Maybe I am overthinking everything and should just give dating him a chance.

Me (27M) and my girlfriend (30F) have been together for over a year. Little backstory - she used to be incredibly caring, physically very affectionate. Any chance we got there would be cuddles, kissing, hugs and the ‘sporty deed’. In the beginning I used to be a little distant because of inexperience and fear. I let that go 4-5 months ago, have been caring and overall a huge improvement life wise, body wise, the way I act with her. This was a turn-off because she has been treated like crap her whole life and this scared her, she doesn’t have to fight for my love anymore. She said she lost some passion and for me to give her time. She said I’m being perfect and doing nothing wrong but she simply needs to ‘fix’ her feelings and previous trauma. 

She also has a 3 y/o child who is a dear. I like spending time with her and she likes me very much also. We have considered moving in together, currently we see each other 3-4 days a week atleast when I drive over to her. 

I am fine in sharing attention and time with her child, that’s understandable and not a problem. In the past 2-3 months we have had 3-4 hours to ourselves on these days when together and she doesn’t initiate anything physical affection - be it hugs, kisses, cuddling or sex. It all feels forced by me. She is on her phone alot more. The sparkle in her eye towards me has faded a little. 

This situation does not satisfy me - if I care for her and child, do my best regarding the relationship, behave like a gentleman - I feel as if her behaving like a loving partner for those few hours we have to ourselves is not that much to expect. 

I love her and do my best to make her happy but this situation will result in something I would not like, probably resentment and my feelings fading. I have tried talking about my concerns but she doesn’t see my problem. 

Any input would be appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!

So my gf (25F) and me (25M) have been together for almost 10 years, high school sweetheart cliche I know. But I genuinely believe she is my soul mate. I joined the military at 16 (U.K.) and then left at 22 and went to work abroad in Germany. So we have always had a fairly distanced relationship but very recently I asked her ‘hypothetically’ if I were to propose tomorrow what would she say. She gave me an ambiguous answer which was basically a no all dressed up. For some context after all my travelling work I moved home in April 2021 and have worked at home since then. I have been slacking with the household chores which I understand is very selfish and have recently made a significant effort to change my ways. I guess having the majority of things done for you or you made to do them (in terms of mundane cleaning) has actually been a detriment which had been bothering her but I accepted full responsibility and have agreed she was carrying too much of the couples burden and have promised (and have been) to carry my end. 

We live together in an apartment which I bought but she pays me under the odds rent (as she should IMO) and I am very money focussed in terms of career. Whereas she is much more, “let’s skimp to save” which I can understand but the job I have been offered (involves travelling Mon-fri) is literally 2x my take home salary and although I do enjoy being at home every night, I genuinely believe this will be a good move for us as a couple and hopefully in the future as a family. I have told her I plan on buying a house, this time in both of our names as she has been paying me rent for almost 5 years and feel like she should be involved in the legal paperwork so that her rent is for something. The issue is after our talk regarding house chores (roughly a month ago) she is still giving me ambiguous answers regarding marriage. After (almost) 10 years I thought she would be ecstatic about marriage but I was wrong. I refuse to use my equity in the current property I own to buy a house in both of our names if she doesn’t see a future between us, which I certainly do! 

With my new job I will make roughly 3x what she does which isn’t a brag but we have a very expensive holiday coming up which she swears we can afford but neither of us have saved anything in the last 12 months.

I’m scared that all of my troubles are becoming too much for him. 

In a nutshell, my mother is terminally ill and was diagnosed a year and a half ago, stage 4 cancer. She may have a year or two left but might not, we can’t be certain. I am in immense pain over this because she is my favorite person and I am so scared to lose her. I keep it together most of the time, but about 1-2 times per week I let it all out before bed and cry myself to sleep. 

3 weeks ago I was laid off from my well paying job of 7 years. They outsourced my entire team and let us all go. This added a ton of stress because the job market is nuts right now due to all the layoffs.

Last night, we were about to go to sleep and we were talking about my health insurance and how it will end soon. I tried to fall asleep but couldn’t. I started thinking about my mom and losing my career and insurance and started crying.

He didn’t say anything or comfort me. Even just a hug without words would have been nice. I felt even more alone and upset so I went and slept in the guest room because I wanted to be alone to think. I decided I’d talk to him about it in the morning.

This morning, he acted like nothing happened. I told him that I feel like he has stopped caring about me because he doesn’t comfort me anymore when I cry or ask how I’m doing anymore.

He said “I know how you’re doing so why would I ask to make you feel worse by asking?” And “there isn’t anything I can do to help what happening so I can’t help why you’re crying”.

I told him I know, but that it used to help me when he would comfort me. 

From there, he said that he doesn’t know how to if it’s always the same issue that makes me cry. He got very defensive and said he has tried and nothing works…. I again told him I just need comfort because if he ignores that I'm crying, I feel alone and worse. 

He got mad at me and walked away. A few hours later we had to go to a friend's for a bit and he acted like nothing happened and was being his nice, normal self. but I'm just feeling like a dark cloud, like my pre-grief and life stress is making him not love me as much anymore. 

I honestly wouldn’t blame him for wanting out because its too much. I just feel lost and afraid in so many ways and I don’t know what to do. I almost just think I should leave to struggle through all of this alone.

Then  he had to leave to help take care of his mom and help her move and get settled. His parents were thinking of divorce and she wasn't taking it well. Then its been one thing after another. He didn't have a job, didn't even try working. Got a contracting job but then blew all his money. Then it was Covid, etc.  It has been 4 years since he left. This long distance relationship has been hard. Being online has led to many disagreements that I don't think would happen if we were together face to face.

About 10 months ago, I help him get a new job...call people and put in a referral and he gets remote contract work from home, making decent money. Which means he can live anywhere.  I am thinking we can finally be together! He has been at the job for 10 months and they love him. But now they want to hire him but it will require him to move to yet another state. I can't move because I have a daughter (from a previous relationship) who is finally settled and in school. I can't make her move again, plus I had just signed a new lease on my rental.

So he wants to take the job because its good money, and wants to do it for at least a year or two to save money. 

I have waited now for 4 years for him to get his stuff together, so we can finally be together. I can't wait another 2 years.  I don't want to wait. I don't want another 2 years of a long-distance relationship 

I told him he can find another job and I would help him, but he thinks not for this kind of money. He says he will try to come once a month to visit.

He made the decision to move and take the job without even discussing it with me. Am I being the unreasonable one? Have I been the stupid one to wait this long? It really feels like he is choosing money over us. Or should I stick it out?

I'm in my 4th year of high school 

2021 wasn't my year. I was 20kg overweight, severe cystic acne, anxiety and depression, was struggling overall and I had to read the Bible everyday to not want to off myself. I'm a social person with a charismatic personality and for a few weeks. However, my struggles dampened it so at the end of the half term, I  had only 1 friend who was explicitly racist towards me, unhelpful and a terrible person overall last year. 
I felt miserable.

When school started this year, I told myself that I'd never let last year repeat. Luckily, I didn't go to a pwi school again. The girls I met first were amicable. I joined their friend group. 

I noticed right off the bat, their personalities didn't click with mine. I'm sarcastic, loud, daring and social. They were quieter and were amused at everything I did like I was a new species they'd never enocutered. In addition, I was often left out of their group to eat alone, was excluded in conversations and such... I went home feeling empty. Because this isn't what school normally is for me. Before late 2021, when all my tribulations started, I was in a friend group in school where we had fun with each other. had a few popular friend. (Note that when I'm not saying ""popular"" because of social ranks but  because popular people tend to the more extroverted ppl who match my personality. I don't approve of idolising people because of the number of ppl they have on their Snapchat). Anyway, every day after school, I felt feeling incomplete. Like I hadn't fulfilled what I needed to do. Like a puff of grey was leaving me not up to scale. But I never felt this way when I was around my more extroverted aquatntaices. I was able to be myself and enjoy life without ppl gawking at me. I didn't feel like the loud black girl in the group. These ppl ere just like me.. I didn't feel like a performer with the friend group as the audience because we were all the cast together. I felt happy leaving school after I'd spent time with them.

I love my friends, but I know I don't have to be best friends with everybody. Sosmtimes ppl don't click and that's okay. But I don't know how to leave the friend group. I have a new one that I hang out with most of the time rn but I still feel like a member of the previous friend group (we have all our classes together but I have none with my new friend group). I like them because I like ppl in general but I don't like them enough to be friends with them. More like acquaintances. I joined their group because I didn't want to be a loner and they were ready to take me in. But I don't like them on a friendship level.

One of the girls is particularly annoying she spread a rumour about me and thinks it's funny. She didn't support me when a girl was literally harassing me in front of her. And now she thinks it's alright to talk to me all the time. I've even made it clear I don't want to be close friends with her. Everyone else gets it but she's still trying. I know it when I talk to her: she doesn't see me as a person. She's entranced by me. Because I'm *that* streotypical black girl: (I like lip gloss, I like hoop earrings, I like feeling attractive, I use lots of slang, I like rnb and aftrobeats, I freestyle rap, I'm confident,  I like basketball, I like dance, I'm an avid church goer, I speak my native tongue, I'm extroverted).  I really don't feel like a person around her at all. If I'm not making her laugh or I'm more reserved then she'll ask ""are you okay? You seem off today"".  So what if I don't wanna talk about who and who or do some extreme crap? What if I don't feel like having you watch me with excitement as I galk about J Cole or Tupac? What if I don't feel like ""popping off"" if someone does me wrong while you cheer with your goofy smile ""go off, (insert my name)"". That's when you're gonna move on from me to your other friends? That's when you'll walk off in a group and leave me behind? 

When I'm with the other friend group, I feel much happier. I don't feel lacking. I don't feel like I need to be a stereotype performing in an 1800s freak show. But I really need this girl to get the message. I don't want to be friends with someone that spreads rumours about me being a tramp, doesn't stand up for her friend, doesn't help me study when I ask her cause I was absent but expects me to help her do her homework, assumes every joke I say will be sexual (cause I'm black) even though I never make crude jokes, makes me feel like a stereotype (even if she didn't mean to, I still feel that way around her), sees her own friend crying but won't help her or even talk to her, gossips about my struggles when I open up to her, makes me sit alone at the lunch table and to top of all off, I don't even like her that much to have her do all this. I want to end the friendship but I (platonically) love my friend. I don't want to hurt her but I'm tired of her hurting me.

My (31F) marriage is in the process of falling apart, and I am working on separating myself from my husband (29M). He and I have been together for over a decade, and married for most of that time, and I'm absolutely devastated, even though I initiated the separation.

My husband came out to me earlier this year as polyamorous. He had apparently been trying to figure things out for a while and hadn't known how to tell me. There was absolutely no infidelity, as he had not so much as spoken to another person. I agreed to give him the space he needed to explore that side of himself, as long as he came home to me.

I'm not poly, and I knew that going in, but I tried for the better part of 6 months to process and adjust to sharing him. I've never been comfortable, but when he's asked how I'm doing I've been honest but perhaps more rosy than I should have been. It doesn't really matter in the end. There was no putting this genie back in the lamp.

He recently fell head-over-heels for another woman who happens to have a small boy. For (my) health reasons, our plans to have children were squashed early this year, and so it created an immediate additional attachment to this woman. He desperately wants to be a father, and I get that. 

He started referring to her as his love, and tried to put us in a group chat. His previous relationship was completely kept separate from me, partly at my request, so this sudden introduction finally snapped into place the knowledge that I could never get comfortable with sharing him like this. I spent days soul searching, but I just feel like I have no other choice that allows us to both be true to ourselves. So I told him we needed to separate.

He's not been taking it well, going through grief basically in front of my eyes, and while he kind of understands, he doesn't want to lose me. Meanwhile, I am still in love with the man, and trying desperately to pull away for my long-term happiness. And because neither of us can afford a place on our own and none of our friends have space to put one of us up, we're trapped in the same apartment. We have a second bedroom that I'm slowly setting up as my space, but it was previously our doom room of boxes, so it's extremely slow going. 

Basically, I just needed to vent, honestly.

i really like the guy. don’t get me wrong, he’s the sweetest thing. probably the healthiest relationship i’ve been in (about a month and a half), we communicate our feelings to each other and we both feel like we can be ourselves around each other. but we live in the same dorm together and that has certainly put our relationship on the fast track. im not so sure that i like it. i recognized this and told him i wanted to take things slow but it’s hard when you’re basically living with the other person. plus, considering all that we’ve already done, it’s not like we can really take things slower, if that makes sense. 

at first, we had spent my first all-nighter together in a commonspace of our dorm. we clicked instantly and just started to hang out more, and i could tell right off the bat that he was flirting with me. being straight out of a breakup (i think less than a week), the validation felt nice but i firmly said no because i didn’t feel that way. he continued to pursue me and i eventually fell for his charm and persistence. but some days i’m unsure. this pattern has presented itself to me a couple times before, when i end up getting with someone simply because they like me or present themselves to me. i think it subconsciously feels safe. but if i was going out of my way to choose someone, i don’t know that i would haven choosen him. 

i enjoy the comfortability of having him, it’s unspoken that we see each other everyday, usually after our classes for the day ends. it was really nice at first but the more time i spent with him the more i picked up on some of his habits i didn’t like. some of them feel like they’re dragging me down. i told him about a couple of them, but a couple of them he can’t necessarily help so it’s not worth telling him because they would just make him feel bad and stuck. those things alone put the thought into my head that i was settling. 

i started seeing him pretty early onto the semester, and so his friends became my friends. i got a chance to make my own friends but they didn’t really pan out so now i really only have his left. if i were to break up with him i would undoubtedly lose those friends and though this should be between me and him, that’s a large factor, as much as i hate to admit. 

the last part of this is that i occasionally fantasize about a relationship with someone else. someone that doesn’t have those flaws, and i know that you’re supposed to love a person unconditionally for all of their little flaws, but i just can’t. so i guess i turn to someone who i imagine doesn’t have them. sometimes this is based in reality, sometimes not, but the fact that it happens is enough to make me feel guilty and wonder if a breakup would be appropriate. 

i talked to him about my thoughts (more focused on how it was bringing me down and that i didn’t like some of his habits he didn’t change after i had previously spoken to him in the past, not about the last part) and said i think i wanted a break, though, he called bullshit and said that just means a breakup at our stage in the relationship and he begged me for a second chance,  saying he would change. i still like him, it’s not like i don’t, so i took him up on it, but i’m wondering if i made the right choice. i know it’s hard to break a habit and i commend him for trying but sometimes i wonder if i deserve someone who never got into those self destructive habits in the first place. i also established that i would want him to change for himself, not for me and although he assured me that that would be the case, i don’t necessarily believe he would have initiated the changes in the first place if i didn’t say anything. plus, with this other guy, i’m sure it’s just the idea of the relationship that’s easy to romanticize, but as i said, it doesn’t feel fair i think about it in the first place.

this isn’t even two months in. i know this was a lot to read so if you made it this far thank you so much. i would really appreciate your help, reddit.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7594799,public,self,"questioning breaking up, please help",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzw90j/questioning_breaking_up_please_help/,all_ads,6,
