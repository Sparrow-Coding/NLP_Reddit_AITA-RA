I (F) have never had any serious problems or caused any drama between people. My friend group is pretty large, talking around 20-25 people and until recently we have sort of split in half. Until a few weeks ago , my friend who i cant name i‘ll just call JR (M) was making inappropriate comments at me and saying it was a joke so i listened. I struggle reading social queued and i reminded him of this many times but he continued but in the back of my mind i knew it was a joke. 
Then 3 of my other friends found out and their initial response was talk about him and tell CS (F) his girlfriend. I was quite good friends with her at the time and was nervous about doing it and i asked if we should really do that if he was joking. They then said he used to ask them too but stopped when they said that they felt uncomfortable. 

Heres where i made the mistake of listening and letting them convince me , they would keep forcing and we told the gf. I had never felt so bad or guilty and now every time i look at him my heart drops and i just want to break down . Before all this happened me and him i feel would just tell eachother everything . He was the one person i would actually talk to and open up to and i feel like now i dont have anyone. I dont know what to do anymore and i feel terrible for him .

On mobile, apologies for formatting errors. 

So 4 years, 2 kids later, I've come to understand my wife's point of view on a topic that has befuddled me for at least a year. 

We both work, myself M-Th, wife works 4 days as well but does this with an every other Saturday setup. 

Kids are 3 and 1.5. Both wonderfully challenging in their own ways. 

The dynamic / rolls we have fallen into leave both of us feeling underappreciated. I've fallen into the role of ""handyman"" - that is I do a lot of ""tasks"" but I have not done my fair share of the planning / monitoring. 

Wife has taken the role of manager, mentally exhausted with keeping various inventories full, meals planned, kids clothes, etc. 

As far as ""tasks,"" we share the load fairly evenly. As far as the mental load, I'm great with lists given to me but shitty with actually anticipating / seeing issues / anticipating her needs. 

Our arguments about this have fallen into the general back and forth of ""you do the bare minimum husband"" and ""I need help/support."" I give her time without the kids, I pick up more chores, but I have utterly and completely failed to understand that it's not the laundry, cooking meals, food prep, floors, and various handyman style projects she needs help with, but more the anticipation/planning/preparation side of the ""mental load.""

I feel superfluous, she has said just as much in a fight, telling me plainly that ""it would be easier to be a single mother because at least then I wouldn't be so bitter about you not helping."" Of course I angrily replied something along the lines of ""let's see how you manage with 100% of the workload then"" to which she replied ""fine, I'll do every chore you do but you do all of the mental work."" 

Now we fairly quickly apologized (well I did, she doesn't believe in apologies but that's another matter all together), and I want to change my behavior. 

I have MANY blind spots regarding the day in / day out of our family. 

Women, men of Reddit, give me your best, your worst, your empathy or your hatred --- I'm just looking to understand the ""mental load of being the 'more at home partner'"" so that I can be a better husband. 

Thanks in advance.

We only started dating decades later. I was super happy and proud to have such a wonderful partner. We understood each other but emotionally and mentally. We trusted each other with our dreams and decided to help each other achieve our goals.
For background, I'm in a more advanced career stage  than he is. It didn't matter. I really thought achieving his dreams would make him happy.
Our relationship was cozy, emotionally supportive and very loving. He wanted to move in with me inmediately, but I didn't agree.
Fast forward and he's not the person I thought he was. 
I'm tired. I'm exhausted I feel like I'm being taken for granted. 
He stopped pursuing me after a few months ( we've been together for a year, he changed 3 months ago. He treats me like a friend. We do have sex but I no longer feel cherished.
He's not abusive or indifferent. It's just that he's showing me a mediocre side that I detest.
I'm a go getter. I fight for what I want. He's only one exam away from a job he really wants but won't move forward because he doesn't wanna study. 
He never registered his LLC, despite needing so. He needs to renew a  certificate to get into another job that he wants AND NEEDS, but the days go by and all he does is sleep, eat and get a temp job when he's out of money.
I've tried to call him out on this mediocre lifestyle. He  acts like he's gonna actually do something with his like but gives up after 2 months. 
I'm so ashamed to admit this, but I'm so angry that I've begun to feel like he's less abd have begun to mentally judge his fashion sense. I've never done this about anyone. I just felt like he's chronically stuck on being a failure. 
I'm sick of the way he talks sometimes. It's like he still wants to live his life like he was in his 20s. 
 I'm not trying to cause damage. We shared something so beautiful and he has just let it slip away, that all I want is to break up and ghost him but I know ghosting is very hurtful. 
As an example of the situation, he repeatedly called me last week while I was in a meeting. He wanted me to write his resume. For the 11th time, I told his to just follow the guidelines that I sent him. Nope. He complained that it won't look good. I wrote his resume 7 months ago. But again, he would remember if he paid attention. I'm not gonna remind him. I know it's pretty but I spent a good chunk of my time writing it for  him so that he just sat in it and never distributed. 
I'm beyond the shock stage from back when he became distant. I need advice breaking up without creating a shit stink. 
Please offer advice as I don't even want to go point by point with him as I don't think I will make any difference.

We have both admitted to doing things that contributed to ruining the relationship. We've been together ten years and married for 9 of them. We married young and got into the relationship while we were both broken people, but went head strong into it anyway. Honestly the only thing that kept the relationship going as long as it did was the sexual chemistry we had with each other. Some things about the relationship though I don't want to just put on here because it's embarrassing on my part to talk about.

Basically right now we are somehow still really good friends. The biggest thing about the split is that I make 3 times more money than she does, and I know she is going to be struggling a bit. She brought a proposition to me recently and I'm not sure how I feel about it. She said she still wants to have sex with me because she enjoys it a lot, and doesn't want to just give herself to someone else(although she's already done that before during the relationship). Also in return I could kind of be like her ""sugar daddy"" and buy her little things here and there. I don't really know how to feel about it though. She set out some rules and it seems slightly iffy to me. The rules were we wouldn't sleep with other people, or kiss or any contact really at all with someone else. Talking to other people is okay, as well as going on dates with people. She said having someone over or going to someone else's house to watch a movie or hang out is fine. 

I really have mixed feelings about this. I don't have an issue with still sleeping with her as I enjoyed it as well. But the rules seem weird to me. I told her if she was sleeping around to tell me so we can see if we want to continue this proposition. If it was just a random person I did this with I really wouldn't care what they did as long as everything was protected. But someone I still have certain feelings for and do care about idk. I guess I'm worried she may be manipulating the situation a bit and she will sleep around but lie about it. Those rules just don't set easy with me. She has been manipulative in the past, so I'm not sure her intentions.

I want to start this update off by saying a huge thank you to everyone who gave me advice, resources, and just words of encouragement. Thank you so much! 

So yesterday after I read all of the replies, I had a really long heart to heart with my ex about this situation. I expressed that his distance and the whole idea of me essentially being a human incubator, really put me off. I told him to just be straight up and tell me what he wanted, because he kept changing his mind on everything we agreed on. 

He apologized to me and said he really didn’t mean for things to be this way and that he was so sorry for putting me through this. He then told me he didn’t actually know what he wanted and that the whole situation was freaking him out. He continued by asking me if I really thought abortion was a good option, that he had been thinking about it deep down too.

We’re in our early 30’s. She and her ex gf split up about a year and a half ago - mutual decision, they just weren’t happy anymore and had felt more like friends than romantic partners. They still live together. They rent a house with my gf’s sister. My gf’s sister is mentally and emotionally abusive and she’s also very close friends with my gf’s ex. So in general I’m just not comfortable being there. I don’t dislike her sister, I just try to limit my interactions. I try to be thoughtful about going over to my gf’s house just so that we aren’t spending all of our time at my place as she has a cat and plants to take care of at her house. I live on my own, so we spend a significant amount of time at my place because it’s easier to just exist and not have to worry about sharing kitchen space, being on edge when her sister is angry about something or feeling obligated to spend time with her ex gf. 

I have met my gf’s family and all of her friends and I have a close friendship with one of her best friends and I get along really well with her other sister, brother in law and all of their friends. We spend time with our friends, we go out to shows etc. so we aren’t in an unhealthy relationship- this aspect is just tough for me to accept.

Its difficult enough that her sister is really unpredictable and her ex being there just adds another uncomfortable layer to it. I just can’t seem to move beyond feeling annoyed that they still live together. The ex removed herself from the lease over a year ago and for some reason still lives there. My gf struggles with boundaries. If I were her I would have already had a conversation with my ex about a plan needing to be  made to move out. Instead, nearly two years post break up - they still live together. It’s bizarre and I don’t care for it. I don’t dislike her ex. I just feel like it’s made it impossible for me to feel like there’s room for me to make a place in her life with her ex being so interwoven in every day life. 

Can anyone relate? How do you stay sane and connected with your partner while also feeling uncomfortable about their living arrangement? We’ve talked about this and she has basically told me she can’t control what another adult does, that she keeps her distance more often than not and as soon as her lease is over she wants us to find a place together.

It went on longer than it should have, but some terrible circumstances happened to my ex-girlfriend and her family beginning in summer 2021 that I needed to be there for. For context, my now ex-gf and I were best friends coming out of grad school, we dated for a number of years after, and things were pretty good. As time went on though, the writing was on the wall for me that although I cared about her a lot and we were best friends, we were not compatible for marriage. 

In summer 2021, while it was becoming evident that this relationship had an expiration date, her father unexpectedly passed away, and then her closest uncle, who was like a second father figure to her, also passed away shortly after New Year’s.  In her grief, my ex started significantly abusing Xanax, and it has been a problem ever since. Being like a second son to her mother, who just lost both her husband and brother and now found her daughter with a drug addiction, I was there for her family throughout the last year as my already disintegrating relationship got worse. We mutually agreed to break up this summer but remain in contact to a degree given everything she was facing, and this has continued on a bit since I have been helping her get into a residential rehab facility and hopefully get her life back together. 

Even though this relationship only “officially” ended a few months ago, it had felt like an albatross to me for close to two years. I was ready for it to be over even before her father died. Over the last month or so, I have started dating a bit and have met a very nice woman who is pretty great. She has her life together, we seem to have a lot in common, and I’ve had a good time the five or six times we’ve gone out. However, I don’t really feel much for her at this point, but she is pretty great, and I’m fairly certain that if I stuck this out there’s a high chance she’d want to marry me. From what I can tell so far, she’d make a good wife and mother, no red flags or drama.

What I’m starting to wrangle with is if I just don’t feel it for this new woman, if it’s too close to my last relationship ending, or after what I just went through with my ex, I just need a break from dating for a bit. At the same time, I’m now 34 and have found someone who could very well be a great match for me. I don’t want to casually throw that away, especially after just been in a nightmare of a relationship, but I also don’t want to waste her time if it just isn’t there between us.

I confronted her, we broke up. I still love her and don’t know what to do. 

My GF, Sarah (20F), and I (20M) have been together for about 1 year and a half.  We are both college students in our third year pursuing different careers. She studies medicine meanwhile I study engineering. During that time we have gotten along great. We have had very few problems, we have always been on the same page on everything and we have always voiced our concerns before they got too big. We have planned out our wedding, decided to move together once we have enough money, even have the names for our unborn children. I love her with all my heart.

The problem comes in with this boy named Matt (20M). Matt met Sarah before me, since they both started university together studying the same career. During the first year they met nothing happened, they were simply friends since she was dating someone else at that time. They broke up halfway during the first year, and then right before finishing her first year she met me. 

When we first started dating she always said that he was just a friend, that nothing would ever happen, that I had nothing to worry about. 

I recently (this past month) had gotten a job, trying to earn enough money for us to move in together sooner rather than later. I didn’t have enough time to be with her since right before starting the job I had exams (ending of October). She told me she understood and I had nothing to worry about, we would always have some time to see each other. 

He has recently been talking more and more to her. She had voiced my concerns and I told her to ignore him and be short with him. Something she did do until this past week when she told him to stop pestering her anymore. He apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again. 

This past Thursday she went out with her university friends to a bar and afterwards a nightclub. This didn’t worry me at all since I trusted her. But then she stopped messaging me throughout the night. Something very uncharacteristic of her and suspicious. I gave her the benefit of the doubt since she hadn’t gone out with her friends since we started dating. 

The next day she went on as if nothing happened but my roommate who has a very close female friend in Sarah’s class told him that she had hooked up with Matt during the night. My roommate then told me. I confronted her hours later about it. She denied it at first but she confessed that she had hooked up with him. That it was a spur of the moment and wouldn’t happened again. I told her she betrayed my trust and that we had to break up. She reminded me of our future and what we had ahead. That she loves me and cannot love without me. I told her she should have thought about that before she did what she did. 

I still love her even after all of that. I can’t imagine my future without her. She has always been trustworthy and an amazing partner.

We were planning on moving out together but I realized that I felt like I was walking into a death trap living with this guy. My gut feeling was telling me that his abusive behaviour would be getting worst and that he would eventually beat me. For a bit of background context, we were play fighting and I ACCIDENTALLY poked him in his eye. He got so mad he immediately punched me in the thigh, and when he saw that I didn't give him the reaction he wanted he hit me again but harder... I lost it on him after that but I ended up getting convinced it was my fault. At the beginning of our relationship he was the sweetest, most considerate guy but now that I know him better I feel like it was all a facade. He is  not a kind hearted person, which he made it seem like he was at first. There has been so many red flags throughout the entire relationship but I loved him so much and the s*x was so good I felt absolutely addicted to him.... And even after everything a part of me still does and I'm scared. I've tried so many times to break up with him to protect myself and protect myself and my mental health... But I would end up running back to him because I wasn't able to take the emotional toll of not being with him... I'm scared I'm gonna end up running back to him. I don't know what to do to help myself move on from this guy. I've already blocked him on everything as he was trying to contact me through any means possible. He called me just to tell me to get tested... And that he has been fucking a bunch of his friends behind my back because the relationship felt already dead. However we have been spending practically everyday together in the last month so I don't know when or how he would've had time to do that with his work... I feel like he is just lying about that to hurt me because I've hurt him by leaving... Even after everything I don't understand how I can still be having feelings for him. I just want them to disappear but I really saw myself having a future with this guy and it breaks me to have to break things off because I don't have hope for a bright future with him. 

I would really appreciate some advice on how to move on and on how to stay rational with the whole situation. I've been going through a rollercoaster of emotions today. One minute I'm furious and confident in never wanting him again but the next I'm crying and planning what I could do to fix things and get things back to how they were. I feel so empty without him. I guess you could say I was codependent in this relationship. I feel like I still am. I want to cut all emotional ties but my heart just can't let go... I'm crying so much just typing this the screen looks all blurry and I have to keep on wiping my eyes to keep writing.

I dated my ex for 2 years and about 4 months ago she came to me, telling me that one of her co-workers told her that she's her type and that stuck her by surprise; but later on, my ex couldn't stop thinking about her and what she said. Then, she proceeded to tell me that she is still in love with me and wants to be with me and that she's not going to engage with her and avoid her. But the thing is... they're co-workers, and how much can you avoid meeting up with someone you work with, right?

Anyways, later, I find out that my ex DID, in fact, engaged in meeting up more.... they're in this group chat together with other colleagues from work, and they all went out several times. My ex even bought her chocolates when she went traveling on a business trip (the girl didn't attend it). So I sat down with her 2 months ago, asked her about everything and she pretty much admitted that she likes this girl and feels some sort of curiosity towards her (mind you, the girl has a bf too) and that she can't go against her feelings.

That was my last straw, and I broke up with her on the spot. The tricky part is that we lived together back then, so it took her some time to find an appartment but until then, it was a challenge to wake up and just be around her. The challenge was impossible at one point and we gradually gave in to the temptations and started kissing, and then s*x and then you can guess the rest. Finally, she moved out, and we started adjusting to that just-broken-up-living-separately lifestyle.

We kept in touch, we would see each other occasionally, we would even do sleepovers every once in a while. It was very relationship-like, BUT we weren't together still. We just kept each other close for our selfish needs. After some time, she went on this team building thing with the whole company staff and she told me that she and this girl sat down and decided that things went out of hand and that they rushed it a lot and that it's not fair towards me or the other girl's bf for them to stay in touch. So on that note, they decided on a strictly professional relationship from then on.

After that happened, me and my ex started to feel a lot like ""Us"" again. We kept talking about what we wanna do together and where we wanna go, she would tell me things like ""You're the girl that i want next to me"" or ""I can't imagine my life without you"" and it felt... genuine, and true? However, unfortunately, that ended being TOO good to be true due to recent events a few days ago. 

My ex was in Amsterdam to visit her best friend. Before she came back from the trip, she called me to sleep over at her appartment for a few days to have quality time. But she kept leaving me to be alone in the  apartment?? She would go to the office every day (she doesn't have to, she works hybrid) and even after her work she would hang out with a work friend of hers and would come back home in 9/10 PM. I felt the weird vibe and asked her if she met the girl in Amsterdam and she admitted to me that she did, but that it was nothing.

Basically, my ex met up with some coworkers in Amsterdam (the coworkers were on a business trip) and this girl came too. The girl came up to my ex at one point and told her that she felt bad ending contact last time. And of course, that got my ex's brain scrambled again. Which is why (to my assumption) she started avoiding me again. My ex was upset that i keep asking her about this girl. She kept saying how she thinks that ""some things don't have to be mentioned"" and that ""if we don't put accent on it, the crush will fade"" and for me that sounds ridiculous. 

First of all, they work together. Secondly, crushes don't just fade, especially if you keep engaging and if you see her around the office most of the time. Third, she had a second chance of redemption with us, and she fucked it up because she clearly made a choice to go for this girl that had a ""gay phase"" and now has a bf. I don't see their situation going anywhere tbh, but i think that THAT will teach her a valuable lesson and she'll carry that lesson with her future gf.

What hurts me the most is the fact that I KNOW that you develop crushes for others while you're in a relationship ONLY if you're somehow unsatisfied in your current one. And when i asked my ex what really awaked her curiosity, she said that this girl made her want to work on herself, and motivated her??? First of all, ouch. Second, i know I'm not perfect, and im humbe enough to know that i can be replaced... but i have always stood by her side, gave her emotional and mental support. If it weren't for me i know that she would've gone in a different direction. And she did that for me too. We brought up the best in each other, we were confident that we’re soul mates and that we would marry each other too.

So i guess i don't know what it is, and it's eating me alive. She had 95% with me and this girl had the other 5%... and in her mind, that's a 100.

I'm just trying to figure out what the right approach is here..I feel bad for believing her the second time and ignoring the red flags because i thought that she wouldn't be this stupid. We still haven't completely cut the communication, and i haven't erased her number or social media, but we're not like we used to be...and i guess that's how these things go.

I try to keep myself busy, but I feel like shit 90% of the time ...and i miss her so much. She was everything i ever wanted in a significant other, and now she's gone. I know it's for the best.... i know it. It just sucks, and I'm insanely mad at her for letting herself ruin this once-in-a-lifetime bond we had. What i DO know though, is that i gave my best to save this...but it was not mutial.

I'm too much of a fucking coward so I know if I don't get it out somewhere I'll probably keep hiding. 

It was maybe six years ago. A coworker showed me her tits, and I touched them. I don't have any excuse. My boyfriend is transgender and has been suffering gender dysphoria, but Iguess I just wanted to fulfill my want for boobs. Instead of communicating I went behind his back and got my fix elsewhere. It's sickening that since then he's managed his dysphoria better and years later let's me touch his chest since ""they're here until I can get surgery, might as well get something from it.""

On top of his dysphoria he's had treatment resistant depression for as long as I've know him. I'm supposed to be his crutch, and he's told me that if it wasn't for me he might not be alive now. I feel like going behind his back and breaking the biggest promise I'm just going to not only destroy his ability to trust me, but also just make his depression all-consuming. There's a not-zero chance he might be suicidal. There's a decent chance that I'm using this as excuse, but I can't keep looking him in the eyes and using the cute talk we use and watching him get excited over things and get some semblance of joy knowing that I cheated on him, and it's all just built on lies.

We’ve gone out 2 times and we talked about everything. Finally yesterday we went to a party together and ended up confessing to each other. We kissed briefly but we both felt it was not the time to go all for it. But she wants me and I want her. We know that something is bound to happen sooner or later. 

But there are some things I don’t understand. 

- Like where am I at this point in the relationship? 

-Is texting so important? Like should I text her everyday?

-She lives kinda far away (40mins) and I can’t imagine us meeting everyday with each other. Like maybe once a week outside of class? Is that good? 

- Its kinda complicated for me to bring her home because I live with my family and I imagine it being uncomfortable for her and even my family. She really insists in coming to my place. But says if i go to her place, her dad will probably smack me xD

- But the most important, what should my next move be??

I'm sorry for the novel so if anybody reads this, thank you.

I've been with my wife for almost 9 years, actually married for 2 but we've been together since we were just 17. I know I'm the asshole in this story. I know I'm the selfish one. I know. I don't need to hear that but I just need to get this out there, to say it. 

I'm not attracted to her anymore and I hate myself for it. I'm a monster. I want to run away, kill myself, something.

When we started dating I was the quiet kid in high school. I always viewed myself as fat and weird looking so I never even bothered trying to date anybody. who wanted to be with the quiet, weird, ugly, fat kid? I had a strong group of friends but needless to say I had no self esteem and no confidence. Right before my junior year ended we had school pictures and when we got them back it clicked. Holy shit. I'm not weird looking. I'm hot. Like really fucking hot and I'm really not that fat. I've got a bit of a stomach but I can hide it no problem if I suck in just a bit. But the broader point was that a confidence pilot light got flicked on. 

I got my first girlfriend over the summer and because she was my first kiss I became obsessed and didn't understand how toxic and horrible she was to me. We ended up calling things off and once the school year started I met my wife. We worked as office aides and were the only two that period so we didn't have much of a choice but to become friends. Right before the Christmas break I asked her out and she said yes. We've been together ever since.

This woman is my best friend and it's really not even particularly close. In college I struggled, hard. I went to a massive school and walked in with one friend that got there a year before me and I walked away with zero friends. I even fell out with my high school friends for reasons that I know are completely justified but even though they were in the wrong, they were all on the wrong side together so I'm the one who lost. Through it all she stuck with me. Her school was a little over an hour away so we saw each other once or twice a month on the weekends. 

Her school was a much smaller liberal arts college and she absolutely thrived. She was loved by everyone, incredibly involved, and even named homecoming queen her senior year. Because she was so busy, it limited how much she could get away to see me but it also affected her another way. Stress eating. 

She was never skinny, she's an athlete and she has a powerful frame to match it but in high school she played volleyball, softball, and basketball so she needed any food she could get her hands on to fuel her. Me being 6'4 and a little overweight, I naturally eat a lot so we developed our relationship around food and going on dates. The problem is she can match what I eat and at times can even eat more than me. We both gained weight our first two years of school but my weight gain was dramatically worse. I turned it around though and lost 50 pounds in the span of 7 months. It was just a change in how much I was eating and adding exercise but I wouldn't call myself healthy, I just wasn't fat anymore even if I was still eating like a 5 year old. 

At some point after I lost my weight I picked my wife up on a weekend and realized how much weight she had gained. It was jarring. I remember seeing her and thinking ""is that really my girlfriend?"" I had been with her just a month before then but for whatever reason it was just now hitting me how bad it was. I never said anything about it but I started encouraging her to go workout when she had free time but she just never had any so she didn't ever go. 

We got our master's at the same school and we started living together. We ate out way too much but I worked out frequently and my bad diet choices were strictly limited to dinners so I was able to maintain weight. She worked out occasionally but never made it a priority like I did so her weight kept creeping up and around this time she broke the 200lb mark despite being only 5'4.

I never wanted to lose her though, she's my best friend. I love her and I want to see the incredible person she can become. Everybody loves her and I could never forgive myself for hurting such an innocent and sweet human who always puts everyone before herself. I couldn't break up with her over something so artificial.

Once the pandemic started we had been living together for a year and a half and dating for over 6 years years. I proposed. We got married that fall and right before the wedding I started working my dream job. Meanwhile she was dealing with an incredibly stressful master's program and the stress eating continued. We had conversations around her weight but never directly about my attraction and the conversations never went well. There was always a reason why she couldn't work out or eat healthy. 

After graduating she got a job where she was underpaid, underutilized, and not in her field. She was depressed and the stress eating got worse. After a year in that position she got a job teaching at a private school and thanks to her experience playing basketball in high school she was asked to help coach the girls basketball team. She loves this new job and cares more about the kids than they will ever realize. They have no idea how much time and effort she puts into them. Now that basketball practice and games have completely destroyed her schedule and she doesn't get home until after 7 most nights. The stress eating keeps happening, she still doesn't have time to exercise, and when she does tell me what she eats at lunch (which is provided) I'm always shocked at how much she gets voluntarily.  

It's so hard to see attractive women everywhere we go and know that I'm not attracted to my wife anymore. I know my wife is a better person than all of these women but seeing guys who I know I'm more attractive than with girls way out of their league is just frustrating, especially when I know I have a good personality and to say I'm interesting is selling me short (I understand this post doesn't necessarily paint a ringing endorsement of myself and you're rolling your eyes right now but it's true). I wish I could say my wife is hot. I wish I could say that but I can't. She's cute, I will say that but I think about our wedding day and seeing her in her dress and I couldn't help but think that she looked great. Not stunning or breathtaking or radiant or even beautiful. Just great. 

I hate that I feel this way. I hate it. I hate it but I can't help it and it won't stop. I've developed a porn addiction now and at this point I don't know if it's because I'm not attracted to her or if it's causing me to be less attracted to her. Probably both. We still have sex but it hurts when she's on top because she's so heavy. She can't fit into 2/3 of the clothes in her closet. We've talked about it before but she still won't make changes. My weight has always fluctuated and I've never been in great shape but in the past 4 months alone I've lost 25 pounds, down to 230, I'm still 20 pounds from my weight goal and she keeps gaining weight even though I'm telling her exactly what I'm doing to lose weight and encouraging her. We weigh the same now. I'm a guy, exactly a foot taller than her, and I still have weight to lose and we weigh the same. 

When people say that their spouse is the best person they've ever met I think it's always bullshit but in my case it's true. She's an angel but I just wish I was attracted to her. I could never lose her, I want her in my life and I don't want that to ever change but I wish even once I could spend a romantic evening out with somebody who makes people's heads turn. I catch girls staring at me. She's caught girls staring at me. I've never caught guys staring at her. 

I push her delicately and I try to motivate her and for the first time a few months ago I even sat her down and told her I was concerned about her health because of her weight but I've never told her my attraction is fading because I know it will crush her.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7600488,public,self,I'm not attracted to wife anymore and it is killing me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0gxkv/im_not_attracted_to_wife_anymore_and_it_is/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Long post ahead - posting this because I feel uneasy and honestly just sad about the situation, and need some perspective. So, I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for 2 months and he’s great. We love each other and it’s definitely a serious relationship. He comes from a tight-knit, small family and is close to his mom. He offered a few times that I meet his whole family and come by his house, but I told him we should wait because at that point we were only a month-maybe some weeks into the relationship. However, I always wanted to meet his mom (I’ve briefly met his brother - lovely person) because they’re all so close and honestly, I’ve always wanted to have a close connection with partner’s family. I also don’t know many people in the state I live in and really wanted to start building a relationship with his mom, who also just works and really doesn’t have any friends here either. So, I told my boyfriend I wanted to really meet her and he was excited. I asked that he please called her and kindly ask her if she was okay with meeting me because I really want to get to know her. Well, he was busy…didn’t call and texted instead. I’m a very sentimental person and like to send intentional messages and I told him to please word it nicely, but he ended up just saying something along the lines of “Mom, I’ll bring my girlfriend by the house tomorrow because she would like to meet you”. I didn’t like that text at all because I wanted him to ask her if 1. She was free, 2. If she was open and comfortable meeting because well, it’s also her house and I won’t show up if I’m not wanted. But he did it his way and she ended up replying saying that she wants us to be together for more time and that we should really love each other and that he’s sure I value his love. She kept saying that he’s her life just like his sister and his brother…basically, declined meeting me and it just made me so sad. I was okay with her saying no to meeting, but I’m not sure… reading her responses made me feel super rejected and sad (some other things have been said in the past by her that trigger these feelings too - and I’ve talked about it with my boyfriend). I felt this sickness when I saw her replies. And it especially hurt me because my boyfriend didn’t tell me what she replied with (I saw her replies on his phone when I was playing a game) - he just told me she said she was busy and that was it. I had a whole gift ready to give her and maybe I’m overreacting, but it just made me sad and like I’ll never be able to be a part of their family, which I’ve also talked to my boyfriend about before because there’s a lot of codependency in their family structure. Also, I think I just feel sad because on the contrary, my mom has been so excited to meet my boyfriend and asks about him and they’ve even talked. They haven’t met yet because we live in different states, but she’s been so eager. Not only that, but my mom has been non-stop asking me why I couldn’t meet his mom because she knew I worked so hard to get her this nice gift and was excited. She’s also been asking if everything is okay because I sound “low”. So, I guess that just keeps reinforcing the sad feelings. Anyways, I just wanted to ask for any perspectives? I know my feelings are valid, but I also don’t want to keep tormenting myself because I’m sure there was no ill intention with the mother in law’s replies, and my brain is just misconstruing it…maybe. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend about it but I don’t want to bring it up again because he didn’t even tell me her actual response and just told me she said she was busy…so obviously he told the white lie to I guess not hurt my feelings. But, I just feel stuck, sad, and rejected. I also have spent all major holidays alone the last 4-5 years and I was hoping this time around would be different, especially since he wanted me to spend it with his family…but clearly that won’t happen because his mom is not comfortable with me at their home (they all live together). Also, this is my first boyfriend/relationship. So, any words of encouragement or similar stories or advice?

She’s the type of girl to date multiple guys at the same time, I’m not. She’s pretty self centered too and she stays on her phone all the time. 

When we hung out after work, she mentioned that another girl liked me but didn’t tell me who it was. While we’re eating, I asked her if she had a sister. She showed me a picture of her, and it’s my work crush! She said “Yeah that’s the other girl I was talking about. She was fighting me over you.” 

I was pissed because I really took the wrong sister on a date. I ended up telling her how I felt a few days later and told her I don’t want to move on and that I wanted to talk to her sister first. She gave me a salty response but understood.

I tried to give me work crush my number (because we followed each other on Instagram and she already liked me) but she said no out of respect for her sister. I was actually shocked but understood why.

My question is, if I wait a few months, could I shoot my shot again? Me and her sister went on one date and fizzled out in less than a week. No sex, no kissing, nothing intimate. Or is this a “you just lucked out” type of situation? 

I think her sister did it out of spite. If you’re  dating other men and I’m not you’re type, why would you not throw your sister a bone and help her talk to a guy she likes??",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7600440,public,self,I took the wrong sister on a date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0gs80/i_took_the_wrong_sister_on_a_date/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Also I am looking for advise on how to make the situation better please no ""just break up"" comments.

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (26m) for four and a half years. We met in collage and finally moved in together 7 months ago. I truly believe that he is the one for me. We are very compatible when it comes to motivation, morals, the way we treat each other, even sense of humor. So I would definitely describe us as a happy couple.

However, when it comes to the domestic, everyday things I feel like we are entirely different and it drives me crazy at times. We like to do different things, have different routines and overall different interests. The movies, books and games that I like he strongly dislikes and vise versa. I am vegetarian and he isn't so we cook different dishes and just eat them together. The way I want to decorate the house seems tacky to him, and the way he wants it is messy for me. I want a cat, he wants a dog. We literally sound like a cliche couple from a 90's romcom. I am even laughing while I am writing this but it is the truth and it is very frustrating. 

It is just that every evening one of us has to make a compromise on what we will eat, watch, do ecs. I am of course okay with making compromises but I wish we had one thing that we both really enjoyed doing that we could do together and bond over. Truthfully we have the best time at home when he is in the office and I am in the bedroom and we just do our own thing. My friends tell me how they love living with their partner and how they would never live alone again. And I keep thinking that I was more happy when I had my own space. I feel very guilty about it because I truly love him and I used to really enjoy spending time with him and now I am searching for alone time all the time. When we were living separately we saw each other 5-6 days a week so it was like we were living together, but these problems weren't there. I do not know what changed and why I suddenly feel so frustrated with him when I was perfectly happy before moving in. 

Foe people who are living with a partner do you have any advise on how to make it better? Was there an adjustment period when moving in together or where you happy form the start?

Like I used to have a ghost account to see how they work and what kind of people were there out of curiosity. Now I have been single for two years, and as I left university I have a hard time meeting new interesting people.

It seems like I'm in the 10% because I have many match on Bumble / likes on Hinge. Getting a date isn't hard either and I've been out on a date at least once a week, none of them were particularly cringe or awkward but rather enjoyable.

I struggle with the next step. I am missing the intimacy of a relationship, but I don't want it from any of the girl I've met. I'm the kind of guy who develops feelings after knowing someone for quite a while, and the timeframe inherent to dating apps is way too short for me. I also think that I'm quite close to being demi sexual, i.e. I am physically attracted only to people I have feelings for. So hook ups or being a fuck boy don't really work for me.

I do fantasize about girls I will meet, but it is the context of an imaginary relationship, that lives in my head only. The whole thing breaks when I actually meet her because imagination gives place to reality, and reality is someone I've just met.

My boyfriend who I’ve known for over 2 years won’t tell me where he’s from. For context, I met him in college as he was an international student and has worked in the US after graduating on a work visa. 

 I had a general understanding by his name and the people he hung out with and just looking at him that he was from somewhere in the middle east as he broke down where his parents were from 2 years ago. 

 Ever since, he told me he cut his entire family out of his life and has said he didn’t get to choose his family so why would he feel the need to speak to them. Also saying things like he plans on changing his last name. Recently, I told him it would be hard for me to be with someone and know only so much about them. I personally feel like these are basic things. 

 Coming from a difficult family as well I had to set boundaries with I completely understand being uncomfortable but he claims nothing happened he just chooses to disassociate from people that bring no value to his life. He also said it makes him uncomfortable to talk about but it was also irrelevant. 

  I’m not quite sure what’s going on. I told him it didn’t align with my values and unfortunately I feel like I have to make a choice I don’t want to and it feels very selfish on my part. Should I wait for him to be comfortable or cut my losses? I don’t feel like he’ll ever be comfortable and eventually will see me as someone who brings no value as well.

We both haven’t been in many other relationships. He has a handful of friends and some are women, but that never concerned me. Just one. We’ll call her Sarah.

 Sarah and my boyfriend had been friends for a few years after meeting at work. He at one point in time had feelings for her but she didn’t feel the same. Sometime later down the road she had feelings for him but he didn’t feel the same. It didn’t end up working out for them, my boyfriend “needed her more as a friend than a girlfriend.” What triggered this post is that yesterday he bought a pair of underwear that were comedic themed. He took a picture of this underwear in the mirror, wearing a shirt, turned to the side so really all you could see was his butt and legs in the underwear. He sent this to me and i jokingly replied “better not show that to anyone else” assuming that he’d want to show all his friends his fun undies. Today, he told me that he sent the picture the Sarah. I just sat there shocked and upset. 

It feels like i’m overreacting but i don’t know what to do. He tells me that she’s his best friend and redefined what a friend was supposed to be in his head. he told me that she would be his best man, that she’s one of the boys. Their past just sticks in my head. They’ve seen each other naked while changing and she’s sent him a nude in the past (just one) to “make him feel better” while he was sad. Before we started dating she sent him a picture of her boobs after she got them pierced and he kept it. When i asked him to get rid of it he told me that he wasn’t going to go out of his way to find it and delete it. That if he stumbled upon it again he would delete it.

The 3/4 of the relationship was amazing, we would always go out and do things, make eachother things, super active intimately, always affectionate and close, joked around lots, had the same taste in music, adventurous, etc. Literally every box ticked for the perfect relationship for me

We both came from abusive bad relationships and then found eachother, our first real love

For the past while now, a lot of it has started to fade out. intimacy slowly getting less and less frequent, with only me bringing it up, which really makes my happiness tank as my drive is decently high. When I ask her about it she just says that she doesn't ever think about it, or that she's not really interested, which confuses me considering the majority of our relationship we were both super involved with it. We rarely kiss anymore, like once a week maybe. We both still absolutely love cuddling. Other than cuddling though there's really no affection. She doesn't want to go out and do anything with me anymore, doesn't like listening to music very often.

She has been in a bad spot mentally for the past while now, for many reasons, most of which she doesn't want to share with me because she's bad at communicating that way. Some of which involves uncertainty about us, which I share the same feeling. A big one is that she's never really had her own space, and now with me she has difficulty setting things up how she likes because it's not fully hers **(her first time moving out, when she lived with her parents she didn't get to control even her own room really. I moved from living with a roommate to here)** and it's stopping her from being able to grow. I've proposed the idea that we try and make things work, but we move apart. That way we both get our own space to express ourselves and grow individually, maybe have the distance/missing eachother early on reignite some of that fire, 'less is more' style. And worst case, if it doesn't work out, it'll be a hell of a lot easier than if we were still living together.

idk what Im really trying to ask here, but any advice? Words of wisdom, brutal honesty? I just really miss the intimacy and affection we shared, I long for it so so much. I never felt more alive, more connected to myself and to her, then when things were good.

Me and my wife (both 25) have a toddler and she’s 7 months pregnant. She’s the main breadwinner since starting up her Amazon business 2 years years ago. 

I work from home and she takes care of our child and pays our mortgage off, pays our bills and food shop, while I make sure we go on nice weekends away and go on holidays and pay for our leases on our cars.

I’ve been suffering from a low libido while hers is higher than ever. The reason for my low libido is I’m depressed and have low self esteem.

Last week she sat me down and said point blank she’s tired of the constant rejection she faces from me every night, and if I want her to keep paying bills I have to have sex with her whenever she wants, give her passionate kisses, and touch her sexually throughout the day.

So everyday for the past week, I dread when it’s time for bed. She always makes us do 69 every night and whatever position she wants till she’s finished.

For the majority of my(F21) life (I’m working on it now) I’ve been a very insecure person. Throughout my life, I’ve been told a handful of times things that makes me feel hurt- they’re realistic, but nonetheless hurt. Whenever I’ve had a period of improvement on the way I see myself, Or when discussing confidence and looks in general, I’ve gotten answers such as - “I mean of course there are girls that are prettier than you but you’re still really pretty”. And: “I mean, you’re not on Gigi Hadid’s level but you’re still pretty”.

These types of comments to me seem a bit mean and unnecessary. Am I being weird? It just seems like there’s a fine line between being realistic and staying respectful and then being rude. After these kinds of things have been said I always find myself feeling down and getting in my head about my looks. It also hurts more because these are close friends that know how I feel about myself and that I’m trying to improve.

I am a 25F my boyfriend of seven years is a lot older than I am, 42M, when we first met I was an 18 yrs old kid with daddy issues who got attached to him so hard because he fill a void in me I didn't know I needed, he helped me with my insecurities, he supported everything I wanted, he helped fix my relationship with my family, everyone I know respects me because they know I have him by my back. tbh after all these years IDK if I fell in love with him or with the security he gave me, I genuinely love and respect him, I love spending time with him, and we have so much in common despite the age gap, we live together with my family.

recently, after seven years I realized I am starting to fall out of love with him, I don't desire him anymore, I get relieved whenever he's not around although I am not doing anything, I force myself sometimes to be with him, either sexually or just casually. we both have flaws that we thought we will overcome and fix them together, he's very possessive and jealous, if I just touch my phone he keeps asking and nagging me who am I talking in a very suspicious way, I never cheated on him and yet his insecurities make him doubt every single thing I do even if I stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes longer he assumes i am staying there to avoid him or if I got dressed up while going out he always assume it's for someone else when i confronted him about his insecurities and how it's exhausting for me to have to always reassure him there's no one else on the silliest matter, he blames me for not helping him out with his insecurities as he did with me, he always says that the age gap makes him think I don't want him anymore and I want someone my age and more handsome, at first I used to assure him it's not like that because it was the truth, but now I keep reassuring him (out of habit or fear of hurting or losing him) but now he's right, i do feel like i want to grow out of this relationship because it's not going anywhere and it's exhausting me.

he knows from the beginning that eventually I will end up with someone else because I want to have children and he can't, he used to say to me that we will always be best friends and family and I want to see you get married and see your children even if it's gonna hurt me. and now I just think that the relationship arrived at a dead end and I don't know how to take it from there.

he feels me and knows me very well, he reads my mind before the ideas even formulate inside my head, at first I used to love that about him but now it's just scaring me, I am shutting everything inside me just to avoid making him feel like I don't want to be with him anymore, but he feels it.

I have a crush on someone we both know, I didn't act upon it at all, I don't even exchange any word with the guy when we see him but I've been thinking about him and somehow my boyfriend knows, he had a dream I was with him the same night I went to sleep thinking about him.

I mean this level of connection is rare and priceless, but scary as hell. 

I promised him I would always be honest with him but recently I wasn't whenever he asks me if I am happy with him or if I want to continue staying with him because honestly, I don't want to hurt him, he doesn't deserve this, and I know it will sound selfish but I don't want to lose him, I want to keep him as my best friend but without the romantic relationship commitment.

So I (23F) have a situation-ship with this guy (24M) we have known each other since 9th grade almost 10 years ago. We have essentially talked non stop since then. During this time it was known that we were really just friends and shared stories about our relationships. However we always talked about us in the Future and us getting married and starting a life together. Now in 2022 we have tired to start formulating a relationship although we were living over 600 miles away from each other . He is a great man and is everything a girl would want ( manifests with me , listens , cares, trustworthy, etc.)  Things were fun over the first couple of months we went on a few trips and spent so time together . However I can’t get this nagging feeling off of me. I don’t crave him , like I don’t wanna snuggle and wear matching PJ’s , cook dinner together all that relationship stuff. Like for example he will ask me to have phone sex or send him nudes but like nothing in me craves to do that with him. I have felt this way with other people so I am unsure the problem.I feel like we’ve never fostered that part of our relationship, because of the fact that during (5 years of this time I have lived away) but with all the distance - now over 1,600 miles as I have moved even further . I don’t know if I wanna keep pursuing this.  I love him so much but I feel like it’s not really fair to him or me to not experience that part of a relationship.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7600296,public,self,"Known partner over 10 years, I don’t crave him anymore, help!",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0gato/known_partner_over_10_years_i_dont_crave_him/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So yesterday I (m25) went to visit one of my best friends from university and we ended up going on a night out to some bars and clubs with a few of her friends from home.

One of her close friends, let’s call her A, I had met before a couple years ago when she visited us at uni and another couple times when I visited my friend, but nothing happened, although we have always got along but never gotten a proper chance to talk.

Also, I did mention to my uni friend at one point that I thought A was really attractive but my friend said she doesn’t want to mix her uni friends with her friends from home so I kind of just left it

Anyways, so It kind of started earlier in the  day, and I was speaking to her, and for some reason it just felt so natural and I felt really happy when I was talking to her.

Later on in the night, I heard her saying she was feeling cold (november in the Uk is pretty chilly at night), and again for some reason my instinct was to just instantly give her my puffer jacket I was wearing. 

After that, we started getting more and more flirty with each other as the night progressed, and at some point we get to a new bar. 

I’m standing outside having a smoke with her and she won’t stop staring at me. I could feel this crazy connection between us. 

It is kind of that look that girls give when they want you to make a move, but honestly I was too nervous at that moment (forgot to mention, she is literally stunning and absolutely my type)

She grabbed me by the hand and we went back inside together and started dancing together and getting closer and I decide to just make the move and we kissed for quite a while. 

Also Over the next couple hours we kept flirting more and kissing.

So we get to the final club of the night and we end up dancing together and kissing a lot.

We go to the outside seating for a smoke and now we start to properly open up to each other

She told me that she thought I was really attractive and I said she was as well and that I had a crush on her when I first met her at uni and she said was the same but was with someone else at the time

We start showing each other our pets, what music we listen to and that type of thing 

At one point I then I ask her whether she has travelled much and she tells me she wants to go to Japan late next year, Which is a crazy coincidence as I have been planning to travel there myself later next year 

A bit later I decided to ask her whether she would be down to hangout just me and her soon and she said that yeah she would

Now at this point the night is ending and me and A want to smoke a joint together back at my friends house where we and my other uni friends are staying the night

But my friend tells A there’s not enough room for her to stay. A then tells me we could go back hers but again my friend basically decided that we shouldn’t and although all I wanted was to go to A’s house, I didn’t wanna start any drama as we were celebrating my friends boxing match and It was her night, So we end up getting different Ubers home :(

Now since I got in that Uber, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her and as crazy as it sounds, I think I might be in love 

All i want is to see her again as soon as possible, However there’s a couple things I’m unsure of

1. Do I need to speak with my friend before messaging A to organising something (we’re not at uni anymore so I don’t rlly see why I should have to) and should I tell her I can’t stop thinking about her or is that a bit much so soon?

2. How is it possible to fall for someone this quickly? I haven’t felt like this with any previous girls, like I’m even getting butterflies just thinking about her

Sorry for the long pos but yeah I’d love to hear your thoughts on the situation :)

Let's call her Alice. Our parents arranged the meeting in order for me to show her around my city. When I first saw Alice I was taken aback at how beautiful and innocent she looks. As we walked through the streets my shyness kept me from talking much, and I also didn't show her and tourist attractions so I feared I was being a bad guide. But then I quickly that she is a rather shy and introverted person herself, doesn't like busy city life or tourist attractions.  



After a little less than two hours I handed Alice over to her mother and we exchanged numbers. Unfortunately Alice was only in town to visit her mother who lives her, Alice lives in a different country. One day after the city tour she took the plane to get there but we have been texting almost daily ever since.   

Although we only met for two hours I became obsessed her. She is the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to sleep. Let me describe her to make my obsession understandable:

She has blonde hair and radiant green eyes, and a soft, adorable voice. She is 20 but her overall appearance (and her braces) maker her look 16/17. Nonetheless, she is very mature and independent for her age. Her interest are typically feminine / girly as she loves animals - horses in particular - and romance novels. She also likes talking about psychological topics and we both like Attack on Titan so there are mutual interests. 

Overall I would describe her as very kind, selfless, intelligent and self aware. To me she symbolizes innocence, beauty and purity both in terms of her physical appearance and her personality. 


She says that I idealize her and it's true that I'm infatuated with her so I probably exaggerate but fundamentally I don't feel like I deserve her. Deep down I think that I'm a bad person who doesn't deserve to be in possession of someone as precious as Alice.   



She knows that I have romantic feelings for her. Lately I often wake up at like 3am in the morning, those are times I feel especially lonely and I'm willing to confess how much she means to me. 

I'm too shy to ask if she likes me back but I know that she is in a relationship with another girl though there are some problems in that relationship. She says she wants to be just friends but I think I blew this opportunity when I told her I think I'm not good enough for her.

She didn't believe me so I confessed to her some bad things I did I feel guilty over. She still doesn't think that I'm a bad person but her perspective is that I obviously want her to believe that I'm a bad person. Also, she says what you believe about yourself becomes true.

To be honest this reaction made me sad because I deep down hoped she would tell me that I do deserve to be her friend but I guess there's truth in what she said. 

Due to being lonely and for other reasons I think I have a tendency to be co-depenent. I obsess over her, make my happiness dependent on her love and affection for me and that's not healthy. We used to talk for hours every day and I wasn't able to sleep without her telling me goodnight. I have a deep curiosity about her, I want to know everything about her. 

Also, she told me that she never traveled outside of Ukraine before the war began which means her family is probably not that wealthy, she's younger than me, and arguably in a more difficult situation than I am with her mom living in a different country and her dad back in Kiev. Yet I, ostensibly much more privileged, am much more immature and emotionally dependen on her.

Fear of rejection sometimes makes me think it's better to live alone. When you make your happiness dependent on other people's love for you, you become weak and vulnerable because you inevitably get disappointed and people die. I long for her in moments of melancholy but this is what post nut clarity tells me. 


Anyways, after I told her that I don't think I deserve to be her friend and she accepted it we also agreed that if I start to love myself and consider myself worthy of being her friend we can become friends again.

I don't know what to do. Should I forget about her? Try to get my life together so I have more self esteem so I feel worthy of her? If so, how? And how should I treat her differently?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7600286,public,nsfw,How do I stop obsessing over this girl?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0g9is/how_do_i_stop_obsessing_over_this_girl/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,

Everytime we see each other or text we get super flirty with each other, and touchy in real life, however, there is one thing that's bothering me about her. She takes too long to reply, and I'm talking hours, and sometimes even days. This wouldn't bother me, although I don't believe someone is busy enough to text at all, not even say goodnight back, it would only take seconds. But the thing that bothers me is I often see her online for a long time, and then she goes offline without reading my message or replying. Multiple times. I don't know why she does that, she's never told me, and I'm too afraid to ask her. It wouldn't be my problem anyway, I just find it hurtful. And the only reason I find it ""hurtful"" is because when she does actually reply, it's always exaggerated and flirty and happy as if she didn't just ignore my message for a long ass time then replied to it later. And as if she doesn't clearly see that I texted her in the notification bar or when she's online on whatsapp. I think I'm attached to her now so it affects my mental state when I see her doing this.

It really has me confused as she's still clearly interested, always asking what I'm doing, asking me to send her pictures and compliment me later, she sends me stuff too, and tells me what she did during the day etc.. even though I didn't even ask her. I've been ignoring what she's been doing and never told her about it, and I'm still flirting with her and giving her attention like nothing is happening and she's accepting it positively, and giving back, but only at her own pace. 

Is she only replying whenever she wants attention? Or does she feel bad for leaving me hanging? Or is she only online because it's something serious? Is she nervous/shy i.e doesn't know what to reply to me?

This girl, although I feel bad saying this, clearly has depression and frequently pulls all-nighters. Don't know if this is related.

What is she doing and what should I take from this? I think I'm attached so when she does this it really affects my mental state, that's why I want to do something about it, let it be confront her about it, cut her off, etc .",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7600286,public,self,The girl I've been texting daily for the past months just takes too long to reply sometimes..,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0g9hn/the_girl_ive_been_texting_daily_for_the_past/,all_ads,6,,,,,
