Before that he was super loving and amazing with me and (yes we‚Äôve had problems but, not all the time and those we were working on getting past) we were happy. 

Since then, he‚Äôs just really distant, quiet and doesn‚Äôt say much to me at all and I wonder if I didn‚Äôt say anything to him (hugs or kisses ‚Äòlove you‚Äô etc. I‚Äôd be sitting in silence here). I thought maybe it was because he was embarrassed about what happened and ashamed (the house was turned upside down) but, it‚Äôs been a while now and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how we can be back to normal again and have a normal conversation as he shuts down most things I say. And today, I walked some of the way with him to work as I was gonna go to the shop I don‚Äôt even know if he said he loved me back when I said it (he stopped saying it first after the incident - but says it back if I say it). 

For context - we work together same shift, but work in a warehouse so we don‚Äôt see each other too much and only take breaks together and travel to and from work together. He doesn‚Äôt have any friends and has isolated himself from his family, I have friends but I haven‚Äôt seen them in a while (despite trying) and most of them don‚Äôt live close enough to visit regularly. We live together and spend weekends together (I do think we probably spend too much time together but, I don‚Äôt really know how to change this). I‚Äôm not at work today as I‚Äôve taken the day off to take our cat to the vets and pick him up - I was excited to have the day to myself but after seeing him go I feel sad.

As a backstory, we‚Äôre both in our 20‚Äôs, he was diagnosed with clinical depression since he was a little boy, this also being the reason why we broke up. His depression got worse and he no longer wanted to contribute to the relationship, communication got stale and so on. This happened nearly a year ago, but we never really stopped reaching out to one another. We had a few trials and errors of getting back together, until I started feeling like it was all too complicated and we both decided that we‚Äôre better off alone. 

Some time passed by and I started dating this other guy (M, 20) one month ago. He is the sweetest, most kind person ever. But the connection is not there for me. I feel like he could give me everything I want out of a relationship: communication, affection, safety etc. But I often find myself thinking and dreaming about getting back with my ex. I‚Äôve never felt such a profound love for anyone else. 

A few days ago, my ex reached out to me saying he wants to reconcile. 
My mind tells me that I should stay with this person who gives  me everything I want, but my heart wants that reconciliation with my ex.

I recently found out that after she broke up with me she had sex with this guy (her ex) one week later. And then they became fwb. 
Now some time ago, she invited her friends over and at one time they started talking about this guy, how good he's doing, that he's got a great girlfriend, rich and hot. My gf needed to go to the bathroom, but her friends kept talking and they one friend slipped and basically told that she lost her virginity to him one week after dumping me.

Now i decided to talk to her about it few days after it - i didn't tell her that her friend said this, i don't want to be a dick. I asked her if she could tell me how long it was before she had sex with him she just said that she doesn't remember at all. I mean it's her virginity so I don't think she could have forgotten this easily. But later in the conversation I called this guy ""her ex"" and she clenched her jaw and angrily said ""don't call him that, he's not my ex, his my friend"" never seen her this angry about something. And just to clarify, this guy is her ex-boyfriend as well as ex-fwb, yet she claims he's not.

Granted she ended their fwb relationship to be with me, but something feels really off about this. Oh and when they were breaking up he told her he loved her like no one else ever would. 

And also he pulled the biggest hoover manouver ever. He (pretended) got lost and some cult wanted him dead and he couldn't stay in the country because it would endanger her life. As they would go after her to get to him. Oh and the kicker is, he never left the country, the only thing he did was to get off Facebook so that they won't be able to find him. And THEY HAD HIS WALLET AND PHONE, LOL.

but she believed him and was there for him until he got crazy mad at her for not wanting to be with him even after this. He called her names and made her feel like shit, like his kidnapping was her fault.

The panic attack happened last night even though we sleep over at each other's 4 or 5 days / week consistently

Some details about us / our relationship

* I (29M) have been dating her (30F) for a year
* First 9 months was incredible. The last 2-3 months have been more difficult - more fighting. Nothing aggressive or physical - usually emotional differences (e.g., didn't like I was spending time with a platonic female friend, I felt like we weren't high energy enough on a recent trip, she didn't feel like I was prioritizing her in certain situations)
* I think - in general - I recognize these 2 months to be a low point in our relationship, but I'm not certain she considers it the same or is analyzing it the same way. I feel like these fights might be us trying desperately to hold onto something
* FYI - this is how my last relationship ended. But there was no communication. I'm committed to communicating this time
* We have are similarities - we each have our phone vice (TikTok / Youtube), we like to read, grew in similar socioeconomic households, share similar friends, share love of our city &amp; city energy, love to travel and travel together
* We have our differences - I work more / am more intense / physically active, educational backgrounds/ levels are different and may manifest in how we parent potential children, she's more emotionally available

&amp;#x200B;

What I am looking for advice on

* How do I explore these feelings in a way that's fair to me and to her? I don't want create strife unnecessarily if this is a one off. But I also feel strongly that keeping this from her is disingenuous
* How can I limit the physical impact this has on me in the short term? I got 4 hours of terrible sleep last night, can't sustain that
* A wrinkle is that she is coming home with me to meet my family for Thanksgiving (I am going to hers for New Year's). Do I tell her before Thanksgiving, and put more pressure on an already slightly difficult situation for her? Or do I wait?
* Anything else that comes to mind reading my post",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7613638,public,self,I believe I had a panic attack about my relationship last night.

My main problem is that he can't be depended on to take care of himself. Since getting together, he has been besotted with me and wants to spend all our time together. But because of this, he has been flaking on his friends, not doing his martial arts training that was previously his main hobby, and not pursuing his education (he has to study for certifications he needs to advance his career). He only works part time and has very few bills and low rent and invests his money well so he is financially stable and has plenty of free time, but he is constantly finding himself in bad situations and not fixing the problem but rather ignoring it or doing the bare minimum. He gets by essentially on pure charisma. For example, when his phone broke he refused to fix it, and his brother missed talking to him on the phone so he repaired it for him. When he switched to part time work and made less money he simply stopped paying his phone bill to save, so his parents started paying it for him. He drives an unreliable motorcycle that is always breaking down and friends are always picking him up to transport the motorcycle on their trucks, but instead of fixing it he always waits until it won't start even with starter fluid, and then does only the bare minimum to get it to start again, ensuring that the problem continues. When his fridge and toilet broke in his house he just refused to fix them and used the toilet at a convenience shop down the way and made a single portion of ramen and eggs for dinner for years. He recently got bitten by a spider and his face swelled up and refused to go to the doctor because he didn't even have $100 cash in his account and all his money was in his investments. Of course his mom, myself and friends all offered to pay but he refused and insisted he would be fine and that the idea of going to the doctor stressed him out. I left for a couple weeks and when I came back he had lost 10 lbs and looked gaunt and claimed it was because he missed me and forgot to eat. He has wanted to leave his home town and travel for 6 years, but has kept putting it off on various pretexts. Generally he is bad at taking initiative, and can be a people pleaser who has trouble saying no. He is always finding himself in dangerous situations, and generally does not seem to value his own health, wellbeing and safety. I am terrified of being pushed into the role of his mom, constantly having to remind him to do things, check on him, worry about him, and drag him through life because I can't depend on him to take care of himself or work toward his own goals &amp; dreams. Is this something that will ever change, and is there anything I can say or do to help?

I earn almost ¬£40k and am due for a pay rise, whereas he has just finished a university course and is awaiting his visa to be approved to study his masters here in the UK. He does not currently work but receives money from his parents, he comes from a well off family (not super rich, but enough to afford to pay for him to study abroad). His family will fully pay for his visa, but he will work when he gets here.

Anyway, I've been in relationships with guys from the UK in the past, and a lot of them have used me for money. My LDR is aware of my past relationships, and he assured me early on that he doesn't care about money, he just wants me. He has never once asked me for money. He gives me so much of his time, video calls every day and remembers every small detail about me.

Anyway, I sent him about ¬£10 in the past and told him he can treat himself to pizza after he passed an interview. This is the only time I've sent him money. He gets offended even if I mention paying him back for something, or sending him any money. He has told me he will pay for every date when he is here, and buy me anything I want if it's within his means.

He has ordered takeaway to my house twice after I said I was craving something (about ¬£30 alltogether). I told him I liked a dress, and he bought it for me (cost about ¬£25). I needed groceries once and he ordered it for me, came up to like ¬£20. He bought me a bracelet I liked and plans to give it when we meet. He has also bought me a upgrade pass to a game we play, which is about ¬£10. He also ordered me a cake on my birthday. I told him I want him to get his lisence, so he spent money learning to drive and passed his test, and has put money aside to buy a car when he is here.

I never ask him for any money or anything, but he knows my love language is gift giving. He gets so happy giving my these things.

 Sam told them that since she was so talented in soccer and had been for so long she didn‚Äôt have anything in common with guys her age were just concerned with having fun and partying and they didn‚Äôt care about her soccer career or anything.

I (22,M) dont have that much experience with relationships and sex.

 I recently met a girl at a party and we hit it off really good. We went to her place and did most of the things you can do with a stranger without condoms and had a great night until like 6 or 7 am. We slept a bit and I had to go after a few hours.
We talked and kissed in the morning aswell  so in my mind things were going great and I asked her if we want to meet again for a date and She agreed. I text her one day later and I don‚Äôt get a reply. (It‚Äôs her real number I texted her as is got home and again said I would like to see her again to wich she agreed again) 

So now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering wtf I am doing wrong. It was the best night I ever had, she seemed to have had a lot of fun aswell. But now she didn‚Äôt even open the text I sent her to ask her out for the coming weekend.

It‚Äôs a bit long. 

Brief timeline. I (40) met my ex-wife (39) in college when I was 19. We dated for 8 years, engaged for 2 and were married for 8. 

Before marriage we had both agreed to not wanting any biological children or children in general. After marriage we were still in agreement that children were not in our future plans. I even had a vasectomy. We were adamant on not having children. We wanted to live together just the two of us.
Everyone on both sides of our family knew of our decision and though some of them insisted, later they didn‚Äôt care as much anymore.  

So for 8 years we were happy, well as happy as a married couple can be. Our communication was great. I mean I believe she was my soul mate. We were together a total of 18 years. I knew her like the back of my hand. I loved her with all my heart and soul. 

Then comes 2019. My sister and her husband unfortunately passed away in an accident leaving behind 3 young children aged (7, 5, 10 months). 
It came down to a situation of who would take care of these kids. 
My brother in law had two sisters but they had multiple kids of their own, so it didn‚Äôt seem feasible. As for his parents, unfortunately they were already deceased. 
That left my side of the family. My parents could have taken the children but they‚Äôre on the older spectrum and well beyond their child caring days. So that left me, the only sibling. And of course the other option foster care (UNDERSTAND, that there was no way in hell I was letting this happen). 

So, I took the kids. Now their parents had been responsible financially, so taking the kids isn‚Äôt much of a financial burden. Their college funds have been somewhat taken care of, so really I just need to focus on their upbringing and providing for them.  

Before taking the kids I spoke with my wife. Laid out the options and why they weren‚Äôt feasible and why I needed to take them in.
My wife agreed that foster care wasn‚Äôt an option when I was in a position to take them in. However, she also said that she couldn‚Äôt stay married to me once I took the kids in. 
This came as a shock and a surprise (at no point did she make she choose between her or the kids). 
There is a reason why my ex-wife doesn‚Äôt want children however I don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs my place to divulge that information so I won‚Äôt. But to say the least I understood and accepted. But given the situation I was hoping she‚Äôd understand. I even suggested therapy to get over this hurdle. Which she declined (she had therapy in the past growing up and that‚Äôs how she reached the conclusion that she doesn‚Äôt want kids). 

My wife left and we ultimately got a divorce. We parted on amicable terms. 
The kids came to stay with me and have stayed with me for the past 3 years. In those years I had to put my heart together again. I had to be a father. Things weren‚Äôt easy. But we‚Äôre in a good place now. 

Now 2022, my ex-wife invited me out for coffee and asked if we might try again. Once again I was shocked. And really I don‚Äôt remember much after that.

Me: what changed? Why now suddenly after this time? 

Her: I regret the divorce. I have for the past 3 years. I‚Äôve gone to therapy like you suggested. 

A lot more was said but it didn‚Äôt really sink in. 

Due to my profession and my new role as father I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to meet anyone. Honestly I couldn‚Äôt - I wasn‚Äôt ready to move on. 
But I was stunned and the hurt and resentment from the past three years came at me all at once. I wanted to laugh. To cry. To scream. But I just sat there. 

In truth. I can‚Äôt say she completely abandoned me in the past 3 years. She would call every odd month (short conversations to ask how I was doing. How the kids were doing.) she even bought them Christmas presents and would sometimes talk to them on the phone. Short stuff like they shouldn‚Äôt cause too much trouble for me. Or they should be good. The kids are familiar with her, but she hasn‚Äôt exactly been a constant in their lives. 

With her coming back and asking for another go. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I still love her? Yes. Am I angry with her? Yes. Do I want her in mine and the kids lives? I don‚Äôt know. 
She‚Äôs amazing. The best human I ever met. But she hurt me. Deeply. She left when I wished she‚Äôd hold on tighter. 

I want her back. But is it the right thing to do? I‚Äôm a father now. I can‚Äôt just think about myself. 
Do we start over? Back to dating? I mean she might not like this new version of me. I‚Äôve changed. I‚Äôm different. I‚Äôm a father and my priority is to my nieces and nephews. I‚Äôm so confused I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well. I wish she hadn‚Äôt been such a decent human being so I could hate her. I wish we hadn‚Äôt divorced so amicably still so in love. I wish she‚Äôd gone to therapy sooner.  I wish that she hadn‚Äôt left. I don‚Äôt know.

Our story is: we (both 25, F and M) have known each other for three months and started chatting a month ago. From time to time, he tells me very romantic lines like he is a poet. I was suspecting that he is just a playboy who used to play with girls because those lines he told were exactly making me excited but i didn't give him much attention.

He is generally nice to me and asks to meet and do things together. But we had only one chance to have dinner last week due to his job (we work on the same project, so i know he is genuinely busy for sure). 

During that dinner, he told me that ""He was only planning to work and maintain a friendship with all the female workers of the project until he saw me"". Then, he continued to tell me how my name will sound after our marriage and after me taking his last name. This time, I was surprised a lot because we barely know each other, really. So, I pass it as a joke.

But he kept telling me maybe we can marry sometime. I asked if he is sure, and he responded that ""he wanted to be sure"". He even said that he likes that i am not refusing it even if i am not accepting it as well.

Also, he asked how many kids i want. I told him that I am planning to give birth to 3-5 kids, and his facial expression showed me that he was truly shocked. Then, he responded that ""we will be very tired, then"". 

But he stopped sending me chats after that dinner. i know he is busy (two days later he have a huuuuge event) but can any man bother to send a chat to a girl he wants to marry?

So here‚Äôs some back story: 

My boyfriend M(22) and I F(22) have been together for almost two years. We took a break in between to work on ourselves and to fix what needed to be worked on. Through this we were still in constant communication and still saw each other. 

Now here‚Äôs the issue:

My bf is so avoidant when it comes to me being upset. Basically if I tell him I‚Äôm mad and it doesn‚Äôt fit into his schedule he will tell me ‚Äúnot now‚Äù we‚Äôll talk about this when I‚Äôm free. Which could mean days later. I find this so disrespectful as I have vocalized before that I want him to prioritize our conflicts I am an extremely anxious person and I hate being mad I wanna talk and resolve it as quick as possible. But if I tell him that he mad me sad or if I say that his actions are disrespectful he will just stop replying as it makes him mad. So I am left to always reach out and solve every conflict.my question is should I leave over this. He continues to cross a boundary I have vocalized so many times. This one one thing as well I have on my list of must haves for a relationship. I think he is selfish for putting his interests ahead of ours. Like he is doing his stuff then ‚Äúdealing with this‚Äù when it‚Äôs convenient to him. But what about me and my stress and sadness does he not care at all. I would never do this to him. 


I feel as though I changed so much to fit his needs and he barely does the same it‚Äôs just empty words with him. And yes we had a big sit down conversation about our needs wrote a list etc and he still acting like this. I am just very upset as I feel as though I am a really good at helping him with his overthinking and helping him emotionally and he never does the same he just gets mad at me if I am mad at him.

Idk how to start this I‚Äôve written and re-written this so many times to the point idk how to even title this. I‚Äôm trying not to make this post super long but also trying to add the needed info. 

My(25f) partner (32m) is someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to handle stress very well he gets anxious over the littlest things and when it‚Äôs big things he gets anxious about he shuts completely down. Just to be open and honest my partner does have a drinking and does have one of those machines in his car. Recently his drinking has gotten so much worse than it was when we first met.

This is important because this month he recently quit his job because he needed a better schedule to work with since he has his son. He did have jobs lined up but the schedule ended up being something he couldn‚Äôt work with at all. Since this now he had a lot of free time which led him drink a lot and because of this he blew a violation when he was trying to come and see me. 

Our relationship is complicated. It‚Äôs my first one ever and his last relationship was his first relationship ever and it wasn‚Äôt good. So he was scared for us to rush into things and things end badly between us. So we were taking things really slow. Well he did text me earlier this month that he might ghost me because he was scared of everything going on between us. That I needed someone who had there shit together and that had time for me but he we had talked out. 

This talk had happened the day before he blew the violation and then the day after that he came to see me. He was down but after talking for a bit he just made the comment he didn‚Äôt deserve me but changed the subject to something else. Then he left and later that night I got a text saying we should probably stop seeing each other. I asked why since he literally just left maybe a couple of hours ago and why we didn‚Äôt talk about it in person. He was drunk and freaking out when he said this and basically he said his machine broke and now he for sure might be going to jail. He also said whenever he sees me bad things happens after and basically I‚Äôm bad luck. 

But we did talk the day after and he said he didn‚Äôt mean that he was drunk and freaking out but mid conversation he stopped replying and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. It‚Äôs been a week I did leave him be for a couple days but since then I have texted 3 times asking how is since I am really worried. 

I know he had probation last week so idk if bad news happened and it made him spiral. I have tried calling once just to see if he had me blocked but as soon as I heard the ring I hung up. I don‚Äôt wanna overwhelm him if he needs his space.

My parents came from nothing, my dad was an electrician who grew up in the projects and my mom was kicked out and 16, and worked their way into success.

I was born when they were still gaining their wealth and had it instilled into me to work hard and do well at school. So I Did. I have an undergrad in Finance, a post grad in HR and Business Management and worked alongside both my full time degrees in the family business (full time also) working my way up from intern to business manager. 

I had retail jobs throughout junior and senior year at highschool , I had college halls rent to pay, Student loans up to my eyeballs and I didn't get their help despite them being able to fund my education. That was fine, I wasn't expecting them to help, they always told me to do it myself like they did.

My little brother was born later so when he became old enough to remember - they already had their wealth, he dropped out of high school at 15 and did nothing until 2 years ago. At 18 he came to work with us because there was nothing else he could do. 

I was thrilled to have him join, thinking he'd learn to be better, but instead he's become insufferable.

3 members of staff have left because of him (we had 30 at the time), the manager of the department he *technically* works for is unhappy with him as he does what he wants, flits between jobs and roles when he gets bored and doesn't believe himself accountable. He walks around as if it's his company, dictating what to do to people superior to him, and my parents don't stop him.

As a person, I adore him, as a colleague, he's awful. Our parents gave him the easiest job, which comes with high commissions, so at 20 and because he doesn't pay rent or expenses, he's saved 40k.

He's decided now that he's going to start his own business using the money he's saved, good on him, he's handed his notice in and the staff have rejoiced.

Only he's not *really* going. 

He's moving into the lot next door and will be doing the same thing but as a ""consultant"" instead. We trained him (one of his many endeavors in the office) to do a certain role creating parts for one of our machines, which he can do by himself, if he buys all the equipment off the company, which he's doing at 40% of the market value. He'll be here all the time, except now he will be self employed and people are worried he'll be even worse.

They're giving him a credit line to fund his business, he's not having to pay rent (they own the lot) for 3 months whilst he sets up, nor pay for what he purchases from us until it's resold. He has a side hustle selling aftermarket parts to other businesses. The same basic principle as his commissioned job, except in that he's not having to buy the parts outright in the first place so gets the full difference, instead of a $150 commission per sale.

I spoke to my parents, saying that I have worked here 10 years, I know the business inside out and I'm supposed to take over once they decide to retire, I'm paid half of what my market rate is and asked to take over the element of his job that brought in the high commissions. 

I'm employed, I've done it before and god knows i need it, I have a mortgage and with the rising interest, I'm terrified I'll lose my home if things don't settle. 

My Husband and i have less than $300 a month left after bills, we've both been looking at getting warehouse jobs for some supplemental income, which is a bit hard for him because he's disabled so works from home. I thought if I could get that element back, I would be more than able to cope. None of that is their fault, but I was expecting they'd have no issue with this, as he handed his notice in.

Their answer was yes originally, then i told my brother about it, so he rang them and they changed their mind, despite the fact he's leaving and claims he can do everything on his own, they're actually allowing him to continue his B2b sales stream for the company which brings in commissions of over $1000 a month.

They chose him. It's always been a joke around the office that they prefer him and coddle him, but this was the first time there was a direct choice to make and now everybody knows they actually would choose him over me, despite what I've put into this company. It's embarrassing and a professional insult.

At home, I'm heartbroken because I have worked my ass off to become what they wanted and they give it all to him. He doesn't worry about money, they let him move into a home they own rent free and even furnished it for him. 

He's adamant he'll be profiting $100,000 a month. I did him a forecast, showing it'll likely be more like $1500 IF he hits the sales perimeters I've set, which aren't over inflated but for a start up probably not achievable instantly. Of course I'm wrong, he's already hired his friend to start in the new year, despite not actually having a business yet. 

The market is struggling post pandemic, and his main customer is literally my parents business. 

I can't tell if I'm bitter or justified in my feelings. 

I feel bitter, but friends and coworkers tell me it's justified. They all laugh (with me, although it  has started to sting now) about ""Golden Boy"" and how I was just an inconvenience to my Moms work day the day she had me. Usually I've never minded because I'm generally a happy person, but the last few months have been draining. 

I feel like it's clear nepotism, he's never had a hard days work, he got the job because of our parents. 

In a way I know that's hypocritical of me, but I also worked hard, got my education and came into the business because I wanted to, not because it was all I could do, thinking this would be my future.

It could be sexism, but really I think it's favoritism.

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, if he was anybody else, I'd give my parents my perspective as the manager - an employee is leaving and he shouldn't get to benefit from the business, an employee should get his role, I have the time to fit the sales role into my day as it organises itself. However, I know if I'm honest they'll call me a jealous sister and say to get over it and be more supportive of his entrepreneurial spirit.

For context, I'm paid $15.50 an hour (no commissions or bonus), he's paid $10 plus about $1000 in commissions monthly (Sometimes more sometimes less). We both have a company car. His will be returned at the end of the month.

The average operations manager salary is $67k, a HR executive with my qualifications earns between $85-110k so I know how underpaid I am.

**Do I look for a job that appreciates me and pays me enough to live, or do I wait because I've already waited a decade and what's a few more years if they hand it to me?**

I say if because there's no guarantee I'll get it or if they just sell up. 

If I leave though, I know that's it for me, My Mom always said if I go, I don't come back - which is why it's angering me more that My brother gets to go but not REALLY and the door is open for his return.

Chris and I noticed the chemistry during my interview a few weeks ago. After I started we found ourselves texting non stop. 

It started with friendly banter, to texting and to obvious flirting in the work place. He would bring me sweets and lunch. 

I can‚Äôt deny that I developed a crush on him. Until I noticed that he flirts with another younger girl in the office too. I was hormonal and upset that day and I confronted him about it. Ever since then there‚Äôs been an obvious distance. 

Needless to say, I‚Äôm not that upset given that workplace romances especially with a superior never end well. At this point we don‚Äôt text as much as we used to, there‚Äôs no sexting and weekend flirting. 

Initially I was kinda upset because I liked Chris. I looked forward to our messages and I really enjoyed speaking to him. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs also upset that a guy asked me out but.. Chris is now distant. I also told Chris I‚Äôm not a relationship type girl. Which I didn‚Äôt know would be a problem given he‚Äôs a hesidic jew and I‚Äôm a Muslim and there would be no way. 

Still.. Chris insists on texting everyday. I‚Äôve been a lot more distant with my responses but he still asks about my weekend. He used to respond to my stories on what‚Äôs app and send me funny memes but no more.

I‚Äôm not sure how to let it go or just let it lose it‚Äôs steam? I kinda feel like he‚Äôs texting to keep his options open and doesn‚Äôt want me to quite lose interest but he‚Äôs also kinda confused on what he wants to do.. 

He left for Florida today and said he wanted to say goodbye before he left but an hour later just kinda left.

so we‚Äôve been working on his addiction since we‚Äôve been together(about two months, so we got time to go), and I(22F) THOUGHT things were going alright. when we try to get intimate, he claims he just gets too nervous/excited and we end up just, not doing it. and i‚Äôve talked to my best friend about that, and she says that‚Äôs completely normal bc that‚Äôs what happened to her and her ex. 

i‚Äôve struggled with relationships in the past, just getting over my last one, where he cheated on me, so we are both also trying to build trust within each other and i honestly thought he felt the same. or FEELS the same. 
but i had an itch that i needed to scratch, so i scratched and fucked around and found out. 

the other day, he was the shower and had left his phone charging in the living room by me. so OBVIOUSLY curiosity killed this cat and since i knew his password(he had told me, what it was) already, i dove right in, without thinking if i‚Äôll see anything. 
so at this point, im looking at DMs first, i see on insta, he had messaged two girls, that i don‚Äôt know, if they had ‚Äútwo sets‚Äù? which i still don‚Äôt know what that means. other than that, there was nothing else. then i look at his safari.
I SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED to see onlyf. in his history but it still hurt. we had promised each other that we wouldn‚Äôt do anything(to ourselves) until he was ready. i‚Äôve been waiting for him for two weeks by now and he‚Äôs been on onlyf every chance he can get alone. and from the history stamp, it was from AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD TO PICK ME UP FROM WORK. 
shocked, i hide my evidence that i‚Äôve been on his phone and put it back as he stops the shower. 

it‚Äôs been a week since then and just now, around 5am, i woke up next to him and his phone and i felt that itch again. i honestly think it‚Äôs just a sign to just trust my instinct. i grabbed his phone and quietly went to the bathroom to start my search. 
first thing, i go to the same dms on insta

they‚Äôre gone. there was two messages, both of them, he started with the ‚Äúdo you have these in two sets?‚Äù not knowing the context still. and they‚Äôre GONE. DELETED. WHY. 
shocked, but i still press on. i go to his safari and again, onlyf and other porn websites were in his history but i go even further now, im checking everything in his account. 

he‚Äôs been messaging cc and how ‚Äúthey make his day‚Äù and he‚Äôs been tipping them money. the last one was from yesterday, around 2ish. when i was at work, waiting for a reply from him, he had told me he was at his grandparents. he‚Äôs also been sending them d pics, even tho he‚Äôs been telling me it hasn‚Äôt been working as of late. 
so at this point, im mentally exhausted, i clear my evidence and i go back. i wake him up in the process and i just tell him that i had a nightmare about him cheating on me bc he saw that i‚Äôve been crying. 

i asked him to promise me that that i was the only one he‚Äôs been talking to and he pinky promised back. and i cried again. 

can someone PLEASE tell me if i should tell him or not.  i love him and i just want what‚Äôs better for him. i can care less about the sex tbh, but the fact that he‚Äôs lying to me, hurts my trust by a lot. i don‚Äôt wanna breakup with him but i literally don‚Äôt know what to do. he‚Äôs not even trying to stop his addiction and i thought that‚Äôs what he wanted so he can ‚Äúbe better for me‚Äù. idk what to do. what CAN i do. help.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7613461,public,nsfw,my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt know that i know that he‚Äôs lying,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1setc/my_boyfriend_doesnt_know_that_i_know_that_hes/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,

We were pretty fast to click and fall for each other. I've always been one to fall for toxic guys who treat me like rubbish but I feel really calm and positive around my current bf, so I want to try my best to nurture a healthy relationship/partnership with him. I really want to make this work. 

The problem is that my bf has this situationship with his boss/work partner. He is a contract employee of sorts and he's the only person working for her. He has told me about how they've been in a sort of on-and-off (romantic) relationship in the past, but told me that they had become platonic since he realised that he viewed her more as a ""work/professional partner""  rather than a romantic partner.  My bf wants to maintain the friendship and work relationship with this person since he does like her as a close friend and also enjoys his current job.

The main issue is that his work partner(30-ishF) is still very much in love with him and is extremely attached to him. The thing which bugs me the most is how dominative she is acting. I have been spending a lot of time at my bf's flat recently. When she found out, she told my bf to tell me to ""get out"" of my bf's flat by a certain date(e.g.""go back to your own flat by nov.20th"" sort of thing), because it was affecting her mental health.( I abided to this condition because I can imagine how hard it must be for her to adjust to my bf having a new gf/partner and that she must feel like my bf has been ""taken away"" from her)  

Another issue going on is that she also wants to restrict the places where I go and spend time at. I have to move houses within December, since my contract at my current flat is ending. I was planning on moving near his flat since the area he lives in is the same area where I work and hang out in. But when work partner(30-ish F) found out, she told him that she doesn't want me to live in close vicinity to my bf or the area their office is located. (She also gave him a pretty detailed list of areas I was ""allowed"" to live in and ""not allowed"" to live in). I feel really heavy hearted, anxious, hurt and conflicted... I have mixed feelings about what I should do, but in hindsight, I do think that this is a demand which goes a step too far. I know I'd be neglecting myself if I just accept this condition. I mean... I don't even know this person - I've never even met her!

Although I do think that time will make this weird situation better, I'm at a loss of how to handle this situation. It's causing me quite a lot of stress since it's always at the back of my mind. I'm trying not to ask my bf too much since he's now caught up between two people and I imagine it must be hard for him too. I feel like I would like to talk to her face-to-face to tell her I don't want to take my bf away from her or anything, since I'm completely fine with them continuing their work-relationship and friendship. But that doesn't seem possible since she's making all these demands and is claiming to be mentally distraught over my existence.

Posting this on a throwaway so she doesn't find this, will keep details to a minimum.

Me and my gf have been together for nearly 3 years now, were having issues lately and it's starting to feel like every time i mess up in some way she gets extremely angry and distant with me. She ignores me for hours afterwards usually depending on what I've done and calls me names (most recent being mostly stupid, bitch and asshole - those seem to be her favourites lmao). 

I know stonewalling isn't okay but anytime I bring up that it hurts me she says she only does it when she's overwhelmed - She never tells me she needs space in the moment and once she got mad at me for leaving her alone. It hurts a lot and I'm wondering on that part if I'm in the wrong for feeling hurt by it and how to be more understanding when it happens. 

Name-calling too I know its bad and no matter what a partner shouldn't call their SO shit like this when angry. When I've brought it up though, she says I'm trying to tell her to stop feeling anything and that she should be able to express herself in that way since that's what she's feeling. To be honest, sometimes it feels like she doesn't care about my feelings at all which makes me feel hopeless at times.

So my question to you reddit, is How can I be more understanding as well as suggest that this hurts me quite a lot and I'd like it to stop?

We stayed together for 1 year and I think everything was perfect, but his words absolutely hurt me because they literally came from out of nowhere. I felt upset, angry and disappointed, especially because I think our conversations were just like always and because he told me he thought about breaking up much longer before. So basically, I don't know since when, but he was faking all his real emotions, right? 
Also, I don't believe in breaks. It is just a word that allows you to go around and have fun with other people. At least that's my opinion.
The thing is, he came back one day later after breaking up telling me ""You are such a big part of my daily life that I can't leave you"". I didn't find this romantic at all, it looks like i'm just part of a ""routine"". 
Now he keeps texting me asking me if I had lunch, goodnight texts and if I will ever forgive him.

Everything is great and we want to take the next steps in life. I have a high paying job for where we live, she has a bit below average income but together we have a very good income. However we are also in debt, partially because of student loans when I was younger, but also partially because my accountant fucked up when I was a contractor and now I have to pay high fines to the local tax authorities. This is making saving impossible as you‚Äôll understand. 

We are currently renting a house, but we can‚Äôt make any changes to it or renovations. It‚Äôs an older house and the housing market is just dead at the moment so moving out isn‚Äôt an option. We would like to buy a house, but getting a full mortgage where we live doesn‚Äôt exist, so you need a very high amount of savings. Which, again, is not possible. Saving enough money to buy a house after paying off debt is going to take many years. 

We would like to start with children. We‚Äôre at an age and point in life where we consider this a good option, something we both want. However, the house we live in is cold as fuck in the winter due to it being old and poorly isolated in an area that‚Äôs very hot in the summer, which questions if we want to bring a child to this cold house that we can‚Äôt renovate.

About 3 years ago my best friend got a girlfriend. about 1 year into their relationship he (let‚Äôs call him jayden) started to complain about her and expressed feelings of wanting to break up. I told him to pull the plug and just do it but he felt like it would b too hard cuz she moved into his place with his family 3 months into dating because of the pandemic. i told him he needs to get it over with but he refused. 

As time went on Jayden kept talking about it but also slipping in things like ‚Äúi never loved her‚Äù and ‚Äúi think i chose the wrong person to date‚Äù and he eventually told me that he used to like me when we were younger. we met when we were 12 and during are 9 year friendship we liked each other on and off but never told each other. the second he told me that he felt that way those feelings rushed back and i and was definitely crushing on him. 

i tried to stay away from him so i would go a couple months without hanging out with him but i would always text him back just so he knew i was still there for him. I really loved hanging out with him so i couldn‚Äôt stay away for long. the same stuff continued for a year but in august of last year his girlfriend moved out because they were having issues.

we had been hanging out for awhile and he was flirting with me a lot and telling me how miserable he was in the relationship. by this point he has promised me he would break up with her but ‚Äúhad to find the right time‚Äù. the day after she moved out he asked me to come over and he was extra flirty this time. we got drunk and started to get a little touchy and he ended up telling me he had feelings for me. I told him he needed to break up with her before he did anything but that didn‚Äôt last long at all. 
we hung out again a couple days later and we ending up hooking up. and then we kept doing that‚Ä¶ almost every week for 8 months. the entire time it ate me up and i felt so guilty about the whole thing, but i couldn‚Äôt get the courage to tell his girlfriend. everytime i saw him i would beg him to break up with her and he promised me he would and i was stupid enough to believe him. but he was my best friend of 9 years and i really wanted to believe him. 

fast forward to june of 2022 and we hadn‚Äôt really hook up in awhile. i assumed it was just because he wasn‚Äôt horny but i think he was already planning to ghost me. but anyway in june we hung out got the last time and i asked him how he felt about us. he said ‚Äúcan i be honest? after sleeping with you i have never wanted to kill my self more‚Äù. he has a long history with depression and i do too but hearing that from my best friend really really killed me.  ofc i immediately burst into tears and he tries to backtrack but i just ran to the bathroom to put myself together cuz we had other friends coming over. the next morning he again backtracks and says he didn‚Äôt mean that sleeping with me made him want to kill himself but instead he meant sleeping with me was the best part of his year and kept him from killing himself. which i did not believe at all but i let him believe i did. because for some reason i didn‚Äôt want him to know that he hurt me cuz i thought that would hurt him (??) idk i loved him a lot so i did. stupid things. anyway after that he drove me home and told me he would call to hang again soon. 

a week went by so i texted him to hang out and he said he couldn‚Äôt. then i text him the next week and same answer. i didn‚Äôt think this was too weird cuz sometimes we went a month or two with out hanging out. but then i get a call in july from our mutual friend that jayden told his girlfriend about us and that she forgave him and they weren‚Äôt gonna break up. needless to say i was crushed. but i was even more crushed cuz i had to hear it from our friend and not jayden. 
i assumed he would tell me when he was ready so i waited a week, then another and another until i couldn‚Äôt take it and i finally texted and asked if he planned on ever telling me or just hoping i would find out from someone else. he never answered that text‚Ä¶ 

idk why i‚Äôm even writing this but i just hate that he ghosted me. i hate that he didn‚Äôt have the decency to tell me why he was doing this or even say he was sorry. i know i‚Äôm so stupid for even expecting that but again we were friends since we were 12 so i thought he would at least say something. ive tried to get over this for 5 months now and i know i should b over it but for some reason i can‚Äôt just can‚Äôt move on. im miss him and i hate him so much but i can‚Äôt do anything about it. i can‚Äôt text him again without looking weak and i can‚Äôt do any ‚Äúact of revenge‚Äù cuz i hate the idea of hurting him or making his life harder. 

i just feel so worthless. i have really bad abandonment issues and i truly don‚Äôt know what to do. i don‚Äôt really have any friends anymore cuz i isolated myself so we could be together hide away from anyone. i‚Äôve hooked up with other ppl but i just keep comparing them to him. it‚Äôs not even that us hooking up was that good that nobody can measure up (i‚Äôve had plenty that were better) but nothing beats the emotional connection when ur hooking up with your best friend. i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. i can‚Äôt stop being hurt and feeling horrible. and i just wanna know what i could have don‚Äôt to change it. did i move too fast? or come on too strong? was it just sex and i misinterpreted everything? i don‚Äôt know and i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever know. i miss my best friend but i hate that he was so willing to hurt me and so willing to throw our friendship away. let me know if u have advice on how to move on, i really need it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7613414,public,self,my (21f) best friend of 9 years (21m) ghosted me after cheating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1s5nj/my_21f_best_friend_of_9_years_21m_ghosted_me/,all_ads,6,

it was meg who kissed me, i was just asking whether i have something in my face, she told me no then gave me a peck. ion know if i was just caught off guard but that immediately caused me to hide my face as i was too shy, but still, i felt nothing.

Prior to the breakup, we were having some challenges. Mostly fundamental differences around finances, partying and long term lifestyle goals. We were deeply in love and committed to working through these together.

Out of nowhere 2 months ago, he said he couldn‚Äôt do this anymore and asked me to move out (he owns the apartment).

I asked to talk a few days after to understand his decision and get some closure.  He said he was not ready to talk. I managed to refrain from reaching out to him since that to respect his space and also work on my own healing. I still couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I had a lot of unanswered questions regarding his decision.

The other night, I received a notification that he edited an old iPhone note we shared. Upon opening the note I was surprised to see a write up for someone else. Paraphrasing a few key lines:

* I know this is early in our relationship but I have known for as long as I can remember that you were someone special
* I‚Äôm falling in love with you
* I don‚Äôt want to wait anymore to be with you, I‚Äôve waited 7 years and don‚Äôt want to wait more

I sent him a screenshot asking him what it was, and he said it was an accident and was intended for someone he started seeing recently. He clarified they did not start seeing each other when we were together. He was very apologetic.

Trusting he did not start seeing them officially until after we broke up ‚Äì I do understand it‚Äôs okay to start seeing someone shortly after a breakup. However, I‚Äôm hung up on the ‚Äú7 years‚Äù part and I can‚Äôt help but feel like he had strong emotional feelings for someone else while we were dating. 

I feel pretty heart wrenched and gutted at the thought of him yearning for someone else when he was my everything. If I had this knowledge earlier on in the relationship, I would have made a lot of different decisions in our relationship and in my own life (moving in together, career planning, etc.)

I have not replied to his most recent message. Although I don‚Äôt have all the facts, I do feel very betrayed and am not sure if I am justified feeling that way. I feel his message to me did not address this, and I'm not sure whether/how to address this.

She has had an affair about 3 years ago, but cut it off before I found out about it.  She later confessed to me and we tried to move forward.  
Fast forward to now, we had a big argument in late-October, where she tells me she wants a divorce.  She claimed she had learned alot about herself and what real love should look like, and she couldn't see it in us anymore.  
Later on, we talked and she eventually confessed how she had grown an infatuation/feelings for her male coworker...BUT was adamant that nothing was going on between them.  She claimed he was happily married and though he was flattered, kindly turned her attention back towards us and wanted to keep things on the up and up as coworkers.  
A few days go by and I am pleading my case to stay married and work out our differences (which are not out of the ordinary), when she confessed that she IS in a relationship with her coworker, that he is getting a divorce, and that they have been intimate since August/September. Most importantly, that she believes she is in love with him and can see herself with him.  
Since I found all this out I asked her to cease futher (intimate) coms with him and give our relationship a 100% chance to make amends. We have been attending couples therapy and communications have had their ups and down.  According to my wife, she has stopped coms with him but I do not believe her.  When we 1st started the therapy she was carefree about her phone, but this past week has gone back towards safe guarding her phone and taking it everywhere she goes.  Needless to say I am sure the coms are still going on and although I feel like such a schmuck, I am a firm believer in marriage for life and that forgiveness, understanding, and healing fortifies a relationship.  

My largest fear is that if I find evidence of the coms still going on, should I confront the deception and lies or should I just accept her free will and focus on moving on?  
I'm a huge supporter of being as honest as possible and my friends also have to abide by this. My concern is, that I know if we break up, I CANNOT be her friend.  She's lied to my face and cheated on me two times before leaving me for MY ISSUES?!?  

Currently, we are sleeping in the same bed and have sex occasionally,  but sometimes she's into it and at other times she as cold as ice and doesn't want me to even touch her.  She's offered to ""cohabitate"" with me, in an attempt to help the kids get the care/support they need to prep for the divorce.  If/When she decides we're completely over She wants one of us sleeping in the guest room, she wants one of us sleeping in the guest room for an undetermined amount of time.  We just bought this house and she's ""willing"" to let me have it, mostly because her friend has two houses in the area.
I'm 100% disabled Army veteran (back injuries and PTSD) and am now trying to find suitable employment because I know I won't be able to afford a lifestyle similar to my current situation with the child support and only one income. 

I love my wife, and honestly feel sorry for her. I think she's making a grave mistake, leaving me and our 14 yr marriage to be with a guy who may provide her with a greater level of financial stability, but isnt an honorable person in his own marriage or my family's unity. I don't think their relationship will last and although I will love her forever, I don't want to be with someone who's physically left me.  

I have overwhelming fears and anxieties of my future, I am unsure of my financial abilities to be ok and and equally unsure of my mental status once I find myself alone again.  I have ZERO interests in finding someone else and do not know if I'll ever he happy again, but this is what I'm currently facing.

Honestly, I'm not too sure how I feel about her right now, but I know that I would never do anything to jeopardize her relationship, and am constantly doing my best to be respectful of those boundaries. That being said, I very much value our friendship and don't want to lose that, but am not sure how to proceed or if I'm just reading into things too much because all of it is messing with my head. I'd just like to hear a 3rd opinion on it from someone who knows neither of us, so I can either A) understand I'm just overthinking or B) she likes me so I can begin to distance myself a bit more and better respect her relationship. So here's a list of things that have stuck out to me as out of the ordinary for friends or just notable things I could think of.

1. I‚Äôve talked to my ex about some of it, we were best friends before we ended up dating (we broke up about 5 months ago but not because anything happened, no one cheated or anything, it was a mutual breakup where we needed to focus on ourselves and our own mental health first). My ex said she thinks she likes me and is a little jealous of her. She's never been overly sure of anything like this in the past nor jealous (outside of 1 instance which she admits was stupid in hindsight) so I think this is pretty notable.
2. She will constantly walk over to me and lean her head on my shoulder randomly for short intervals, think 3-5 seconds, and then move on. I kinda just ignore it now and it's not really all that bad, I just think it's disrespectful to her bf. At the end of the day, I am also not the one initiating it and I've seen her do it to some of her other close guy friends (2 or 3 I think). Oh, she does this publicly, think in front of 5-10 of our mutual friends.
3. She switches between being very hot and cold at times. She'll sometimes go for days with either of these ""phases"". Not sure what to make of this but here's what hot and cold look like with her.
   1. **Hot:** will respond immediately, double texts, randomly calls, asks to and plans hangouts, and engaging and interesting conversations.
   2. **Cold:** will not respond even if I double text or will respond hours later (kinda just ghosts me), completely ignores me until she needs something (ex: hw answers, asking if we‚Äôre going to the same event), cold and honestly quite dry during these stints.
4. We were at a bar for an event (we are part of the same organization) and I was talking to 3 of my other friends, and she walks over hugged the other 3 (2 girls and 1 guy), and then walks over to me hugs me and then has her hand on my kneecap for a little bit. 
5. \*\*\*Offering to get me food because I hadn‚Äôt eaten and was too busy to go do so.. (I‚Äôve done it in the past for her, more just being nice than anything but just writing it down anyway).
6. Offering to clean my room because I was complaining about not doing it (also nice but not something I would want my hypothetical gf to be doing for another guy). I didn't think anything would happen but I turned her down anyway because of the principle of it. I'm not gonna be that guy don't worry.
7. Got guilt-tripped into helping her try and find her friends in a super crowded bar on a Friday night. It was her birthday can you blame me? So her drunk ass proceeded to grab my hand and dragged me through the bar with her, I tried to let go and continue following only for her to grab my hand again and continue to drag me along. During this, we walked past some of my friends and I had a brief conversation (think 1-2 min) with them but she walked off so my friends told me I should probably go after her to make sure she was okay (she was quite drunk, I had to walk her home after because her boyfriend was ""being a bitch"" her words not mine) but they thought we were dating or something which I cleared up to all of them that we were just friends. 
8. I gave her my hoodie because it was cold, she was shivering and I genuinely was fine without it despite being a little cold. She held onto it for like 3 weeks but we're both super busy with school I think we just both forgot about it (That's what she claimed, I believed her and I genuinely did forget). She returned my hoodie after washing it, but sprayed perfume in my hoodie??? She also put enough where it took 2-3 washes for the smell to fade and eventually completely disappear. While she had it, I am unsure if she wore it or not but I never saw her wearing it out at all.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head while writing this post. So the question is ‚Äì what do you think of this situation? Does she like me and I'm valid for thinking some of this stuff is strange while having a boyfriend? or Does she not like me and I am reading into things too much and just overthinking it?

Has anyone else experienced a similar thing?

Other than missing 5 days once, it was literally every day. We exchanged anywhere from 4-20 texts each daily. I understand it was only texts, but we talked extensively about many things and  I got attached. It ended abruptly in a way that I find very confusing. He is in jail for a nonviolent crime and we started writing because our family has a history and we are from the same town. Our last conversation was entirely normal and showed nothing out of the ordinary. A couple days prior we did have a convo about my ex who he also knows, but I highly doubt that played a role in anything that transpired. He is the most respectful guy I have ever talked to and our conversations are something he said he treasured.

Ok so four months ago we have our final text on this jail app. Everything seems normal. The following day I don‚Äôt get the usual good morning text so I went to check and his name showed ‚Äúreleased.‚Äù I knew this was not the case, and figured something else was going on. He had given me his sister‚Äôs number and always said she would let me know if he got transferred. At that point I wasn‚Äôt worried and assumed I would hear something.

I waited 8 days and still heard nothing. I was getting anxious so I texted his sister first. Keep in mind her and I do not formally know each other. My text to her said ‚ÄúHi it‚Äôs Cassie, sorry to bother you, I just wanted to check if Gary is okay? He no longer shows up on the app so I was worried and wanted to make sure everything is alright.‚Äù

Twelve days later she answers me and writes, ‚ÄúHi Cassie, Gary got transferred!‚Äù (The 12 day timeframe isn‚Äôt too unusual, with processing and Covid lockdowns it probably took him a few weeks to call or write her.)

Her response threw me off and was not at all what I expected. Does this mean he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore? Or what? I am baffled and this seems out of character for him to ghost me. But that was all she wrote.  I replied back ‚ÄúOh ok, thanks for the update!‚Äù 

And that was it. I heard nothing more and it‚Äôs been 4 months. What am I to make of her answer? The friendship was very important to me and I miss him a lot. I just don‚Äôt understand what happened.

So much of our time has been shared through it, many late night conversations about all of life, laughs, and love. We share so many core values and views/goals on how to navigate the world around us and what we want in life and so many shared interests/passions. The emotional, intellectual, and physical chemistry and compatibility are the best that I've had with a partner. She has everything I'm looking for in what I would want in a wife and she has said the same about me. Also, we have not been dating other people. The timing is just not good even though she has said ""you would be everything I'd be looking for in a husband "" and ""I don't want you to be the one that got away""
.

She was dating a guy for 6 years living together,ready to marry him, which ended due to his cheating,  just a few months before meeting me and needs to learn how to become her own person. I was already planning an across country move but wasn't 100% certain, to live in a mountain town that has all of the outdoor recreation one could dream of for 2 years. She is not emotionally or mentally available for a relationship and needs to take the time and space to find her own sense of fulfillment, happiness, and self worth independently without a partner. 
.

We both agree that it's such a special and rare connection, that came so unexpectedly, and I've allowed myself to fall in love with her. There are so many things we haven't had the time to do together yet like climbing mountains and so many places to travel that weve talked about. 
.
.

We've talked about how we understand she needs the time and space to work on herself and get where she wants to be. She also wants to stay in touch,  but doesn't want me to wait around for her to be ready. She also isn't sure if she really does need that time for herself since she doesn't want to lose me or have me be the one that got away. She wants to come visit to ski and climb when I move in a couple of months but also is unsure if that would even be healthy.
.
She is confused on what would be best for her to do. I don't think there's any easy answer and that It might be for the best to go no contact and move on from eachother so she can have her time and space to develop her own fulfillment and be ready for someone else down the road. If it was meant to be then circumstance will pull us back together in the future. 
.

Has anyone else had to end an extremely positive and uplifting relationship due to circumstance that isn't either person's fault? 
.
Now we just have 1 week left together since I'm going out of the country for a month, and then am moving 3 weeks after I get back, and are enjoying it like it's the last time, but I don't want it to be the last time...but I know for someone I love I do value her happiness and wellbeing even if that means it isn't with me.
.
While I'm overseas the next month she wanted to separate and not stay in touch, but she also says she doesn't actually want that because talking to me and knowing about the adventures I'm on makes her really happy, so why end something that gives so much fulfillment? She is definitely confused and I want to stay with her and wait it out.

So I‚Äôm a 26-year-old girl who works as a CNA, and I go to UCLA part-time, so I work part-time and go to UCLA part-time. I live in Los Angeles county. I don‚Äôt talk to my neighbors because the ones up front sit out front for hours and invite their family over, and they gossip about me right in front of me when Covid was happening to go, like, where is she going? What was she doing when I was going to get my nursing license?

I‚Äôm also irritated because the woman across the way constantly leaves stuff for days in our shared laundry machine but complains if you move it, and she also had a boyfriend that sexually harassed me for years. She would constantly invite them back to the apartment. I would sit at the bottom of the stairs and harass him about my not wanting to talk to him. One time he barged into my apartment, and I had to force him out.  
I never complained about the landlord about this stuff. Still, I completely ignored this woman's Neighbor because her boyfriend harassed me, and I don‚Äôt like the neighbors upfront because they‚Äôre friends with this neighbor lady. she acts like I‚Äôm a complete b\*tch because I‚Äôm angry. After all, she would invite a guy that would harass m.

Well, new neighbors move in, and my neighbors tell them that I‚Äôm psycho and crazy and not to talk to me. My neighbors are all 40, and I‚Äôm like 26 years old. My new neighbors are in their late 20s or something. I‚Äôve never introduced myself or talked to them, but they constantly leave their blinds open at night or their blinds open, pointing toward the hallway. I have to pass by their apartment to get to my car or to go to leave the apartment, and their apartment is in my line of vision.

They constantly passive-aggressively close the blinds like I‚Äôm trying to peep into their apartment. I‚Äôm starting to get irritated by this cause they need to get privacy curtains or something. I honestly want nothing to do with them, and I don‚Äôt understand why they have their way open at night.

They gossip about me to the other neighbors and call me weird and shit because I don‚Äôt talk to them and try to keep to myself. Why do my neighbors gossip about me?

Decided to push through with it, go on a few more dates and it went away, I really fancied him, wanted to kiss and touch him and finally when we were intimate, I didn‚Äôt get that sick feeling. I had so much sexual desire for him. He was so soppy, forehead kisses, holding my head and I loved it. I felt amazing and he became my boyfriend until 8 months in and he pulled away, I actually lost all attraction to him when he did.

I know it may sound like an alarming thing but I know him, he is a private person in his personal information but also very outgoing so his solution of ""responding with a joke"" to the question ""are you in a relationship?"" was not with malice. 
I got angry because we have been together for 8 months and he has not told anyone except his family and closest group of friends. 
I asked him for a break because I was hurt by the discussion, defensive he told me quite hurtful things and I am afraid of being too soft. To forgive him right away because I am very much a pleasing person, and I can become even more so with someone I love.
So Reddit please advise me! 
I love him even though he is sometimes a child in certain things, we are young and I would like to grow together with this person. But I am afraid that my being too accommodating and understanding will lead him to then step on my toes or understand that he can do what he wants because he won't get consequences from me anyway.
I know he didn't do what he did out of malice, because he wanted to fuck other girls or to be seen as single by others but because he keeps things important to him for himself and a few people. 
He apologized and promised me that he will not make this mistake again and that as soon as he put himself in my shoes he felt terrible and understood how he made me feel.

We had problems since year one or two, but nothing too major we couldnt handle. Back then nearly every time we argued it was either because she was jealous and/or I didnt love her enough. The jealousy part was about me looking at someone, nothing physical, or talking. I tried to show my love for her in any way I can but it was never enough. At the start of this year she met a guy trough a common friend. At first they just talked witch I was okayish with. But once when she was in an other town on university field work, they partied and after that she cheated on me with him. She told me after that she is terribly sorry and it wont happen again and everything. I was devastated and only stayed with her because she forgave me a lot of things and i still loved her. I told her if was to happen ever again i would break up. Their story didnt end their sadly because they kept talking. Since then she have been trying to decide what does she want. She says that she can imagine her future with me but not with him. But she makes her feel passionate and loved and I dont. 
I always told her to make up her mind and she always said that she is going to, she just needs a week or something. It have dragged out for months and a few weeks ago we agreed to that she wont talk with either of us for a week and after that we will decide what we should do. This was after they had two last, final meeting to end it, but it didnt happen. After the week she said that she doesnt want to be with him, but neither really with me too. Then we talked and she said that she cheated on me multiple times with me after the first time. I was ready to break up but couldnt because I loved her and we had built our life together. Then we didnt break up immediately. The next day when Intought trough everything, I couldnt look past that she did it again and didnt even told me. I was sad when we met. She got angry with me that i was sad and wasnt loving her. I told her that i couldnt love her until she finally moves on from him. Then she got angry at me too and since then we are pretty much doing the no talk week again.

Bf has not properly acknowledged the situation either despite knowing it hurt me as well. How do I fix this situation when I'm not prepared to interact with the sister until she acknowledges what she did.

My bf (21M) and I (21F) have been dating for four years now after meeting at the same high school. He has a sister (20F) in the year below. I had been going to that school for 12 years, was captain of various activities and was tbh quite proud of the relationships I'd generated with a lot of teachers and students in various year levels.

Although I said my bf and i have been dating for four years, there was a period two years ago where we broke up for various reasons (mainly he didn't know how to ""show"" love while I was the opposite, so I ended up doing a lot more for him then he did for me - which now that we've matured he has become a lot better at and I also know when not to overwhelm him by doing too much for him). At that point, we had both graduated and moved on to University in the same city. His sister was still at the high school in her final year and I later found out that during that time we were broken up, she had gone around telling a lot of people that 'I had been a manipulative bitch of a gf' to her brother and 'caused him to be suicidal'. She was spreading it to people who were also family friends with my family and people I was tutoring. Tbh this is all a very big deal for me because I value ""face"" a lot and having these terrible untrue rumours spread about me at my old high school of 12 years to people who I respected/ were family friends and would then gossip as well really hurt me (not to mention I had been more then generous to his sister when we were dating including spending hours helping her with her homework whenevre I was over at their house to hang out with her bf). When I confronted my (then-ex) bf about it, he said he got angry at her but ""what else do you want her to do? she's not going to apologise to you and we're broken up"". When I breached the topic again when we had gotten back together near the beginning of us getting back together, I said ""look, all I ask is that I don't interact with her until she apologises to me and before then- don't bring her up to me."" And all he essentially said was ""I will always choose her over you"" which really hurt me at the time because it's not about chooosing me or her, it's just about acknowledging that in this one instance, she really messed up and she is in the wrong.

Now that we're back together and older, she still has not acknowledged what she did or apologised. I understand her actions were done years ago but I'm just more upset at the fact that neither him or his sister have taken any initiative in this. Should I just let this go? To be honest, after his response last time I'm scared to bring the conversation up again because his last response really hurt me. He's been trying to get me to interact with her (one time he invited me to a play without telling me she was also going to be there). I'm still really angry about everything but I don't know how to communicate this to him, and whether I should just be more mature and let it all go and be friendly with her without ever hearing an apology or acknowledgement.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7613299,public,self,I (21F) am still angry at my partner's (21M) sister for something she did years ago,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1rmrb/i_21f_am_still_angry_at_my_partners_21m_sister/,all_ads,6,

Just laying that groundwork as I am 100% sure she isn't into this coworker. She started the job around a month ago. She is geeky and loves her Nintendo Switch, Animal Crossing and pop vinyls. In the span of this month he has invited her to the shops to go pop vinyl shopping, she has gone. He has bought her lunch a few times. He hangs with her in their lunch break and plays Mario Kart on the switch with her. They text outside of work - I have seen her laugh and look excited when she gets a message from him.

&amp;#x200B;

From the information I have I feel pretty confident he is into her, he seems like a nerdy sort of inexperienced guy trying to get into her good books, I could be completely wrong and he's simply just really nice and is a friend. Just wondering what you guys think I should do. Like I said, at this current point if he is into her, she is most likely oblivious, and definitely not into him. Just not sure if I should say anything, it is sort of making me feel depressed and I think at minimum I should tell her how it makes me feel without being judgmental or throwing around accusations. 

&amp;#x200B;

For age gape haters, I completely understand. I have never had a girlfriend, only started serious therapy for social anxiety when I was 26 and got on meds and started coming out of my shell a bit, met my girlfriend at work and organically got to know her, the age gap always bugged me but we just got on so well at work, everyone at work saw me as a loser and didn't really associate with me, my girlfriend and I were each others saving grace. There is definitely this big part of my mind that thinks if she fell for him at some point it could even be for the best, we have so much in common, but there's some jarring age gap differences that effect the relationship that she wouldn't experience with someone closer or age.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7613293,public,self,My (34) girlfriend (26) has made friends with a male coworker (27),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1rm3u/my_34_girlfriend_26_has_made_friends_with_a_male/,all_ads,6,
