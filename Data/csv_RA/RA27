So I am seeking advice of some unbiased reddit strangers.

There is this girl in my life I know for nearly 20 years now. Apart from one very close friend of mine, no human else connects with me the way she does. I can absolutely say I truly love her and want her to live a happy life. The fact that she is beautiful and I am sometimes getting a crush after meeting her, doesn’t make things easier.

So I usually try to avoid meeting her more than a couple times a year, because our meetings become emotionally very intimate and could be already considered emotional cheating in my opinion. Any small amount of physical contact is also always immediately interrupted by me. I try at least to be a good human sometimes… 


When I was a teenager, I missed the chance to get together with her. Since then, she is in a longterm relationship with her boyfriend for about 10 years now.

I really know she is the one and for now, I was always trying to avoid frequent contact trying to avoid further complications. My feeling was always telling me not to „take“ her, because she is in a relationship and that is against my moral. Of course, my family and friends are thinking differently and tell me to react on her advancements.
Her mother is very friendly towards me, telling me the nicest things about myself, apparently she knows about the situation of her daughter.

Since I do not want to continue to avoid her, I was thinking to either really take the initiative or to straightly tell her that although I dearly love her as a person, she cannot continue with emotionally cheating on her boyfriend and making me fall for her. Because that truly sucks for her relationship and just hurts my feelings.

The backstory is, my bf and me have been together 9 yrs and I'd say it was a happy 9yr relationship. There were always some sacrifices made on my side (he's very asexual, doesn't really touch me intimately, and is very selfish which does cause a lot of fights, but I decided I'll learn to live with it beacuse I love him). I always wanted to marry him, but he never proposed, always saying it's coming, be patient, for years. 

So to come back to present time, about a month ago we had a stupid big fight because he went to get cakes while waiting for me and didnt think to get me any, and I was kind of sad because of that but nothing major (this was always something I told him really meant a lot to me, the little acts of affection). But he FLIPPED the f out, he was so angry that I was so sensitive and expecting stuff like that from him and something flipped in me, I realized I don't want to live this life forever. After that day, I think I kind of checked out and yesterday I decided to end it. He was devestated, and I was very sad and felt like shit because he is a good man despite his sortcomings (nobody's perfect). And today, I find out from my dad that he was planning to propose for a few months now, even bought me a ring which he kept at work, which now has me questioning everything.

And now I'm thinking, maybe I rushed it, maybe relationship's are just like that, you can't have everything you want, some things you have to give up on, and if he's finally planning to propose, maybe he decided to change (even though we talked about the same issues over the years with him promising change and never going through with it).

Not sure if this the right sub for me to post in, just looking for some second/a few opinions on my lifestyle and mindset. 

I've been in relationships for 10 years between young teens and mid 20s which is a lot I think for me anyway. 3 different women. 

Now I've been single for the past few years, and I've never really taken a break from dating, I always have to have a woman or few who are messaging me and like me. Otherwise I'm really lonely and uncomfortable, and just feel shit.

I want something serious one day, but I've had a fair few good opportunities with awesome women to get into something exclusive, and always have to friendzone/say let's be fwb at this point.

Not sure if this will ever change, but it's sad seeing cool ass girls your dating block you because you won't be exclusive and such.

Women who know me call me a fuck boy, but I have these super intimate, passionate things with girls I'm seeing, but it always ends when I say I'm not ready to be exclusive.

My (30F) boyfriend (34F) and I started dating over 4 months ago, we met online. Generally, things have been great and he is really good to me in every way. I've met his closest friends and he's always making plans a couple of months from now.

The downside is that I know he has cheated in his past, one which was only a few years ago. We agreed to move past this. Now, I know he has his exes on Instagram but my gut feeling tells me he might not be over his last ex. I understand she broke up after dating for a few months and he had been single for a couple of months before we met.

I feel like at a minimum he keeps tabs on her through social media, may have messaged as well. When posting about us, only his closest friends can see his stories so he can easily appear single on social media. It is important to mention  I dont have concrete evidence and I'm going by his phone behaviour. Also, I may be projecting how an ex of mine behaved when he cheated.

I want this to work so not going to snoop but I cant help shake this feeling. It's also too weird to bring up. Any advise on what to do? Assume the best until I have actual evidence? Other than this annoying gut feeling, I'm really happy with him.

However I haven't heard from him now since Friday night, he did mention he'd be watching football on Saturday but I don't know it seems odd to me he hasn't texted at all considering we would usually text a bit everyday. I know he said hed tell me if he didn't want to continue but I don't know.... I just have a bad feeling.

And now he's saying I'm not putting in effort to participate events related to his family/life. But sometimes , I agreed on a day trip with his family. We went on a day trip twice with his family.

In both of the trip, I'm very tolerable to any food and plans. I'm ok with anything. But I need personal space.

Recently, I rejected his invitation again for a trip together with his family again and he got sad saying I'm not showing effort etc. My concerns of the trip is because of accomodation, I wouldn't want to be sharing room or bed with his sister or him. Privacy still matters to me alot.

so i have a close friend i made in college. shes really sweet and kind we we met on a very good start. 

i threw a party on friday halloween at my place and invited everyone. bought food drinks etc

we all were drunk happy and having a good time.

a lot of videos were posted mainly of us having a good time and dancing and being funny.


i entered my kitchen and her and another guy friend were dancing sooo funny! they were just hoping and waving their hands up in the air. 
 the girl jumps from one spot to another and yells my guy friends name and looks super fun and drunk and smiles. 

i post all the videos to the groupchat.

i also posted that video on my private friends story as it was so funny and i didnt see any harm. 

apperently they were both annoyed but i talked with the guy and he goes “ya it was funny but we were also drunk and maybe its a violation but i dont care much its whatever she did seem very bothered” the guy later said he didnt care and we hang out and we’re fine

i addressed it to her and she said it was fine. a week later she asks me to delete it from the group chat as well. i do and apologized. she told me she did tell me to remove but i didnt listen. i quickly hugged her and apologized.

Its november 19 and well she has asked me to be her partner for some class that i am struggling with tremendously and shes very good at because she has prior classes beforehand.

we were assigned with 3 assignments. we had to pick her apartment as a study (we are architecture master students) she mesures her apartment with help of some guy. the guy helps and she finishes hw 1.

i have my exes past examples so that will help us a lot.

hw2 she did it alone after i attempted and failed bc i don’t understand the class well.

she shared me the info on thursday and missed a deadline for another class


i kept asking if she needed help and she says she would do it


anyway today i come to find out shes still pissed at me bc of that video. and it will bother her for a while and bothered at the fact that i didnt help her in some assignments as shes stressed and tired.

she keeps saying shes got it so i thought she got it snd since some  guy was helping her i didnt see the need lol",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7596948,public,self,i dont know if im in the wrong or she is,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z03neh/i_dont_know_if_im_in_the_wrong_or_she_is/,all_ads,6,

anyway my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

we break up and well i beg obviously and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…
then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building f

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety
i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later (3 days ago) he
screenshots someone's story on in. st a g
ram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text
im
scared” 

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

he comes back hours later and talks to some girl next to me. and i pass by and look at each other and wave and i leave",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7596944,public,self,weird ex situation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z03mvt/weird_ex_situation/,all_ads,6,

Have now been back together for around a year. 

My girlfriend told me that she feels as though I don’t respect her. She told me that this stems from things like hugging and kissing when she has told me that she doesn’t want to have sex. I’m genuinely not trying to breach what she wants, but being physically affectionate is important to me. I’m not trying to initiate anything. 

So we were talking about this a few days ago. When she kept pushing me about how I don’t respect her, I asked if she respected my needs anymore than I respect hers. I cannot remember the last time we were in any way intimate. Beyond the obvious enjoyment of sex, I’ve started to feel unloveable and unattractive as a result of receiving absolutely no physical affection. I don’t know what is wrong with me or what I have done to be so evidently unattractive to her. She says that she doesn’t enjoy sex and that is all there is to it. She says that it hurts, I’ve been researching online and attempting to encourage and support her to get some form of help, because as I understand it sex should not be consistently painful? I trust her word of course, but this appears to be something that has happened over time. When we were first together this was never an issue. I then asked if there is any room for comprise with non-penetrative alternatives (for want of a better phrase), she told me that I obviously don’t understand how consent works, and that if she doesn’t want to be sexual, then we never will be as that is her choice and her body. I absolutely respect and understand that, and of course I never pressure her, but am I genuinely in breach of consent for wanting to be intimate with my partner occasionally? I love this woman and I feel beyond shallow for questions the relationship over sex. But I’m currently here feeling like nothing I want matters, and believing that I’m a sleaze who doesn’t understand consent. What do I do here?

They apparently met online and she is also Asian and definitely seems like his type. He has said random things like “I’m so glad you don’t rave” and she’s a raver. They apparently FaceTime once every few weeks and she tells him all her relationship problems and he said he feels like he can relate to her a lot because of their mental health and BPD. He has liked provocative photos she has posted. When we got into a big fight and ended things he talked shit to her about me (I know because she subtweeted me). I have also found tweets of her tweeting hearts at him and saying how he stuck by her side through something like over a year ago. She also had photos where his parents have a house at around the same time as when she visited him where he lives, again I find weird if they took a vacation together like that. She has also tweeted things saying why don’t we just hook up with our friends because relationships suck, so I wouldn’t put it past her to have been fwb w him, especially if she is visiting him. 

When I asked him about their friendship he first brought up a situation where I went to visit a guy friend that I thought was platonic but he did things to make me uncomfortable and tried to say that he’s sure I talked shit to him. I said I’m not even into that guy and think he’s ugly. Then he claims he thinks she’s ugly because “she has a bunch of weird tattoos” and claims he’s not into tattoos when I’ve seen girls he follows and commented compliments on (before we were talking) and they have tattoos. And when I called him out on that he said “it wasn’t the tattoos that I liked about her” and said he cut the girl I was referring to off and that they were “just friends” but like why would you follow someone you cut off? He unfollowed that girl after our fight.

I and E have known each other since we have been kids. When I was six K, her husband, E and their daughter A moved to France. My mom was pretty sad about them moving, but she and K talk every day on the phone and we visit them one or two times a year. K, E and A visit their family three times a year in their home country and we see each other when they visit. L visits when he has time off from work. I and E aren't that close to each other anymore, we have each other's phone numbers but we don't text much. I have started to develop romantic feelings for E. We don't see each other often, but the last time I visited them without my mom and I noticed something different about him. He seemed very uncomfortable around me and avoided me. We were alone one evening and he came to me to talk. We had a long nice talk and after that, he started to be around me more often and smiled more around me. His sister A noticed it and came to talk to me about it. E moved back to his apartment and said to me I'm always welcome to visit him if I wanted to visit him. I took this as an opportunity, so I went and stayed one night at his place because he lives closer to the airport. He had made us dinner nothing romantic and after that, I wanted to go for a walk, he came with me and we talked more. I got my best friend back. The next day I left and he drove me to the airport. A texted me a few weeks ago and told me that E has been acting sad and weird since I left, but me and E text each other daily or talk on the phone. A called me yesterday and said that E has feelings for me. She had talked to E about his behaviour and he told A that he was in love with me. I haven't told E about my feelings, but I told A. Since then E has been calling me and I haven't answered his calls, because I'm scared that A told him about my feelings. They are coming to see their family in two weeks.

I want to hate him I want him to love me I am just so broken, I’m just glad I’m strong enough to hide this from my son as I don’t want him to pick up on any of my emotions and with all my heart I’ll shield him from it.

She was coming out of a long toxic relationship. Our first few months together were amazing. 

We only lasted about 3 months. She mentioned a couple times she wanted to settle down with me and we’d already been spending a lot of time with each other so I bring up moving in with her.

 We never had a fight or an argument. Then one day after she’d seemed off/distant for a week or so she texts me saying how she’s scared and worried about everything and how it’s moving too quickly and how she feels she needs space at times. I told her I understand and I’m totally ok with giving her space and I’d already asked her if she was SURE about living together because I didn’t want to rush things or move too quickly because the last thing I wanted was to make her feel uncomfortable. 

After her telling me all this we had a long talk on the phone and it was scaring me. I was telling her I was scared to lose her. She would tell me “you’re not just going to disappear out of my life” I asked if I was still her boyfriend and she said “I’m not gonna tell you no right now” and that really hurt. So at this point we didn’t break up yet. Work became awkward because everything had been so great up to that point and now I’m in my head wondering if I should barely talk to her saying she needs space and dealing with depression. This went on for about 3 weeks where we only saw each other 2x outside of work and both times I came over she had been drinking and we basically just had sex and that was it. 

Fast forward to about a month of this “break or whatever you wanna call it. She tells me she’s just not ready for a serious relationship and she’s not healed from her previous 8 yr relationship. I was devastated. I love this girl so much. I was telling her can’t we at least kinda start things over? Take it slow and whatnot and she says she’s just not ready. Work has been miserable for the past month and a half we still talk very little we still never argued or got in a fight through and after the breakup. She was telling me how we can still be friends and hangout even though we don’t say much to each other and hasn’t actually asked me to hangout at any point.

Well for a bit of a back story. We’ve grown up doing everything together. Most of my childhood photos have him and his family painted throughout. I cant remember a time he wasn’t part of my life. I will and always will love him like family. 

Now for the complicated part. He 25M has had feelings for me 26F in the past which has been known by everyone since we were young. I on the other hand had feelings for him in the past and never expressed it in fears I would ruin a “good thing”. Eventually we both grew up went to uni and had relationships which distanced us at times (his girlfriends always saw me as competition). But when we saw each other again it’s like we’re the same kids again.

We recently started hanging out again and I can’t stop thinking about him. I miss the way his hair feels in my hands. I miss the way he looks at me. I long for him. However! I being the person that has “friend zoned” him for quiet literally nearly two decades it would be rather unfair for me to finally confess these feelings.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7596858,public,self,I think i’m falling for my childhood best friend.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z03b02/i_think_im_falling_for_my_childhood_best_friend/,all_ads,6,

I was happy and excited to share our lives together. Herhateful altercation with her former best friend during our intimate celebration led to opening a can of worms that ruined the whole event and caused the end of some friendships and her relationship with my family. 


I'm ( m41)in a serious 5 year  relationship with Marie ( f44). We got engaged three days ago. I went through the trouble of saving up to buy her a ring, take her to a very upscale restaurant and proposed to the sound of a violinist I paid for. Last night, she destroyed everything.

We invited a group of friends and family for an informal engagement brunch. All we wanted was to get together, share our happiness and start planning. Because we have some out of town loved ones, Saturday was the most obvious and viable option. We chose a small local hotel that does open ticket brunch. Because of the price, a lot of people make it their choice.

Things went in the wrong direction when Marie noticed one of her former friends near the lobby. Everything was great until then. The minute she saw Clara( f42) , she started acting pissy and difficult. For background, they used to be best friends until 2.5 years ago when Clara stopped talking to Marie. I never asked too many details because I sensed this triggered her but according to Marie, Clara is a narcissist who fed on her admiration and ignored her after she had positive career changes in the corporate world. Her explanations sounded plausible, what became challenging was her fixation. We've had issues with this. Also, we told each other that we would leave past trauma behind so that we could both be our best version of a good partner. 

During our get together, her attitude and demeanor changed after she noticed Clara. She constantly moved away from me with excuses like needing to go look for something inside our car, etc. 

My sister pulled me aside wanting to warn me that Maria has a verbal exchange with another female ( Clara) while on a  restroom break. I asked Maria what was that all about bit she said it was long overdue that she put Clara in her place. I wasn't pleased that this happened because I hate situations like this.

After that, the entire mini-event was hijacked by Maria herself, who ranted about Clara non stop to the point that some of our guests seemed kind of losts while others were super invested into her stories, which quickly turned to ugly gossip. The point is, our celebration lost it's significance.

We were ordering more food when Clara jolted in, stood there while waiting for the waitress to take our extra orders and all of our guests were ackwardly minding their own business. Maria tried to ignore her but Clara confronted her, and when she got ignored, she became really loud. I tried to calm the situation very unsuccessfully. Clara asked Maria WHY did she hated her so much and WHAT had she done to deserve her ill will. I was surprised to see Maria trying to avoid her. Clara kind of owned her in public and Maria went mute, like deer looking at headlights. She took a hot minute to respond why she expressed so much hatred. Things got out of hand. They exchanged insults, Maria telling her that at least she has a man and that she's engaged and mentioned very personal things about Clara and her divorce. Even my parents, who could have a sharp tongue, showed disdain for my Fiancee's overkill. Some of our friends know her and were mortified by what Clara said.

Clara spit out lots of things that Maria has said about our friends in the past and referred to me by a name that Maria apparently used to describe me. I felt horrible because the nickname is disrespectful and has to do with something very private that I shared, so I know she most have said something to Clara.

Everything happened too fast. I can't remember how long it took but Clara opened a whole can of worms. I felt the humiliation, my parents were upset and our friends looked disappointed.

We tried to calm down and at least eat our food. It's such a pity because we made reservations for a heartfelt reunion and it turned out horribly. I feel sad and frustrated. After that, Clara has been posting compromising screencaptures and vice messages from her past conversations with Maria. At least two of them were published while we were still in the restaurant. Clara forwarded a voice  message to one of our friends who's also her friend. I'm not clear about the content but our friend left inmediately. It's been a shit show. Someone led another friend to Clara's social media and they told my sister about unkind screencaptures about me, some friends and even Maria's coworkers. The last time I checked was 4 hours ago and the update included screenshot tagging the company where Maria works. 

Last night was  bad. Maria got confronted by a friend's girlfriend and things got very heated, to the point that Maria ended up with a busted lip. This is unacceptable. Our friend's gf has no business assaulting anyone but Maria said some things about her for no real reason. My parents have already decided that she's not welcome in their house. I'm hurt and while I think I'm equipped to face the challenges of a relationship, I feel betrayed. I suppose she shared my very private situation with Clara a long time ago, but I'm hurt that she made it into an unkind joke.

I love her, but I don't know if I could trust her ever again. I'm also very aware that her gossip is an expression of envy and this  is a problem. 

Would it be unfair if I broke things off? I know we can get couples counseling but I don't think that would help. I'm staying out of the house to clear my head. I need to face my family and friends and her too. I feel very confused and hurt. I already invested money on buying a ring, and have made an emotional investment. I'm not emotionally ready to move on but  I can't spend my life feeling suspicious or not knowing if she being sincere.  Please send me words of encouragement and advice.

We've been together for almost 1,5 years now, want to live together next year and were supposed to meet last week (since it's a long distance relationship for now). Because of her getting sick we couldn't (fever for sure would not stop me, but I guess she felt different. apparently her mom wouldn't let her go though) so since we were really looking forward to it, we were really sad. The same day when it turned out that we can't meet she also learned that her mom was diagnosed with something very dangerous that can also be a life threat (further tests are required so she'll learn in the next month or 2). We talked a lot that night, she was incredibly sad because of these 2 situations, but I kept being strong (even though I really was affected too) and supporting her, which she thanked me for.

The next day (which was the day when we were supposed to meet) went normal, we watched some things, talked, but then in the evening she told me that she's going to bed. Normally we'd always talk before doing it, but she just went and never replied back basically ignoring me. I was pretty upset (since she'd also always be in a situation like that), and in the morning she tells me that ""these 2 events really changed our stability, that she didn't take these things well, she feels like she hit rock bottom and in order to get out of it she needs to do it herself since in the past i'd always help her mentally and this situation she needs to deal with herself since when she's with me she's so happy that she doesn't see things around her"".

I kept questioning her decision because in the past no matter that troubles we both had, we'd both deal with it together by supporting each other. But then she said that because of these 2 ""bad signs"" she's questioning a lot of things and has doubts about us. Then I started asking her if I did something wrong or if it's about me, but she said that I've been nothing but perfect and she appreciated the support that she got from me. Then she told me that in the past whenever I'd prefer to spend some time by myself, she'd go crazy (like messaging me all the time, refreshing my profiles everywhere) but nowadays even though she still wants to spend all days with me, when I want to have some time for myself it doesn't affect her and she's able to watch tv during that time and stuff. It makes her question her love.

The outcome of this was basically her asking for a break from spending time with me, to see if she really loves me or if she just loves to spend time with me. She wants to be sure before we move in together since it'd require me moving to her country. During this conversation she kept telling me that she loves me but is not sure if it's the love that can make us live together. I accepted it, then some hrs later she messaged that she loves me to which I replied that I'm only interested in love that would keep us in a relationship and if she doesn't feel this way then she shouldn't write this. She apologized, and then at night I sent her a message saying that I can't deal with this uncertainity anymore since it was killing me, and that I'll do her a favor and break up with her instead.

She replied in the morning that she just wanted this break to gain confidence in herself again, that yesterday she was going crazy realizing how much she's missing me, apologized for ruining everything and said that the months spent with me were the best in her life. I said that if after perfect months 2 situations are enough for her to question our future and want to take a break with me, then I don't want to be with her. She kept apologizing and telling me that she'll love me forever and will be waiting for me. She also said that she was scared of being able to be with me because of the fear she felt from not having her mom forever.

My bf is much more sexually experienced than me. From the start, we used to have sex multiple times a day, like any new couple. Then it was once a day for a pretty long time, there were no issues, everything was going smooth.

I noticed that at maybe the 2-year mark it started being less frequent (that's normal, I guess?). We used to have a bit rocky relationship and I sort of started looking at it like it is a chore. I stopped getting wet so easily, my boyfriend had much higher libido than me. So I started dreading to even cuddle together, because I knew he was going to get horny and want sex, when I just wanted to keep cuddling and then I'd have to reject him and both of us would feel bad and ruin the moment.

Anyways, our relationship got much much better eventually as we learnt to communicate in arguments better. But it feels like our sex life is still going downhill. 

My boyfriend had to travel to his parents a lot for the past three months. He was getting his drivers licence so we did not see each other for three weeks (just FaceTime), then he got sick for a week, came back and had to go to work a lot (he is still studying but working too because his parents don't support him anymore), and he works 12 hour shifts so I barely saw him anyways. When he wasn't at work or at his parent's, he was at home either working at his diploma (he is finishing school in May) or playing videogames for 8 hours to chill out. Then he again travelled to his parent's because of doctor appointment.

Because of all of these things, we had sex maybe just once in the past month and neither of us finished. I asked him about it and he told me it's because of all of these things I wrote above and that he is so stressed out, had to get his license, he was sick, procrastinating, stressing about finishing school and making enough money to survive. That he does still love me and nothing changed in his feelings. Through the relationship he admitted multiple times he is jerking off to porn pretty frequently and now he told me he does not even jerk off anymore that much, maybe like once a week which is so uncommon for him. That he is just not in the mood for jerking off nor sex. 

He still does things for me, he invited me to restaurant, he bought wine for us to have a nice evening and watched movie together at home (no sex), he makes me tea every day before he goes to work with cute notes to read after I wake up, he brings me sweets from work. But I feel like I initiate most physical contact, there is no flirting or spark, when I talk about my day he does not seem very interested. I am getting really worried. Should I just wait it out?

So if we’re both unmarried by the time we’re 40 we’ll marry each other! We chose 40 bc then we could still have kids if we really tried.
