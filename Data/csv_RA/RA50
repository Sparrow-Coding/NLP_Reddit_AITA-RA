During that time I had to cut off my best friend at the time and she'd left her friends as well, so we found solace and companionship in the similar situations we were in. It took awhile but we eventually became best friends. I valued her intelligence, ambitious nature, her charisma and her commitment to maintaining close friendships. I was like oh hell, she’s a great influence, great support, blunt when needed, a great friend! But after awhile at getting to know her, there's some things that don’t sit right with me. 

* She's explicitly told me she uses her guy friends as a means to just flirt if they're attractive, keep her entertained when bored or use them for career gain. When it isn't the case she keeps them around because she feels sorry for them. I think it's manipulative and disingenuous, and makes me second guess her intentions with people ever since.
* She said about her roommate ""she'd be so pretty if she lost weight."" I gained 40lbs recently. I'm not entirely sure if I'm being paranoid if I say she treats me different now. I feel like she does, and doesn't. Who knows. But if she said that about someone else she'd probably be thinking that about me right? 
* She's had arguments and fights with everyone in the friend group (3 other girls) about how she feels like they don't value her enough, etc. An infamous quote she says in general — ""I have so much love to give but people just take it for granted."" I don't even know how to interpret this. She says she has abandonment issues from her previous friend group.
* The group chat will have random general discussions sometimes. She'll join in, most of the time not. When she does, she'll change the topic and will be boasting e.g. someone flirting with her, how she flirted so well in this situation, how she dressed so well today. I understand support is needed in a friendship, but fishing her compliments and needing to validate her constantly is exhausting. It usually ends the conversation quickly.
* The first time her friends and I met I hit it off with one of them really well. We ended up splitting up and spent hours just talking outside. She confronted us and said ""you guys better not like each other too much and leave me."" Ever since then we weren't able to get too close. When we did, I felt like she would passively intervene on the connection. 
* She said ""never tell someone your flaws or they'll use it against you"" when I asked for advice if I should tell my partner about my shortcomings. I just wanted him to have clear expectations of me. I didn't follow it, and now my partner and I are very healthy and aware of each other's flaws and strengths. Makes me think if she does that though. 

Our friendship flourished into something very gossipy in nature, putting down others, psycho-analyzing people to feel some sense of intelligence, enabling toxic coping mechanisms in each other, etc. I sat back and thought, ""oh shit, do I want to be that type of person? I feel like a bitch."" So I just stopped enabling and engaging in conversations or attitudes that doesn't align with being fair, equal, non-judgemental and objective. I sort of started distancing myself and she called me out on my low efforts but I agreed to make changes to it that I really didn't want to (lesson learnt). Now we're in the middle of a break but planning to meet up to hash things out due to a situation I caused which led to something bigger. My passive actions definitely caused this due to my mixed feelings. Two people I've met has told me that they think she's toxic, an extremist and needy (they're close to me but have met her on a few occasions). It confuses me because she can be a great friend but a difficult person. I'm not sure if I should keep this friendship because of her persistent commitment to friendships, or if I should end it based on my moral judgement of her character. I'm also unsure if I'm being too critical as well since I feel like I'm judging her based off words said or situations. I just need help coming to a decision without any biased opinions from close friends.

They've been happily married (or so we thought) for over a decade and my girlfriend has tried hard to get on with the step-mother, despite what she did to her family many years ago. 

Now it turns out she's been sleeping with another man behind my girlfriends' dads back - someone from her work.

(The step-mum) is behaving like a total bitch - openly chatting with this man on her phone right in front of her husband, saying she's 'staying out with work' then when challenged on it, admitting that the person she's having an affair with drove her home (and she spent the night with him). The lack of respect is jaw dropping. 

Separation seems certain. They're having to sell the house and she's even made comments about (his) money that she has zero right to. She's a gold digger. Her family now want nothing to do with her (and she's saying that's the fault of her husband, not her affair).

Whatever's going to happen legally will happen - it'll probably be painful. 

I don't think that's karma enough. *She* deserves to be humiliated. She won't take any responsibility for the hurt she's causing our family *and* her family (including her own son from another relationship). 

My first thought was an email finding its way and her office calling her out on her behaviour - along with the guy she's having an affair with (the co-worker, who will also be leaving his marriage and a 9 year old kid behind). 

But I'm keen to tread the right side of the law. Don't want to be done for malicious communications or some other bullshit.

We work together, and he's always claiming I want attention from people that I don't even know, and have never spoken to.

I'm saying all of this to bring up the fact that I've discovered that he refuses to be friends with women that he isn't attracted to. I had  female friends that he tried to make me drop. He claims they don't like him, but they initially did, until he started being a jerk. His initial response is to talk about their weight as if they're obese women, and they're literally just a few sizes off from me. Whixh makes me feel even more insecure. He claims we never hang out with women, and that it's all my fault, but anytime they're available he never wants to hang out because he ""can't enjoy himself"".

Especially since he deems it mandatory that ge meets anyone I want to be friends with. He also acts like he's the judge on whether or not we get to be friends. He claims all men want to just fuck me, but he apparently doesn't feel the same about his ""friendships"". They're not even really friendships. Mainly just him stalking and lurking while I'm asleep at night. He's messaged them and they ignore him. He claims it's me being intimidating, but I've never met these girls, nor have I ever spoken to them. I caught him jerking it to some of their pictures and I'm entirely disgusted, but he claims there's nothing wrong with it, and that i'm just overreacting, and not loving him for who he is. I'm beyond frustrated and ready to walk away, but I wanted to make sure I'm not losing my mind first.

A bit of a back story. My boyfriend was in a horrible marriage for 20 years I’m very emotionally mentally physically abusive towards him and vice versa because nobody’s perfect. When my boyfriend and I first got together he had mentioned that he had an ex of over a year but they still talk sometimes which was fine I mean I can be a jealous person but I am a pretty mature person and understanding as to how to make a long story short this ex she ended up basically killing me to choose her. The first entire year we were together she was telling her how much she loved her and needed her Mr. how I was nothing compared to her how he was just with me to feel time and no matter what he would always wait for her because she was the love of his life she was perfect in his eyes he misses her so much he told her I was crazy I was psycho I was forcing him to be around me we thought all the time it was horrible. All the while he was sleeping in my bed telling me he loved me and wanted to be with me. He made me think so many times it was my fault for the fights that were happening and I used to think so. in-service day he constantly accuses me of things that have never ever even happened he gets it in his head that if I don’t answer my phone right away I’m not doing something horribly wrong and lying to him about where I am even when I’m at work he’ll drive by my work to check on me he doesn’t see my car there he flips out mind you I am work at multiple different locations in multiple cities I was in fairly close all within an hour but I go to several sites during my work time and he himself has even gone to work with me. But I need some help I can’t be with somebody who talks and thinks so negatively of me all the time. during the time we spend away from each other he is constantly blowing up my phone trying to figure out where I am what’s going on why I’m not answering I don’t have the time for that. The entire time we have been together 2 1/2 years I have never cheated lied been disrespectful to him myself or our relationship I begged and pleaded for him to treat me right do right by me be a decent man in life be honest and all around a decent person. After a couple years of all of this I finally have had enough and I said fuck it I don’t care anymore I care Anymore. When he left me for her I died inside I begged him I pleaded him to stay to come back to give me a chance he didn’t even know me as a person he’s been completely Afton and our two year relationship the entire time. He was gone for about a month we still keep in contact I still saw him every day we just didn’t talk as much he was very standoffish we never made Luv you weren’t into him and he wouldn’t touch me and it was off and on for the first two years of happened. Well he decided to come back he decided that I was when he wanted and that it was me that was better for him in life. I didn’t believe him so IMessage to myself and after why he broke it off with her she said I don’t know why all I know is he said that you were better for him and that was it. But I need some advice I can’t move past the hurt caused by him leaving me for her and other things he said about me being in my bed telling me things that he was telling me isn’t right. I don’t know what to do please help he says he’s changing he says he does it because he loves me which I know is a line of shit.

Thanks in advance if you read this whole thing.


Me (32) and my husband (36) have been through rough patches, but nothing like the last year. We almost divorced in April. Not only do I take care of/live with my two slightly disabled parents, my husband filed for disability recently. I am the only one working in my entire household. My husband and parents have always had battles for my attention, but with my husband quitting his job and leaving me financially responsible, I’ve felt more obligation to help out my parents and pick up his slack in our house. (Which I’m sure was the exact opposite effect my husband expected) 

When he gave me an ultimatum of “it’s me or your parents” I chose the latter and had to literally beg for days just for him to leave and give me some space. He has horrible rejection issues, PTSD, ADHD and BPD. It’s a lot to deal with.

My space was used reconnect with my parents and family, and to hang out with all the people I had lost contact with over the years due to my relationship. (My husband having severe mental illnesses isn’t easy for most people to deal with)

One of those people was my ex (35.) We had broken up 12 years prior because he cheated on me. We were basically children at the time.

 I had been in contact with my ex for some time, which my husband knew about, but it was all very platonic. The day I hung out with my ex he told me he had broken up with his girlfriend, and just happened to be moving in with one of my best friends. I didn’t tell my husband about this.

I spent a few nights (not sleeping over, just hanging out late) at my friends house while my ex was moving in. My husband called me one of those nights and I lied to him about where I was.

We had some really great times those few nights my ex was moving into my friends place. I had texted my ex hearts at one point asking when we could all hang out again. My best friend told me if me and my ex ever got back together I should really try and get him to clear up all the drug charges and warrants out he had, and I was floored. I didn’t want anything to do with that.

A few days later I asked my husband to come home so we could try and work things out. He came home immediately and agreed to therapy and working on his anger issues. The day after he came home, he went through my fucking Apple Watch that I left on the charger while I was at work and saw ALL the messages I deleted on my iPhone to/from my ex and all my friends. He threatened to take everything from me because I had cheated on him. Honestly at the time I just wanted to prove to him any way I could I never cheated on him.

I just wanted to save my marriage and see my husband get mental help… 7 months of therapy for both of us and ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT with my ex or any associated parties to my “cheating” and my husband still constantly accuses me of being unfaithful and says I’ve caused him to become depressed. He doesn’t trust anyone in his life because his wife/his life parter lied and tried to hide things from him and he will never trust anyone again.

I wanted to share my take on best friends who become interested in each other. I met this girl back in high school going into my sophomore year. We both took most of the AP and honors classes that our school would offer so we would often conveniently have classes together. I lowkey had a crush on her when I first met her but I let it go after like a month. Throughout the years we were really good friends and would participate in a lot of school activities together such as as shinanigans. She wasn’t the only girl that had caught my eye as throughout high school I obviously would find other girls attractive as well although every time I did talk to a new girl there would be conflicts and issues with me and them. It was never anything crazy just me and them having arguments with each other. So I wouldn’t truly say I had an actual relationship but instead would just fool around with other women from time to time. Going back to the best friend thing, me and her got a lot closer when COVID came and it was the end of our senior year. I started seeing her more as a beautiful women and wondered why she was still single. Although I knew I probably would never have a chance if I were to ask her anything at the time. It was also by the end of our senior year that we found out we were both going to the same college which would lead her to asking me questions about what I would bring to college and we would joke around with each other by saying we would hook each other up with someone. Little did we know what would come… summer came and she needed a job so I was able to get her the job I was currently working at. She loved the environment and ended up loving all the people we worked with. I was just happy she enjoyed where she was at working. My birthday was coming up in July and she asked me if I wanted to go see a movie with her to my surprise and I obviously said yes only if it was just the two of us. She agreed to it and we went off to see the movie I forgot the name to. During the middle of the movie I jokingly asked she could hold my hand because I was “scared.” She was like okay and held my hand almost the entirety of the movie. I’m sure she caught a hint at what I was doing and then asked me if she could lay down on me and I said of course. We were both so comfortable and it felt like a date. Our faces were pretty close to each other too although I could have leaned in for a kiss I didn’t because I didn’t want her to be weirded out lol. We both left the theater acting as if nothing happened and went home like normal. A few days later we finally talk about what happened and agreed we were both interested in each other. The rest of the summer we would just mess around with each other and tried our best to hide the fact me and her were a thing to our coworkers. Although they all probably already knew. We then got to college and the first night there we ended up sleeping together because I had came over and conveniently her roommates weren’t there that night. I stayed the entire night and left early in the morning  before her roommates would come and kissed her goodbye as a left her dorm. I really only got like 2 hours of sleep and wondered how she felt afterwards. A day later we go out to a party with friends she had just met that day and said she would only go to the party if I was there with her. The party was fun and we got drunk and acted super touchy in front of the friends we just met. They asked if we were dating although we were still only in the talking stage according to her. The thing about this girl is that she is very indecisive so I made so much effort to watch my mouth around her so that I don’t fluence a decision she makes. It was always so hard to get a fat with her too during the summer cause she was always doing something that conflicted with our times to meet up. The next day after the party I thought to myself that I need to ask this girl out already so that we’re not just fooling around without actually having a title. So I did ask her out the next night and to my surprised freaked out and didn’t know what to say. Me and her talked about it for hours and she told me she would think about. After that night I just kept getting mixed signals from her and she wouldn’t act as touchy around me afterwards. I didn’t wanna over think it but I know what her answer would probably be. She finally gave me her answer 2 weeks later and basically said she thinks we should just be friends with a sad face. She even looked at me in the eyes and said “I’m just not ready for anything right now and we don’t have to be friends anymore if you don’t want to :(“ My heart shattered and I’m sure you guys would understand why. I said we could be just friends. But as you all may know that doesn’t work. There ended being many arguments with each other and we didn’t know how to react with one another. It was heartbreaking to see every little instance of her change in front of my eyes. I missed her every day our first year of college and to this day I don’t feel the love anymore that I had for her but it is heartbreaking for me to tell the story to my friends. To those out there who are in a friends to lovers pickle I would say to just go for it cause your feelings won’t go away anytime soon anyways. I am currently in my second year in college and think about her from time to time but I just keep my mouth shut now a days.

To clarify we are strictly casual and have never met irl, but we do text (and only text) everyday. I’ve noticed I’ve become very happy when he texts me, wanting to tell him everything about my day (which I don’t). Also I’m at a point where I would like to be texting only him. As well no longer being fully fulfilled with only texting and wanting more. We’ve only been talking for a few months.

I’ve been texting other people to keep my options open as well a precaution to try not to fall in love.

Also through his words I can see that he has maintained the boundary in that he wants this to be casual. So I’m pretty sure he’s never looked at me in a different light although he does like me as someone he can talk to and get sexy stuff from.

I keep hoping this feeling will pass just as it did when I was infatuated with him when we started talking.

Me and my Fiancée have been together for 6 years and 2022 has been pretty rough for us. We both worked in a toxic work space and we we're both heavily depressed. This would lead to some stupid arguments because we we're both pressed and we would be dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety in our lives.

Back in September I managed to work up some courage and I got a new job and I've been doing pretty well lately. But a month ago, one of our close friend died and we've both been really sad and dealing with grief. Now I know my gf is pretty independant and I know she needs some time to process things, so I left her alone for a few weeks following my friend's death, because that's how she deals with things. She's rather be alone and have some alone time when she's sad. So I did just that and waited for her to come back to me. I'd ask if she needed help and she'd say no, i'm good.

A couple of days ago, I confessed to her that I thought it was super hard to deal with this on my own since I live pretty far away from my friends and they can't really help me with my struggles. I also told her that I've been missing her in the last few months. She's often away from home hanging out with friends and I started to feel left out and it almost made me feel as if I was losing her. We haven't had any intimate moments in months, I'd tell her '' I love you'' and she wouldn't reply and she's been acting really distant over the summer, I feel like we're barely roomates at this point. I give her the benefit of the doubt because she's been dealing with school, financial problems, anxiety and stress and grief but I hit my breaking point this week.

I sat her down and told her how I felt about the whole thing. She told me that she needed some time by herself so that she could ''find herself''. My problem with that is that I've been pushed to the side for a couple months now (Early Summer) and that I don't see any progress. Life hasn't stopped throwing shit our way so it's been hard to move forward and I totally get that, but I felt as if I was owed at least a little bit of affection, being her fiancé and everything.

Fast forward to yesterday, she tells me she wants to take a break. I asked her: How long? To which she replied: I don't know...

We had a long talk and she basically told me that she still loves me but she's dealing with too much things and that she can't love me if she doesn't love herself. I totally get that, but I feel like I've been on a break for 4-5 months already and I just don't know how long I'll be able to handle that. It feels like torture, I feel like i'm just waiting to be dumped.

there was no cheating involved and the break up was about as amicable as one could be. She had called things off and I still love her to the point where I would even now drop anything to be with her again. I have never changed my stance on this and I think she knows that.

We haven't spoken about the breakup as it was all we talked about for weeks and weeks repeating the same things over and over, however we have stayed in regular contact and see each other most days. 

However this past weekend she was drunk and had text me saying she still loves me, this was out of the blue as she hadn't made this very clear in the last few weeks. So being skeptical I asked her the next day and she said she meant what she had said and she did in fact love me and was almost upset to admit the fact.

Ever since we have spent most nights together not actually doing anything other than cuddling/touching, I have no clue what to do next and do not want to be too forward out of fear of being rejected again. 

We now often joke and playfully laugh about the breakup and getting back together, but nothing concrete has come of it.

Okay so I (f18) and this guy L (m18/19) are in the club together. He’s like physically attractive so I always like noticed him. Anyway we were at the clubs Halloween party/movie night and he stops his conversation and asks if I’m going to this club weekend trip that was coming up in a different state (2 nights, ~3-8 hour drive) and I’m like yeah and he goes cool and goes back to what he’s talking about.

Anyway moving ahead to the trip we were split into guy and girl hotel rooms and I was teasing this girl for liking a dude also in the club and one of Ls friends asks me about my love life and I’m like ‘crushing but the guy didnt like me back lol’ and she kinda nods and asks about it later but doesn’t really push it 

Even later most of the club got together and we drank alcohol. I might’ve gone a bit overboard considering it was my first time - note for self: vodka is a lot! - and it ended with like 7-8 of us piled onto this one bed cuddling and he was next to me and I was cold so I asked if I could hold his arm and he said yes and I essentially just cuddled his arm lol and then I put his hand on my shoulder and we kinda held hands idk? 

Anyway on the ride back home he was in our car and the two of us were sitting in the backseat and I asked if I could sleep on his shoulder and he said yes and I realized later he was almost certainly in an uncomfortable position but stayed there so I could sleep

We had a meeting today and I think I caught him looking at me? He kept looking at me after jokes were made but that could’ve been bc I’m usually reserved and they kept making me laugh he also like entered my friends and I conversation but addressed/talked to her and not me so idk.

Me (26f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been together for a bit over a year now. When we started dating it was all roses and rainbows. We had sex 2-3 times a day, so up to 10 times a week. He was lovely and caring. About 4 months into dating I got pregnant and my boyfriend did not want to have the baby with me, which almost caused us to break up. Well, I did the abortion for our relationship. And since then the sex has been, well not great. We have sex maybe once a week, sometimes once a month. 

My reason for this is that he’s pressuring me into sex. If when we started dating there was foreplay for 30minutes, now there’s absolutely horrible foreplay for 2minutes before he gets mad/frusrated that I’m not into it. He literally just pets my kitty like it’s an actual cat?! Like, I feel like my absolutely perfect beast in the sheets is an unexperienced little boy suddenly.

I’ve told him about this problem so many times and he just gets mad or annoyed with me for saying this. Like honestly, I have no interest in sex anymore if he pets me like a cat and expects for me to be into it.

We also moved in 3 months ago and I do most of the chores at home (cooking, cleaning, laundry) the only thing he does is go to the store once a week. All he does after work is play his damn PC. So after a day at work, cooking, cleaning he expects me to be excited to be petted like a cat? 

Our relationship literally sucks right now and it’s all because of sex. There’s no fun in it anymore. It just feels like one of my chores after work. Any advice will be appreciated.

Before I started feeling like something was off we went out together to hang out to get Halloween costumes together last minute and later decided to go out Saturday night downtown for some drinks. We both tried to call other friends to come out that night as well but everyone else had their own plans but one person. We walked around downtown all night trying to find a place for drinks but ended up at earls and the 3 of us ordered drinks. Immediately I felt something was off because she was spacing out. I asked her if she was doing ok and she said that she was beginning to feel stressed out about our midterm that was coming up on Tuesday. We continue having drinks and then we all head home. Fast forward after the exam we discuss how the exam went briefly and I felt an uneasiness or awkwardness talking to her but I brushed it off thinking that she still feel stressed. She usually invites me to join her class after the usual class we have together but she didn’t so I decided to go home. We usually hangout on campus in between our classes everyday but she hasn’t asked to so I ask if she’s doing ok and she tells me she went through an argument with her boyfriend and I leave it at that telling her that if she needs to rant I would be there to console and listen. I leave her be and check up on her again during the weekend and have asked mutual friends asking about her but they reply that she’s doing fine. I leave it alone but I have this gut feeling telling me otherwise. Fast forward to this week I asked to study together and we agreed to meet up at the library at a certain time and had texted her to ask where she was in the library with no response. I called her once no response. I waited for her in the library for an hour and a half and then decided to leave and ran into her at the cafe on the way out with someone else and she introduced us and I left feeling frustrated. She later texted me saying that she just got the text messages and was working on a project with her and I leave it at that and tell her that we can study tomorrow instead. Today I was walking around campus and ran into our mutual friends and caught up with them and out of no where she pops up and I greet her and we talk for a bit and ask her how she is doing because I am genuinely worried. And she just says “the same old”. We go to class together and decide to meet up to study later and she mentions that she will be bringing another friend to which I agree with and met up with her and I meet the other friend. We don’t end up studying but she and this other person talk outside while we all sit on a bench. I just silently listen after introducing myself for 45 mins in the cold. I even mention that we should try to start studying soon but they both say they’re no longer in the studying mood. After waiting I decided to make an excuse to leave because I was really cold and felt upset and disappointed. Now I don’t know if I should confront her about this because in the back of my mind I feel like I did something wrong for her to distant herself off. I feel like I may be overthinking it but idk. I’ve never really had close female friends ever so I don’t know how to approach the issue.

So here goes, I (20M) was involved with my (19 F) girlfriend in a horrible car crash this past weekend where we both are extremely lucky to be alive. For some context on the crash we hit a tree going over 50 or 60 I beleive and the car flipped with no air bags going off. I only broke my left arm (currently typing with one hand) in two places and got a few screws where as she has critical injuries but she is stable and expected to make a full or almost full recovery eventually. 

The relationship itself is under two months but we have gotten along  extremely welland it is by far my best relationship I have had at this stage. We have had deep talks, relate on many things and just generally do well together. However I have not met her parents and we are just a new couple altogether BUT i did meet them in the hospital which is a awkward situation to say the least especially since they didnt even know she was dating. 

My question to all of you is how should I go about this in terms of the relationship? Of course I am there for her in any possible  way obviously but when I saw her in the hospital bed while she was asleep I told her I loved her. I meant it when I said it because I truly do have feelings for her especially considering I almost saw her not make it but I also do not want to make her uncomfortable by saying the wrong thing while she heals. We have not exchanged the L word before so im unsure of what do. All i know is i truly do care for her and just want to do the right thing. She is definitely worth it so i dont want to fuck this up.

I don't know if I am abusive or not. I'm open to the idea that I am the abusive one in this relationship, but if that is the case, I want to know how.

The story starts around 2 months ago in September. My long distance gf of 2 years cheated on me with a guy she didn't even like because I was distant (because stressful uni term). She accepted full responsibility and promised to never do it again (she has held her promise). Since that point, she's shown immense guilt. I assured her that even if I am hurt that the future would be brighter. However, at the start of October, she requested a two week break because of how she felt and wanted to get her emotions in order. I obliged because I want to ensure she's happy. 

When that break was over (27th of October), everything seemed fine. But over the course of the last 1.5 weeks, she's been accusing me of making her want to kill herself and how I'm the cause of her depression. This came as a shock to me because this is the first time I've heard her like this outside of a dumb argument. This isn't some dumb argument, something serious is up and I want to know how I can make it better. When I ask her to please elaborate, these are some of the responses I got (I don't know how to parse it):

Her: ""you want me to look back at our messages so i feel guilty and i feel bad about this. you want to sugarcoat it with good things. now you’re gonna say you’re not saying there’s no bad things. but ffs you’re telling me to hyperfocus on the good parts. lr whatever you think is good. how about i hyperfocus on our bad shit?""

\[context: she was saying how the vast majority of the relationship she was unhappy and we just fought, even though until September, we rarely fought and our positive experiences vastly outweighed the negatives imo. Then again, I'm biased, but I want to dig deeper on why she thinks that\]. 

She doesn't want to call because she believes I manipulate her during calls. I don't know if that is true though. How do I figure out what I do that's manipulative? I really want to know. The last thing I want to do is to hurt her more. I treasure her and I want her to be happy, ideally with me. When I offered to break up, she keeps sending mixed signals. She says she wants me to leave, and I ask her if she'd prefer if it was forever, and she says ""I don't know!""

I've gone back to her every day for the last 1.5 weeks no matter how much I get emotionally hurt because I know she's hurting more. This isn't about me but is about her, how do I go about figuring out what I'm doing wrong if she refuses to tell me. Here's an example of me trying to find out:

&amp;#x200B;

\[context: I told her that her words hurt me the day prior. She was saying stuff like ""i wish we’d never met"", ""you don’t love me"", ""i want to kill myself thinking about you""\]

Her: we’re just being honest with each other. or do you want me to lie to you?

Me: I don't want you to lie to me. It's just, do you not see me as a positive in your life? do you see me as just someone who hurts you?

Her: youve toyed with my feelings long enough. i’m sick of it

Me: how? what am I doing to toy with it? how am I toying?

Her: stop it

Me: srsly tho, how do I stop something that I don't know I'm doing

Her: you’re acting like you don’t know

Me: BECAUSE I DON'T

Her: i bet you think it’s funny

Me: it's not. you're hurting. ofc its not funny

Her: you’re not actually hurt by anything. you don’t love me

Me: i do

Her: you’re just pretending

Me: do you really think the last 2 years were fake?

Her: yes

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, this is the only clue I got:

Her: **and you made me believe it more. that i need help or need someone to depend on you wanted to be dependable to the point where you can take away that attention whenever you wanted not just during uni but whenever. you wanted me to fucking depend on you. and you say you didn’t. fuck you. you’ve ruined so much**

I'm at a loss of words here, I don't know how she came to this conclusion. I feel so heartbroken just reading what she said again, I just... can't. How can I better understand what I was doing to make her feel like that? I was completely unaware she felt like that until just 3 days ago when she said that. But this message only reveals what she feels which is valid, but I can't find any instances of where I acted like that and she won't point them out. I want to better myself but most importantly to make her happy. You have no idea how happy I get when she smiles or anything like that. We have so many treasured memories as well! I know our chemistry is fantastic otherwise (unless I've been oblivious).

I want to understand how I can better understand my flaws and improve if my girlfriend is having a hard time telling me anything?

Most importantly, she's hurting right now. She's in utter emotional pain. It's 4 am where I am and I haven't been able to sleep properly knowing how hurt she is. Please, I don't know what to do and I'm stuck on how to make her feel better.

I have made many mistakes and agree that I was dumb, a shitty partner, and sabotaged the relationship. A little background about me was that I was emotionally unfaithful at the start of the relationship due to us having arguments and not being able to communicate properly. This repeated 3 times over and deteriorated the relationships between her family and mine which is due to my fault. With that there was in incident in February where I thought something happened but that wasn’t the case which emotionally left me scarred. The incident broke the dynamic between my sister and I which made it hard for my family. After a couple more months we had another argument then broke up for the 4th time then got back with each other again. Afterwards before our 5th breakup she broke my boundaries and forced me into an uncomfortable position where she was a escort and I had to sit through a month of it before she decided that it was wrong of her to put me through that. We’ve been arguing for about two years and I finally ended that this week but now I find that her friends are talking bad about me because I said I wanted nothing to do with her. The negative energy that surrounded our relationship was too much for me to bear and I couldn’t take it anymore, I have grown as a person and I do cherish the good memories that we both shared. I strongly feel that these arguments are going to keep on happening and I don’t want to be around that anymore. Now that I don’t want anything to deal with her, her friends are keeping tabs on me and making malicious comments about me, I understand that you are her friends, I hope that you can be civil about it. While you can argue that we could start out as friends, the damage done between us from both parties is too much and I feel it would be better if both of us went out with our separate ways rather than be friends. Sorry for making this long and if this post blows up I’ll try to answer any questions people may have about me to my best ability. As for my ex partner, I respect the fact she doesn’t want me to talk about her publicly and I’ll leave it at that.

So I (21F) am in a fairly new relationship with a really wonderful guy (22M) and for the most part things are going really well. We can talk endlessly about things, we like a lot of the same stuff, we don’t get tired of each other and have really similar values.

He’s sent a couple of suggestive texts and sent a few pictures and they make me feel weird. I don’t dislike them per se, but I’m still a little bit uncomfortable with everything from sexting to actual penetrative sex. However, i feel guilty because I know he he’s a way higher sex drive than I do and I feel really bad for rejecting him. I also AM sexually attracted to him and I feel very safe with him but I often don’t know how to express what I’m feeling when I feel that way.

***He is going to study in Europe for 8 months next year (we’re from the USA).

Fast forward today, he comes up to me and tells me that when I visit him in Europe, he would like to have a threesome there. I asked him why specifically at that moment and he answered “wouldn’t you rather fuck a spanish girl than a texas girl”?

***My problem is: 
-first of all, I don’t know how to tell him that this made me doubt his loyalty.

-second, does this mean he will probably cheat on me during his exchange?

-third, we’re only 7 months in. is this and indicator that he is taking advantage of my open mind relatively to sex to explore, just to leave me and go marry a more-modest woman afterwards?

We have an impeccable relationship. We have never fought before, we live together in such harmoney and love, he makes me feel loved and except for this situation, I don’t feel like he would cheat.

Guys, but my heart is telling me not to. Child support is to support the child, but I support my children just fine. I could call my kids dad right now and ask for $100 and he’d send it. I wouldn’t know when he’d send it, but I’d get it eventually.

He’s a great dad to our kids. When they’re with him, he takes them out to eat, buys them clothes, they go to the park and sometimes other places like the zoo, etc. 

My family thinks it’s going to taper off due to his new relationship and her children. I feel that if it does, I can always file later. I don’t feel comfortable taking money away from my kids when they’re with him.

i am content, although i wish i lived in another city in my country. the only thing stopping me is i don't have the money to do so.

ever since i have made this decision, she confessed she is feeling lost and would really like to study fashion properly, or even literature. her dad is buying her an apartment, so i suggested that she uses the money to go live in another city where she can get accepted at another fashion university. 

but when i told her she told me she doesn't want to leave our city for various reasons. she told me that she is not worried about friends. a lot of times she wanted to leave the city but a lover would keep her here. she said she wouldnt like a long distance relationship.
so now i feel like i am one of the reasons she is not following her dreams because of me.

i tried telling her that if she wants to travel around with like workaway, i would follow her. i would even save money to follow her eventually in another city if she moves to study fashion, but she just seems hopeless. she doesn't want to leave the vocational course because her parents already paid for it (""only"" 500€ in total)

Our relationship has been going on since November 2021. It's my first relationship, and my girlfriend has been in a fair few. This particular ex, by my girlfriend's account, is someone she went on 2-3 dates with three years ago, had sex once, and then she never saw him again.

Her ex is engaged to be married as well, so it seems really weird that he would reach out to an old few-night fling. Part of me worries for his future wife if he does have bad intentions, and I feel like it's my duty to let his partner know that her future husband is getting back in contact with an ex, potentially behind her back.

However, I'm less inclined to be concerned as obviously my girlfriend let me know (though waited a week to tell me), and I'd like to think she's motivated more by curiosity in this place - she did give me the option to tell her to not go. If this guy really does have innocent intentions I also risk disrupting a future happy marriage.

I didn't say no at first because I didn't want to seem controlling, but I'm having second thoughts.

Here's the conversation - my messages are in **bold** for ease of reading.

During the last 6 months, she gradually started to be more and more impatient with me: everything I do is ""too slow"", or the way I do them is ""stupid"".  
To give some context, it is true that I have had some mental health problems that may make me slow or not think straight *sometimes.* However, it is not always the case.

Anyway, overtime I let things settle that way and am kind of stuck on this. I tried, many times, to talk to her about that, and it doesn't work. She always comes up with one of the below:

* Find something that is indeed not optimal in my doings to prove that I am wrong being upset about her being impatient.
* Saying that it is difficult for her because I am always too slow, and it is normal to become easily irritated.
* Saying I am too sensitive and should not take her remarks so badly. She justifies it saying that in her past relationships it never happened.
* Saying that I am always too conflictual and that she started to be agressive because I started to be so.
* She doesn't accept being criticized and says she is not wrong.

Until yesterday, I kind of believed I was the one wrong. It is very difficult not to feel guilty when you have some mental health problems (mid-mood disorders due to insomnia in my case).

But yesterday, a friend came out of nowhere with ""Is everything okay with your gf? I am just asking because sometimes she says some remarks I would take badly if I were in your place"". I didn't even tell him anything about her! What a huge relief, I am not crazy and sensitive, I may be right to think that she is kinda abusive.

Despite all of the above, I don't want to leave her and I do want to give her a chance. There is many good things in our relationship and it is not so toxic. I know she has some life trauma that may be the root cause of all of this. Moreover, I know that my mood disorder is an issue and can be heavy. However, I don't think I deserve any of this (as I most of the time ok in terms of mental health). 

I also realized she has the same problems with others and seems to struggle to build long term relationships.

Hi there, essentially one of my friends (27M) is standing on the edge of a metaphorical bridge regarding his first and only relationship. Essentially the relationship was a year long and it has now been a year since the break up, but he's had an extremely hard time moving on and is still dwelling on the collapse of the relationship. He just ran into his ex today and found out she moved in way closer to his apartment, and told me he's been borderline suicidal all day, especially because it's around the anniversary of the break up.

I (23F) have never been in a relationship and don't know how to help my friend through this time in his life and I'm way too busy to spend a bunch of time with him. Having never been in a relationship I'm seeing this as maybe too dramatic of a reaction, but I understand everyone works differently and that maybe he just needs more help than myself. He has been to therapy, and copes with weed, but I want to find him another option that will hopefully pull him off of rock-bottom.

I have a 5 year old son (yes I was a teen mom,he is not the dad)

I'm not going to rant alot and make it as short as possible.

We've been in a relationship for 11 months now,at first it was great. He would video call me everyday for the first 7 months or so and always have time for me no matter what.Now he hardly ever ask me to video call him. 

For info,he works as a school bus driver during the day. During the night,he does a part time job of driving club girls around. I know that hes a hard worker and is always working for us.

What makes me suspect him is that nowadays he always hide his phone under the pillow he's sleeping on. He's never done this before and would always leave his phone in the open,I could even use it with no problems. He also changed his phone password and the lock wallpaper wasn't us anymore.  I used my phone to call him once and what I see made my heartdrop,my name was changed. It used to be sweetheart with emojis and all (cringey I know) ,now it's just my plain name.


I have confronted him many times,but he's saying that I'm imagining things and it would always ends up in an argument but after a day or so he would pamper me and apologize. It has been the 3rd time yesterday. 

He treats me and my son well,he provides for us and always gives us money. He don't even allow me to work. My son loves him which is why it's hard for me to just do something. I'm a very soft hearted person,I break down easily when someone pleads and I always forgive them.  

We were arguing yesterday and today was my son outing with his school,we were supposed to go together but I wasn't sure if he'd come but he did. He's always there in the end. I feel so pathetic.

She lives with her mother and last month, following the death of their older dog, they decided to get a new puppy, which is great! Of course I understand that it needs to be taken care of since it is very young but that means I am seeing much less of my gf than previously. For the past month, she has stated that we can only meet from 6:30pm (when her classes end) to 9pm, because she doesn't want to be away for too long and it's slightly inconvenient for her to leave later.

However it's usually only these hours I can do stuff that need to be done since I also have classes and I can't go for groceries, to the gym or anywhere else earlier, so it's deeply inconvenient for me since I have to skip multiple days in order to meet with my gf. She has also stopped coming to stay over since someone needs to take care of the puppy the day after and her mother works, so she can only stay over if her mother has a couple of days off and can take care of the dog. Which again means I have to schedule stuff much differently if I want to see her for more than 2 hours, especially if it happens to be during a week day when I have classes. So she might stay over once a month and we see each other a few hours every week, which is okay but much less than what we used to and I feel the need to see her more.

I understand that having a puppy is a responsibility and I am glad my gf is a responsible person and takes good care of him. However yesterday I talked to her to see if we can find something we can do to see each other more often and she told me there's nothing we can do and we should just be patient for the next 4-5 months till the puppy grows up a bit and the weather gets warmer. However that made me a bit sad and I feel stupid because it's almost as if I am jealous of her dog. We can only go out during these 2-3 hours that are convenient for her and we can't do anything later than 9. There's a movie she and I wanted to see this past month, but we couldn't because it would mean she would have to stay in town later than 9. 

I really enjoy spending time with her and it's not enough for me to see her a couple of hours every week for the next 4 months but I don't know what to do. She won't do anything that's inconvenient, I asked her if she could take a taxi ride home so she can stay a bit later than 9 every once in a while and offered to pay her rides but she declined because ""it's not right"".

(note: the reason she cant stay past 9 is because she takes the bus home. There are buses that can take her close to home that are past 9pm, but after 10pm her grandpa can't come pick her up after the bus ride, so she would have to walk home which is roughly 20-25 minutes)",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7571090,public,self,Jealous of my [21/m] girlfriend's [22/f] new puppy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxkz9m/jealous_of_my_21m_girlfriends_22f_new_puppy/,all_ads,6,,,

This is more of a ghost account than a TA but I will throw it away eventually lol.

I (25M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for 6 months and we've been in a relationship for 3 months. In these 3 months that we've been in a relationship, I've realised that I'm not gonna fall in love with her and I'm not the kind of person to stay in a relationship without genuine romantic feelings, so I'm gonna break up with her. However, there are two apparent problems that I need to take into account in all of this. 

The first problem is that our relationship is relatively good. We communicate well with each other, we have the same beliefs, we have opposite ways of going about life but that's never been a problem and we've never been in a fight. Add to that the fact that ours is the first relationship she's been in and it really brings into focus the fact that when I break up with her I'll be pulling the rug out from under her. I know my reasons are valid but it doesn't change the fact that I feel like I'll basically be blindsiding her. 

My girlfriend is a research student and she's currently preparing for a major submission next week Wednesday. The second problem is that because of this, the next time I see her will be next week Friday when we're supposed to leave for a couple's get away that I booked for us over a month ago. She's super excited about the get away because we haven't spent a lot of time together in a while and after that, she will be out of town for 3 months.

I had explained all of this to a friend of mine and said that it makes the most sense to break up with my girlfriend when she gets back to town in a few months time because the getaway is the last time we'll see each other until then and my friend's response was ""going on the get away makes the blindsiding worse because it's taken you 3 months to realise that she's not the one for you. If you pretend that everything is fine for the next 3 months after a whole getaway, what if that's the 3 more months it takes for her to realise that you *are* the one for her?""

That really put things into perspective for me and I now think it makes the most sense to cancel the getaway and end our relationship before it, but as soon as I as I tell her that I want to cancel the getaway and we need to talk about why, she will know something is up and I'll likely end up breaking up with her over the phone - which I don't want to do.

This all leaves me in a place where I don't want to breakup with my gf over the phone, I don't want to end our relationship before she's submitted because I know how much it sucks to be broken up with during a stressful academic period, and I don't want to break up with her on the day of our getaway because that honestly feels like the biggest douchebag move I could possibly pull. 

This all means my only option is likely Thursday - one day after her submission but one day before the getaway - but in this case it may end up being over the phone.

I know that there's no good way to breakup with someone, but I'd like to do this in the least hurtful way available to me, so I'd appreciate any feedback to that end.

About a month and half after he was settled in rehab, he broke up with me(right before our official 1 year), said I was burden on his sobriety. Of course I was heart broken and cried. He said he still wanted to be friends and still have my support through sobriety and amend the things he did and how he treated me while on drugs. It's been a long road and I'm happy to support him, but ever since he relasped 7 months ago, and put himself into a coma for three-four weeks. He did come out of it and recover from that but he has brain damage. Mind you, I don't know the extent of it, but he has memory issues. To the point that he doesn't remember breaking up with me. He thinks he broke up with me for a day and that we worked everything out. Or so it seems. He asks me for spicy pictures and videos, will tell me he loves me, things like that. I caught him flirting with a girl or two before the relapse happened, when I confronted him, he said I wasn't his gf and that he was single. Obviously this left me confused, because the day before that, he was calling me his girlfriend. He saw me talking to one person a while after he dumped me, by logging into my Facebook messenger and looking through the messages and then called me crying and distraught, saying he loves me. Again this left me confused, because he had said he wasn't in love with me and that I was burden when he initially left the relationship to focus on his sobriety. I honestly don't know if he's manipulating me, or if he's actually having memory problems from the brain damage. You would think supposedly being his gf, I would know a bit more information about something like that, but he doesn't tell me much about his life in California. He only seems excited to talk to me when its sexual. Tonight we were talking and I asked about a girl he was following on his instagram, wondering if it's a friend that he hasn't told me about or something. He said it's his therapist from his inpatient rehab. They are friends on Facebook and follow each other on Instagram. I'll admit, his past cheating still has not settled with me, we haven't talked much about it because he's focused on sobriety and not getting too stressed out and he says its too stressful to talk about. Maybe it's selfish, but I don't think it's fair that he gets to get a free pass on dealing with things he's did while on drugs because it's uncomfortable to speak about. Is he going to avoid talking about uncomfortable things his whole life so he doesn't relapse because he's fragile? Then it's left with me to deal with alone, and it's building resentment in me. Everytime he laughs at me for being insecure, while not realizing that it came from his calling me a burden and lusting after other women, I feel like such an idiot. I love him very much and would be happy to let him go be with whoever he wants or alone if he chooses. I don't know if I'm being manipulated/gaslighted or if hes genuinely is struggling from the brain damage in some capacity. One moment I'm his girlfriend and he loves me and the next I'm not.

He expressed interest about being with a guy before but I trust he’s never acted on it. We even brought in some toys to help with his desires. I know it’s not the same as a real person though.
We asked each other to reflect on what we needed before we get married. Today he came to me saying he wanted to take a break so that he could try sleeping with a guy before he married anyone. Tbh it really took me by surprise. I told him we didn’t have to take a break for that. I told him he can go sleep with a guy a few times as long as he came home to me and it didn’t impact our sex life. I also made him promise that he’d get tested and use protection. He says that he can’t sleep with someone else in good conscious because he would be in a relationship and that would feel like cheating even though I told him it would be okay. He says that he still loves me, wants to marry me, have kids one day with me. He says that he’ll always wonder what it’s like to have sex with a guy if he doesn’t do it though. I do worry bc we have both talked about how we catch feelings quickly and how we would struggle with one-night-stand type situations. He says that he still wants to be with me after he has tried it if he hasn’t caught feelings for another person. He also says he’s not wanting a relationship with another person.
I will admit that he sometimes struggles to finish when we are having sex, but I think everyone does and that is normal to struggle now and then. Then again, we’ve only ever been with each other when it comes to sex.

I’m torn. I think I’m genuinely okay with opening our relationship for him to try it. I would do just about anything for him. I struggle to understand why he doesn’t want to open the relationship to try it a few times if he doesn’t want a relationship with someone else.

This is a long story so apologies for the long read. Im a 22 male currently dating my girlfriend who is also 22, we were high school lovers who have been together since we were 15 and still are together to this day. Everything was swell at the start for a few weeks, im Australian and she is Arabic and her parents forbid her to date…ever. We had to keep it a secret because people she hated would spread rumours so it was under the radar, i ended up waiting 5 years just to even be with her physically while before that id walk past her at school pretending we were strangers. And eventually after school not seeing her face at all. During that time i had no help or advice from anyone because my dad was very abusive towards me and my mum just didn’t care. After 4 years i became so mentally drained of waiting but we knew our love was beyond everything and that we had sufficed everything together. Despite our secrecy i always had her back in school or anywhere else, i wanted that physical affection so bad because it’s all i had left to look forward to in my life. My friends eventually all had partners and i was the only one irl who was alone without seeing my partner, eventually my happiness for others turned to envy and grief. I could never open up and talk to her about it because I’ve never talked about my feelings or problems to anyone, growing up i was taught it was weakness and i had to toughen up, when i would try to show those signs of “weakness” he would abuse me until i showed no sign of pleading. But i realise all that bottling up caused me to make the worst mistakes of my life, one of them being cheating on her. Im a man who always believed in never being immoral like that and always be loyal to the people i love. I became filled with guilt and shame and eventually i would just cut myself to feel again. She found out and forgave me but sometimes she struggles to accept it and tells me she wish she exposed me but at the same time she doesn’t. I still to this day dont forgive myself and my heart is very closed off to a lot of emotions because of my upbringing, i want to feel the love and strength to give her how i used to, i don’t blame her for feeling this way. I used to show her all kinds of love because its the first time i received it, i was truly happy. I’ve been broken but i dont know how to move on. I feel like i desperately want to be single forever, that i don’t deserve to have love or feel it for breaking my own morals. But at the same time i want to be the man i promised her to be.

So my bf (M22) and I (F20) are together for more than 2 years. I do really love him and can't imagine being with someone else. 
We're doing mid distance since about an year, but manage to see each other every weekend. This is quite stressful sometimes, since traveling 4h by train is exhausting to me and I have a lot of university stuff to do but I like to take this time off to be with my bf.

Now onto the problem: my bf had a quite rough year: a good relative died in the beginning, he changed jobs and doesn't feel all to well at home because of his family situation. This made him quite moody and he developed a state of always being pissed and annoyed. I tried to help him and be with him, suggest solutions and wanting to cheer him up but nothing seems to help. He starts snapping on the smallest issue, even if I just talk about something that bothers me. 

Normally I would feel all comfortable around him but now I am always annoyed and don't even want to say or do anything, just because I feel like he will be in a bad mood. Especially when I talk about my problems and feelings (I am not always super content with my situation and my life is pretty stressful) he always says that there won't be a solution and I should start growing up and accepting I can't be completely happy and one day will know there are certain things you can't get over. 
Talking to him about my feelings are not coming through, just because he always says there's nothing you can do about them. He also does not want to talk about his own feelings (he never really did).

This makes me extremely sad, especially to not see my bf smile anymore and not seeing the glance in his eyes. It takes a lot of my energy and I start to connect more negative feelings connected to my bf but I truly love him and do not want to leave him alone.

So what can I do in this situation to gain new energy and also brighten our relationship?

Ok, so, hear me out. My husband and I got together 19 years ago. I was young, I was and still am very self conscious about communicating what I want. That's in everything in life. 
Over the last few years, I've worked hard to start asking for things I need, from help at work from coworkers, to simple things like asking my husband to load the dishwasher for me while I finish cleaning up from dinner. 
But, there's one area I struggle gaining any confidence to ask for what I want and it's probably the most important area. That's sex. 
For 19yrs I've made sex about him. I've catered it to him. I was young and dumb in the beginning and honestly didn't think sex could be that horribly enjoyable (I had shitty exes in high school lol). I learned stuff I liked over time and I damn well know what's good now. 
But I can't SAY it. I can't start that conversation.
How the hell do you tell a man you've been sleeping with that he's been doing shit wrong for 19 years? How do you tell him that you need more of this or that? Less of something else? That certain things will absolutely turn you off and other things turn you on in a hot minute? 
It all feels so stupidly embarrassing. Not just the conversation itself, but the admitting to him that I've kept it from him. How can I not hurt him but still get this to improve?
Tell him ""hey I really liked this let's do it more?"" And act like I'm just now figuring that out? 
Just to clarify, he's a great and wonderful man. He guilts himself over silly indiscretions like forgetting to grab me something at the store I wanted, things that aren't big deals. I truly believe that if I don't approach this carefully, it'll destroy him.

I don't think that she is forever in my eyes, and I'm on the verge of wanting to get out.

I am not set on getting out yet. Because she does seem to genuinely care for me, but I don't think it's reciprocated by me. I do genuinely think she's a good person but I don't have romantic feelings for her, and I have very little sexual attractiveness to her. The only thing holding me back is the idea that she genuinely cares for me. But I don't know if it's enough for me to stay. 

I want opinions in general. This is my throwaway / porn account so you can make them harsh if you want to. But I just don't see me and my girlfriend working out.

But.. with everything being there.. it just feel like something is missing and like..I know it's not just the trust but I feel like it's comfort... things just.. had not felt the same lately and we had a talk about it a while ago cause she felt it from me.

I just don't know if I should stick with it knowing how she feels....or if it's better to just let go because the trust and comfort is not there yet.

idk what im doing wrong but something definitely is
im ready to take these Ls but i want change

im scared of approaching girls because ive been shunned before,it was kinda embarrassing 😂😭
im not looking for a relationship and i dont lovebomb girls im talking to,im pretty much clear with what i want.

i can definitely work on conversation,my friend tried to set me up with a friend of hers at a party and the friend tells me that she has a headache,i go on about what i do to fix headaches😭 i could've offered a massage or something

my friend told me that i should go upto girls and ask for their instagrams but idk, isn't that too creepy?

i haven't been with any girl after my ex ( 6 months ago) and idk man i want that to change.

other than the women part,my social life is great,i like my friends a lot. i pity people like my ex who don't have friends and are just hooking up with everyone they see. i have a distinction between things and im happy about that.

its like if only i could have the conversation scripted in my mind itd be so smooth.

my instagram acc is also  not bad, better than most dudes my age

im in shape, hitting the gym to get better.
i think my biggest problem is idk what to say. im not the worst at spontaneous conversation but the pressure added makes it super tough. i dont wanna make a fool out of myself but ig its necessary.

The last couple months have been rough for us, particularly these passed few weeks. My gf says we haven’t had sex for over a month but I do not think it has been that long. We don’t have sex everyday but we definitely have had sex within the month, if not within a couple weeks, she just being dramatic. 

Lately I haven’t been in the mood so whenever she initiates that she wants to have sex I tell her “tomorrow” or “later” fully intending on giving her some love but when it comes to it, I’m either tired or not in the mood. Normally she understands and doesn’t push it but recently she’s been getting a little peeved when I tell her another time. 

About a week ago she tried initiating sex but I wasn’t feeling it so I told her this. She got… irritated I guess that’s the word for it and said she wasn’t going to ask anymore then started moving my hands away from certain areas of her body to only her abdomen and legs and saying “if you’re not gonna f*** me, get off me.” That particularly hurt my feelings because normally when we cuddle, I touch her all over even under her clothes and now she will only cuddle me if I keep my hands out of her clothes and on designated areas of her body. I asked her why and she said she feels like we’re just “kissing friends” which we’re not.

This continued of barely touching her until today when she was cleaning the kitchen and I went gave her a really enticing kiss and I admit I let my hands wander and she once again initiated sex but I pulled back and told her later because she was busy with the dishes and packing (we’re in the process of moving and she was dead in middle of packing the kitchen) she sighed very angrily then pushed me completely away from her and went into the bedroom for the rest of the night. She didn’t even finish packing the kitchen. She has been giving me the cold shoulder all night. I finally got fed up with her attitude and asked what her problem is. She told me she’s sick of me teasing her just to reject her. I told her she’s being ridiculous because I’m not teasing her, I’m just trying to love her. She got loud with me saying that me touching her the way I do and knowing she’s been wanting sex is teasing her and she doesn’t like it. She retreated to her side of the bed and hasn’t let me cuddle or touch her at all. Even now with me trying to give her what she said she wanted, she doesn’t want it now. Wtf? She’s been distancing herself from me and I can’t take it.

I’ve talked to her about it, either she says she’ll try harder to make me feel wanted or she starts crying and saying how terrible she is until I start comforting her and end up dropping the topic all together. 

I love this woman so much, and she says she loves me too, but I feel like she’d rather play on her phone than interact with me.

I’m not sure what I should do at this point, any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
