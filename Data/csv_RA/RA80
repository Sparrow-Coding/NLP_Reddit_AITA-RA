Uhh. Today I find out that my boyfriend took shrooms with his friends over the weekend and I’m not quite sure what would be the proper way of handling this situation. 

I was brought up in a Christian household where any substances are a huge no-no (minus maybe some wine on a big occasion) and it’s a completely alien concept to me. I knew that he sometimes smokes weed, and I had the same reaction to it but eventually just made peace with the fact. This however… I might just be uneducated but the thought of what condition it puts people into is disgusting to me. 

I tried talking to him saying that I’m not sure I’m alright with it, and I would probably not want my man to be involved in this sort of activity. The response I got was that he was “just having fun with friends” and that I apparently know too little about it to have a “correct” opinion. Ended on “I don’t care what you think, from time to time I might be doing it anyway”. 

Umm. We didn’t part ways on a pleasant note, and I’m not sure what course of action I should be taking next. I love him very much, he’s a very caring and supportive person, but I have no idea how to communicate this feeling of mine to him because he won’t listen.

I blame culture differences (we live in England). He’s been here 7 years, I’ve been hear 7 months. 

My(F,22,American) boyfriend (M,23,Norwegian) has been bringing up my behaviour recently but last night we had an actual conversation about it. He said that sometimes my behaviour is embarrassing to him. For example, he said last year I acted like a Karen when I tried to return a shirt to Uniqlo with a hole caused by our washing machine. I have returned things like this in the US so I thought it would be the same in the UK (which is wear we live). He said he was so embarrassed. Or three days ago, a closed escape room was giving away furniture but when we went inside we were greeted by a notice that said they were closed already. I saw two men working in there so I yelled to them if they were open. My boyfriend was embarrassed I did that but when the two men responded that the place was open, he didn’t feel embarrassed anymore. 

When I do things that are potentially embarrassing, if the situation goes my way (like the escape room) he cools down. But at the Uniqlo, he said to me when we left he was so embarrassed. I don’t get it. He says he wants me to make good first impressions to everyone he knows and I genuinely think I do but then he’ll type something in his phone notepad that says “stop talking”. 

He said I can’t take some social cues either. For example I was talking last night about clothing while we were in bed and I didn’t even think his silence meant anything bad. I just thought he was being a good listener. Then I asked “did you hear me” and he said “don’t you understand the reason I’m not answering is because I want to go to sleep?” I replied “I just thought you were being a good listener.” This same situation has happened to multiple people (his friends). I thought they were being good listeners too but my boyfriend says they didn’t want to talk about the topic anymore. I thought their silence meant they were good listeners too!

Also, I dress funky and interesting sometimes and he’s not at all embarrassed of me. Just my behaviour. I don’t know what this means.

Please don’t advise me to break up with him. This whole situation is just strange.

So I told him I’m not ready and he said that he is willing to wait for me. But I’m so scared that I won’t be ready anytime soon, and I don’t want to lose him since he is a very good friend. However If I tell him I’m not ready anytime soon then it’s going to ruin things yk. 

I do like him but I’ve had trouble with relationships for years now, I don’t know why since I love romantic stories and stuff but when it comes to real life, I can never actually do it.

It's been over a month since we had sex and I've been trying to initiate or at least see if he's interested every week. I've found out that he at least masturbates once a week in the shower. I've asked him, whenever he's horny, if he could try to let me know because I would like to be intimate.

Well, late tonight he started cuddling up to me, and we started touching on each other. He took some time to get it up, and then he asked me to ride him. For years he was the one that was in control of sex and we usually did missionary. So I was a little rusty. However, he still could hardly get it up. However, he also said that he was enjoying himself. After some time I told him to take over and he couldn't get it up. He said that it felt like he did after he came, but he was hardly hard during the time I was on top.

He thought it was weird and I asked if he had masturbated today. He said he had earlier. (I was only gone for 1.5 hrs earlier in the day and he played games the rest of the day).

We start cleaning up, and I'm feeling terribly. I have self esteem issues from weight loss and gain (he didn't find me sexually attractive for a long time bc I had gained a significant amount of weight and didn't tell me for a yr). So, while laying in bed after, he said he enjoyed himself but felt it was weird. I got emotional and said that I was worried I wasn't enough for him. He said, ""How is that supposed to make me feel? That puts a lot of pressure on me."" I was just worried he wasn't being honest in enjoying myself. I apologized but he turned over and said I needed to drop it. I assured him it wasn't bc he didnt perform, but bc I was worried that he didn't actually enjoy himself.

For brief context, he has two children from a previous relationship who live with their mother in another country. He’s very active in their lives and visits them twice a year, speaks to them everyday etc. 

Since we’ve been LDR, we’ve tried to bridge the distance - which effectively means me moving over to him as it would be easier for all involved (he’s on a two year contract) and I’m keen to explore my options overseas. He’s visiting his kids in a few weeks and one of them in particular has been unsettled, saying she wants to live with her dad etc and very upset. 

This has made my partner upset in turn, and effectively stagnant on moving our relationship in any sort of direction. I wanted him to speak to my family and have their ‘official blessings’ so to speak before I move, but he’s reluctant because of his kids not coping emotionally and has asked me to wait until he returns from his trip with the kids. 

I feel like my life is on hold; or rather, I’m placing it on hold for someone who isn’t emotionally available or present due to other factors. I’d like to have a family of my own and whilst we’ve never spoken about it properly, I don’t think he wants any more children. It’s a lot for me to uproot my life and leave my family and friends behind for a relationship that quite honestly, feels uncertain at times. 

I’ve been seriously reconsidering whether we have a future together or not.

In the beginning it was so different. We talked all the time she couldn't keep her hands off me and always have oral etc just for no reason. A while back I noticed her on her phone a lot and just really jumpy when I come in the room. Two times I caught her switching apps and confronted her about it and she told me for the longest time that she did not and that I was being paranoid. She finally told me that she was watching porn, but one of the times was on her mom's back porch. Our sex life quickly started to die and she went through my phone and accused me of cheating or something but I wasn't even talking to anyone and have never cheated. She saw spam emails on my email account that I never even opened from some bots saying something like honey women in your area. I felt she was projecting because I know she was lying about the porn because I actually saw her the first time texting quickly while looking out for me but she didn't see that I could see her through the window on the porch. I let it go but eventually looked in her phone and noticed a lot of weird apps that seemed like decoys but I couldn't prove it however I did see some recent nudes and I asked her about them. She said she took them for me but didn't like them, at this point she had never sent me a nude ever and these were full asshole pics. I know what is going on as I'm 45 and have been married before and was cheated on a lot so I had been paying on a engagement ring for a while and just stopped talking about it and stopped paying on it. This has happened a few more times and she just makes it out like I'm just being insecure. Meanwhile our sex life has died, she hasn't even touched it with her hand despite me frequently giving her oral until completion and than afterwards I get to have the most awkward sex that is really just humiliating at this point. I have told her several times that I don't believe her and that being honest would mean the world to me and if she would do that I would be willing to work through anything. I do love her deeply and I love her son and even though he is an adult I speak to him weekly. She has moved our bed where it is facing the door and she sits on her phone with her knees up so I cannot see what she is doing right away even though I see the telltale swipe. I don't know enough about android phones to find hidden apps etc but I would really like to put her back against the wall where she is honest to me as I believe that is the start to her giving up on whatever she is doing. Now we live together and I really don't think she is doing anything physical because we share a vehicle but I have had much worse happen. I have tried so hard to put it behind me but at this point when I leave for work in the morning I will not here from her unless she needs something despite seeing her online all day. Sex life is totally dead, I have told her that I am considering leaving her because I am not alright with how this is going. She tells me all the time she loves me but then again she has begun to talk to me the worst way with no respect. She can see where I am as we share our gmaps locations with each other but I really would like to catch her. I want the apology, I need it. I have sacrificed everything for her and I tell her the truth no matter what. I have tried talking to her but the only way is to catch her.

Sorry if this gets a bit messy I'm just very sad right now

Obviously I'm very young and I have a hard time sticking up for myself

I met my boyfriend (Call him M) online (because we had lots of similar interests) around January 2020 and we talked a bit and played some games then and then we went our ways and stopped talking and he blocked me. The only times we have ever called it would turn sexual and I would show my body to (M) to please (M). (That was the first time I had ever sent nudes and I haven't sent nudes to anyone besides (M)). I tend to have crushes really easily and I developed a really big crush on him and continued to do so even when we stopped talking. This lead me to look at (M)'s accounts and see who he followed and what he posted and stuff. I found out that he got a girlfriend and tried to stop myself from having feelings for him as that would be inappropriate and just a dick move on my end. This really hurt my feelings and I couldn't stop thinking about him and comparing myself to his girlfriend and the other girls he had been talking to. This was when I started going to the gym because I was super insecure and I couldn't handle it mentally, I had quit social media entirely and only focused on sleeping early, going to the gym, going to school and going to work. 

Months have passed (now august) and then (M) magically popped up and started talking to me again. I checked his socials and I found out that he didn't have a girlfriend anymore. I've told some friends about this boy I met online and how I had feelings for him. My best friend at the time was a guy and he's is still very close to me as of now we can call him (L). (L) was my best friend and we saw each other as siblings and we always looked out for each other. So when I told (L) that I was going to start talking to (M) again he was furious because he knew how much (M) wasn't good for me and my mental health, in the end he told me that it was whatever because no matter how hard he tried it wouldn't stop me from talking to (M). Me and (M) began talking again and we followed each other on Instagram, he had two accounts one account which was personal and another account which wasn't and this was the one I was following. This Instagram account had 2k followers and he was only following 15 accounts one being me and the rest being girls. Our call got really sexual and I showed him my body again. We called a couple of times and then he had stopped talking to me again. This hurt me but I got over it because I was used to it at this point. 

A guy started hitting me up and pretended that he didn't know who I was we'll call him (D) He originally found me on a friend making app and I had my game profile up so he added me and I had now clue who he was. We became really really good friends and he later admitted that he knew me all along and added me because of my good stats and he found me attractive. We would share really cool conversations about our interests and he taught me a lot of things about gym and life skills in general. We would always joke about our horrendous love lives and I introduced (D) to (L) and we became a trio. It was a fun group. We hung out as a trio and ate food and I hung out with them separately as well. I was having a really good time in my life because I was having so much fun with my female as well as my male friends, during this point because this is the first time that guys have been friends with me truly without having any intentions of doing anything sexual to me. I continue talking to (D) as (L) has stopped talking to the two of us due to depression and wanted space. Me and (D) understood and gave him space and would still constantly ask if he was doing alright. We continued talking and texting each other everyday about every detail about our lives. Literally everything. It was fun and nice to have someone to share everything with. At this point I even introduced (D) to my online friend group and we all got along very well. During the period of always texting (D) I developed feelings for him and told him. He was in shock and said that he doesn't know if he wants to date me and that he can't accept that a girl would even like him. So we nothing ever happened and we just continued being friends with no problems. 

It's around December and (M) comes back and talks to me. I thought I didn't want to talk to him anymore but I still had feelings. We continued talking again and he always complimented how pretty I was. During this time he became really on and off with me until we started talking more and more and I listened to his struggles about girls and so forth. I still had a crush on him and he continued telling me details of all the girls he had been with and how he wanted to get with some girls and proceeds to show me their Instagram handles and all. I bared with it all and just listened, thinking that he just was going through a hard time and had no one to listen to. After months and months of listening to his problems he said that he was starting to like me and was interested in me but was still unsure whether he wanted to commit to me. It was about March now and I had booked tickets to the state he lives in to visit my best female friend who had moved there and that we could meet each other. We became official in April when we met and everything was great. He said that he started having feelings for me aside from sexual when he realised that I wasn't like the other girls and that I was a virgin and had never done anything sexual with another guy. When I came back home we would call everyday and everything was perfect. 

This is when he said we were fully committed and he deleted all his Instagram socials besides his personal and got rid of all the girls he had been talking to and or had FWB with except a few girl who I will get to. I was happy. I got to see him again the next month and things were all good. During my whole relationship with (M) I had talked openly about my male friends (L) and (D) and how they were amazing people and (M) said that it was great I had nice male friends and that he wanted to meet them one day. The honeymoon phase started to wear off and I started to ask him to remove the girls he was still following because I was incredibly insecure about them. They were his previous FWBs but he says that they just talk occasionally now. This really strained our relationship as I really could not stand seeing girls on his Instagram page that he has fucked. I think this is because of how young I am but (M) was my first everything and I felt insignificant when I saw them. Again this is my fault because of how insecure I was and still am. He always comforted me and told me that he was done with the fuckboy stuff and he wasn't here to play with me anymore and that he wants to be with me in the long term. It was a few fights and lots of tears shed until he had removed the girls he was FWBs with. He still has some girl friends who I have met and have not been his FWB or one night stand that I'm completely fine with as they are nice girls. 

We have had discussion about hook-up culture and all of that and how we both agree that we would not want to participate in that (again for (M)). And I have expressed how I felt being one of those girls he used and how I had to listen to all these things about other girls before we even dated. After telling him that I was just insecure he said that he never realised how much he had hurt me without even knowing. I said that it was okay since we weren't dating at the time but it still lingers in my mind.

Our relationship had become more unstable as he began to nit-pick all of my friends especially the guys (D) and (L). He said that he didn't want me to have any guy friends because he said that they all have a crush on me and are just waiting until they can get in with me. (M) said that it was impossible for an attractive girl to be friends with a guy and for it to be purely friendship. We have had so many fights about girl-friends and guy-friends. I began slowly drifting from my guy friends and some girl friends since then. (M) started having a grudge on (D) especially.

(D) works at the same company as me but we don't work together. At work you can send messages to anyone that works there on the store computer. (D) texted me hi and I thought it was so funny how random it was to text me on the store messaging system. This wasn't out of the norm as we would find the weirdest ways to text each other. I told (M) and he was furious. He said that he wanted to kill (D) and saying racist remarks about (D) and that he was clearly trying to get with me. (D) knew that (M) did not like him already. (M) kept telling me that I shouldn't have been friends with (D) in the first place because he acted as if he never knew me to get into my life. This really didn't bother me because we had so much in common and it was fun to talk to him. To make things all good with (M) again I texted (D) a long paragraph saying that we couldn't talk anymore and that I didn't appreciate him texting me randomly in different social media platforms. (I didn't really have a problem with it but (M) talked so much about it that I kind of started to believe that (D) was weird for doing that). I did this in September.

(D) didn't reply to the text message and he respectfully removed me on all social media account. 

(M) was happy about this but now he was starting to doubt (L) who I talk to rarely and we only ever talk  about fashion and overwatch. (D) and (L) are still friends at this point and I'm not sure if (L) knows about the situation or not. 

I really miss my friends and I want to talk to (D) and (L) like the old days and hang out as a trio again. I want to send (D) a text saying sorry for everything and ruining our friendship but I'm not sure if he would want to be friends with me again. And I don't know if (L) would want to be friends with me if he found out I ended me and (D) friendship over (M). I'm very stuck, I miss my friends very much. If I don't do anything would our friendships be gone forever.

I had recently been calling with (M) less and they have been very boring and dead as he sleeps really early and I have work all day most days and I prioritise time for the gym. He says he has been having doubts about our relationship and that long distance is hard.

I will be going over to see (M) and my best female friend during December to January. 

I need some guidance as I have no one to talk to now because (M) doesn't want me to talk to anyone else and my girlfriends are all busy with their lives and boyfriends. I'm having a hard time because (M) is my first boyfriend, first everything. I know that I should break up with him but why is it so hard. I know I'm stupid.

My friend heard from one of his wife’s friends that Ive had a thing for his wife. And now he has distanced himself from me. 

So I talked to him about this. And he told me what he has heard. And in addition to the rumours about “me hitting on his wife”, he also told me that he has heard that I’ve been hitting on this other girl from the same friend group during the same time I was hitting on his wife..! I said none of this is true, and he became really uncomfortable and didn’t know what to belive. 

I have never even talked to the other girl, and I don’t even know her. 

From your perspective you could assume that all this rumours is actually true. And that I don’t know how to behave “normally” around girls. But please do not assume that. 

I also wanna add that everyone is a part of this christian community/church. And that some of the girls in this friend group are from really “conservative” families when it comes to dating and men, which is sad. But overall I really like it here.

How would someone you admire handle this situation?

I am a junior in college and began a mentorship-type relationship with a freshman this semester. We became very close and the relationship has become a friendship, though I definitely still impart wisdom and advice whenever I can since I’ve been here two years. I am attracted to him, though wouldn’t act on it because I feel non-trivially older than him and don’t want to abuse my role as a mentor, even if we are close friends. Also, my school forbids relationships between freshmen and non-freshmen (think military academy) and both of us could get in a ton of trouble if anything romantic went down. 

I was telling a friend about him on the phone and went to send her pics of him and accidentally sent them to him, including a screenshot of him shirtless on his Instagram. I told him my friend found his Instagram and sent me that picture, and that I did not mean to send that to him. He seemed to buy this and was into the idea of my friend finding him attractive (lol). We haven’t seen each other in person since so have yet to discuss it further. At a minimum he knows I was sending photos of him somewhere. How would someone you admire address this situation? I don’t want to ruin our relationship. Do I just say “You came up in conversation with my friend (we’ve been spending so much time together this wouldn’t be unreasonable/weird) and it came up that you were good-looking (He is very objectively attractive and is aware of his good looks) so she asked for pictures. I’m so sorry if I made you uncomfortable or made things weird. We are very close, but I see this as just a friendship/mentorship relationship and I’m so sorry to jeopardize that by being dumb. Let me know if you need space or anything from me.”

Part of me wishes to be fully honest and express that I have some feelings for him, but considering I don’t want to/we couldn’t act on those for 9 months I don’t know if that’s worth doing right now. I’m just usually fully honest with friends so I’m having that compulsion, but I’m not sure if that makes sense here.

He has had enough, he has switched off from me emotionally and said that we will never work unless I change my “argumentative ways”. I must highlight, disagreeing with anything he says in a discussion is considered “combative, argumentative, fighting etc”. Do you see the problem with that?

Anyway, its been a hard week. He basically said that he loves me, cares for me and wants to be with me but just feels hopeless about our “fighting” and the future is uncertain (paraphrasing). I am heartbroken and trying to let time heal.

We were previously together for 6 months in 2020, but ended things because the time just wasn’t right (difficult to navigate a new relationship during a pandemic and some big life changes!)  

We love each other, have met each other’s families, I’ve been on holiday with her and her daughter who she has 50/50 custody of and we’ve planned a big trip together in the new year. 

We don’t see each other as much as I’d like; we live about 50 mins apart, I don’t drive so rely on trains and we don’t tend to see each other on the week she has her daughter as she struggles to juggle work, child, health etc. so she rarely invites me over on those weeks. She suffers from depression which comes in waves.

I would like to hear from her every day. Usually I do, but sometimes I don’t and that makes me feel sad and like I’m not a priority. I’ve mentioned before that I like to hear from her and worry when I don’t. She is a really bad texter. Like really bad. She leaves her friends on read regularly so I know it’s not just me. I try to be understanding as I know her life is hectic and depression makes people withdraw, but it does hurt my feelings. 

It especially hurts my feelings when I know she has time to text her ex-husband back (they’re friends and have a good coparenting relationship) but not me. I logically understand they need to discuss childcare logistics and are friends, but emotionally it doesn’t feel great. 

I’m worried if I bring this up, I’ll seem needy or like I’m unsympathetic to her situation. She has a tendency to blame herself and be really hard on herself so I’m anxious to phrase it as gently as possible without ignoring my needs too much. 

Thinking about something like:

“I understand that life can feel overwhelming, but I feel anxious and disconnected when I don’t hear from you, especially when it’s a week we’re not seeing each other. It would mean a lot to me if you checked in more, even just a ‘it’s been a busy day, how was yours?’ text or call.”

We haven’t seen each other in person since so have yet to discuss it further. At a minimum he knows I was sending photos of him somewhere. How would someone you admire address this situation? I don’t want to ruin our relationship. Do I just say “You came up in conversation with my friend (we’ve been spending so much time together this wouldn’t be unreasonable/weird) and it came up that you were good-looking (He is very objectively attractive and is aware of his good looks) so she asked for pictures. I’m so sorry if I made you uncomfortable or made things weird. We are very close, but I see this as just a friendship/mentorship relationship and I’m so sorry to jeopardize that by being dumb. Let me know if you need space or anything from me.”

Part of me wishes to be fully honest and express that I have some feelings for him, but considering I don’t want to/we couldn’t act on those for 9 months I don’t know if that’s worth doing right now. I’m just usually fully honest with friends so I’m having that compulsion, but I’m not sure if that makes sense here.

He doesn't like the way I show affection and doesn't think I carve out enough time for him in my schedule, and I think he's too clingy. We basically have 2 completely different ways of doing things regarding relationships. We have disagreements a lot and almost every time we hang out he texts me new things that I do that he has problems with. My best friend (19M) and I have always done this little fake flirting thing and my boyfriend didn't like that, and for some reason about a month ago, he proposed the way to fix it is adding him to our relationship. At the time we all thought about it for like a week and decided to agree because we thought that if it got messy we could just talk it through and there would be no hard feelings (dumbass thinking). It has been a month since it started, me and my boyfriend still have problems, my best friend and I basically stopped doing the flirting thing we did before, and apparently all my boyfriend does is complain about our side of the relationship to my best friend. We decided at the time that we were going to keep this a complete secret, and that we each got to only tell one person. My boyfriend chose his best friend, my best friend chose a mutual friend of ours, and i chose another close friend. I only told my close friend recently, so i've been dealing with things and making decisions about it on my own (stupid idea). My biggest problem about anything is that I think my best friend actually likes me, and I don't know what to do about my boyfriend. ""Well of course your best friend likes you if he agreed to it in the first place!"" is what one might say, but I am clearly not a critical thinker, and when we made romantic jokes and talked about things with me I didn't get the hint. What might be my best option is breaking up with my boyfriend and staying with my best friend, but I can't decide. I like my boyfriend, but not all the time. Sometimes he is an asshole in public and does things that I don't like, but i still like him when i don't think of what he does as embarrassing. I've also grown close to his friends throughout our relationship and i'm afraid of losing them. If we broke up I would still want to be friends with him, but i'm afraid he will promise to be friends and then slowly drift away. He also got me into a bunch of new hobbies and activities that i've made friends in and he is in all of those with me. It's also kind of an asshole move to break up with someone then immediately get with someone else, or kick someone out of a relationship and stay with the other. I also can't tell if I like my best friend or not, but I think I do. Fuck me.

For background info, my boyfriend C (26M) and I (26F) have been dating for almost 8 months. During this time, he has been by far the sweetest and most caring person I've ever been with. He has never given me a reason not to trust him.

My boyfriend recently got promoted to restaurant general manager, and he just started working at a new location. He has a coworker named B, and I don't know anything about her other than him saying she's a hard worker and is probably his best server. However, last night my boyfriend was scrolling through his text messages with one of his guy friends who is also a manager for this restaurant chain, and I accidentally saw a message that said ""I want to f\*ck B in the a\*\* and I don't know why. Brb deleting myself"". His friend was like ""Yeah, B has an amazing a\*\*"" and the conversation about her died there. I immediately became upset, but I took a breath before I reacted. He left the room to go grab something, and when he came back, I casually in a non threatening way asked him if he had any coworkers who he thinks are cute. He said he wanted to be honest with me and told me there were a couple cute server girls, but he wasn't attracted to them and only wanted me.

I know guys have their own way of communicating, and my boyfriend's message about B mostly sounds like an impulsive thought that he decided to express to his friend, but I can't help but feel bad about it. I am also worried about looking crazy if I tell him I saw his message while he was scrolling. Is this a red flag and worth bringing up to my boyfriend?

&amp;#x200B;

loooooooong version

So basically my GF is putting me in a situation where it feels like she is using emotional threats to get her way. So for the context I am someone who has few but very close friends, amongst these close friends there is a girl (ill call her Juliette) who is someone I had been friends with and at one point developed a crush on and asked out twice, both times rejected. I have on a regular basis asked my GF if my friendship with Juliette bothered her and if she wanted me to take certain actions to make her feel more secure and the only one was that I not talk about her too much which at the start I did arguably do which gave her the wrong impressions but have stopped since then and my GF has regularly stated she saw no issues between me and Juliette even after the elements added below. 

About 8 months (we have now been dating for 1 year and 4 months) into the relationship with my GF, she one day decided to skip class with her friend (she tends to be model student so not a regular activity for her) but her friend ended up going to class and she didn't and the teacher decided to put in some harsh consequences. Now she called me panicked waking me up ( I started later) and I spent the morning trying to comfort and reassure her the best I could, even texting her in class when I could not be on the phone with her but at some point it feels like I was hitting a brick wall (being autistic I'm not the best at dealing with emotions). Now I could tell she really wasn't taking it well with her breathing hard over the phone and clearly in a bad shape and in her panic she is being unintentionally kind of nasty telling me I'm shit at reassuring her and that I should really understand emotions better. At one point I do say. being rubbed the wrong way by her comment's, ""look you put yourself into this situation, I'm trying my best to help you but if you're not happy you can try to fix it without me""  (and I recognize this was not what I should have done but cant change the past. After a bit more comforting I get out of class for lunch break at which point, completely out of ideas on how to comfort her and pissed off by her comments towards me, I tell her that I had to go work and leave her when she was not completely over her panic attack despite my best efforts all morning. Now I ended not working and having lunch Juliette and chatting with her and catching up (she had done a burn out the semester before so I was worried about her and making sure she didn't repeat it). Now in the afternoon I catch up with my GF again and she seems to no longer be in the panicked state she was in earlier after having called on another friend who was far better at handling this situation and at some point during the conversation I mention the fact that I ended up having lunch with Juliette. Now my GF took this really badly and since has interpreted it as me having left her in her panic to go have lunch with Juliette which was not the case but I understand how she interprets it that way. Now I get that this marked her and she claims to have developed this fear that she is not the priority in my eyes and that if I had to choose between her and my close friends I would choose them and especially Juliette. Now I do get why she has this fear due to the consequences of my actions and do not question it. However, since then I have worked on myself and by her own admission have changed and she has said that she felt a lot better around me now than in the past and that she was happy that I had been there for her without defection during multiple events since. 

This brings us to today where I'm doing a year abroad and so is Juliette in a neighboring country.  Me and Juliette have been talking about visiting each other for a while now and my GF was always aware of these plans and never opposed them and I kept it regularly updated about the plans (for the note I am interested in visiting the country independently of if my friend was there or not but its a bonus). When me and Juliette finally settle on a date (New Years), she blocks and says actually no I'm not comfortable with this and an argument ensues because I was surprised and upset that she was stopping me from trying to see one of my closest friends especially since she had not opposed the plan until now (4 months). She argues that what changed her mind is that a third friend of mine who was going to be there is going to be doing travelling of her own at the time and that my GF had always made the trip conditional on both friends being there (I don't remember her making this claim but she claims she did). once the argument calms down we talk about it again calmly and she explained that basically she felt as if her feelings were not taken into account and that I should not go. At first I thought that she was jealous of my friend and despite by her own admission of me never giving her the impression that I would leave her for someone else she was insecure. She said it was not that and that she wasnt scared that I would leave her for Juliette. She went on to explain to me that it was related to the incident mentioned above where she felt like she was not the priority and that she didn't want me to go see that one friend specifically. Confused because she said that I had always been there for her since that one event even staying up all night to comfort her at times and skipping class to help her on one occasion, I asked her if she though that if the same scenario as the one described above would happen again she though I would abandon her for a friend, she said no but that she couldn't be sure until the same situation arises and I would act in a way that would secure her. Now I pointed out that the conditions for such a scenario was impossible and that she couldn't possible ask the impossible as proof and basically she admitted that the one way for me to prove that I would not choose my friend over her if she was feeling bad was if I simply didn't go see my best friend which IDK when ill see next because we aren't going to be doing our masters in the same country. She also admitted that her fear was not founded in any actions that she though I would do but rather because she felt that her feelings, no matter where they came from had to be justified no matter the consequnces for me. And so she made her ""final offer""

She basically told me ""you can go see your friend but if you do, I deem that you do not respect my feelings and my limits and thus will not respect you and will feel free to hang out with my guy friends who are hitting on me, even the one which openly offered to be friends with benefits with me if I wanted to and that she admitted she had been physcially attracted to for a  while were were dating and that the only reason she didn't do it is because 'he was more of a desire and she was really planning on doing it'""(she has not seen the guy since after I blocked and didn't protest it).  Now I immediately called bullshit and said that her reaction was way out of line and that the demands were not comparable but she keeps stonewalling saying that if I go see Juliette she will not care either Ignoring basic decency of not hanging out with a guy who says he wants to fuck you and you hesitated on. but she insists that all I have to do is respect her feelings despite but by her own admission her feelings are completely irrational because she doesn't think I would either cheat on her or that I would choose a friend over her anymore but that to prove it I had to not go see my best friend for no other reason that ""I dont like it"".",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7535399,public,self,My (20m) GF (19f) is saying that I shouldn't go see my best friend because it doesn't respect her feelings despite her admitting that her fear is not rational and is using emotional threats as a bargaining chip and idk what to do.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytxri6/my_20m_gf_19f_is_saying_that_i_shouldnt_go_see_my/,all_ads,6,

He is honestly a very caring, calm person and I've always admired that about him. But my anger issues got in the way of our relationship because I kept lashing out at him and it eventually caused him to fall out of love with me. So he ended things with me and said we could be friends. 

I was heartbroken but went NC for a few months, dated another guy etc. During NC he did reach out but I respectfully told him I wasn't ready to be friends.  He dated other women too. Gradually, we managed to develop a friendship without any animosity that's lasted several years. 

What I've noticed (and it's very confusing for me) is that he seems to have trouble keeping the friendship boundaries. We're not SUPER close friends in that we talk every day or even every week. There have been gaps when we don't communicate because I travel a lot and I really focus on my work. But, EVERY TIME we talk to each other and meet up, he's still very attracted to me, to the point where he admits it and tries to restart our romantic relationship. He's even mentioned several times traveling to come to see me. 

I no longer feel sexual attraction for him, but I feel a real closeness to him, and our chemistry is still there. He's flat-out told me that he will always be there for me no matter how long it's been. I crave our emotional closeness (sometimes in ways that I think AREN'T entirely platonic) and I know I can talk to him about ANYTHING and vice-versa but that's about it. 

So I guess I just need some insight here...

1) How is it that he fell out of love with me and yet every time we've met in the past 4 years he's still wanted to try things again with me? Do exes forget the things that break you up? 

2)  Should I just cut things off with him?

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed. The prices were astronomical, it was like 70 for us both and I had to pay the whole thing. I complained but instead of offering to chip in she made an uncomfortable face so I pretended I wanted to pay, and unfortunately had to pay the whole first date.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date.

I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me. I also threatened to get up and leave. This time the cost was almost 100 and it's ridiculous she expected me to pay it all AGAIN.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the WHOLE meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time. But I was just trying to get even with her and it was her turn to pay which was why I locked my card.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her and told her that sometimes couples fight. I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my shoes and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.

We've lived together for nearly 2 years. In this time I've dealt with him being addicted to pain killers, Xanax, and alcohol. 
I had no idea this was an issue with him until we moved in together as he never did the stuff around me. 

He has a horrible temper and anything mind altering just makes it so much worse. He also lives off a trust fund that I had no idea about. He had a normal outdoorsy type job when I met him and drove a shitty suv so I had no reason to think otherwise. Now he refuses to work or let me work so I have to be in his presence all day, every day. He gets upset even if I go see my family.

Over the last two years he's busted 4 tvs, punched several big holes in the wall, tried to ""give me back to my ex"" like I'm property, threatened to unalive himself if I left, pulled a knife etc. If he wasn't so much bigger than me, it wouldn't be as scary. He's 6ft and over 370lbs. I'm 5'1 and around 130lbs but I'm scrappy as hell as I grew up around all boys and had to fight my way to the top. 

Unfortunately since he isn't letting me work and I don't have my own car, I've been stuck. I haven't been able to get out. I've read enough reddit to know this is a dangerous situation. I live in a very rural area and there is no domestic violence shelters or help for women.

The next day he had gotten mad bc I didn’t speak to him. And I told him that it shouldn’t matter bc he was the one who wanted space and had acted like he didn’t want to be with me so I could only respect it. We had argued and I ended up comforting him once again and he still did not apologize. After that he had asked me to do something for him and I told him I wasn’t going to do it because he couldn’t even apologize. He then gave me a poor excuse of an apology so that I could do what he asked of me. I felt like it wasn’t sincere since the only reason he was going to apologize was bc he wanted something. But was fine with letting me walk away with conflict unresolved as-long as he felt good about it. He also got mad that I didn’t do what he asked and had said “but I said sorry” 

In the morning we had gotten into another argument bc I just wanted to make things right and he refused. I told him he never wants to communicate, compromise, or apologize for anything. He then got mad and tried to flip things on me and say it was my fault. He said that he had never done anything wrong and that it was me. I told him that he was being prideful and selfish and everything could’ve been solved if he didn’t let those things get in the way in the first place. I feel like that was the root cause of our issues anyway. He was being too prideful to accept help and instead of communicating, decided to be selfish and push me away and not think about how that made me feel. And then continued to ignore my efforts to comfort him. 

He kept blaming me and then told me that he is done with me and to go away. After that he had said “go find someone else better” and out of anger I said “I will since I asked you to do better for me and you couldn’t” I felt like he said it to push me away. But part of me feels like he did it bc he just simply refuses to put more effort and that was the easy way out. 

I also felt like he didn’t expect that response and expected me to cry and beg him since he’s used to girls doing that for him. But I’m just tired of extending myself first so I had to put my foot down and show him I’d put me first anytime. 

I’m just so confused and don’t know why someone would say something like that.

He always just tells me to brush it off or let him deal with it, but the result is always the same. His family just never stops and continues to talk shit about me. Tonight, I told him that I was feeling very low. I asked for some emotional support. His response? “Okay, but let’s finish up because I need to go to bed”.

I could tell we were going to move towards a relationship vs casual just by the sex we started having almost immediately, he let me know that he had never cum from a BJ or HJ, so I never took it personally and we obviously had just met so sex felt electric and very sensual.

Since we moved out of the super fresh stage, our romantic relationship just goes from strength to strength. But our sex life is just okay, sometime we have amazing sex and other times not so much. Basically, at the beginning of the relationship I had a lot of self esteem work to do and I associated him being difficult to cum with me being a failure in the bedroom. I've never struggled to make a guy cum, so he was the first, and I kinda just thought 'ah doubt thats true, I will be able to', and I thought 'i'll just ask him what feels good and do more of that', but he literally cannot tell me one single thing he thinks feels good. In our 1.5 year relationship, I've made him cum from a BJ twice, which he swears was the first and second time ever. Obviously that made me feel great when it happened, but this shows me something I do \*does\* feel good, but when I ask him he literally cannot get the words out whatsoever, he just freezes up and says something like 'its nice, thank you'. Having tried a good few things now that are all 'nice' and 'okay', it has become meaningless and sometimes annoying.

Over time, I just sort of learned to accept that he doesn't cum easily, only ever from PIV and on the rare occasion the BJ, but it's almost like he feels ashamed of those and is unable to talk about what might have gone well during those to reach that outcome. I have tried to stop focusing on the outcome of cumming entirely, and most of the time I do it well and I am able to feel super confident knowing that I did my best and he just doesn't cum as easily as others i've been with (I don't say this to him). But sometimes, like today, I just feel so down. I've noticed that I've started to avoid sex if I'm not in a fantastic mood or good place mentally, because I associate it with feeling unattractive because of how the sex goes: He knows that he can make me cum, he does that (he is satisfied), then I'll try (hopelessly) to get on top and he doesn't express any kind of pleasure, and I just have to stop at some point and accept I've failed. I know I can't always associate with him not cumming with my own personal failure, but I can't help it.

When I try to playfully talk about what he might like in the bedroom, he just says 'I don't know'. I've asked him to wank (show me) and he doesn't want to, fair enough, I've asked him to show me how I can mimic his own moves when he wanks, he will just do it for like a second until he changes the subject. Any conversation I open, he answers the question and then changes the subject.

I'm in between a rock and a hard place because 1 - I don't want to show him that I'm focusing on him cumming because I know it'll make it worse, and 2 - wanting to talk to him more about it but knowing it'll be fruitless. I think ultimately I know it's not a me problem, I'm trying hard to understand his likes and dislikes even without verbal communication, but its becoming deeply unsatisfying for me.

One day some random guy called me, he sent me pictures of her at his crib, bank transfers, a few chats.

I basically had to pry every answer from him about details , he said “her house was far I didn't know, im sorry I don't want it to look bad because it wasn't :/ , I literally talked about you so much and blah blah blah blah”

I said I wished he told me more about the person he was driving far to see, he explaining he didn’t drive to see her it was so she could wash her comforter (???)

I saidI didnt  care if he hung out with girls but it is respectful to tell me when you are, especially if you’re getting home at almost 4 in the morning . 

He said he told me earlier about seeing the friend (didn’t mention any details of the friend) and immediately deflects with saying “I feel like I can't have any friends if I'm going to be honest”

He argued with me for a while, brought up my sexuality (I’m Bi) and that I stay out late as a way to level his wrongdoing I guess, and the argument then became about him wanting trust from me and how he trusts me and by me not trusting him it means i don’t respect him. 

Am I crazy? Is it not justified to expect my partner to let me know if he’s with a female I don’t know at 3am? I always let him know who I’m going to see , out of courtesy. His thought process is that because he doesn’t ask who I’m with, it’s showing that he trusts me, and therefore I should do the same with him.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7535211,public,self,SO (m) was hanging out with someone I don’t know (f) at 3:30am,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytx5pt/so_m_was_hanging_out_with_someone_i_dont_know_f/,all_ads,6,

I (29) messed up, actually we both did in the grand scheme of things but i reacted in a way that is super unhealthy and i said some things that i cannot take back. 

My person (31m) sometimes browses reddit and i can't run the risk of him seeing his apology posted online before i have a chance to send it. 

Any takers to give it a read and give me some genuine stranger advice to see if it conveys the message i want it to? 

You'd really be doing me a huge favour. I love this man and i am fundamentally changed for the better just because i met him but i issued an ultimatum because i was insecure.

Or just wait a little bit so thank you in advance for listening. so I met this boy eight months ago, with no intention of being with him at all. He was a really good friend starting off. He seemed great honestly. And slowly but surely I feel for him and I know he had just gotten out of a bad relationship so I wasn’t looking to push anything. I wasn’t looking to tell him anything until I knew he was ready or I was ready or never it all that works for me too. But one day he brought it up and he asked me and I answered truthfully, and I told him I wouldn’t act on anything until he told me for sure that’s what he wanted. everything was great starting out honeymoon phase. I guess I don’t know I’m talking every day constantly. FaceTime me every day constantly going out I got used to that I went from not talking to anyone constantly, and usually being by myself most of the time. to talking to this one person every day day and night no matter what. then one day things get weird I don’t know if I did it or not he knows about my past and what I’ve been through in my past isn’t pretty, but it didn’t change who I was. I am still the kind hearted loving person that I’ve always been, and will continue to be regardless of what happens to me, because sadly, I am a hopeless, romantic. Trust me I beat myself up about it every day. And one day, my trauma got the best of me and I got quiet. I got really quiet and he doesn’t like it when I don’t talk and I explain to him why I was feeling the way I was, and why I wasn’t talking as much and I apologized though I know I shouldn’t apologize for my trauma. I still did anyway and I thought everything was fine because we talked until the morning we didn’t go to sleep at all then I thought everything was OK but I was wrong. Because the next thing I know we’re barely talking we’re no longer on the phone we do share locations so he knows where I’m at. I know where he is that’s how I realized he was talking to someone else you know that gut feeling you have when you just know something isn’t right and you know what it is but you’re trying to trick yourself into thinking it’s not that. I couldn’t trick myself. And he didn’t tell me that I would think that. Hey we’re friends at least we would tell each other because that’s what we agreed upon if someone ever came into the picture that wasn’t one of us we were tell each other regardless of how much it hurt. he didn’t tell me. I figured it out and brought it up to him and that’s when he told me and his exact words were I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to hurt you and me being the person I am I didn’t cry, ready did enough of that before I even asked him. I didn’t waver. I just smiled and said it’s OK. that I’m happy for him and I hope that she is everything that he wants and I will always be rooting for him in his corner like a good friend that I always end up being. he told me about her, and even though it hurt, and I was a little jealous, I still gave him. Good advice still was a great friend regardless. came to find out he didn’t really like her like that. He was playing with her and then she blocked him to be with her ex. then he came back to me like we used to calling all the time texting all the time. After all this, we went out once, because I really wanted to go to the fair. and after all that, and I got home, and we were on the phone again, we got back on the subject of him, not telling me, and I told him honestly that I really contemplated not talking to him again, or just kicking him out of my life completely not because of him hurting me not because of him being with someone else nothing like that it was just simply because if I’m supposed to be your friend why didn’t you tell me that he told me that why would I do that because we’re friends and he didn’t wanna hurt me….. if we’re just friends why would it hurt me? Why were you scared to tell me? I let that go because it is a new leaf. We’re turning over getting back to her old self so just for him to stop again and I brought up my concerns and he said nothing was going on the anxiety and me and my attachment issues that I’m still working through had me checking his location sometimes especially when he took too long for him to respond and I’m not talking about a few minutes. I’m talking about hours so people don’t think I’m crazy because I promise you I’m not. And he was at home most of the time or work or school(college) but I don’t know it’s like I have this feeling that it’s the same but this time I really don’t know because he said it’s nothing I want to believe him but my trust was broken the first time. I’m OK with people not choosing me. It’s happened most my life and I’m only useful to people when I’m needed. Not what I wanted. My family taught me that along with most people in my life but that’s another therapy session to go through. I’m OK with being alone in life I’m OK just being. I would just rather know for a fact what’s happening are we just staying friends? Are we moving somewhere to where we can be more than friends? What are we doing? that’s all I wanna know in. I think I’ve been friend zoned, but sometimes the way he acts like he wants us to be more than friends. Like we’re together because we act like boyfriend and girlfriend, but we’re not. PS we have done the devils tango quite a bit. He knows my family I know his we are both consenting adults. right now I just feel so many emotions and I’m lost. I’ve been hurt a lot before. he has to. And I’m not knocking his hurt I’m not trying to minimize his feelings. Everyone heals at their own pace, but if I learned anything, you can’t let one person that hurt you dictate how you are for the rest of your life. because the people that want to help you I want to be there for you I want to do anything they possibly can to make you happy. you make them not wanna do it anymore you make them wanna be like you I never let anyone in again. because unfortunately, I’m guessing getting to that point yes, I know we’ve only known each other for a short amount of time and I could just be extremely naïve but some advice would really be great because I know what my conscience is telling me what my gut and heart are telling me but I’m scared because they’re all saying different things so I really don’t know some assistance would be great.

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed. The prices were astronomical, it was like 70 for us both and I had to pay the whole thing. I complained but instead of offering to chip in she made an uncomfortable face so I pretended I wanted to pay, and unfortunately had to pay the whole first date. 

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date.

I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me. I also threatened to get up and leave. This time the cost was almost 100 and it's ridiculous she expected me to pay it all AGAIN.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the WHOLE meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time. But I was just trying to get even with her and it was her turn to pay which was why I locked my card.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her and told her that sometimes couples fight. I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my shoes and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date. She has just completely ghosted me all because I simply stood up for myself and advocated equality.

Careful, it's gonna be a pretty long one.

So my GF and I have been together for a little more than 6 months and we've had our fair share of arguments. Most of the time, it revolved around ex-fwbs and gfs. My mistake was when this question came (around 2 weeks into the relationship), she explicitly told me that she'd break up if I were to still talking to them (and I emphasise talking as just straight up normal conversation about daily life and news about them). 

At first, I told that she could trust me about it. But she found out and I had to erase two friends (past fwbs with whom now I see just as friends only) from every social media I have if I wanted to stay with her even though I told her numerous times that these people saw me as just a friend like I see them as just friends.

And multiple times I would undo what I've done, but it resulted in more arguments.

Yesterday, we've had a talk about trust. And in the end I thought that I was the only one toxic. And she agreed emphasising the fact that she didn't do anything toxic and I should even thank her for allowing everything I've done so far.

And yesterday, she also told me that if I had issues or problems, she should be the one listening and not other girls that I see as friends. Because it makes her feel like I can't trust her.

Background: Me M23 have been pursing said girl F22 for a year now. We talked on instagram and met in person numerous times. The friendship we had didn’t really elevate till summer where we started doing more activities together and spending alone time. This is however the part that will most likely be judged. I haven’t been in the dating game for years; TLDR it’s been 4 years since I actually dated and idk how to read signs of what is good and bad at times. I follow the relationship advice and take the title 9 training at school serious to where I know how to be a proper partner and how to give them space and not controlling. I will ask about their day and ask them to text me to let me know if they arrived at their destination when traveling or just a random night activity. Yet, I am not her boyfriend. We got closer over the summer but when the question was raised it was more of less “You’re going back to school, so we can’t really give it a shot”. That hurt but I went with it and we stayed in contact a lot. Recently though things have changed. We mostly stayed in touch through Snapchat and I would text her occasionally, but there were periods where I would get ghosted for 2 days and she returns. This has happened 4 times now and recently I just lost the BFF emoji. It may not mean much but it really hurts to be talking to someone normal that you care about to just get ghosted for 2 days and the BFF emoji disappear. 

I need guidance or some advice. We haven’t really talked at all, we just snaps back and forth of our faces with no words, but it really feels like the friendship is just dying. She hasn’t unfollowed me on social media, but the stress of thinking how toxic I’m becoming from this overthinking is pushing me to a limit. I could honestly care less about the emoji and more or less losing the girl. The only issue is, I feel empty each time she ghosts, it just hurts more now because it feels like she really is talking to someone else and I can’t just go home because I am slow close to my degree that I could devote time after this one semester. The more I see it though, it’s starting to feel toxic. What do I do?

Lately we have been in a quite good place, until a normal conversation escalated last night. Which made this extra devastating.

I feel like this, on top of everything, is a deal breaker, but I hesitate (as so many times before) to leave him, because what do I do?

So I 29(m) dated this girl 27(f) two years ago. She moved so we broke it off but we've reconnected recently. We still live far apart for now but we've been talking almost every day / night for like 2 months. It's mostly been great BUT every once in awhile she'll drink and she's on some new medication and when the two mix she becomes completely unreasonable and just makes zero sense in our convos. It's not only unreasonable but there's anger and resentment that comes out of nowhere It's honestly very disconcerting. I like her a lot we've always had a special connection I mean we talked on the phone for 8 hours a few days ago. Idk if that's normal for most people but I've NEVER had that sort of connection with anyone in the past. 

Tonight we had been talking for a few hours and then took what was supposed to be a 5 min break and then she disappeared for like an hour and when she called me back her mood had COMPLETELY changed she was all of the sudden being short with me and made a bunch of weird excuses as to why it took her so long to call back. So I don't know if she had a few glasses of wine and it hit her like a load of bricks or if something else happened that would make her flip a switch. 

We've been talking about me leaving my life and job down here to move in with her and start a life together but after tonight I'm having major doubts about if that is a good idea. For one if it is a case of drinks getting mixed with meds and this happens when we're living together then what? She gets mad and I leave and go where I know no one where she lives now.

If these people are guys I usually make a little joke about how I’m jealous but deep down I know if I mention that I had spoken to Radom girls on nights out she would be extremely jealous and angry so much so that I don’t really talk to any female anymore that she doesn’t know personally.

Just yesterday, I went for a night out with her and all her college friends to celebrate a graduation and she got extremely drunk. On the night out she was talking with a lot of guys that she told me she had met in college and was congratulating them on graduating, which I had no issue with.

Back at the house she drunkenly started talking to me about how if she was single she would be able to get with so many boys and it would be so easy for her to do so.(I do think this is true because she is quite pretty and girls have life on easy mode). She asked if I felt I could be as successful as her if I was single and I just said no. She then told me that on a recent vacation with her college friends she had been approached by guys a lot and was even asked by two guys for a threesome. She said she told them no because she has a lovely boyfriend at home but still not great to hear.

All these acts individually are all harmless at a base level but please bear in mind this all happened in the space of about two weeks. If roles were reversed and I had done any of the above I know I would be in the doghouse but that’s just life I suppose. Am I being paranoid?

We did LDR for 3 months then he broke up because he was feeling depressed and he made his life a mess.

I felt heartbroken for a very long time, went through all breakup phases, texted him, stalked his socials, and finally started feeling better after 6 months of sadness. I felt better because he became a loser, his grades dropped down and he started seeing multiple girls for fun. I got my life back together, and felt really good for 2 months until he texted me (I hate how they like coming back when you finally find peace), we started talking as friends as he said he's feeling better and trying to change again to the healthy guy he used to be, it made me feel happy for him.

But then we started texting more and more and our feelings came back so fast that we spent the whole summer texting and calling like an LDR couple, and i trusted him and gave him a second chance.

He told me that this school year, he was very motivated to work like he never worked before and be very productive (it's something I really like about him) but to do so, we'll probably have to stop texting, i really didn't like the idea at first, but i accepted it and i think he's not that wrong I also need to study hard this year and being in a relationship takes a lot of time.

I bought tickets to go back to my home country and sent him a pic after about 2 months of not talking, because we agreed that we'd meet when I'll be able to come back. He texted me he's not sure we'll meet, because he has 0 time to give me, but then tried to save it by saying how good he's doing and that everything is going well according to his plan. 
I felt a little disappointed but i think I'll still be able to convince him to meet when I'll be there.

He unfollowed me and made me unfollow him on IG, and i felt betrayed so i texted him about it telling him that if he wanted to give up on the plan, he should at least tell me about it instead of unfollowing me, but he reassured me saying that he just unfollowed me to not get distracted (even though my account is inactive) and that even though he's in a ""i should only focus on my work"" mindset, he still think about me when he thinks about someone to have a future with.

And now I'm feeling so confused about how to feel about him, i tried to do the same as him and not think about him, it worked for some weeks but I'm feeling kinda miserable now for feeling like i miss him and still having dreams about him from time to time, it feels like a breakup again, but without the possibility of moving on because he still reassure me and give me hopes.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7535178,public,self,i feel so confused about this guy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytwzs1/i_feel_so_confused_about_this_guy/,all_ads,6,
