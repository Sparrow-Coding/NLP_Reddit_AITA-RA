My most recent ex is an anorexic with some very clear untreated mental issues and I just found out that she's been trying to slander me with lies about me being an alcoholic and controlling. She also used to cut the palms of her hands (I have no idea why palms specifically) and was in an actually abusive relationship in the past.

Anyways the worst aspect of this is that I feel like I've been conditioned by them to love these emotional highs, yelling at each other for half an hour and then fucking, clinginess, obsessiveness, shit like that.

So much of our time has been shared through it, many late night conversations about all of life, laughs, and love. We share so many core values and views/goals on how to navigate the world around us and what we want in life and so many shared interests/passions. The emotional, intellectual, and physical chemistry and compatibility are the best that I've had with a partner. She has everything I'm looking for in what I would want in a wife and she has said the same about me. Also, we have not been dating other people. The timing is just not good even though she has said ""you would be everything I'd be looking for in a husband "" and ""I don't want you to be the one that got away""
.

She was dating a guy for 6 years living together,ready to marry him, which ended due to his cheating,  just a few months before meeting me and needs to learn how to become her own person. I was already planning an across country move but wasn't 100% certain, to live in a mountain town that has all of the outdoor recreation one could dream of for 2 years. She is not emotionally or mentally available for a relationship and needs to take the time and space to find her own sense of fulfillment, happiness, and self worth independently without a partner. 
.

We both agree that it's such a special and rare connection, that came so unexpectedly, and I've allowed myself to fall in love with her. There are so many things we haven't had the time to do together yet like climbing mountains and so many places to travel that weve talked about. 
.
.

We've talked about how we understand she needs the time and space to work on herself and get where she wants to be. She also wants to stay in touch,  but doesn't want me to wait around for her to be ready. She also isn't sure if she really does need that time for herself since she doesn't want to lose me or have me be the one that got away. She wants to come visit to ski and climb when I move in a couple of months but also is unsure if that would even be healthy.
.
She is confused on what would be best for her to do. I don't think there's any easy answer and that It might be for the best to go no contact and move on from eachother so she can have her time and space to develop her own fulfillment and be ready for someone else down the road. If it was meant to be then circumstance will pull us back together in the future. 
.

Has anyone else had to end an extremely positive and uplifting relationship due to circumstance that isn't either person's fault? 
.
Now we just have 1 week left together since I'm going out of the country for a month, and then am moving 3 weeks after I get back, and are enjoying it like it's the last time, but I don't want it to be the last time...but I know for someone I love I do value her happiness and wellbeing even if that means it isn't with me.
.
While I'm overseas the next month she wanted to separate and not stay in touch, but she also says she doesn't actually want that because talking to me and knowing about the adventures I'm on makes her really happy, so why end something that gives so much fulfillment? She is definitely confused and I want to stay with her and wait it out.

It was like repeating days so i didn't think anything else would happen. I was really craving the pizza from school and the cookies! And i know there was this drink that was really popular in the school it was the Sunny D strawberry drink. So i bought that and went to go sit down. But right when i went to go sit down one of my friends called me a ""Fat Bastard"". I was shocked, surprised, disappointed and sad. I suffered a lot with my weight for around 2 years now. I would stop eating because i would think that i ""Ate too much that day"". I wouldn't eat lunch usually and i wouldn't eat at home either. I still would do that sometimes, sometimes i wouldn't eat for a day or two. And when i got that comment i was send with shock. I was quiet but when she asked me something i told her to ""Shut the f\*\*\* up"" because i was honestly pretty pissed. And some people were laughing, and btw she said it loud enough that the whole table i was sitting in heard. One of my other friends from our table was getting mad with that other friend saying how rude that was and how i am not a ""Fat Bastard"" and she should apologize. The guys were laughing and saying ""Bro you shouldn't joke about that"" because she was saying how ""It's just a joke, my brother calls me that all the time"". But it honestly hurt me really badly, i turned around at one point and started crying, a couple tears were running down my face but i turned my head so no one saw, but i guess someone beside me saw and said ""Are you crying, what's wrong?"" because she had also just returned from the cafeteria before the situation happened, i told her something was in my eyes and i turned around. The people were staring at me in shock that i was in tears. Also i gave my Sunny D to another one of my friends and i gave my pizza to my friend that tried to help beside me, and i kept the cookie which was pretty good size. When i went outside i walked around with them a bit, and then i saw my best friend and i just walked up to her and hugged her and stood there for a while. But since i felt very comfortable around her i started crying, i just broke and started crying and she was like ""Hey, hey what's wrong? Do you want to talk about it or just stay here and hug"" i told her i just wanted to hug and she said okay and kept hugging me. She let me cool down a bit and then told me that if i needed someone to talk to she's always there for me. I said okay and thank you and then returned to the people from my cafeteria and just walked around with them but didn't say anything. Another one of my friends just decided to grab me and walk around with me since she could tell i wasn't having the best of my time, and decided to just play around with me. And i guess some other of my friends did the same thing. But the person who called me a ""Fat Bastard"" asked me if i forgive her i said ""Idk"" and she told me just now that she's sorry that she said that at school and she didn't think the joke would hurt me and make me mad. I told her ""Alright, but don't say those things anymore they really hurt."" and she replied back with ""Okay i promise"" and i said back ""Cause i don't think jokes are supposed to make someone cry"" and she said that she will think twice before she says a joke.

I (27F)  have been with my boyfriend (27M) for about 9 months now, we get along well and like each other but of course, I feel like I sabotage everything with my insecurities. My boyfriend have been telling me that I have changed ever since we became a ""couple"" I tried to understand how I have changed and he told me that I am not ''chill as before'' and that I am stressing too much about the future and other aspect of our relationship and that I should enjoy more the moment we are in instead of worrying. He tells me that my energy is heavy and that I always talk about things negatively. I don't feel that I've changed that much and I am trying as hard as I can to be chill about things and be positive, not to give negative comments. recently (3 weeks ago and still ongoing) we started to have less to no sex (we used to have sex a lot before), he told me that it is because he took too many anti depressants because he missed his dosage for 3 days, hence why his libido is low, he also stated that my behavior is also affecting his want to have sex. We had sex 2 times in 3 weeks and I feel like he forced himself because he felt that I was upset about it and I feel horrible. My only insecurity is fear of abandonment and I'm highly dependent on affection and I tend to overthink a lot, I know that these factors I just stated are affecting my relationship even though he is understanding and patient with me. I try to get help for my mental health but I live in Canada and they don't take you seriously unless you try to commit suicide, I have been on a waiting list since maybe 3-4 months now. I suspect I might have borderline personality disorder (my previous psychiatrist from Turkey told me before I came back to Canada that I might have that or ADHD. 

How can I be more relax about everything and let go of negativity? this was more like a rant but feel free to comment what you think of my situation.

We have only been together about 4 months, and she has just started showing signs that she is having second thoughts about me, and saying she might  ""break up"" with me if things don't improve in a couple of months.  


The main problems that she brings up are my depression and income level.  She is more successful than me, has a way better job.  At first she told me that she doesn't care how much money I make, that her last boyfriend was a abusive, and she would rather have a nice guy who has little money, rather than an abuser who is wealthy.  She said she doesn't even care if I make less money than I currently make.  She also said that she didn't mind that I have depression issues, as long as I am a good person.  This was in the beginning (first couple of months), she even said that I am the nicest guy ever and can see herself marrying me.  


Well, last week (after about 4 months of dating) she sat me down and told me that although I am the sweetest, nicest, most caring wonderful man she has ever been with.  (BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN) She has concerns and doesn't know if the relationship will last.  The times we have gone out, I am more introverted, and not very outgoing like she is.  She said she wants me to be more social, to start acting ""happier"" and start acting happy about life in general.  As if depression has an on/off button.  This is typical from people that don't understand depression, they think you can just suddenly snap out of it when you want.  This was not an issue the first couple of months and she was understanding about it, I guess that didn't last.  She also said that she is concerned about the amount of money I make.  This was never an issue before but apparently now it is, and she says that if there is going to be a future between us, I should get a better job.  She doesn't need my income at all because she owns her own house and makes a ton of money, but she is starting to look at me as being not ambitious enough.  I felt very sad about this, then she felt bad.  She insisted I go to her bedroom with her, we made love, she apologized and said that she still wants to be with me no matter what.    


Things seemed to be getting better.  Then yesterday I was at her house, and she had pretty much the same discussion with me.  She said if I don't improve in these areas, she predicts that the relationship might only last a couple more months.  


I really just don't know how to feel or what to do.  This is my 10th relationship.  None of them ever work out.

I got out of a really toxic relationship last spring and haven't wanted to date or have ANY form of connection with another person since, and honestly I was only using tinder as a form of entertainment. However, I matched with this girl and there was an immediate spark. At first I was really scared because I wasn't really prepared to find myself this attracted to someone. Not just physically, but emotionally too. I'm not going to lie, I felt like a teenager with a crush, I was giddy and excited, but at the same time she has this amazing ability to make me feel really safe and calm. She's on my mind all the time, I message her back immediately, and honestly I REALLY like her. There's one problem... she's incredibly emotionally closed off. Now, she told me this from the beginning, and told me that it would take time for her to open up and she needed to make sure she wouldn't be hurt before she let herself feel that stuff, which I totally understood, and I don't push her at all. It's been 3 months since we started talking, we haven't met up (long distance kinda thing) but we talk constantly and intensely, and used to call/facetime every other night or so.

But I can feel her pulling away from me, and thats fine, these things happen and I'm not gonna force her to carry on talking to me if she's not feeling it. My first reaction is to try and take control of the situation and be the one that says I'm not feeling it anymore (a choice fuelled by abandonment issues.... thanks mom!),  but honestly i'm just really upset that I let myself like someone this much for the first time in a long time, and she obviously is losing interest. I actually feel a little heartbroken.  I just have no idea what to do or say to her. And I absolutely don't wanna come across as neutoric or pushy. Can someone tell me if I'm overeating?

My bf (34M) and I (26F) have been together for 2.5 years and moved in together 8 months ago. We’ve had the majority of all our arguments since we’ve lived together, trying to sort out our domestic responsibilities.

I’ve had concerns since the beginning about our different levels of initiative; contribution, and laziness, especially around the house. My bf lived with his brother who did all the house cleaning, and I lived with a roommate who we split cleaning responsibilities 50/50. While I’m not perfect, it is important for me to have a clean home and to tackle any job required to accomplish that. I love getting up on ladders and cleaning toilets! My boyfriend doesn’t see the value in housecleaning seemingly at all.

Possibly important to note that I was raised by a single mom who did it all for us, nothing was too big or too “manly” for her to take care of, and my bf was raised by very traditional gender-rolled married parents. 

For context: At first, my bf was super averse to doing any contributing to household chores, besides putting the garbage out once a week and cutting the grass. It took months and months of arguing and my explaining that I didn’t want to live in this imbalance for the rest of my life for him to accept that he would have to take on more responsibilities in the house. While he has been making more of an effort since, and we’re working on him doing it without being asked to, I keep seeing the “helping out around the house” problem creep back up and it causes the same fights over and over. 

This past weekend we had friends over for dinner and had devised a plan to get the food prepped and house cleaned. At the end of the evening, it dawned on me that I had ended up cleaning the whole house and making the majority of the food, while my bf took on tasks like playing with and walking the dog, and showering before our guests arrived. I mulled it over and brought it up to him the next day, and it turned into a fight about my overlooking the contributions he did make, and how I’m too critical of him so he’s resistant to help me. This has turned into a multi-day fight, as he’s not in agreement with my feelings and we’re at odds.

I realize I’m getting into more problems than just the cleaning here (we are going to try out therapy and see if we can address these things), I am getting incredibly frustrated with how the same problems about housekeeping keep recurring.

In addition to the lack of initiative to contribute around the house, my bf will completely walk by things that I’ve unpacked from shopping like Kleenex boxes, toilet paper and soap as if they don’t even exist. He won’t top up extra toilet paper in bathrooms, put up Christmas lights, put away dishes that are used infrequently (claims he doesn’t know where they go), change the sheets on our bed, or any other misc. task that requires effort.

We have been married for a little over two years now, but have been together for 8. We met in high school. Within the past two years our sex life has rapidly deteriorated. It’s essentially non-existent at this point. A lot of this stems from my wife’s battle with anxiety and depression. Weight gain, low libido, and lethargy have all taken control of her. It’s a long story, but she had a false medical scare 6 years ago that lead to her developing severe anxiety. Within that time, I have essentially became her only friend and her “caretaker” for lack of a better word. We’re horribly co-dependent, but I’m not dependent on her really at all.

My wife wants to start trying to have a kid, but I’m debating whether I’m A) ready for kids and B) whether I want to even have a child with my wife and want to continue taking care of her. I have a blossoming career that I’m not sure I want to slow down on to have children.

I realize how selfish this is sounding. But I’ve given up a majority of my 20s taking care of her. I’ve foregone friendships, relationships, travel opportunities all to take care of her. All of my comments make this seem like a no brainer question.

But I still love her. She’s still one of the few people in the world I know would support me at my lowest. And I don’t know how she or I could possibly handle the guilt and pain associated with breaking her heart.

When we first got together I think we had regular arguments more than the average couple. This seems to have slowed down over time. Neither of us are perfect partners. We have a child together and she is a great mum. 

Side note to this post is that I’m very much an introvert and she is very much and extrovert.

The thing I’m struggling with is I feel like everything is becoming toxic. We are arguing again over very minor things and disagreeing on most things. I try my hardest not to react too much to things but it’s getting increasingly harder. I’ve hit the point where I’m almost past caring as I know everyday there will be an argument about something and I don’t have the strength to keep dealing with it. 

As mentioned I’m introverted but I feel like this has been made worse throughout the relationship as I suddenly realise I have like 2 friends. I used to have female friends when I met my partner but that lasted a couple of months. I’ve never been in need for a large social circle but it feels like whenever I want to do things with people I get stopped by my partner as her insecurities make her think I will cheat or have fun without he. I have no issue with her going out as I know that’s what she likes doing. It feels very much like any enjoyment I have should be through her. Any time I go out for a few drinks there is always a few days/ week after where I get the silent treatment. And if I do go out, she will go mad if there is not constant communication with her while I’m out.

I feel like it’s impossible for me to pull her up on anything, as any time I try to, it creates a massive argument. I then get told I’m not loving enough, but I have openly said many times that I can’t be loving when there is so much shit talking coming back at me.

I’ve lost count of the amount of times a dig has been made about me sleeping with other people before I met her. 

There is also the fact that it’s one rule for her and one for me. If she forgets to do something , it’s fine, if I forget to do it, it’s the end of the world.

The thing that made this worse as well was that her mum knows exactly how she is with me and when we argued once I told her to ask her mum for an honest opinion. She said nothing.

So i have this problem. I'm 19 and have been dating my boyfriend for 3 months, but we have been friends for over 6 years and during this time I had a crush on him several times. It's my first relationship ever.

At the beginning of our relationship it was exciting - I had to sneak into his house secretly, he would come pick me up from work, we watched movies together, we kissed in his car. I've never done such things in my life. But for a month and a half (if not longer) I realized I'm loosing my feelings for him and I begin to doubt if I have ever loved him. Don't get me wrong, he is the sweetest partner I could ever imagine, but every time he asks me if I love him, I feel like a cheat. His sweet, caring messages about how he loves me and misses me (it's a long-distance relationship, we see each other on weekends) makes my stomach ache because I can't return it anymore.

I feel like the villain of this story. I'm starting to ghost him. The more often he asks why I don't write back to him as often as before (and he does it several times a day), the more I feel cold and the more I feel the need to push him away from me.

I know what you're gonna say next. The honeymoon is over and I should work on my relationship. Except I don't know if the spark has ever been for me since we started our relationship.

The first time we kissed, all I thought was ""and that's it? Shouldn't I be feeling anything now?"" It was the same every time he sent me some nsfw photos of himself. He admired my body, asked for photos of me and said my photos made him feel comfortable. When he was sending me his photos, I said the same. I was pretending because I wanted him to be happy. Besides, I thought I would ""feel it"" eventually, too. A week ago my boyfriend noticed that something was wrong with me. I wanted to make it up to him, so I offered to try something more intimate. He was stressed out and and excited and then amazed when I made him feel good. I felt nothing again. And I lied that it was fine. Again.

Even though this relationship was very comfortable for me, I had a great time and our meetings felt fresh and exciting, I don't think I was really sexually attracted to him. I did what other couples do because I thought it was right and waited for this ""spark"" to come. But it didn't.

I have no idea what to do. My boyfriend is still the sweetest person in the world and does everything right. I just can't feel anything. And I don't want to confront him because he feels very badly mentally at the moment.

I just don't know what to do.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7608325,public,self,"I lost feelings for my crush the moment he became my boyfriend, even though he's a perfect person.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z19ioi/i_lost_feelings_for_my_crush_the_moment_he_became/,all_ads,6,

Met this guy out. Long story short, we started hanging out &amp; hooking up, even took me to meet some of his closest/best friends 1st time hanging. We started hooking up more consistently. Would watch something/go out/get dinner then hook up, I hung out with his best friends a few times. This went on for a month. Then I had him meet one of my closest friends and things went downhill. Did not like his behavior that night. The way he’d been acting with me that whole month (set expectations) vs that night completely different, I ended up pissed off (found him disrespectful). Tried to discuss it after but felt dismissed so I decided I would cut him off. We did finally have a phone conversation that didn’t go well and I fully cut him off. Due to circumstances, I had to get on the phone with him again, that convo went much better but at the end he wanted to part ways. I was kind of sad about it but respected his decision &amp; had no contact. Since things ended on good terms, I still hung out with one of his best friends (who didn’t tell him he’d still see me). 

This is where it gets confusing. A month goes by, he reaches out (last Monday), &amp; we hang out. Talk things out, he was pretty emotional that night. Saying how much he missed me, how he doesn’t let people in his space but did with me, how upset he’s been, etc. We hooked up again &amp; it was good. I did break it to him earlier I was still hanging with his best friend (I thought he knew). He’s hard to read, but seemed to be fine with it (I did offer to stop hanging with him if it was an issue/bothered him, he said no) &amp; we slept together after so no indication it’s an issue. The last time I saw him (thurs) tho he had a very idgaf attitude. “You’re free to do what you want, I’m free to do what I want”. Even made a comment about how I’m free to hook up with his best friend (who’d made an advance on me when we first met but I’d shut down then &amp; he knows). It wasn’t said in a salty way, just matter of fact. He’s been a bit odd with me since. He told me he’d text me to meet up this past weekend, but didn’t invite me to anything (totally fine). But he’s consistently texted me everyday. Nothing riveting, but still. I also might have done something mean. He said he wanted to go out with my friends (I have a lot &amp; his circle is smaller) &amp; based on how things went last time &amp; the fact that I enjoy being around him cuz he has no connection to my life (and I can be myself) I said no. He seemed fine with it &amp; I had some time to think and did end up inviting him to stuff with my friends last weekend but he didn’t join. Maybe he wanted a more direct invite or didn’t feel like it anymore, idk. Hasn’t asked me over since Thursday, so today I messaged him to hang cuz I thought maybe since he’s the one always initiating he wanted that. He just said he’s down, supposed to see him today. 

Note: this is my first situationship and I’m so confused. We’ve both agreed we don’t want a relationship, even tho sometimes he makes these comments as if he thinks I see him as my bf (ex. When we talked things out I said ‘ended things’ and he made a point of saying we were just talking/having fun etc. nothing to end, which I explained is just a phrase &amp; I never saw it as more). If anything, he’s hammered down the point he wants nothing with me outside of this &amp; im good w it. But I find some stuff counterintuitive, like involving me in his life &amp; wanting to be involved in mine. I don’t get him at all. Things he says/his behavior seems erratic.

I am a family person. We live in a metropolis, but besides that, we grow grow up quite close. My mother had 6 sisters, and I spent my child with my cousins, which are having their own children now, so it's a really huge family!

So there is a secret convention in my family, that everytime someone starts a new relationship, it needs to present the person to the family, to see if they ""approve"". It's not a serious thing though.

Generally they are just glad to meet the ""new person"", and they do anything to make the person feels happy and comfortable.


Then... I am dating this guy. He is very lovely and caring when we are together, but in his daily life he is quite ""demanding"".
He used to be very rich in his childhood and adolescence, but now that he is a grown up adult, he is facing some difficulties that he never had before, so he is getting used to it.

He is also a very communicative person. I have already presented him to my family before, in some family dinners we had, and my family liked him at that time.

But then this weekend we had a family travel, and we invited him...
We joined all my mother's sisters and my cousins, and we rent a big house in front of the beach, with 4 bedrooms and swimming pool. There were 20 persons in total, including the kids, so we needed to share bedrooms.

Due to the lack of cars, we needed to carry some people in his car. We didn't want the kids to travel without their parents, so it was needed to fit mathematically which person would goes in which car, but still the count was inconclusive. I offered myself to travel in another car without him, so each kid could travel with their parents, and there would be no problem. Except he complained: ""I won't be uber driver of these strangers... You will travel with me.""
I understand his point. It would a little unpleasant to travel with people he don't know. But it was a 2 hour travel, and the way he complained was very aggressive. Of course I didn't tell it to anyone, but it turned on an ""alarm"" in my head.
At the end I travelled in his car, and some kids were separated of their parents...

But we had a safe journey. Everyone arrived in the house arround the same time.
As there was only 4 bedrooms, we needed to share it with others.
In our bedroom was me, him, my mother and his boyfriend.

At the first night everything went peacefully. But in the sleep time, my mother's boyfriend's snores quite loudly, so he couldn't sleep. He gets up in the middle of the night, and I followed him worried. He said he couldn't sleep, and was looking to sleep in his aunt's house, that lives in the nearby city.
I said it was not necessary, and in the next  night I would try to find another place for us to sleep. But then he started to complain about other things, like the lack of air conditioner, the lack of pillows, the mattress thickness and stuff...

At the end we slept in the living room couch (that personally I thought it was a very comfortable couch), and the night goes on...

The next morning, my family and the kids gets up very early to take breakfast and goes soon to the beach. As he couldn't sleep well, he was in a terrible mood.
I said that soon the people would go to the beach, and he could stay home and sleep. He was frowned and everybody noticed. People thought he was not enjoying the vacation, but then I explained what happened, and everybody understand.

Then I went to the beach with people and he stayed alone in the house. I tried to enjoy the beach as much as possible, but as I was worried about him, and returned to the house soon, and waited for him to wake up.

He woke up in a better mood, but in his face was written ""I shouldn't have come"".
He isolated himself, and it was totally not an ""I am shy"" isolation. It was an ""I don't want to interact"" isolation. 

I was making every effort for him to feel comfortable and interact with people. But every interaction he had was full of faces and complains.
Of course there was some small talks during the weekend, but in general people noticed he was not enjoying the vacation and started to feel uncomfortable around him.

At the end we all returned home safely, and the travel went really well. Nobody said verbally anything about him, but I could notice some looks of ""your boyfriend is annoying, isn't he? 😒"" and ""poor you that needs to handle with him.... 🥺""

Now I'm questioning myself... I really like him, and we have a lot of good moments when we are alone. He is fun and lovely, and he cares a lot about me.
But if I stay with him, I should abdicate of an important part of my life that is my family. I would not be able to take him to these kind of travels or others family reunions, because I know he will not enjoy it. And I thought know it is possible to maintain the relationship without forcing it, something that I well evaluate in a person is that it hangout well with my family.

Now I don't know if I should end the relationship or if there is anyway to make him feels comfortable around my family.

When we met it was practically love at first sight. We seem to be able to laugh endlessly when around each other and being in each other's precense is immensely comfortable. I find that being around them when I have a headache seems to rid me of my pain.
However, throughout this relationship my partner has had strong intrusive thoughts regarding himself leaving me for someone that ""might"" be better. An example being  their closest friend besides me, someone who I'll call Ryan (21M).
Ryan and my boyfriend are very platonically affectionate towards eachother ie: kissing eachother's cheeks, cuddling, hugging
Stuff like that. That is fine
The issue is that my boyfriend gets intrusive thoughts and fantasies with this friend ryan. This is not the first time this has happened, it happened three years ago as well with a completely different person. He and I have spoken about this before, and I understand what is going through his mind since we both have OCD. 

However I have told him that because of these thoughts, I am not comfortable with the two of them kissing eachother anymore. A few nights ago, he and this one person hung out while I was at work and my boyfriend initiated a kiss on the cheek.
This was the second chance I gave him to not do that.
While I don't think he will be leaving me for Ryan, this was still a big boundary overstep since we talked about this in the past (that I was not comfortable with this)
And then he does it depsite saying he would never do it again unless we talked about how I feel about it. He told me after, saying how he felt so guilty he might throw up and I can't seem to understand why he did it.

This morning he texted me to say he would make dinner tonight. I asked what he was going to make he said sausages and mash with all the trimmings etc. He then sent me a text for me to check sell by dates because he wasn't sure if the food was still good. I text back ""okay"". 

Important to note I'm a stay at home mum to a 6 week old baby, 2 year old and 6 year old. So when I texted ""okay"" I was out with the two youngest children after just dropping eldest off at school and it was pouring rain. My plan was to do it when I got back home. Anyway the day went on I looked after the kids, cleaned the house etc etc had my normal day and totally forgot about checking sell by dates for dinner. Also important - my partner is a really good cook and everytime he cooks its always quite lavish, all done from scratch, really nice which I appreciate. 

Anyway partner comes home and says the mash is out of date what did I want him to do. I said oh sorry I totally forgot why don't you just make chips with dinner instead? I can hear him huffing and puffing banging around in the kitchen etc. An hour later he calls everyone down saying dinner is ready. He made me and the kids food but not himself. He literally cooked 3 plain sausages, frozen chips and a blob of ketchup. 

Personally I don't like sausages on the best of days and was more looking forward to the veg, Yorkshire pudding etc so I just took my food to the kitchen and didn't eat it. He asked why and I said sorry I'm not that hungry (in reality the dinner was really dry and bland and that was the reason but I was trying to be nice) also keep in mind he didn't eat this himself but expected me to? I ended up making myself a cheese toastie after the kids went to sleep.

Anyway after dinner he storms upstairs leaving me with the kids and dinner to clean up. So I get the kids to bed, clean up etc and he storms down while I'm having my first 5 mins peace since 6am and says why did you make a toastie if you wasn't hungry. I said I dunno I just fancied it. He storms back upstairs. 

I go upstairs to get a towel etc to have a shower and I ask if he could watch the baby while I shower. He grunts back. I say, why are you so angry I didn't eat the dinner I don't like sausages on the best of days and that dinner was really plain, sorry. 

He said he doesn't understand how out of the whole day I didn't have time to look at the sell by dates. I started talking and said ""I have a newborn and 2 year old all day"" but he cut me off before I could finish explaining how it slipped my mind and he said what so you can't do anything because you have a newborn baby can't even read a packet of sausages.

At this point most of my evening is wasted on SAUSAGES AND MASH. So I'm like okay I'm going for a shower have a nice evening. 

Am I missing something? Like I do appreciate he made dinner but he very obviously made a shitty dinner he didn't even eat himself, because I forgot to check the sell by dates earlier in the day. 

I feel like I'm going crazy? I tried to be nice and say I just wasn't hungry etc etc but it was like unless I ate his shit dinner he wasn't gunna be happy no matter what? 

He's giving me the silent treatment now and I'm just getting ready for bed.

Looking for some advice on how to approach a breakup with my girlfriend of 8 years. We met in college and have had an amazing relationship and we generally get along. However, we have never done the ""deed"". We have gotten to all bases/variations just prior to the deed. My GF is usually on the nervous side when approaching something new and I have tried to be supportive and make her feel secure but it has never happened. As a young man, obviously the hormones were raging and the excitement was always there to do the deed. But I think over the years I have lost the optimism and joy of even thinking about it. There is frustration as a I balance committing to a healthy relationship which does not even have space for my emotions/needs.  She has never understood my emotions in a mature way or we have never been able to talk about it in a mature way.  Her main thought process has always been we shouldn't be pressured by society and we will have our own timeline. I want to move forward to the next stage in life (marriage) but I'm scared about entering in a marriage which has been a sexless relationship. I've been in a depressive state for the last 3 years, it hit just prior to covid and the isolation has kind of ruined me. I don't believe this will lead to a healthy marriage and nor do I have the optimism to find out. I have decided it's time to move on.

Well, we hadn't had sex the last few days (I thought calming down on all the sex would help) so when we started fooling around and he was rock hard I thought we'd be able to go all the way, or at least a lot further than we did. Unfortunately it just wasn't happening. I told him I loved him and that it was ok, I also tried very carefully and non-judgmentally to open up the door for conversation about his ED. He just said work was on his mind and he got distracted. Ok, fine, I've been there, I get it.

I am an extrovert and I love making new friends but Im a classic case of knowing a lot of people but having no friendships. I have had some friends in my life but as soon as school/work ended, the friendship ended as well. Now I go out sometimes once in 1-2 months with some old friends and thats it. I have always had issues with friendships, I see girls that have best friends and they even call each other sisters and I want that but everyone is already “booked” (lol). 

Also the other issue is that when I get into a relationship, i forget about everyone else and fully commit in my bf. Everyday, every hour. I know its wrong but… 
On my last relationship, his friends were mine as well and he had A LOT of friends (all boys tho) and didn’t have a problem bringing me along. On my current relationship even tho I am the happiest because I love him to death, we both dont have friends. He has a few but whenever I ask to meet them or go out as group or whatever, he disagrees and gets angry even. He says he does not respect those guys and would never give them the satisfaction or chance to meet his girlfriend, also they are not guys who discuss about each others gf and dont have girls into groups. So basically I get left with my 3 friends I meet once in a blue moon. (Even when I meet them I have to be careful not to make my bf feel bad for leaving him for them even tho we meet everyday. Before you judge him, I feel bad when he goes out with his friends so we are both toxic)

My words may come off as selfish but I am just being honest and am coming here for help and advice.

There's this girl I dated a few years ago, for a few years. Our breakup was pretty amicable and last week she reached out to me out of nowhere. I wasn't expecting to ever hear from her again even though we didn't leave off on bad terms. The problem I'm facing is that if things go well, I can't seem to shake the fact that there have been other people since me that she has dated, had sex with, etc. If this was a new person I was seeing and there were people before me, it wouldn't really bother me. But being that I have a history with this person, it just upsets me and oftentimes angers me as well. I think part of these feelings also comes from the fact that we were each other's first everything, so it was very special to me and I cherished that. Additional info: I personally haven't done anything with anyone since. Not because I was waiting for her, but because I've been enjoying my own company and hobbies and haven't really been interested in dating.

I feel like either I need to figure out how to get over this mindset and see if I can chill tf out (how?), or let her go for good (because currently I cannot have a healthy relationship with her with these thoughts, and I feel very strongly about it).

Although it may not get in the way of many people, is this a valid reason to not want to be with her again? If it is, should I *say* this to her? Is this something that can even be worked on?

I (24f) am really good friends with my neighbor (23m). I had feelings for him early on, when I was first getting to know him, before he told me had a girlfriend. After they broke up we cuddled on the couch and we talked about what it meant afterwards. He is naturally that touchy feely but Im not and so I told him I had feelings and he kindly declined. I havent had feelings pop back up until very recently. We spent the afternoon together and he was more verbally and physically affectionate than usual so that kinda got to me. 

I know he is not interested and I cannot entertain the idea of him changing his mind from months ago. I have tried some things like making a list of turn offs, not checking his social media or pictures of us as often, stopping any daydreaming, not romanticizing memories or the idea I have of him, and also telling myself if its not meant to be then its not (if you wanted to date me he would have made that obvious or tried by now so he obviously isn't into me). However, I am still struggling a little bit since I do like him a lot platonically.

I 23f got engaged to my fiancé 26m this past spring. His family has always been very supportive of our relationship and very welcoming/caring and we get along well.

This past weekend I went dress shopping for the first time with my mom, my future mother in law, and a few friends. Before going my mom originally said she wanted to pay for my dress. But my future mother in law told me she wanted to buy my dress instead and to disregard the budget I had originally set for the dress, and get whatever dress I wanted. She said she didn’t want me to feel limited and wanted to make sure “I’d have the perfect day” and that “it was the least she could do”

While I am very grateful for her offer, I could see how this made my mom uncomfortable and a bit sad. Originally I had came to an agreement with my mom to spend max of $1000 on a dress since it’s what she could afford, which I am very grateful for.

My fiancés family is significantly wealthier then my family, and this has been very evident during wedding planning. I was fine having a smaller more low key and affordable wedding but my future mother in law keeps offering to pay for things and keeps telling me not to worry about costs. 

I don’t know how to talk to her about this without seeming ungrateful, because I truly do appreciate her offers but I’m just not sure I’m comfortable with it. And it really hurt me to see how upset my mom was when she offered to pay for my dress instead.

I wasn’t interested in her and nor was she in me. But as we got closer, we realized we really enjoyed spending time together and have the same life goals.

Then I graduated and moved, while she stayed to finish college. She was getting over a boy she was into at the time. We were talking one day and she said that our friends saw us getting married and having children. This isn’t that crazy. Despite her not being attracted to me that way, we still flirted around all the time. We both just saw it as innocent fun I suppose. 

But this time, it didn’t feel so innocent to me. I feel like you just don’t share that with someone. I hated that she did that tbh. It felt like she was keeping me around as a backup plan. Which we used to joke about doing to each other, but, like I mentioned, it didn’t feel like a joke this time. Kids and marriage are super important plans I have for my future. She knows that. So why share something like that with me?

I don’t know why. But I took it as an opportunity to ask her out. I knew she’d say no. I lived in a different city, she wasn’t over this one guy, and lastly I’m still fairly confident she was never actually romantically attracted to me. If she turned me down with a hard no, I could have kept being friends with her. I would have interpreted that as her being honest with and not keeping me on the back burner. 

She did turn me down. But she said for now because Im living in another city. That drove me a little crazy, I’m ngl. It was the one way for her to reject me that didn’t resolve my problem- I refuse to be friends with her only because she sees me as a backup. I don’t want to deal with a caveat for the future. I took a bit of distance from her to see if that’d change things.

I have been sincere in my apologies, as honest as possible and open and admitting the wrongs or/and hurt I've caused.

I sustained a bad concussion and my partner say I started to be 'rude/a bitch' - I was starting to get depressed and anxious with the injury and admit I wasn't myself but I know when I am a bitch and as far as I remember, I really wasn't.    I made some small comments like 'don't be an idiot, we should eat at home' and was probably a little distant during some of the time we spent together.  He also keeps bringing up how about 6 months ago I said in passing 'well if you feel like that, maybe we shouldn't be together' which I explained to him many times, we were drinking, I was being vindictive didn't mean anything by it and wish I could take that comment back.  

This relationship is pretty new (almost 1 year) we were best friends for a year before the relationship.. but I've been getting nothing but passive aggressive behaviour, all the blame, being called a victim if I express I haven't been myself because of the anxiety and the concussion, my words and feelings seem to be meaningless.  

I know this person holds on to things, and I've seen them remove themselves instead of facing things or taking any responsibility in relationships with coworkers/friends.

Then we started playing together. After 1 month i stopped playing with them. I thought they doesn't play anymore. But then i came to know that mf guy broke up with her. Then me and the girl started talking on Instagram after 7 days she gave me her phone number. Then we started chatting on WhatsApp. Then we created a really good bond with each other talking everyday playing games with her etc. Then i started to develop love for her it was increasing day by day i thought i should not say it but i told her that i love her iam a really shy kind of a person in front of girls this was the first girl i truly loved. Then she told me she loved her ex sooo much she isn't in the state of loving someone again rn. She got betrayed by 2 guys both left her and leave her alone in sadness. The 2nd guy she had in her life she truly loved him. But that mf left her. Then she told me she now want to focus on her career and her family. She told me that she is afraid that the damage feels permanent. I want to do so much for her anything for her. I say love u to her almost every day she always replies with a smile. She told me feels good to be loved by me she feels comfortable around me she want me to stay with her forever but she isn't in the state of loving me rn.

She is so much emotionally attached with me. She said she can live without sexual things (and i know she isn't a lustful girl she values emotions first) she wants to be emotionally attached with the person first. She has a lot of family problems she is sacrificing herself for the family.

Mid October, we first hung out. Things were going pretty well. We’d sleep over together, cuddle, kiss a whole bunch, etc etc., and I’d do stuff for him a lot just cause that’s how I show affection. 

We had had a talk about how he may need some time like early November to figure stuff out and figure out who he really is. I agreed and told him that I had some issues myself that I hadn’t noticed until now (this is the first person I’ve ever had real feelings for, and it sort of caused some behaviors and thought patterns to come about that I’d never experienced until now. Basically brought out a whole new side of me that I know I’m going to have to deal with). 

Saturday, though, he told me via text that he wanted some time apart and that he just isn’t ready for a relationship. I instantly took this as “I wanna let you down easy” but apparently that’s not what he meant? Like he says he still has feelings for me and that hasn’t changed, but he encouraged me that if I found someone else to pursue it (which I’m not going to). I understand what he’s going through though because I did the same exact thing earlier this year where I just took a lot of time to myself for self-discovery.

What scares me, though, is I’m a big giver. And before this guy, I’d never been in a situation where I can just give and show love to someone. Overall it’s been really therapeutic for me, and I’m scared it’ll have to stop, even though he told me it won’t.

He says now, though, that he thinks a Fwb thing is best, which if this was how we started off I’d be okay with, but I’ve already developed feelings for him and when I think of FWB I just think of a regular person to hook up with and nothing else. (We haven’t even had sex yet because I feel like having feelings it had more weight than just fucking. I also didn’t want our relationship to be based on sex like all his past ones) I want more from him than that, but I don’t need it constantly 24/7. I just want to know that I have someone that even without being there with him or talking to him for a bit, I know that one day I’ll see him.

I told him that right after he dropped that nuke on me Saturday, and he told me he loved me too and said he wanted to say it but he never says it first.

Right in the beggining of it I met this girl from France and we got along very quickly. She doesn't speak portuguese and I don't speak french so we talk to each other in spanish. After 2 weeks I realised I was in love and super attracted to her (not a surprise since I know I'm bisexual for years). She told me she dated a girl before but they ended it because she didn't feel so attracted to her and at the end of the day she's crazy for boys. I told her I dated girls before (i've had 2 gfs) and that I usually suffer in relationships with girls because I like them too much. After a few weeks she met this other french girl (F21) who was a lesbian and was trying to make out with her, she told me she was bothered that lesbians looked at her this way, but then started making out with this girl at parties. She told me she felt unconfortable thinking about having sex with the other girl because she was not sure she was attracted to her enough to have sex.   
A few weeks later she met a boy and started to have sex with him and eventally fell in love, but he was there only for the sex and she ended up heartbroken.

So, after this 6 months I never told her about how I feel because she always said we are friends and always told me her deepest feelings and fears, and I feel she trusts me so I don't want to ruin that. Now she will come to Brazil next year and we'll meet and travel together for 2 weeks. I'm in an open relationship with a guy now and he knows I have a crush on her and is fine with that. She knows I'm in an open relationship and I that can be with other people if I want.

It's like I'm in some alternate universe where nothing makes sense.

I have started going to the gym two weeks ago. Me and my husband agreed he will start as soon as our credit card rolls over. Also, he needed a test, because he's past 40, to make sure he's ok to exercise.

Today we went for the test. Coincidentally, the clinic was in the same building as the gym. Everything was OK so I was like ""what if you enrolled today? We could come together tonight"". He said no. As we walked down the stairs and we got to the floor where the gym is, I asked him if he wanted to see the installations. He said no. I insisted once or twice. He said no.

If you're wondering where this literal non issue is going, same. Even as I type this out I realize how insanely mundane these exchanges are, and that's the point.

Problem is, from then on my husband very impatiently asked why I was insisting so much. Did I think maybe if he saw the gym, he might get excited and want to start tonight? I said maybe (as in, maybe that's subconsciously a factor for why I insisted a couple times).

So then he started to angrily accuse me of ""manipulation"", because I was trying to manipulate him into starting the gym. When I said that was a strong word to throw around, he got even angrier.

The whole way home he was talking about how it was manipulation, how defensive I was being, and how I don't ever take responsibility for what I do. Meanwhile, I was saying I didn't understand where this was going, why this had turned into an argument, and muttering ""this is insane"".

This is not the first time I find myself in this situation, but it's been a couple years since the last one. I'm honestly considering divorce here because I can't. I can't be with someone who gets into this insane spiral of getting angry &gt; inventing a reason for why they're angry &gt; getting angrier as they ruminate on that made up reason.

But maybe I am delusional and defensive? So I decided to ask here. Please help me understand this situation I'm in.
