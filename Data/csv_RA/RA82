These are easily his worst traits but I’m fearful for what they mean for our relationship I’m the long run.

I’m ready to get married and start a family, a goal I’ve very much wanted for a long time and that he’s aware of. I have built a stable career and make close to 6 figures annually. I have a car, my own place, pay my own bills, etc. 

My partner, however, is a recovering addict. He somehow never got his driver’s license and is now anxious/scared to do so. He has worked on and off for years, mostly under the table in construction. His job can pay well, but does not provide him with stability or benefits. If it rains or snows or is too cold he can’t work and thus doesn’t make money. Unfortunately his previous habits depleted any funds he could have saved, and he gives his family the bulk of his money because he feels guilty for their own issues.

I stress to him that I love him and want to be with him in the long run, and he says he wants the same. I believe him. But I can’t help but feel that things are sometimes one sided. And if he continually puts off bettering his employment and life that he’ll never feel comfortable enough to propose or marry me.

My family and friends adore him. He’s the best partner I’ve ever had despite these issues. I just feel like constantly trying to drive him and help him and worry about him puts a lot of stress on me. And when I tell him he always makes excuses for why he can’t make even the smallest changes, including seeing a general doctor for a health check up or go to a therapist.

We spontaneously decided to go grab a drink at a cocktail bar tonight with no plans. Got dressed up and made our way there. Unfortunately, the bar changed policy and no longer was the bar first come first serve. Reservations were booked and we were SOL. We went back to the car and I suggested many great alternative cocktail bars in the area, but my GF was annoyed by the whole situation and wanted to just go home. After 20 mins of more suggestions we agreed on a place and went to grab a drink. This is not the first time in which a situation turns to all or nothing when it doesn’t go our way, and there is no adaptability in plans unless I strongly urge her. She gets annoyed easily and it becomes my fault and she takes it out on me. 

At the bar we were talking about life and work. We have been in a complicated situation where my work may take me to a city my GF does not enjoy and may lead to a long distance relationship. I think it is the best opportunity career wise out of the choices I have and explained I have been conflicted between choosing an offer with an amazing city/a place she would be happy vs an offer with great growth potential career wise and opportunities to move to any city in a few years. Since then she has been silent and will not talk to me. 

I’m confused on what I did to make her start ignoring me and getting a little tired of the all or nothing reactions when things don’t go her way.

Hellooooo. Hoping you all can help. 
I’ve been talking to a guy for about a month. We met on a dating app for background knowledge! We have great chemistry and at first we would text quite a bit. He would initiate a lot of the conversation, but then one day- it stopped. We still text everyday, but I would say I initiate most of the conversation. And sometimes he just wont respond to a last text and the conversation stops, obviously. I think I initiate 70% of the dates, he does 30%. We had a date last night and he did ask if I wanted to go to his family Christmas dinner…which I feel like is a positive. 

We had a long talk about relationships and the dating apps today (face to face). He did mention that in the past he was attracted to what he couldn’t have, which definitely bothered me. He is honestly great in every other way than the texting, initiating dates thing. Is he trying to act cool? Or he’s not that into me? Maybe I’ve been too available.

We have been together since 2019, and living together since 2020. We have known each other since 2009. We have been very compatible, until recently. I had a severe mental health decline which brought me to such a low point in my life. I completely shut down. I started therapy, medication, and have worked to find myself again. Through this experience, I realized that our compromises for each other have started to dwindle… especially our love language compatibility. My partner’s love language is physical touch while mine is acts of service. We’ve had many talks about how to fill each other’s cup to ensure we are satisfying our needs. However, we have not been sexually intimate in a few months due to a disconnection I feel within myself. I know her cup of intimacy is not filled and I have been trying to offer solutions and compromises, none seem to satisfy her need. I have come to a point where I don’t know how to continue to build a healthy relationship where everyday I feel I am not good enough. She doesn’t say things to me that make me feel this way, but how she reacts when I decline an advancement or express to her that sometimes I am unable to be physically touched is causing me a lot of resentment for myself. Tonight, before I wrote this, she asked if we could be intimate and I politely declined and expressed that I felt it was an awkward time to ask. She replied,” You never initiate anymore, so I have to ask.” That statement put me over the edge as we have been having constant discussions on how to help each other with our wants and needs. I just do not know how to respond to these types of statements anymore. 

Please, does anyone have any experiences with compromises between our love languages? Is there any actives/discussions we can do/have to make both of us understand that both have to provide compromise and effort to maintain our relationship? I just don’t know how to better fill her cup. TIA.

Seems to see nothing wrong with his actions.

A few days ago my boyfriend mentioned the possibility of meeting some friends on Saturday, but said things weren't sure.

On Saturday at 11:00 (when I woke up), raw fish (sashimi) arrived, which he had to have bought late last night/early morning. I don't like this fish, so I thought it was weird he would suddenly order it without mentioning. It cost neaelt 100USD. But I didn't think much of it.

On Saturday afternoon we went to a clinic (I had emergency surgery 2 weeks ago) to check some stuff. Then we ate lunch and went shopping, specifically to an alcohol store. We both love drinking, especially unique or hard to find alcohol (we live in Asia), so it wasn't that weird. Except I can't drink for another 2 months, we have like 30+ bottles at home already in our collection, and he is moving to the US in less than 6 months. He spent about 200USD and purchased a box's worth (maybe 6 or 7 bottles).

We arrive home at 4 and I am exhausted due to walking and still recovering from my surgery. I do some light cleaning like washing the dishes and a load of laundry while he just uses his phone.

Then at 6 p.m. he announces his friends will come in an hour. I am caught off guard. He didn't mention any clear plan, so I told him so. He swears he did (???). The last I heard was a vague plan, and never at our place (he knows I don't like having people over, eapecially unannounced). I have been weak since my surgery so the house was a little disorganized (the only chore he does is cooking) and we live in Asia so our place is small, and there are tons of restauranrs within walking distance - even open 24 hours. He says ""Well we can eat outside but the fish..."" So it seems like everything was pre-planned secretly? But he completely denies this is the case. He claims he bought the fish to eat alone (it was 3 to 4 servings and if that were true why did he order it for the day he might meet friends?). It was also a ""coincidence"" they drank the sake we bought that day. And then he said to his friends ""I wanted to eat the fish HERE because it was too hard to bring all the materials to your place."" Which meands everything was planned.

I clean the floor in a mad rush (since people sit on the floor here) and he starts preparing the food. I haven't even properly showered in 2 weeks because I can't (doctor's orders) so I quickly sponge bath myself and wash my hair.

His two friends come (one i know well, the other I have met only once) and a girlfriend (never met her before). They drink and eat (I eat with them). One goes home at 2am because his ""controlling gf is angry"". AT 2 A.M. My bf and his friend are drunk and annoying, but the other woman is fairly sober.

They decide they want to go to karaoke, so we do...at 2:30 a.m. It lasts one extremely painful hour (I wanted to stay home and sleep and I hate singinf but my bf begged me), but then they asked for additional time and got it. Finally we leave at 3:45 and my bf wants to go to karaoke AGAIN?? I almost fall asleep while standing at the red light and the only persob who notices is the other woman, my bf is walking ahead.

At this point I have been up 12+ hours whereas after surgery (and due to my severe constipation and not having a BM for a month) I can only stay awake maybe 6 to 8 hrs and sleep nearly 15 hrs a day.

I tell them they can go ahead but I need to go home and sleep. Bf begs again, and promises only 10 min. It was NOT ten minutes. An hr is the cheapest you can buy, but I thought we would leave early. He keeps saying one more song...I finally sleep in that noisy smoky place and the woman covers me with her jacket (my bf does not think of this). I somehow fall into a fitfull sleep and am awoken by ky bf purposely playing with my feet. I kick his hands off but he keeps doing it and I realized he was recording my ""funny reaction"" so I yell at him to stop. Resume sleeping. Finally I am woken up when they are done at 5:30am which means they used the full hour AND extended the time.

We leave and his friends call me an angel and my bf says ""Wow I am so tired I could sleep right now"". I blew up, uttered a curse word and stomped the 15 min back to home. He didnt follow me at first, but stayed with them (while they called a taxi I assume). Then he starts coming in my directiom but doesnt even try to run to catch up with me. I wait for him and then he says ""What's wrong?"" 

Well that made me go crazy. The total lack of awareness or pretending of. I got so mad I turned around and walked in the direction of ""my"" apartment. (I stay at his place half the time and mine half the time. But he calls his place ""ours"" and it definitely feels like our apartment, not his. I do all the chores and furnished half of it). He shouts my name but makes no effort to follow me. My phone is out of battery. I can't get a taxi or take the subway since I use my phone to pay usually. I walk the hour home and arrive at 6:30. Charge my phone and see just ONE missed call from 5:30, when I left him.

I sent him a text when I got home that I arrived safe but I want to break up (this is just the straw that broke the camel's back). I grt being drunk and being excited wirh your friend but the thing I can't understand is how his first reaction wasn't ""sorry"" or how he seems to not feel bad at all for what he did.

It is now 1p.m. and I haven't heard from him.

There have been hundreds of situations where I felt he may have NPD. It has gotten to the point where I have even asked him to go to my therapist and I have also spoken with my therapist about it (my bf is up to couple's counseling but not indidivudal?).

How do women accept all these things and not feel low mood or lose attraction to men?:

They accept that o ral s ex is far more performed on men than it is performed on women

They accept that v aginas are not appreciated as much as p enises (especially large p enises) and instead have s tigma and are seen as more g ross and t aboo. 

They accept that men like p enises and women who have p enises but women and g ay men don't like v aginas and men who have v aginas. Again due to what I said above

They accept that it's widely believed that men prefer younger women and that women have issues with ageing

They accept that s traight male s exuality depends almost solely on the s exual availability of women. Whereas female s exuality depends on so much more than the s exual availability of men. So men in gender segregated and sexually repressed countries (Muslim, etc) replace women with men for s ex. While women replace men with women for s ex far less. 

They accept that men are attracted not to women but to a performance or costume of f emininity. So natural body hair and women being u nfeminine is less attractive than a very f eminized male. Whereas women and g ay men are attracted to men and not merely m asculinity. So a ndrogynous famous men are often popular with them.

They accept that v aginas are seen as s ubmissive and p enises as d ominant. So dominatrix women have to use p enis imitation like s trap ons and p egging to be taken seriously.

They accept that m isogny is far more common than m isandry across the world and throughout history and this means women like men as a gender more than men like women as a gender and that women like men in a far more well rounded way.

They accept that women hate other women more than men hate other men

They accept that women support, praise and celebrate men doing typically female hobbies (d rag q ueens, g ay male makeup artists) more than men support, praise and celebrate women doing typically male hobbies

I mean, even expecting and wanting men to appreciate v aginas is too much to ask of them.

Are women just happy to find the needle in the haystack and the exception to the rule?

She told me that shed be back and would definitely text me after school. I chatted her every hour as I don't know her schedule. 

I chatted her again but this time it's the time where I'm 100% sure she'd reply as we talk in that time everyday. It's probably after her school. And for me it's like 2 am in the morning. But even then she wouldn't reply there.

Then eagerly and curious I checked her profile.
Then I saw her replying to a comment before chatting me which made me pissed off as I feel offended that shed rather reply to a random dude first before her boyfriend and I chatted her about it, She finally replied and  reassured me that she loved me but I got pissed of as she Replied to one random dude first before me, she was saying sorry and sorry and that she loved me but I tried to ignore her and be cold to her as I'm still angry and I'm very bad at controlling my emotions though I did get better at it though. Then we got in a big argument and now we are taking a break from each other. 

During the fight She also commented on how ""annoying"" I am since I text her like every moment., really hurted me there lol.  Gotta admit that yeah I do that but only because I'm gonna be not talking to her as much as I did since I'm gonna be busy and going to my school full time, yet she didn't even care and laughed it off and about how stupid I am.

Then after that, I saw Her on her posts flirting with other random people in comment sections despite Having a BF. 
It really made me uncomfortable and makes my anxiety issues and Insecurities just take over me. I feel as though I'm not attractive and I have a shit personality.

I'm doing my thing and he's going from hard to semi tohard for like 20 minutes. Until he just goes limp. 

I stop and ask him if he wants me to stop and he says sorry ""I'm just thinking about work"" so I leave. Feelings kind of stinging, he knows I'm upset

 I say I'm going to go work out. 

He instantly goes into the bathroom and I got a weird gut feeling. He's still logged into his Chrome account on my computer so I snoop the history. He's in the bathroom watching porn.

My heart broke. He would rather jerk off instead of getting head from me? I confront him when he comes out and he says ""I didn't look up porn I was pooping."" I told him to show me his browsing history and sure enough it's there. He tries to play it off that his reddit feed shows him porn. But I know the difference between that and (you searched for 'enter porn name here' )

Our sex life sucks. It's usually just hand stuff or me sucking him off. We rarely if ever have PIV sex

I asked him why, why would he want porn more than me? He gets annoyed and asked me to let him work. So I did. 

He finished working and started doing something else I asked him ""what are we not going to talk about this?!"" He said he told me all he had to say and if I choose to believe otherwise it's on me. And he wasn't going to let me ruin his weekend along with mine. 

I feel like I should just break up with him. But I have hesitated doing this because he's good to me. He is sweet. He treats me well. We never argue and he gives me plenty of attention. I tell myself I can do without sex because the emotional stuff fills a lot of the void. But this is the straw that broke the camels back. Especially since he won't even talk to me about it and instead chose to ignore me when I am clearly in distress.

We went to different high schools but remained really close friends. Every now and then we would not talk for a while but every time we got back to talking it would feel great.

Dont get me wrong I am very much in love with my girlfriend. Probably more than Beca, but sometimes I wonder what if? A lot of my friends still think Beca and I should be together. 

I also think sometimes Beca feels the same way. She also is in a long-term relationship but she has told me multiple times she wants to dump him.

Idk what to do. I can’t understate how much I love my current girlfriend. And I would hate ruining what is a very lovely relationship for what has a very small chance of being anything good romantically.

I’m a female (26) he’s a male (26). We have a great relationship and have good sex regularly.

His phone is always unlocked, he doesn’t have a passcode and he never acts nervous when I use it. My phone was dead so I grabbed his to google search something. As I typed the internet browser, the suggested searches from his history started to pop up. Lots of tranny porn, gay porn, and some straight porn. But mostly trans. 

I already had a hunch about tranny fetish because I saw he followed a few trans models on Instagram.

My question is whether or not I should confront him about it. I cannot stop thinking about it and it’s haunting me.. 

I’ve asked him many times in the past about his fantasies, what porn he likes, even if he’d ever been with a man or is bi and he’s denied. He clearly doesn’t want me to know. And I don’t know if I should respect that. But unfortunately I do know now. A part of me wants to talk about it and be open with him about our sexuality and feelings but I don’t want to ruin our relationship either if he doesn’t respond well.

And self. I'm never happy, I'm always confused and lonely and hurt. I feel most of the time that he genuinely hates me and I even hate myself at times because it all has turned me into someone that I don't even recognize or like.   
I am 33F and he is 28M. We've been together for 4 years now. The first two and a half years were pretty much perfect. I had never felt so connected to some. Had never felt more seen and wanted and loved. He made me feel so beautiful and confident, which I've always struggled with so that was no easy task, he had to really try and try to accomplish that one but he did it. We had an amazing sex life. He took the time and attention to learn exactly what I liked and did it amazingly. I felt like he truly had my back and would never even dream of doing anything to hurt me or risk losing me. He was always encouraging and supportive in everything I did. He was super helpful with everything, even doing most of the household chores without ever being asked. He would tell me all of the things he wanted to do and experience with me. He wanted to share the rest of his life with me and could no longer imagine it any other way. He promised to never give up. He communicated his feelings, wants, needs, hopes, dreams, everything. And he truly listened and cared when I shared mine. I felt like we were truly meant for one another and that there was nothing that could ever shake or break our connection and love.   
I feel like there's no way that someone could just fake what we had. It felt too real for so long. I never had alarm bells going off saying something was wrong. I never doubted that what we had was anything other than completely genuine and rock solid.   
I still can't make myself believe that it wasn't real or true even though it seems like it's now his mission in life to only do things that leave me no other choice but to admit that it was all a lie and he never cared at all, not even in the most basic way.  
It didn't happen gradually. It was so sudden and shocking. You can see it in our text messages. They went from loving and cute and sweet and thoughtful and him calling me baby, he ALWAYS called me Baby, and telling me how much he loved me and why and him being super open and transparent to the complete opposite the next day and every day since with a couple of exceptions just recently.   
He stopped calling me baby at all, it literally never came out of his mouth again for a complete year and that was literally all he ever called me. He went from paying attention to me and spending time with me and listening to me and communicating to COMPLETELY ignoring me like I did not even exist. So many texts just completely disregarded like they were never even sent. The worst and most heart breaking and soul crushing thing I've ever felt in my life is when I was sobbing in front of him, begging him to just please talk to me and tell me what was wrong and how to fix this and that I would do anything, just please stop ignoring me. Please look at me. I begged him like I was begging for life. And he didn't even so much as look in my direction. He stared straight ahead, blank and emotionless. He even laughed at something on the TV while I was sitting in front of him begging him to please just stop. That did something to me in a big way. It broke something inside of me. That is the only time in my life I have ever thought about suicide. I just wanted so desperately to make the pain stop because it was the worst thing I've ever felt.  
He started sleeping on the other side of the bed when literally every night for two years and I mean every single night we slept with my head on his chest and his arm holding me. He always said he loved how I fit so perfectly and that it was impossible for him to sleep any other way now and he looked forward to that moment when we climbed in bed and cuddled up with one another all day long. Suddenly he acted like it was torture and unbearable. We went from being super affectionate and always touching in some way, holding hands,  my head in his lap, cuddling. To him never even sitting near me or touching me at all except on the occasions he wanted to have sex. Which I continued to do and even initiated it more often just to be able to feel wanted and close to him if even briefly. He started hiding and lying and doing hurtful and dishonest and just awful things behind my back. Talking about me behind my back. And he didn't really care when I found out. I got no apology or explanation or even excuses. He just simply was completely unphased by the knowledge that he'd hurt me and seemed totally fine with the prospect of losing me. He downloaded ""hook up apps"" even though he swears he only said one thing to one person then decided them instantly, I feel like I will never get past that betrayal, especially since he's done nothing to try and make it right or make things better. At least I got a half hearted ""sorry"" for that one. But I feel like be was only sorry He got caught not that he hurt me. He went from always being there when I needed him and wanting to spend all the time he could with me to him volunteering to work on my days off and going to bed a couple of hours after getting home. I work from home and would get off work about 3-4 hours after he got home at which time he was always showered and in bed and ""falling asleep"" complete with occasional fake snores if I tried to talk to him God forbid. He even admitted to me that he knew what he was doing and knew it was messed up and destroying me. Now he says that I'm too sensitive and I'm blaming him for all of my problems and I need to get a life and get some help. Then he finally ""opened up"" and told me that he treats me the way he does now because I just refuse to trust him again so it's pointless. I try to explain that it's impossible to trust him since he's still lying to me and doing nothing to repair the trust that he and he alone destroyed completely. And he ignores me. Just like he does every other time, I've spent countless hours, explaining my hurt and sadness and exactly how his actions effect me and how he makes me think and feel and what I need from him. Completely and totally ignored because it's ""pointless"". Then in the past 2-3 months he suddenly without any obvious reason at all just went right back into the loving person he used to be. Briefly. It broke me in a whole new way when he finally gave it back just to take it all away again and this time it was clearly my fault according to him because I literally could not just go right back into it with him. Not after the hell and what's felt like torture I've endured for a year and a half. And we didn't actually do anything to fix any of our many issues he just decided one day to love me again and was shocked and critical when I had a hard time accepting that. I was so confused and shocked and I still tried so damn hard to just enjoy it and go with it and be happy because after all isn't that exactly what I had been hoping and praying would happen this whole time? So why can't I just go with it? But no matter how hard I've tried I couldn't accept it or feel comfortable. It just all felt so fake and not at all genuine. And he couldn't even explain to me why he was suddenly being nice and loving again. But he had no problem making it clear that it was all my fault he was taking it away again.  And that whole scenario has played out probably 4-5 times now.  It only lasts about 4 or 5 days tops then ends just as suddenly and unexplained as it started. And every single time I get my hopes up that this time he means it. That he's finally going to really try. That we can really still fix this and be in love again like we used to be. And I feel so stupid and pathetic and hate myself for it when he rips my heart out all over again and so effortlessly. I want to be able to give up the hope, I honestly do. Because I despise the way I feel and am living. It's misery. But I can't let go of the person that I fell in love with and all of the hopes and dreams we had. I can't say goodbye to the life we should be living and love we should be sharing.

We actually were friends in person before for a few years, but funnily started dating *after* I moved for my studies.

I have since graduated, and the current situation is that he is a PhD student (STEM) and I am running my own successful firm full time. Distance-wise, we are a 5hr flight away (he's in a different country).

In the first 1.5 years of our relationship, it was of course difficult but I think with the whole thrill of the relationship, it wasn't too difficult. We had lots of talk about and lots of things to do and try. However, now whenever we call or text, it's incredibly dry and mostly small talk. This is partially due to us already having talked about most things and shared most of our interesting stories. Another part is that a PhD requires a lot of his time and attention, and my firm sucks up most of my time too. We are both exhausted all the time and I personally find it hard to be all goofy like I used to be.

So I'm coming to you for help. I know there are many long distance couples who are very busy. For example medical students who go on rotation or law students. Any tips on making it work over the next few years would be appreciated.

Over the last year or so she hasnt put any effort into our relationship. She doesnt show me any sign of affection and it feels like she doesnt really care for any from me (and actually seems to be unwanted despite her not saying so). It honestly feels like she does not care about me anymore and is only with me because I support her financially and if I left her she would not be in a good spot in life. She contributes very little to the relationship as well. Even though she has a full time job she hasnt ""been able"" to pay rent for months despite always making unnecessary purchases. I dont feel loved or that I receive the attention/respect/caring that I deserve even though I shower her with these things plentifully. When we do have sex it doesnt feel like we are doing it together. It more feels like shes just letting me do it to her which feels gross. I feel at least partially responsible for letting it get this way because until recently I did not have much self respect and thought this was normal treatment. Recently I thought about how I would want my partner to treat me and realized that I am far off from that. I also am not desiring anything extreme. I just want to feel loved, respected, and like both of us are putting effort in the relationship. I also have been the one putting in the effort and making the vast majority of contributions to our relationship so perhaps she felt like she didnt need to put any effort because I was doing it despite her lack of effort so why bother. For example, she wont hug, kiss, or tell me she loves me on own. If I do these things to her she seems miserable despite not saying anything. She also says ""I love you too"" in a sad tone back to me almost as an forced automated response. I still love her even if I cant explain why and its possible the sunk cost fallacy is what's keeping me with her. If I leave her I would lose 3/4 of my dogs because they were hers initially and I know it will be painful to go through with it. Please let me know what your thoughts are and if I should let her know that Im thinking about leaving her because I havent told her that yet.

He said looking at me on the couch doing nothing and coming back to a messy house irritates him; he doesn't mind that the house is messy because he is not overly neat. But it's the fact that I haven't done anything but spend his money in a day, and I haven't thought to clean the house or hire a housekeeper to help him out.

I guess ill just start from the beginning.   


My girlfriend and I met at work together when she was 19 and I was 24. I could tell she was interested, but I was, and still kind of am very wary of the people I let in my life, and I was bothered at the age gap, so we stayed friends for a couple years. Nothing ever happened between us, I had never been in a relationship until I was 25 years old, we just very much enjoyed talking to each other.  


About a year and a half after I met my current girlfriend some problems happened at her place and I offered to let her and her boyfriend stay with me for a little while, rent free so they could get themselves back on their feet. Them living here was ok, up until I had my first girlfriend, then tensions started to rise and I had to tell them they needed to find a place because of the drama shit that was happening, they also had been living with me for 3 months at that point and I was convinced they were taking advantage of me. That then led to much more dramas, I got a call from the cops, and then they were gone the next day. My current girlfriend and I didn't talk for a while after that.  


My ex girlfriend ended up texting me one day saying she was going back to her ex, which ill fully admit put me in a very off mood and my emotions were erratic and all over the place, I messaged my current girlfriend after we hadn't spoken for about 5 months, apologized, and offered to make a few things to keep my mind off what I had been through and also to say I'm sorry for the way things had gone. After that we would talk every couple weeks just seeing how we were doing nothing very important but we were talking again.  


In the fall she messaged me saying she needed help or she'd lose her place, I offered to help, but even after I did I could tell something else was different. She had been through some things with where she was living and her boyfriend at the time that affected her mental health. So I again offered a place for her to stay just so she could get herself better and healthy again.  


About a month after she moved in, things started to happen between us, which was never my intention, but we cared about each other a lot even before any of this.   


Things were, and still are mostly fantastic, she's exactly my dream, affectionate, caring, smart, funny, beautiful, you know the whole package. We spend virtually all of our time together and have for a year. Almost every part of this relationship has been just another fantastic memory to look back on, but there are some serious things that either A I'm creating problems when there aren't any, or B I cant come to the conclusion on my own that we'd be better off not together.   


Things really took a strange turn back in the spring when she brought up the idea of an open relationship, I immediately know how that sounds, but we talked about it thoroughly, laid down some ground rules and essentially tried it out. The sex part isn't what bothered me as much as I felt like something else was happening. Her attitude changed and she was a lot quicker to judge for things during the situation which put me in a very bad mindset.  


Im a very passive person, definitely too passive at times, and where I really started to have an issue was the name calling, Im not trying to sound like a baby, but to have someone tell you to ""grow the fuck up"" or call me a fucking retard etc, while you are paying for literally everything starts to create a very bad image of the person you are considering your significant other.   


For a years worth of time now, she has worked a total of maybe 60 hours, and gotten probably less than 1000$ CND of income, I have sold my laser engraver, my Alienware computer with a 2080 in it (I know Alienware sucks) countless tools, I've changed my job from somewhere I was for 4 years, ive traded dogs with my mom (another endless story) to try and make things easier and more accessible for her while we live together.   


I don't mind taking care of someone, in my mind that's what I feel I'm here in this world to do, but this is where things get unbelievably complicated in my brain. In my mind I would never say the things she says, never do the things she does or let someone deal with or change so much all for me, even if I didn't love them. And its so hard for me to tell myself she cares in any aspect when this has been an entire year of it.   


Today things blew up, and I realize I absolutely need to talk to someone and figure things out because it feels like things will be much worse.   


An argument started because she asked me what the last name of one of the girls I work with is, she's asked me numerous times, I have no idea and never probably will, so I was frustrated because she keeps pushing me about it. That excelled into screaming at each other about things with the open relationship, the lie, how I found out, and by the end of it she threw my grand mothers ring, twice, before running upstairs with it (I've told her before to be careful with the ring around the tub as if it goes down the drain its not something that's gonna be easily retrievable) and when I went to get the ring from her, because my grandmother was 97  and she just passed it means a lot to me, she pushed me back down the stairs.  


Now I'll fully admit I started that fight, it was bothering me she was asking yet again, and then in our fight I said in rage that she's horrible because she just uses people who are trying to help her until they cant take it and then she moves on to the next person.   


After looking at all of this I can kind of already gauge the overall advice I'm going to receive, I'm just lost, I want to love this person, but after today I just see 2 people who wish we were both someone else trying to make things work.

I am a teacher and a full time mom,wife,cleaner,nurse…all the things. Anyway I am having a difficult time in this season of my life. 
Husband and I do not have good open communication, no dates, and little to no affection. 
I am with my kids pretty much all the time. We all go to the same school, we go to school together and we come home together. I take the kids to their extracurricular activities, you name it and I am there. With that being said I never get any time to myself. My weekends are don’t cleaning and taking care of kids and the house. 
My husband doesn’t really have to do anything. Yes he does physical labor work so he’s exhausted all the time. 
I really don’t get any help and I feel like he takes advantage of that. He has had back issues ever since we met and he blames his pain for the lack of effort.
I don’t know how bad the pain is but I do sympathize so I take on the extra load with the kids and the house.
I am exhausted of doing it all. But I also see him just on his phone and easily getting frustrated with the kids for any little thing.
He has no problem going and hanging out with his friends but I feel he doesn’t put effort into spending time with his family, let alone spending time with me. 
He drinks 4 out of the 7 days in the week and I think he drinks too much and he knows that. 
I just feel alone. I’m already introverted because I just focus on my kids. I really don’t have any friends.

i met her at a wedding in september. we’ve only met in person twice (she lives 4 hours away from me) and we got on really well. we both have the same interests. we text everyday, and have called a few times and played video games together. 

but the more i get to know her, the less i like her. i don’t know why, i can’t give a reason i just don’t want to be in a relationship with her, even thought we share a lot of interests and have similar personalities. 

i know i don’t have to be in a relationship with someone who i don’t like, but she seems dead set on me. the first time we met, she was talking about marriage, and she even mentioned OUR marriage a few times. there is something wrong with her and she frightens me. 

i’m really afraid of her because she seems very clingy and obsessive. i’ve heard from my family members that all she talks about is me all the time. it really creeps me out. i’ve had relationships before but they were very laid back, nothing like this and we aren’t even together. i think she might be fantasising that we’re actually together because of the way she talks about me. that’s why i think she could be some kind of demon or succubus, the way she acts doesn’t seem normal, at least to me anyway. 

she hasn’t asked me to date her yet, but i know she will at some point. she even asked my mum for advice on how she should go about asking. 

my entire family approves of this relationship, even though i’ve said multiple times that i’m uncomfortable with the age gap. they just think it’s funny and brush of my concerns. they aren’t taking this seriously and it pisses me off. 

i’ve been waiting for her to ask me over text or a phone call, but apparently she is staying at our house for new years so she will ask me in person. 

sorry for getting sidetracked. but the point of this post is to ask for advice on how to decline someone in person. it’s not something i’ve ever had to do before so i’m nervous. everyone in my family talks about us like we’re basically together and i don’t want to seem like an asshole for rejecting her.  i’m scared about getting a bad reaction from her, like in case she gets physically aggressively or tries to make me seem like a bad person because i said no. thanks for any answers.

Here and there I helped her out, like with her mom at the airport and fixing her plumbing and other household needs. We fucked here and there. But as of one month ago we went completely no contact. Within these 3 months I slowly regained myself and my happiness. I only clarify these things to show we have been in contact here and there. I have since been with other people here and there, but I choose to remain by myself. 

About 3 days ago I got a notification on tiktok saying she viewed my profile and just a couple hours ago she texts me “hello :). I hope you had a good week :))))” after sending me the most toxic texts I’ve ever seen. These things I don’t tolerate. I don’t allow myself to be bullied and abused. I regained myself and my happiness and just when I’m finally discovering who I am again, she texts me. 

Safe to say I love myself again, but this woman and I have been together for years. Day and night. We have experienced almost everything for the first time together. Do I think she’s changed? Absolutely not. But do I still love her?! The answer is yes. This woman stole my heart. 

What do I do? She didn’t apologize, she didn’t say she missed me. She just randomly texted me, most likely to keep the contact alive. Am I crazy for thinking an apology was owed to me for the years of abuse my patience let subside? Or that I think she wants to work on the issues we had and leave the toxic side of us behind us? I love this woman to death, but what’s happened between us drives an absolute hatred towards our relationship.

My girlfriend's parents suffer from mental illnesses that affect our life. Her dad's an alcoholic, her mom has a lot of paranoia, we believe she's bipolar, and she is religiously fanatic. My girlfriend is a recovered opiate addict, and her mom perceives that she must make decisions for her daughter or else bad things will happen. Her dad has control of her mother, Her mother is afraid to stand up to her dad, who literally forces her mother to take care of work and finances all on her own, even though he never had a disability other than addiction. Her mother tries to manage everything down to what her daughter wears and when...

My girlfriend loves her mothers, she doesn't want to leave her, but loving her mother comes with the consequences of us randomly having her show up at our door uninvited at 11:00pm at night because she didn't answer the phone (she was asleep). Or her mother uses her daughter for serious emotional leverage, which has brought my girlfriend into relapse a couple times over the last year.

Her dad's drinking causes a lot of fights, and crude behavior. For Example, if my girlfriend doesn't answer his every text he'll start texting her all these terrible things ""You're schizophrenic and need a mental hospital"", or ""You're a terrible daughter, I did X, Y, and Z for you""... They've stolen money from her insurance claims, her dad has taken out $2000 in debt in her name to go on a coke binge when she had JUST turned 18, which I am now responsible for paying... It gets worse, trust me...

It's taken a few months to help my girlfriend see the extent of the emotional abuse and manipulation, but she's finally standing up for herself... Now her dad has cancer (probably from drinking for years on end) and we've been dragged into helping them with appointments and what not, which would be cool if her dad would care about his own health and quite lying saying ""Doc says I don't have to stop drinking"". Her parents are trying to control our finances to where, I'd go to pay to get her car fixed, my girlfriend will sleep over at her mother's for a night, her mother will steal her phone, call the mechanic, run up to our mechanics and pay the money (she doesn't have on a credit card) herself, before we have the opportunity to pay... and then later use it as leverage on her daughter. (I've now stopped her from doing this... finally).

The father has power, because he wants to drink, and when someone threatens his drinking, he responds by trying to manipulate her perception of that person telling her ""You're boyfriends not all that smart"", or like, I stood up to her mother for her, because her mother is CONSTANTLY showing up without being invited even though my girlfriend has multiple times set clear boundaries for her not to. So now, he's trying to twist it into ""Your boyfriend acts like an evil authoritarian"", because I scolded her mother for disrespecting her boundaries. We've tried having a civil conversation over their behavior, and they didn't listen. Her dad's afraid of me, he wants nothing to do with me, because he knows I see through his bullshit. I sent him a long text about his abuse because he REFUSES to talk to me, ending with ""You two will control her no longer"". 

My goal since I've started dating this girl is to fix her environment so she can remain sober, such as moving her into a home she wasn't fighting with her parents everyday for. Teach her how to fight for herself, and we talk a lot about ethics, to help her learn to make decisions for herself. Her dad and I are in a struggle for power because we want two separate things. I want them to stop abusing and controlling her, I want him to stop drinking and causing harm to the people around them, and I want both her parents back in therapy. He wants to keep drinking, and her mother wants to be able to abuse her daughter's boundaries. The tricky part is, I don't know HOW to get them back in therapy. I keep looking for leverage to use against them, but they're not easy to budge. She isn't at the point of breaking contact with them. And I know that's going to be the go-to answer for most, but I'm telling you, it's easier for US to tell her that's the right option, but at the end of the day, it has to be HER decision to block them, not mine... My girlfriend, at the end of the day wants to have a healthy loving relationship with her family, and for me to have a healthy relationship with her family. I want that for her, but I can't have that with her parents abusing her constantly, and making THEIR relationship her problem.

Right now, I'm trying to get them to stop overstepping her boundaries, and they're losing their shit im giving them commands to stop overstepping her boundaries, and texting my girlfriend things like ""You're a scizophrenic, go to a hospital, you NEED to be answering your phone"". So I told them, they get no help until we both get a written apology. Their car broke down today, and you know what they do?

I asked what I could do specifically to work on it and I’ve been doing more of it since. That issue wasn’t brought up when I asked what the problem was. He then continued on this morning that he feels unhappy with me and being in this relationship feels like a chore. Those words hurt like hell because we fought so much to get to a place of trust and comfort. He said he needed space to sort his feelings out, that he is unsure of his life at the moment. I asked if I did anything and he responded no, that it was a personal problem and nothing to do with me. We’ve broken up in the past, around the 2.5 year mark. We reconciled and worked hard to get to what I thought was a good place. I can’t do the “space” thing again just to be told he wants to end it. I tried ending things and explained he needs to figure his stuff out without me because it hurts too much and I think he needs to be alone. He continues to ask for space and tells me “just give me time please”, but my gut is strongly telling me it won’t workout even after the space/break. We agreed another breakup would be our last and I need help to move on. I just don’t understand why he wants me around to wait for his response once he has had his “space and time”.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7533044,public,self,Bf asked for space after confessing to feeling stagnant in relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytqwwo/bf_asked_for_space_after_confessing_to_feeling/,all_ads,6,,,,,

The other time we wer talking about how tutoring money came in handy when we wer students and he said, nay i wasn't doing it for the money, i feel like i have too much information that i should just give away. When in actual fact he needed the money. All the things he says may be truth spiced up, meaning there will be some truth in it but magnified to look good and glorious. 

He always portrays a perfect lifestyle even when his struggling financially sometimes. He wilĺ talk about his struggles when he has some breakthrough attached to it. It feels like there is so much deception surrounding him. The need to be seen as better and more successful. Elements of PRIDE really but pride sugar coated with lies

I have recently discovered that im not the only one with such an observation. At some point, in some group people literally held a ""commission of inquiry "" questioning him about his financial status and wanting him to prove that he has that financial muscle that he inplies and talks about. 

I think he is a good guy with a bright future but he talks about it as though he is living it now. It feels like a character flow. This flaw leads him to conflict with a lot of people because sometimes he then makes promises that he cant deliver.

I was in 10th grade and very popular when she transferred into my school.  The girls I normally dated were very fake and were snobs, and this girl we'll call Scarlett, was the complete opposite and very shy but from a middle to lower income background, and wasn't popular.  

Most girls ignored or bullied her because of the attention she received from the guys at our school (she was very petite with dark hair, very pale, but very large chest).  I spent a lot of my time making sure the guys left her alone, but since I was immature and unable to deal with my feelings, I constantly teased her.  She normally ignored me, so I went out of my way for her attention by trying to be near her in classes or walking with her in the halls.  I even found out where she lived and drove by her house often.  I also made it clear she was off limits to all the guys at our school so she couldn't date anyone that went there.  

We had art class together and I often made crude jokes to her about her figure which I now regret.  During that time I would often draw her and even now have a sketch hanging inside my house of her (which most people assume is Scarlett O'hara from Gone with the Wind since they look so much alike - I never correct them).  

I recently attended a dinner at my fathers house where he's now investing in a company she works for and I tried to apologize to her for my behavior, and she actually cried and accused me of making her highschool life miserable and left without giving me a chance to properly explain.

My bf and I had been together for 2.5 years and things were really great. He is such a kind-hearted person and has truly treated me really well. There were only minor things that bothered me here and there, and we always talked about them. The best relationship I had ever been in. We broke up a few months ago because he said “he wasn’t feeling the same way he did when we first met” and he wanted to be independent. We agreed that the best option was for us to break up. Well we both cared about each other so much that we wanted to be friends still for as long as we could  so we continued to be in contact after the breakup. After we broke up I went through weeks of feeling so lost and broken, but I pushed myself to grow from it and look forward to the future. Enough where I started to feel okay and was excited about future relationships and how great life could be with new possibilities. Well…. He went on a trip right after we broke up and after he came home to his new apartment by himself, he was rushed with emotions and essentially called me and said he regretted everything and wished me could get back together.
This was hard for me because I felt like he needed time to work through the hurt like I did, but I still loved him. So I heard him out. Fast forward- we decided to get back together. Things have been good and all, and he’s been mentioning marriage (that was always the plan prior to the break up) more than ever. But I can’t shake the feeling of “Do I deserve to marry someone who at one point didn’t want to be with me and saw their life without me?”. I have always loved very deeply and sometimes I feel that while he does love me, it isn’t as deep or as much as I do. Our break up gave me a taste of what could be out there and I’m worried that staying in this relationship isn’t right for me because of how much I question and now when he mentions marriage, I get nervous. Before I was 100% ready to get married to him.

I thought I could forgive him for the break up and hurt I went though, but I’m scared that it’s going to follow me forever and build up. Some days I wish we didn’t get back together, but only when I haven’t seen him in a while (we are long distance now), but when I’m with him- I’m so happy.

I'm so lost. My values are God but I don't align myself with religion. So I don't go to church often. My girlfriend on the other hand goes to church multiple times every week (she's in choir). I've never been the type of guy to put rules in my relationships. But now it's becoming to the point where she can't even pick me up from work. I have to walk back home because her choir practice is running late.

We share a car and all the expenses that come with it. But I notice that she's been prioritizing her needs over mine. In the past three weeks shes needed my time to help her with all these extra curricular activities she got herself into. Then I would go to work. I work 12s. 

I keep finding myself just sitting down exhausted and I shared it with her. But she seems to not understand and with the stuff being related to God. I never felt like I could enforce anything. Which at this point is what I would normally do but it's different cuz it's something we align ourselves to as partners. 

She's not cheating. I'm always welcomed to the church. In my opinion I think she goes there mostly to be with other girls. I have no problem with that as I'm mostly antisocial with everyone but her and I'm sure that can be a pain. I don't mind. I like alone time. But the issue is when it's starting to affect my work. We both rely on each other's income to survive. If I lose my job and we don't get that income anymore it can mean homelessness. 

An example of this is in the morning when I'm getting ready for work. She knows that she has stuff to do. But until Im walking out the door is when she gets up and starts getting ready. We share a vehicle. 

Idk what to do. Half of me just wants to watch everything burn and restart the other half is telling me that I'm not enough.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7532929,public,self,My serious gf (F27) can't be there for me (M27) when I need her,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ytqjtw/my_serious_gf_f27_cant_be_there_for_me_m27_when_i/,all_ads,6,,,,,
