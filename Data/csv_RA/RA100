Then we met few times and ended up sleeping next to eachother (no kissing or anything, just cuddle). It was nice. Same thing happened twice.

I realized this month I’m giving into toxic habits and thought processes I had while in my bad relationship and I’m becoming frustrated with myself. Any advice or similar stories would be helpful, I am currently in therapy.

Backstory: I was in a relationship for 7 years that ended early in 2022. He was a chronic cheater and finally found someone who would allow him to move in with them after I found out. Our relationship was very distrustful, codependent and I took on a mother role taking care of him. I feel like I need to be with my partner 7 days a week otherwise I don’t know what they’re doing or if they’re being respectful to me and our relationship. I held onto a lot of resentment but I also couldn’t function being apart from him. It was difficult to move on at first but I learned better habits and made great memories, restored damaged or tense relationships I had with friends and family, met tons of new people, found new hobbies and felt more confident than I had in years. I dated around for several months until I met my current partner (28M). He is an extremely nice and understanding person and at first it was easy to continue to do my own thing while he also did and we are both respectful and happy. Since the beginning or October I noticed I’m becoming more needy, and giving into it before I evaluate WHY I’m feeling that or if it’s appropriate. If we take a day off from each other it’s because we literally can’t see each other that day and we still call each other on the phone. The other day we were on the phone and I said ‘I like that we still call each other even if we don’t see each other for a day’ and my partner said ‘as long as it’s not something we NEED to do’ and it made me think if it is becoming something I feel like I NEED to do. I realized I would be hurt if my partner asked for a day off and didn’t have a ‘reason’ to not see me. It’s becoming harder to find happiness in days where I don’t see him. I feel more moody and upset when he doesn’t give me more attention even though he always gives me a great amount of attention.

And that bothers me for some reason. How would you guys feel about this sort of thing?

I'm using a friends account as I don't have one and didn't really want to make one just to ask this question.

Me (24f) and my bf (25m) both work together and have a good friendship group within work. There is the one girl who I am reallt good friends with (G). G and my bf are also friends since they work in the same department . G has been in a relationship for a year. G doesnt really talk to many more people at work and can be quite socially anxious. Me and my bf have suffered with that in the past and know how bad it can be.

Another friend of ours from work was having a lot of people from work at his house for a little party and invited me and my gf. I asked if G could come and he said yes. We got to the party and everyone was having fun and it was a good night. My bf said he was going to the bathroom and disappeared for about 10-15 mins.

When he returned he told me G kissed him. he said he backed away and didnt respond but I was angry and betrayed so I asked him how could he cheat on me. He asked to talk the next day when we were both sober and I agree. He tells me when he left the bathroom G was sat on her own and said she didnt feel like she fit in so he said he offered to help get her talking to people and she hugged him to thank him. Once she pulled away she kissed him and according to him he pushed her away instantly and then came to find me. I messaged G and she denies it. I have been cheated on in the past by my previous bf. My bf asked if we can move past this since he doesn't see it as cheating but I only have his version of events so I am not sure what to do. Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been through something similar?

He doesn’t seem as eager for a second date, I expressed my concern and he tells i’m just being paranoid and that he does want to see me. 12 days later we meet up for a second date, didn’t go as well but still really good. We went back to his and messed around but did not have sex.

It’s been 3 days after the second date, and i don’t know whether I will see him again. I asked, he just said “i’ll let you know”.

All I know is his bad texting makes me want to see him more because he’s very affectionate and lovely in person, but I have to wait 2 weeks just to get another date.

I think my ex (26M, I am 26F) sent me a birthday present. It was a t-shirt of a band that we both listened to a lot together with a design that references a very specific inside joke of ours. I feel really weird about it because we haven’t spoken since August and there was no note included. 

We dated for 4 years and split up in May of this year, after which he moved out of state. The breakup itself wasn’t very contentious, but I had to break up with him several times for him to get the message, and the relationship itself was very unhealthy with a lot of emotional abuse on his part. I also heard from a friend whom he was staying with while in town on a visit that he got very drunk and tried to go over to my house in the middle of the night. I’ve expressed to him my desire for distance, which he has been respectful of, but I just don’t know what to make of him sending this (admittedly very thoughtful) gift. It just seems weird of him to send me a birthday present with no note or contact. Do I teach out to him?? Ignore it??? I feel kind of obligated to text him but also don’t want to invite more of the controlling or manipulative behavior he had while we were together.

That's like a bucket list thing but only 6 months after that it turned into more her going on dates with girls and then coming home and fucking the shit out of me then 4 months ago she mentioned this new girl she was talking to that was idk like one of those hardcore lesbians I guess with very short hair and just more masculine traits i came home from work I started working a night shift job that pays more so that she wouldn't have to be a nanny on the the side to help with our bills I came home and saw her phone was on and when I looked at it ( I know this was bad but I've always been able to feel when something just isn't right) and just for disclosure I've had a bad feeling about this girl she was talking to but idk something stopped me from saying anything anyways the text my wife had sent her said "" he's like a best friend that I can't live without but intimacy there's nothing there"" so that kind of broke me and snd then she went on to say that's why I need to form a whole another relationship with someone else she managed to talk me out of a divorce while crying and so I stayed but it started to feel like I was being placed 2nd in my own marriage and so I left for a divorce she was a mess and it lasted for about three months in which she still talked to this girl all the while she proclaimed herself gay now while she cried every time I came to pick up my son for the first month after I left then she started to running into trouble with this girl and being emotionally abused by her and being together and then breaking up so many times she lost a lotta weight from the stress and not being able to eat which mind you she's a type 1 diabetic so that's not good at all and just not being able to watch our son so either I or her parents would watch him while she went out to this girl, on Friday she finally officially ended it with this girl and came to pick up our son just crying and unable to eat so I made some food for her let her cry on me and offered to come back to the place to lay our son down for bed ( I'm the one who sleep trained him so I always laid him down) and then she was still a wreck and I didn't realize I still loved her because I thought I got over her but she was a mess so I came to her and told her that we can pretend the last 3 months didn't happen and that I would be her husband and best friend for Tonight as long as she needed me she broke down crying in my arms shaking her head in a yes so I layed down with her cuddled her ran my fingertips across her arms and legs and back because it helps desensitize her from reality and gave her a foot massage until she calmed down and we almost fucked but then I left she asked me to come back at 5 which I did and then we did the deed I didn't feel anything abnormal besides missing her and that day she was such a mess from this bitch that mentally destroyed her and she ended up allowing herself to be admitted to the hospital to get mental health and so I took her I stayed with her the entire time until she had to be taken to a separate facility for depression because she had thoughts of just driving her car into a tree and said it wouldn't be so bad if I fell asleep and never woke up during this whole time I just held her hand and cried because I realized I still loved her no matter how much I tried to act like I didn't I did it was like my soul was screaming out at me that this is your soul mate you did this by your inaction to do anything or say anything and i called her every day she was in there she told me there's no future for us and that she's gay yet she told her mom and friends that she misses me and the life we had together, she told me she threw out her wedding ring and photos yet while she was in the hospital I cleaned her (my old place) for her from top to bottom because I didn't want her to stress over anything and then I found it in a drawer along with pictures of me and her and pics of me and our first cat that we had and apparently she told people that she still loved me but now has built up these walls around herself she got released yesterday and I took her home to our son took her out to eat a family dinner and watched shows with her yet idk as I was leaving the bedroom because I asked if she wanted me in there with her she said no snd that me using her blanket while watching the show was pushing it and so I left to go sleep on the couch while trying not to cry about this whole thing to have someone you loved for 7 years be somewhat frosty towards you Is a hard experience today she has just been mostly sleeping with me taking care of her watching our son cooking food for both reheating a hot pad to put on her head because I know it sooths her when she sleeps and yet if I bring anything up she'll just idk maybe kick me out yet when I told her that I would be her friend and nothing more she told her mom that it hurt her (this is while she was at the hospital) I found out Earlier today that she got onto a dating app that she claimed was just so she could talk to people because she wanted to feel better smd doesn't want to date anyone right now I just laid our son down for a nap and checked on her again and reheated the hot pad what do I do how do I proceed from here just keep doing what I'm doing do that her ocd and anxiety makes it so that she can see that there can be a future for us

We have a long term relationship of about 9 years now, both in our early thirties.

She sees our relationship more as 'friends' rather than a emotional/physical one at this moment.
I recognize we've gotten stuck in a rut since the birth of our daughter 2.5years ago.

We have had a miscarriage 6 months ago and it hit us both pretty hard.

Right now we are in relationship therapy with bi-weekly sessions for 3 months.
Both of us are also visiting therapists individually to work on ourselves, also every 2 weeks.

The 'problem' (?) here however is that after 3 months in this program, I'm not really seeing any progress on a emotional connection (or effort?), mostly on her side.  When we try to adress this issue in private or in therapy she suggests that she is still 'in doubt' and it's holding her back.

I, myself, however look at these challenges not as the end but as a new start or chapter in our relationship.  I'm also in doubt but I look at these things a bit differently.

We own our house and have a great daughter (2 years old).  Our lives are very interconnected private and family wise.   Her family is pretty much my own as they depend a lot on me.  We have no financial problems, trust issues, substance/emotional/physical abuse and get along just fine, albeit 'just as friends' raising a beautiful daughter.

Looking at what we have is an extra motivator to invest more in the relationship and really put in the works so we can figure out together if there's any future left for us.  I'm not saying I believe in 'stay-together-for-the-kids'.  I'm just saying I fear regret more than failure.

I still love her to death and hope we can get through this together.  I really want to keep my family together but it's been a rough ride so far..  I guess I need an emotional connection with my partner to allow me to function normally.  On the other hand I want to give her time and space to figure things out.  I fear if I give up it will mean the silent death of our relationship and disrupt all of our lives greatly.

Writing this down is also some form of therapy for me.
I feel I'm at the crossroads of a decision that will determine a big part of the rest of my life, and am a bit lost with conflicting emotions and thoughts.

I can't promise I'll follow advice from random strangers on the internet, but I'm looking forward to read up your comments for extra insights.  I'll monitor this thread and reply to comments if you need more info or have questions.

My partner and I, both in our late 20s, started dating 2 years ago. At the beginning of the relationship I explicitly said I'm very insecure about myself. And that I don't like that my partners follow random cute chicks on Instagram. He used to do it a lot, and after a lot of begging from my side, he stopped doing it.

 I occasionally check his followings and today he followed a girl from the other part of the world (not an influencer, just a normal person).

I'm so so mad. I already told him I am mad (for something else that is not relevant to this matter) but I also said ""you know there's something else you did that is not correct"", expecting him to realize I'm talking about this issue. 

While he was working the whole day, I cleaned the whole house and then cooked dinner for him, just to realize that he is following random girls on ig and liking all of their posts. I feel so stupid right now.

I have recently met a guy who has made me fall hard for him. 

I (22F) have recently come out of an abusive relationship. It ruined me for a long time and I’m still healing. 

I’ve been going on a few holidays and on my most recent one I went to Dubai to see a friend. I met his friend there (22M) and he made me so happy. 
He made me feel excited, cared for and I started to look forward to the future. 

I didn’t know him for long but there was an instant connection and we spent everyday of my holiday together. 

When I came back to the UK I fell into a cycle of feeling unhappy and feeling like a burden. I started to push him away and was looking for a reason to believe he didn’t like me. 
By doing that I have messed up big time. 

He told me loved me, wanted me to be in Dubai with him but since I started pushing we ended things. He said he wants it to work but he can’t cope with my pushing. 

I’ve apologised multiple times and tried to explain why I was acting the way I was. I’ve tried asking him how he feels but he said he doesn’t want to talk about that. 

I feel like I’ve really messed up and I want to fix it but I don’t know how. It’s a lot harder when he lives in Dubai and I live in the UK (where I’m really unhappy) 

I’m not contacting him and we haven’t spoken a lot since. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to do?

If you were once hers yo do her bidding, and now you have gotten away she feels you no longer deserve life.
I am a drug addict in recovery, and recently more than ever my life has been stable, and actually that's an understatement. My credit is better than 78% of people my age and my credit limit on my cards continue to go up every few months. I have plans to stick my foot in the real estate game when I am ready to do so, and educating myself on said endeavor is a big motivator for my life right now. 

 I left her in February 2022, and basically went immediately into a long term rehab and halfway houae program. We were together on and (off totalling maybe a month?) over 2 years. 
That two years started in January of 2020, a few short weeks after a MAJOR meth psychosis induced suicide attempt. I literally sliced deep into my L forearm 6 times at lengths from 3 to 8 inches wife. I did it ""right"" and went vertically. This woman worked  at the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center I signed into after the mental health stay for the suicide attempt. At the end of my 2 months there, I moved myself, and my belongings into her home. She had non court stipulated 50/50 custody of her 2 boys, aged 9 and 12. At first, we were having sex ""causually"" and I was a live in roommate. It didn't take long for me to develop actual feelings that weren't just based on ANYTHING possible to get out of my own head after a hard breakup, relapse, and eventual suicide attempt (#1)
It was the start of covid in the U.S. and within weeks EVERYTHING was shut down. The Pandemic Unemployment hit about 6 weeks later, and those checks plus my regular U.C. pay was probably 40% higher than the last wage I was earning. 
The initial honeymoon was new, exciting, hot, and relaxing. There were certainly red flags, but fresh off a breakup with a good woman I truly cared about, and the suicide attempt I was just happy to have a VERY attractive woman by my side, and start rebuilding my life. 
IN THE BEGINNING I was giving my best effort at ""recovery,"" at the time which meant I didnt do any street drugs but I continued to take what the doctor wrote for me however and as many as I pleased.... and the chick was a blackout drinker almost if not daily. When I think about it, she didn't REALLY drink much, but a six pack of Blue Moon and a couple of prescription benzodiazapines is a literally recipe for a blackout. 
Red Flag # 1 : BEER. This woman was the nastiest drinker I've ever met, and least towards me I'll say. When she drank the first couple always seemed Euphoric with a good Playlist than only consisted ofL maybe a total of 40 songs of a mixed but VERY overplayed variety. I've never been much of a drinker so I dont mix with the backyard roundtable drinkers club, that may have been an immediate barrier now that I think about it. 
# 2 : Relationship with Ex-Husband and his Wife. I never understood nor was made honestly aware of the details of their Relationship after marriage. I liked Her Ex Husband AND his current wife, I just didn't personally understand the sexually open Marriage they had that occasionally included my current(at the time, now ex) girlfriend. I think technically they're stingers, but I was told ex's are off limits when I asked her about it to see if it would affect my ability to be with this woman long term.

I met this guy and really hit it off. He is genuinely the love of my life. We got together for two and a bit years and mutually decided to split. 

The reasoning was he was born and raised in the most shittiest little town you can dream of. Many years back I had a school trip there to learn about urban decline, its now way worse then that. Massive homeless problem, zero jobs, just nothing going for it. 

Despite this, he decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life there. He loved this town. He and his friends all had plans to live next to each other and have little movie/ games nights. Work in his favourite little shops. For him everything about this future life of his is perfect. 

This sounds like an absolute nightmare to me. I grew up travelling around anywhere. By 18 years old I moved fully across the country 3 times plus another time in a different country. After that I've moved in the same segment of the country a few times. I don't want to move around a lot, its way too much work and is isolating at times. But I've seen abit of what the world has to offer and know there's more then what my ex wants out of life. 

I split up with him shortly before I moved back to the city I am currently in (lived here for 9 years with my parents before). Its 45 mins away and I feel a lot happier. There's a massive art scene, and always something going on. I can go into the city centre at any given time and be able to do something interesting. So much better then drinking cans in a muddy field.

Its over two years since me and him split. I am absolutely thriving, I have a decent job with good prospects, met loads of cool people and living life. Ex however isn't. He's losing job after job as shops close down and is struggling. 

He has started messaging me and we've been talking, but now he wants to go on a date and get back together. I really do miss him, and he is the one who got away. However he still doesn't want to move out of where he lives. I would like to say he just doesn't know what its like elsewhere but I genuinely think its more then that.

Me (20f) and my boyfriend (21m) are from to different cultures. I grew up in an upper middle class/ working class family, whereas my boyfriend is from a country with poverty and didn’t grow up with his mom (don’t know his bio dad), but grew up with his grandparents and aunt and uncle who where strict on him and beat him regularly. Therefore he never had a close relationship with his mom until he moved to the country I’m from, when he was about 13 years old. My family is close as I said, but I struggle with trauma relating to my dad doing drugs when I was young and abusing me. We’ve moved on, but I haven’t forgotten it.
This is where things gets hard, his culture is more like the past is the past and it doesn’t effect me (put on a smile and fake it), and in results his not very good at expressing his emotions and can get stone cold and distant when faced with difficulty and people showing other emotions than happiness.
Which often result in me doubting our relationship and pulling away- as I often did as a child. I won’t say I’m not at fault, I often have very high emotions and can easily get sad and angered, I have ADHD; and often push his buttons when I get overstimulated.

But I can’t help but feel like I put more into this relationship and that our cultural differences and experience halt our relationship. I do everything for him and I want to spend more time together (we only see each other on the weekends) but he works the weekdays and uses it as an excuse to not see me. I work on the weekends and some weekdays( uni too) but I still make time for him.
“I’m doing it for our future “ but I can’t help but think we won’t have a future if he doesn’t show me he love me and appreciate our time together now. I always feel like the second choice because of this.

OK, i’m just needing to vent but a some advice/opinions would be nice…
I’ll get right into it, I, 24F struggle with a lot of mental health issues, but the biggest one is borderline personality disorder. For me this means unhealthy attachments, constant anger, outbursts, and changes of mood ect. about a year ago I got a new youth worker for those who don’t know it’s sort of like a social worker but they help you out in the community so he would help me get to my therapy appointments and help me grocery shop etc.. i’ve always had female workers. This was the first man that I had worked with him. I didn’t like him at first, i’m very picky about who I work with, but I gave him a chance and over time I realized that he’s really nice, caring and he’s really funny.. but now here’s the problem I could be wrong, but I think he may be attracted to me? 

Now I know with my BPD I am attached to him. You don’t have to tell me I know it’s unhealthy. I also come from a situation where I don’t have any family or outside supports so I do tend to get attached to people very fast. It started off with small things the ones that stuck out to me were “You look really nice today“ “I’ve never heard you laugh before it’s cu-funny“ just small things like that. Now I am a woman, so I don’t know anything about male parts and what not but I noticed overtime every time we were together driving he was constantly adjusting his pants, we would make jokes and talk about s*x, listen to music while driving, I ended up making him a whole playlist of my music he liked/asked for, and yes, some more s*xually suggestive songs. He came to bring me something I came outside in pyjama pants and a cropped tank top (how I dress daily) dropped my lighter we both kept bending down to get it ended up smashing heads twice, and after that we talked a little bit more, he said he had to go, gave me a hug and left. The one super awkward encounter that I can think of is we were shopping in a little thrift store and the aisles were so small I’m talking aisles, touching my shoulders as I’m walking down, I knelt down to look at a bottom rack in about the middle of the aisle. He was standing beside me when a woman with about four kids started to walk down our aisle. I guess we both had the same idea to get out of the way, he tried to sidestep behind me, and I went to stand up I’m assuming you can guess what happened next but if not, it essentially was my back/butt slid up his whole front 🤦🏼‍♀️ It was really awkward for a second and then he just laughed and told me he was going to check his emails while I finish shopping but he was super red in the face. So there’s a few examples of why I feel this way and before you say anything, I will admit that I am attracted to him I would never want to be with him dating wise out in the real world say if I met him at a bar or online dating, he’s not even my type, but would I spend the night with him? yeah, probably. I can admit I’m definitely s*xually attracted to him, I smile when he texts me, I get excited on the days that I get to see him  I found it attractive when he asked me for a song I was playing, and the next time we were together, he could sing all the lyrics and I’ve let myself fantasize about him but I’m also a child of the system so I know the rules , code of ethics, etc. and like I said, I would never want to be with him or date him in the real world if he wasn’t my worker. Maybe I’m projecting my feelings and that’s why I think he has feelings or is attracted to me, maybe I’m right and he does feel this way? I know that getting an answer isn’t gonna change anything and nothing is ever going to happen between us which I’m fine with but I’m a major Overthinker and I have a hard time sleeping at night because this is all I can think about. I really struggle when I don’t know how people close to me feel but I know that bringing it up with ruin the professional relationship. so I guess it would just be nice to get the opinion of a third-party, who had no personal interest in the matter (she’s the man quote 😂) and I don’t know what to do about my unhealthy attachment… I’ve talk to my therapist, which hasn’t really helped and I also learned that I can’t get a new worker right now because everybody else’s caseload is so high.

So I (M25) am married to my wife (W25).

To give some background information, I'm a really extroverted person, which means I love being around people and doing all kinds of things with others. Unfortanetely, I had a problematic childhood and some traumatic events in my young adulthood, which lead to me loosing my whole social circle I head and basically having a semi-depressic episode for some years.

Well, then things started to get better, I got to know some people at work and after some time a friend group was formed (mixed gendered). We went out, I got invitied to birthday parties, met other new people through this group. Basically, I came close to the kind of life I always wished for since I was a teenager. 

My wife however was not used to me having an active social lifestyle and she became a bit jealous and insecure. So I took her with me and introduced her to the group, and the other people liked her, everything went well, at least I thought so. But afterwards, she said that one of the women is hitting on me and probably has a crush on me. Honestly, I was really surprised and a bit schocked, because I never noticed any inappropriate behaviour from her side. To be fair, I'm not the most attentive and emotional intelligent guy, so I don't want to claim that my wife is wrong, but still I'm not convinced about it.
After that, she got more and more jealous, and reacted negatively everytime when I talked about having plans with the group. Last time when I took her with me, she was really angry afterwards and said she doesn't want me to be around this woman anymore. When I asked her how I should do this since she is a part of the group, my wife said I should just come up with something. 

Today, I told her that I'm a bit sad because tomorrow there is a holiday in my country where people go out and have fun together, and nobody asked me to join them so I will be alone. After this, my wife asked if this is some kind of preparation to tell her that I'm going to spend it with the friend group. I said no, they didn't asked me or plan anything. Well, turns out last time when we went out together and I was in the restroom, they asked each other, including my wife, what plans they have for this day. My wife said she isn't doing anything because she has a night shift. 
Well, so I didn't even know about this, and when I was surprised my wife said something like ""do you really think I would let you go out with them partying?"" 
Then I asked her what exactly she wants from me, if she expects that I cut all contact with the group.

After this, she went out angrily and messaged me that I should do with my b*tches whatever I want and don't be there when she comes home.

Right now, I feel really pissed. She knows how important a social life is for me, yet she just expects me to shut it down and even forbids me to go out for myself, even if nothing inappropriate ever happened to me. 

I don't know how to rule this out and avoid such problems in the future. I could just do what she wants, but then I would be half depressed again and I also don't want to be upset about my wife all the time.

He lifted my shirt, asking if it was okay to do so, and then started sucking on my breast. He asked if I liked it and I said yes, but then he started biting and I cringed, he noticed and asked if I wanted him to stop that and I said yes. He got back on top of me and didn’t pin me down this time, but he wouldn’t let me touch him (he pushed my arms down every time I tried). He asked if I’d rather be on top and I said yes, I pulled his pants down and went down on him, but suddenly he started pushing me away with his foot. He asked if I liked the “roughhousing” and I said no. He apologized and we took a break for a few minutes. We started kissing again and he asked if he could eat me out, I said sure. 

After that, we hung out fully clothed. At one point he tried to wrestle me again and pinned me down and told me to fight back, and I told him again I wasn’t in the mood. He apologized and stopped again.

I (32F) was suppose to take my mom to the doctor for her annual visit but I unfortunately had an emergency at work. My wife offered to take her there since she was not scheduled to work today. I thanked her and went to work. I was fixing a burst pipe in a construction site when I got the call about the accident.  I started going into fight, flight, freeze mode and started to panic. I rushed to the hospital where the three most important people in my life were. My wife is pregnant. My brother offered to be the donor as long as he got to be an involved loving uncle (we are farternal twins so it's literally the closest we can get genetically). He was there 5 minutes after I arrived about as panicked as I was as we watched both our mother and the mother of our child undergo several tests and treatments for the injuries that were caused. They were stopped at an intersection when a car made a left turn but ended up hitting my wife's car head on. He was a younger man (early 20's) and going pretty quick for making a turn.  He only had bruises and scratches and walked out of there pretty much unscathed. My wife had several cuts from the windshield shattering and the bruise from seatbelt when it locked up. Several cuts to her face and a concussion. My mom had a broken cheekbone and the seat belt bruise as well as a concussion. When he hit my wife's car it caused hers to go backwards into another car. They were unharmed but their car had a lot of damage.

My (27F) bf and I were shopping at Sainsbury a few days ago and he ran into an  old acquaintance of his during the time. I say acquaintance not friend  because apparently they went to college together and they had a falling  out over something.

This Hijabi  woman (this is relevant) was just looking over at us suspiciously the  whole time when my bf finally noticed her and began holding me closer to  him.

I saw her expression change  and she quickly moved towards us and began talking to us. She said hi to  my bf with a very sour expression and looked at me like she was  x-raying me as we made introductions. Her face was grew even more  serious when she heard my name and simply told my bf ""you don't deserve  this you POS"" and walked away.

I  was shocked and when I asked bf he just told me it's ""someone from  college"". I figured okay maybe it's an ex, maybe it ended badly, who tf  cares about some random b\*\*\*\* right?

However, my bf had been sort of lost in thought ever since then and then pulled away whenever I initiated anything sexual.

I  asked him if he was okay and he kept saying ""I'm a bad person"", and  ""Don't leave me"" and ""I cannot lose you"". This naturally freaked me out  as I thought he was initiating a breakup or even worse confessing to  cheating. But the truth is apparently something else.

He  told me it's time to confess his mistakes and begged me to hear me out.  My bf was involved in a group called the English Defence League and was  active in their street protests. I am an Indian immigrant and a Muslim  (also relevant) and didn't know what this was until I googled it later.

To  sum it up, it apparently is an anti-immigration British political party  with specific viewpoints about a certain religion. Guess which one?

And  now I don't know what to fucking do. My bf kept saying sorry and saying  he wasn't involved in any criminal activity and he was only protesting.  He said he was not coming from a place of hate and that he has changed  his mind about politics since then.

The  thing is, I love him. He loves me. This whole thing was almost a decade  ago. But some part of me feels like what if he's not as attracted to  me. What if he loves me but doesn't like me?

I'm so confused how do we proceed. How do we go from here?

We  have been together for over a year and love each other. We were  planning to get married. This is the man who I imagine spending the rest  of my life with.

What the tittle says, I met a girl (lets call her Judith) 4 moths ago, when we first met we feel (or I felt) an instant connection, we have talked all days since i met her, we have talked about EVERITHING, we had so many plans together, everithing seemed ""perfect"", i really loved her deeply.

The problems started two days ago, i found out she already had a bf (i had no idea) he discovered about me (he neither had any idea about me), i had a verbal fight with him then Judith tried to calm things down, we talked alone with her and i was so hurt that i told things that maybe caused her pain like for example: ""relax, i will not fight for you anymore, you not worth it""

The problem is that after treating her so bad i cant stop to feel guilty for what i said (even when i know i have a good reason to be angry), i know that she cheated on me and him (i feel really bad for him too) but even with that in mind i cant hate her.

So in brief, i broke up with her and now i feel really guilty for what i said to her when i was angry and for what i did to her ""BF"". Even when she lied to me, i feel bad for causing her pain, now i feel like the weakest and most pathetic man on the planet, i dont want to be with her anymore, everithing is over now but still feels bad for her and him .

I wished to be one of those people who don't care about what others feel, someone who don't care about nobody but that's not me.

My feelings now are: guilty, hate of myself, i feel pathetic, naive and stupid

My boyfriend ,let’s call him P, lies to me too much. We have been together for one year since a couple days ago. He treats me pretty well. He’s always available for me. He takes care of me. Listens to my mental breakdowns. Caters to me. From everyone 
else’s perspective he’s the model boyfriend. 

But trust has been a problem in our relationship from the start. At the beginning of our relationship, I asked him if he was sexually involved with anyone on campus. He told me no and that his last relationship was 3 years long with a girl from his home country. I initially saw this as a green flag because I saw it as he can commit to long term relationships and that he was a relationship person like me. About a week later a girl messaged me on instagram saying that she got *intimate* with P a week ago. When we had been getting really close for the last 2 weeks. This immediately made my heart drop because I didn’t know of his involvement with any other women and we had also been getting closer. So before 100% trusting this girl that messaged me, I asked him to be honest with me about his history. I asked him why a girl was telling me that they were just messing around together. He told me that they only messed around once after a party and that he didn’t speak with her much after that. So he was also confused. I was so annoyed by this whole situation because why say you’re not sexually actively when you are. I don’t care for body counts, but I like to be safe and know a little history of the people I am getting close to. He apologized about not being honest about his past. He said he was ashamed to reveal those things and didn’t want me to think of him differently. I accepted the apology and moved on. Especially because we weren’t official at this point. 

We became official a month later. And everything felt perfect. I felt so in love. 

Then we had to go long distance because of winter break. We FaceTime and texted frequently and everything seemed okay. UNTIL we came back to school. I realized that he had so many “thirst trappy” pictures in his phone that I had never seen. I mean he can take pictures without sending them to me but he always did. So I got suspicious and decided to check some of his Snapchat messages with random girls I didn’t know about. I saw him calling girls “sexy”, “baby”, all the words that he used for me. This was the first time my heart broke. I confronted him. At first he tried to act confused and say “I can’t send picture like this?, it’s not like anything is showing”. It wasn’t only the pictures the disturbed me but the pet names he was giving these girls. I found out they were girls from his home country that he still continued to flirt with. I was speechless and felt lost. He promised never to contact those girls again. That he won’t ever do it again. He removed them from his Snapchat and I thought maybe we can fix this. 

Then a few months later, I found out that his “girl best friend” from back home was actually his ex. I was so pissed off because I trusted him to have a girl best friend because I have guy friends from high school that are really like my brothers. He used to take Snapchat videos of me saying “ hiii [ex’s name]” to his girl bestie bc I wanted to be friendly with all his friends. I always asked about her wellbeing and even encouraged them to rekindle after they got in an argument. Just to find out it was another ex of his! Not only did he not have one ex of 3 years like he claimed, I had found a note in his note app, apologizing to his girl bestie/ex #2* for cheating on her. I was so sick to my stomach. He acted like it wasn’t serious. He even had the audacity to say “oooh noo she found out” in a mocking voice. I let it slide because I just assumed that they were ex-to-friends and I never read their messages together. And that was until I read their messages together a couple weeks before he went back to his hometown. He spoke about all the sexual things he wanted to do to her when he got back. Asking for her to be ready. I wanted to vomit. This really was the last straw. I can take light flirting, but PLANS TO PHYSICALLY CHEAT! I tried to leave him, but he would leave me alone. We had a heartfelt conversation about our relationship and what I wanted it to be. We cried together. And I thought maybe this was needed to make the relationship serious. 

Since that day, there have been a few hiccups like him kissing a girl on the cheek when he went back home (apparently she wouldn’t leave his car if he didn’t). Texting friends to look for “easy” girls to fuck (supposedly he was helping his friend look for girls). Getting close and friendly with girls and deleting the messages. 

The current issue is that I’ve told him repeatedly not to delete messages from girls he texts bc I don’t care that he has female friends, it’s the hiding them from me that makes it weird and suspicious. Last night, I had a surge of anxiety about trust and saw he has deleted messages from someone named John. My boyfriend doesn’t know a John and in the messages he referred to “John” as “queen”, so I knew it was a cover. I did a quick search and found out it was a girl he used to mess with before he met me. He always assured me he never got intimate with her because he met me before they got closer. But every so often she pops up asking to meet up. I don’t care that she texts him and wants to meet. I am more concerned that my boyfriend felt the need to hide her identity. I confronted him without disclosing that I knew who John was. He kept claiming that John was a male high school friend from back home who wanted to meet him because he was in the area. The fact that he could quickly come up with a lie with no guilt and shame has completely changed the way I see him. He refused to admit he was lying and stuck with his John excuse. I finally told him I knew who it was and how. He continue to deny saying I got my details wrong. Then he finally admitted it and said he didn’t feel the need to tell me because there was nothing going on there. 

I really don’t know what to do with him anymore. I love him and what he has done for me. But I cannot trust him anymore. 
After writing all this, I can’t believe I still fear losing him. :/ any advice?

She also keeps calling me kid, I've asked her to stop she always says it ""just slipped her mind"".  She also keeps bringing up topics that I don't think should be brought up at work. For example she keeps bringing up elections and anti-abortion topics I shut that down quickly but she keep trying to bring it up again saying things like "" I'm not trying to offend anyone,"" ""I'm just making conversation"" I told her that I just don't think it's a work topic especially as we are busy with holiday work and need to focus.

(Although I'm looking at therapy)
I'll try to make this concise.
I was adopted as an infant and for the first 8 years I was an only child, but I really wanted a sister.  So we ended up adopting a girl slightly younger than me.
We welcomed her with open arms, but she made it clear from day one she did NOT want to be part of our family.  To be fair, She had a rough start and we were far from perfect.  But the emotional abuse she heaped on us during the 25+ years she's been in our lives has dissolved any sympathy I ever had for her.  (And if you'd like examples, I shall provide). In fact, she's one of the reasons I decided to move two states away a year after college.  A few years later, my parents moved to an hour and a half north of me for similar reasons.
For the first time, I felt like I was finally free from her. I would maybe see her once every couple of years when we were simultaneously visiting my parents, but I could handle that.  And I thought there was no way she'd follow us here. That would mean leaving her son behind because her first baby daddy (She has two children, both with different fathers) would never give her full custody of their son to move out of state.
Cut to about 3 months ago, she did exactly what I thought she wouldn't do and left her son behind to move out of state along with her current baby daddy and their daughter.  They moved to about 3 hours away from my parents.
Obviously, I wasn't thrilled about that. But I still figured that 3 hours was so far enough away that she wouldn't be there every visit.
Cut to a month ago, her new plan is now to move 30 MINUTES away from my parents.  Along with her undisciplined daughter and drug addict baby daddy.  So now I'm facing the prospect of her being able to barge in anytime I'm visiting my parents as well as seeing her for every holiday.
I don't know how to handle this. I love my parents, so I can't just say ""if she's there I won't be."". I don't want to force them into an impossible place where they have to choose between us
In my more clear-headed moments, I tried to convince myself that I can put up with her for my parents sake
But more often the thought of having to play nice with this toxic person on a regular basis again makes me sick to my stomach.  I've already had a couple of emotional breakdowns over it and it just feels so unfair.  I mean I moved 11 hours away to escape this a****** and she's followed me like some kind of curse.

So long story short me (20M) and my gf (18F) have been having a troubled relationship. Not gonna go into details on all the negative stuff but today is what hit me. Basically I complimented her (like always) on how she looked and she always does this “overreaction” like yelp because she says she really likes me and etc. She says she’s nervous when I call her and stuff but I feel like it’s a high over exaggeration. Last night I complimented her and she did it but then calmed down and said “lemme calm down it’s just **my name** ” and I instantly got turned off and became silent. This is a girl ik likes attention, idk if I’m overreacting but it hit me and it’s like does she take me for granted? She has many times said hurtful stuff, such as straight up asking me what i would do if she left me for a white guy, then proceeded to talk about the last person she talked to without me even asking. She admits liking attention and has narcissistic traits and I try to deal my best but sometimes it’s too obvious. Does she want to hear compliments from people more “valuable” then me or from ppl like her favorite rappers since maybe I compliment her to much or she doesn’t need that reassurance from me anymore? She also has a history of making me jealous and etc, with bringing up her fav rapper tryna make me jealous or once brought up sexual memories she had with someone else to rub it in my face. this just happened not too long ago and I’m feeling done. She tried to say it was because she talks to me everyday and shouldn’t be nervous but this is not the first or second or third time she said some shit that affected me and made me feel like she isn’t treating me good. In my opinion the people. You truely value the most and love their compliments and blessings should be the most. I don’t say “it’s just my mom” when she does stuff for me. It was last night and I’m still thinking if I overreacting but the situation is just weird with everything else that happened before. 

TLDR: Girl I’m talking to said “it’s just **my name**” when I complimented her on how she looks after she overreacted by yelling a little and acting nervous and I feel like crap. I feel devalued and taken for granted. Has history of making me jealous and has narcissistic traits.

He’s a single father of 3, and the mother had passed away a month before we met. I know… we got together too soon. We had been together for 6 months and he moved in with me at the end of August (almost 4 months in). I honestly didn’t want to rush moving in, but he made some valid points about it and we were already staying together every day. The reason I gave up was because in the short time we were together, he had VERY insecure and jealous moments. His previous relationship wasn’t the best and she cheated on him, but they had kids and stayed together. I felt like he was taking out his fears on me. I never gave him a reason to be that way with me. Out of 6 months, he had 4-5 different times where he was either jealous of small stuff or insecure and I had to reassure him constantly. Out of the short time we lived together, he threatened to move out 3 times and this time I let him. This time that led to the break-up was because someone commented I was beautiful on a picture. I never met the person nor really know them (I have 3000 Facebook friends). He flipped out and didn’t communicate it with me. Then lashed out and said I should be with a “college boy” (his way of saying someone educated from college like me). I couldn’t take anymore of that, so I didn’t stop him from moving out. I feel bad because he has 3 girls and I got close to them and he rented out his house to live with me. So now he’s staying in a camper on his mom’s property and his daughters are with his mom. I love him, but I started to see unhealthy behaviors that I asked him to work on, but he didn’t. He’s overall a good man, but his jealousy and insecurities are cumbersome and tiring. I feel like we are in different places, but we were best friends. Of course, he regrets it now and wants me to try again. I said it would take a lot for me to do that.

I dropped her up to her house and she said something along the lines of “thank you for this , you’re such a protective guy” and she leaned into to kiss me so I just backed away and told her that she’s drunk and should get some rest.

They think people with anxiety are just annoying and immature. They think people with bipolar or BPD are abusive and actively choose not to control their emotions (FYI, I've never abused anyone due these issues. If it gets too much, I leave the room to calm down). Unless the person is completely non-verbal, they think an autistic meltdown due to sensory overload is just a childish tantrum. I have been medically diagnosed (properly, over a period of 4ish years), I didn't just take an online quiz. Its very real and I do get overloaded sometimes. When that happens, I do get quite upset (havent had a tantrum since I was a teenager), but I leave the area and go somewhere quiet.
