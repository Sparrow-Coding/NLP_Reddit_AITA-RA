We are dating for the last 11 months now and more than 8 months of that was LDR. first, we met in SK then he needed to go back to the US, and that's how we started a long-distance relationship. During this time my Bf visited me once in SK and once in my home country, which was so sweet. Also, he is planning to move to SK to live with me and leave his work next year. But it's not all a selfless decision for him, he also wants to live abroad. But the problem is we have 16 hours of the time difference, and I do 2 part-time jobs while doing my master's degree in South Korea which is not my homeland. Because of that, I don't have any days offs during the week, and trying to live all by myself here alone makes me crazy busy.  Meanwhile, my American bf who works 12 hours 3 to 4 days a week is pretty busy too. One of my part-time jobs where I work 3 days a week doesn't allow me to use a phone. So literally we have only an hour and a half a day to text or communicate when I'm on the bus, but my boyfriend spends that time playing video games instead of spending quality time together. other 4 days of a week he works, and his work also doesn't allow phones at all, so we just go in silence except for calling mornings for him while he drives to work which is a night for me. But lately, I feel like he doesn't engage in that short amount of conversation too. it keeps going like that and now it turns out that we don't have much to talk so just go in silence frequently. Even though he validates how much he loves me and how appreciates me, I still feel like he is bored with me, and he is not happy as before around me. I complained about it A LOT before and every time I mad at him because of it he just says sorry, and he will do better in the future and promised me that he will give me a little more attention. but he still does that after 4 or 5 times of me complaining over and over again in the last 11 months. He tells me that he misses me a lot and thinks about me during the day a lot but why doesn't he text me for that only hour and a half? He is really a sweet talker, at first whenever he explains the logic of the situation I gave all the fault to me and felt guilty that I'm being too dramatic. but now it begins that his words sound empty and fake. Should I end this relationship before he does such a big decision in his life? Also, my BF has never had a girlfriend before so does he just can't understand that he doesn't care about me that much?

Lastly, I apologize if my letter is hard to follow or if I chose the wrong words. I'm not a native English speaker at all, and I have never been to native speaking country too. so, hope you guys can understand that. Also, I really need your opinion.

Just when I think I'm over this pesky crush, it comes back. She and I bartend together. A few things that have happened:

* We see each other regularly outside of work at the gym. We often plan on going together as gym buddies.
* I've confessed how I feel to her. We were drinking after hours at the bar, just the two of us. I told her I had an embarassing crush on her. She said ""Don't be embarassed."" But she sure didn't say ""oh cool, me too!"" which pretty obviously translates to ""I don't like you that way.""
* She's told me she's into one of our other coworkers. They've hung out, they flirt at work.
* I feel compelled to engage with her at work. We happily chat about our lives. She fascinates me.
* On good days, I hold it loosely. This is a person I think is cool, but is just another person. It's nice that she's in my life.
* On bad days, I imagine being with her, I find her endearing and attractive as fuck, and I crave her attention. I start to feel more desperate.
* Other coworkers have remarked that there's clearly some connection between the two of us. We chat easily, we get along well, she seems to like my company. It's not the same though as how she acts toward the coworker she's into. I see her flirt with him, and seek him out in a way she doesn't with me.

I want two things, simultaneously. I want to be free of her, and I want closeness with her. It's completely illogical. I'm fully aware, as a 37 year old man, that if she REALLY was interested, she'd make that known, either explicitly or through actions.

So the question is - what do I do with this? I thought confessing these things would be the ticket. Feeling that non-reciprocation would help me to move on. It did work at first. But then we spend time together at work, or at the gym. We chat, we get along easily, and she laughs with me, she lights up with me, we make fun of each other. I delight in asking her about her life. That's what intimacy is to me. And that feels fine in the moment! Just a delightful exchange with someone I've got a fondness for. But then my mind takes over, my longing fires back up again, and I'm frustrated and ashamed and attracted once more. I imagine inviting her over to my place, since we chat together so easily when we hang out at or after work. But the energy isn't quite right for that and again, I've seen how she acts when she likes someone (the other coworker). That's not how she is with me.

TL;DR - I've got feelings for my 13-years-younger coworker. Though she likes spending time with me, she does not reciprocate my feelings.

One of my dearest friends have a tendency to boss me around and criticize me a lot.
For context I (21F) have ADHD and my friend (22F) has OCD. Our interactions are mainly she telling me what to do. Sometimes is for good reasons like hygiene (I shower but I forget to clean my nails or brush my hair stuff like that) so she kinda calls me on that. Or my makeup skills, she says they are bad. She always tells me what to do, even what to wear sometimes, not in the best way. I appreciate her being honest tho.
Likewise, when I’m hype (like excited about something) she tells me to calm down or shut up. She also tells me to calm down when I’m chill and she is the one that is actually anxious. A lot of people have noticed this and have also admitted that I’m the calmest of the bunch.
She often tells me to hurry up, or screams at me but we all have to wait for her if she is doing her makeup. 
Or like today, we were doing homework together and said two words: and she was like shut up you both when she talked for about 10 minutes prior to us.

Likewise, when I’m telling her something like my problems, or even fondest memories or whatever she interrupts me or says something like shut up or stop or hurry up. I’ve stopped telling her stuff about myself because of it.
She judges me when I tell her what makes me sad but if the same happens to her we have to be compassionate 
We always hang out whenever and wherever she wants to hangout but no one goes with me to the stuff I want to go (she would cancel last minute and then get mad if I can’t make it to her plans)
Last time I tried talking to her she got mad and told me that we weren’t in a relationship and that I should stop the drama.
I really lover her, even when she tells me that I stink or calls me out when I’m awake at 3am in the morning because although it hurts I know she will always be honest to me and she does this because she cares about me. Or that’s what she says. I don’t know what to do, how should I approach her or talk to her about it or maybe simply just stop being her friend (although I’m too attached)

We met online and we were fwb for a year before deciding to start to date. We were exclusively talking for a few weeks before we made it official. He had come over to my house when we just started dating and logged in on a game on my PC and forgot to log out. 

I opened up the game to play and saw it still logged in. I went to the web browser to log out of it then me being curious looked at his pms. I then saw all these messages to random / friended people that he was flirting with during the time we were “exclusive”. This obviously pissed me off so we had a conversation about it and I decided to forgive him bc I wanted to believe he wouldn’t do it again and he said he unadded them. 

Then a couple days ago I find out he still is talking to his ex and other girls he talked to at one point on Snapchat. 

This happened when he was at my apartment he got off of Snapchat really quick and went to YouTube and I asked him why he was trying to hide it from me. It didn’t help that I was already a little paranoid from the previous stuff. He told me it was a friend that he messaged but then we got to talking and he told me he still snapchats his ex and girls he talked to before. This obviously turned into an argument bc he didn’t see a problem with “just sending pics” to ex’s or girls he used to talk to. Which I can get just sending streaks and it really not meaning anything. He again said he “unadded” those people and it’s not a problem for him. It just makes me feel like he is still trying to entertain other options while dating me. 

I just for some reason have a feeling that he’s always trying to hide stuff from me. While he’s always texting me throughout the day and always wants to be around me but I can’t get past this. I don’t want to be a bitch after saying everything was okay and cut it off. And I still care about him. But I also don’t want to screw myself over by letting him think doing that to someone is okay. Starting a new relationship on rocky ground has been hard but I don’t know if it’s because I genuinely like being with him or he’s just love bombing me. I’m honestly just torn and I wanted an unbiased opinion that isn’t friends or family. Any advice helps lmao.

Hi! This is my first post on Reddit but I honestly don’t know where else to go with this question lmao English isn’t my first language and I haven’t practiced it in forever so sorry for any mistakes! 

My boyfriend [29, M] and I [25, M] recently split up after nearly 3 years together. I found evidence of him talking to another girl and he admitted that they’ve kissed and he fell in love with her a couple of months before that. We broke up after that. It wasn’t that I dumped him, he actually dumped me after I told him I knew about a girl saying that he needs someone with more shared interests…

We had a good talk after the breakup actually, he talked how he wants some time alone (meaning he is not going to date another girl right now), but he also asked if I was willing to continue sleeping with him even (!) if he and I both got into monogamous relationship with other people. That was a very strange question tbh and I said I don’t know how to answer that. 

We had sex the very next day after the break up and continued doing so almost every day. I moved out of the flat that we recently renovated together. Now sex happens regularly a couple times a week, he visits my new place and stays the night, I visit his place and stay the night. 

I do really love having sex with him, he is the best partner I have ever had. He continued asking me if I would sleep with him if I got in a new monogamous relationship, I continued saying that I don’t know how to answer that. 

The catch is: he started dating this new girl three days after our break up, it is not a secret, he admitted it to me almost immediately. He is in a monogamous relationship now and the girl does not know that we are still sleeping, so if we are talking terms, yes, he is cheating on a girl with me, that he ruined our relationship for lmao

It’s been going for a little over two months and he has had a couple of doubting episodes when he told me “I think we shouldn’t do it anymore” but usually 30 minutes later he tells me that I am the sexiest woman alive and starts touching me. 

While drunk he has made a couple of comments about my body being the most beautiful body he had ever seen while his new gf is chubbier and it is hard for him to get used to it. Or a comment about how compatible we are in sex but his gf doesn’t like the stuff that he is into. 

For the first month of these shenanigans, i was never an initiator of sex, I wanted him to show me that I am wanted but later I started dirty texting him first and once he told me that it made him uncomfortable because he is in a relationship (so it’s okay if he does it, but if i do it, “it’s not right” lol). 

I know for a fact that he hasn’t told about us still sleeping to anyone, not even to his closest friends. I have told to a couple of my girls (with his permission), but of course it’s not public information. 

A funny fact is that he asks me not to use the term “cheating” as it makes him uncomfortable haha 

My therapist knows the whole story and she made me answer what has changed in our lives with the breakup and I realised that actually nothing did except the status: he kisses me, he holds my hand, he takes me on dates, he tells me he loves me every day..

I really do like him as a man and I love him altogether (we constantly called each other family when we were still in a relationship), he is the closest friend to me. I don’t think that I just want the relationship back (i don’t trust a cheater) but I do want him to admit that he likes me as a woman. 

Some points I think are important to make:
1. Our relationship never was traditional. We slept the first night we met and we continued just hooking up without relationship for a couple of months, but covid happened and we started isolating together and later I moved in his place officially and some more time later we started officially dating. 

2. Even after we started being official we still had open relationship. He did not sleep with anyone new and neither did I but it was an option that we both had.

3. Later he liked to mention (as a JOKE, he always added that) how I made him close the relationship, how I made other girls be scared of me so he wasn’t as popular with girls as he was before. Whenever I argued that I never made him do anything (I really didn’t, I said “you know with us having open relationship, I don’t think I would want you to meet my parents again in the future, it is a serious thing for me and I don’t want my parents to get used to a boyfriend that i am not sure in” - and he said that he was ready to become monogamous with me) he always responded with “I was just joking”. 
—


My question is: do you think this thing has any sort of future? I am not talking about kids and family, I am not like that and neither is he, but I do love stability, I love being sure in the next day and with my now ex boyfriend being a man-child it is quiet hard. Do I just call it all off and try to forget the closest most important person in my life? Do I talk to him? 


P.S. I don’t feel sorry for the new girl because she was the one talking to a taken man (and she knew me personally, we have a lot of mutual friends), I have thought about just texting and telling her that her new man is a cheater from day 1 but for some reason I don’t think it’s right (and it’s not going to get me my relationship with the man back either).",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604226,public,self,My recent ex cheats on his new gf with me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0t1cj/my_recent_ex_cheats_on_his_new_gf_with_me/,all_ads,6,

Yes, my skin is pale, and I am also mixed race. My mother is Polish / Italian and my father is Black / Spanish / European. 
I regularly have people ask me what I am mixed with, with no prior conversation of race involved.


I did not respond or reply to the girls when they said this because I felt baited (in a way) to  defend myself for being mixed, and because I *do* have pale skin, my color *is* white.


But, I identify with being more than white, and it is important for me not to erase my family background by interchanging my color and race. I feel like I am not being true to myself by not correcting them. 


I am uncomfortable that they would bring up race in the first place and put a label on me without knowing me. (Although it may not have been their intention). I grew up with family and friends of all different shades and have never related two people together just by the color of their skin. 


I’m not sure how to navigate this gracefully, and not sure if I’m overreacting. If I was relating two girls I would just use hair color or build as an example, and leave skin tone out of it, or maybe say “fair skinned”.

K had recently broken up with her boyfriend, and he was pretty insistent on going back. Long story short, she came back with him during a trip with K's friendgroup—just for a couple of weeks, then they broke up.

As hurt as I was for that, the worst part came after. See, we had a lot of friends in common (the group), and after things got awkward between K and me, they stopped inviting me to parties and meet-ups on K's request, ate lunch alone for a while, and had to stick with other (problematic to work with) people for group projects. Things got pretty lonely pretty quick.

I felt like K had stabbed me in the back for her own comfort, and didn't thought of the repercutions of doing that at 19 yo.

For almost a year I had one of the worst depressions I've experienced, and blamed her (in part) for it. Fortunately, I went through it with the help of some new and old friends, my family, and, of course, some good old therapy. Now things are like water under the bridge for the group, K and me—we even *kind of* talked things out (K &amp; me).

We graduate next semester (3 years after that event), and I've hanged out more with them during this one. Because of this, feelings for K are coming up again, and I've considered asking her out (we're both single), but I don't know if it's a gut feeling or just my insecurities talking, that this may be a bad move. 

On one hand, I think that I'm very young and there are plenty of girls out there that I should try and meet instead of ""going back"" with someone I already have had an negative experience with. On the other, I don't see it as apocalyptic just dating for a while, get to know her and see if that leads somewhere worth working on.

Would really appreciate some advice, should I date her? How should I approach that topic with her if we do date and it comes up?

The relationship is still pretty new but we get along so well, he’s so respectful and sweet to me and is just overall a giant walking green flag. He also pursued me first and is always showing his affection for me.

Just last weekend he came to me and told me that he thinks we might need to break up. I won’t go into too much detail, but basically something bad happened in his family recently that requires all of his attention for the time being. He told me he just doesn’t have the time right now to focus on me, and that he’s not confident he can continue being a good boyfriend at the moment. He told me all of this while crying and apologizing and said if this thing never happened he would never think about breaking up. 

(side note: we do live about an hour away from each other so we can only meet during the weekends since his work schedule is pretty irregular and it’s hard for him to make plans to meet during the week..but because this happened now even his weekends will be busy which means it’ll be hard to meet for a while)

I tried to tell him that I wanna be there for him (he’s not the type to rely on others and just bottles everything inside), and that he can focus on his family for the time being and that I can wait for him but I don’t think we should break up. He even said that whenever all of this blows over he would probably wanna date me again when he has the time and freedom to focus on me again, but he just doesn’t know how long that will take (he said it could take months) and that’d he’d feel too sorry to me if we continued to date officially and I was just “waiting” for him. But for me, if he wants to try and get back together after everything blows over, what’s even the point of breaking up? I know he’s trying to be selfless for me but I want to be there for him when he’s having a hard time, I don’t want him to go through this alone. I don’t mind not meeting as often or contacting e/o as often because I’m also busy with university, but I still wanna be there for him.

I know we haven’t been together for that long and some people might think it’s not that serious yet for me to be waiting for this guy or taking a break already, but I really really like him and I know he likes me, and I just think it would be such a waste to end things like this because of something outside of our control when our rs itself is so good and healthy.

She also said that she wants to marry some other guy she met over the summer and he doesn’t even want to be with her.

He enrolled in college after graduating high school but dropped out after one year. He now sleeps in until 3pm every day, spends each day in his room, lying in bed, playing games until 5am and talking to people he’s met over the internet. Although he has interviewed for maybe a few jobs in the past year, he's apparently has never been successful. His reasoning for dropping out of college was that ‘college is useless and teaches you nothing’ and that 'he could still be successful without a college degree' yet it’s been 4 years since high school and he has done nothing. When my parents raise this issue with him, he shuts down and tells them to stop getting on his case, that it 'takes time for some people to find their path' and that he’s ‘learning about running a business’. This is if he isn’t responding to my parents in monosyllabic grunts (which is most of the time).

He believes that everything comes easy and that opportunities will fall right into his lap without having to work for them. He’s talked about not wanting to work a 9 to 5 and how there’s people who become billionaires without going to college, but fails to consider just how little people actually manage to accomplish this and just how much work they put in. He also talks about how he's heard from people online that getting into the Ivy Leagues (Harvard, Yale etc.) 'actually isn't that hard' and 'if only he'd applied, he'd have gotten in'. Never mind the fact that he dropped out of college after a year. After he dropped out he started talking about going to college overseas, completely disregarding the fact that my parents would have to fund every cent of his tuition and living expenses since he doesn't work, which is money that they don't have. But being the eldest son, my parents would do anythingt to make him happy so they agreed to fund him if he made it in. He didn't, due to the fact that never even put in the effort to apply.

Now I want to say that he’s always been a very introverted, shy person and has trouble communicating with people. I suspect that he was bullied in high school (my parents asked but he wouldn't tell them anything) and probably has some self esteem issues as well as social anxiety. He also has some developmental delays from childhood where he started reading and speaking later than the other kids, that make me suspect autism. He is also non-communicative with my family. Whenever asked a question, he responds with a grunt, or mumbles something under his breath that we can't hear. He also is not very physically fit - though not particularly overweight, he is very weak and can't make it very far without being out of breath, and also has trouble holding things as he has shaky hands.

I'm mentioning this because, as a result of his poor social skills and physical problems, my parents coddle him. They give him an allowance of $50 a week which he uses on UberEats and spends on games. They used to encourage him to apply for jobs or think about going back to college but have stopped, because he either completely ignores them or responds with an argument about how 'they're being too harsh on him' and that 'they bring up the same thing every time'. I think they're also afraid of coming off too overbearing the more they pester him, which would distance him from them even more. They also believe, due to his timid and shy personality, that it's justified that he'll never be able to live normally or get a job. They would never consider cutting him off as he has no life skills, no friends to crash with, and are worried that he might spiral or commit suicide if he has no one to rely on. He's also recently been showing some concerning behaviours - he's been wandering around the neighbourhood late at night, refuses to answer my parents' phone calls and last week I caught him leaving his room to pee in the yard where neighbours could see (he outright denied this when questioned about it).

We've recently learned that he's been seeing our family doctor in regards to his mental health and anxiety, but I honestly don't think a general practitioner is best-equipped to provide thorough counselling. My parents went to see the doctor along with my brother, who diagnosed him with anxiety and prescribed him anxiety medication but didn't refer him to a psychologist. I expressed to my parents that I think he really should be seeing a psychologist or a psychiatrist to discuss his self-esteem issues, and possibly address the concerning behaviours he's exhibited recently. But they were happy for him to try out the medication and then see if he needs a psychologist, which I didn't agree with. I feel like they're are scared to acknowledge that he's mentally ill, and think that if they just coddle him some more and provide food, shelter, and a warm bed, that's all he needs to magically emerge from his depression (they constantly talk about how back in their day, they could never be sad if they had a roof over their heads and food to eat).

Partner (21F) and I (20M) broke up a little over a year ago because we were both scared of committing; and we eventually cut contact after a bit. We started talking again just as she was getting out of an emotionally and physically rough relationship. Fast forward several months, we've gone out several times but we aren't official. We both want something to work, but we're both finishing up school and trying to straighten out our own mental states. Right people, wrong timing. 

However, her sex drive is gone. It used to be there - we usually had sex two or three times a week while we were dating. But between the emotional state her ex inflicted and some other pre-existing health things, she simply doesn't want it. It disgusts her. We slept together once, when we first started going out again about a month ago - and it was really good; but every time I tried to initiate since, she would avoid it - until she eventually explained that it was something that made her feel gross.

This is a person I really care about and want a future with, but the fact that we aren't official makes it awkward for me to approach the topic of my needs. Everywhere else, we're compatible - but this is something that's important to me, and I have no idea if it's temporary or something I should prepare myself to deal with long term. It feels shitty, but I'm seriously considering letting this potential relationship go over this. I know it's not my trauma to appropriate; but it's starting to affect my own self esteem - it feels as if she doesn't find me attractive or desirable. Even when we are slightly physical, she gets antsy when I touch her. This is all new - things weren't like this before.

How do I approach this subject with her?

Full disclosure: I'm probably an asshole and you'll downvote this into oblivion.

I (29m) broke up with my girlfriend (33f) for a few reasons.

1. She is deeply in debt (student loans &amp; credit cards) and has no savings, retirement, or other. I grew up really poor, but worked super hard to reach a point of financial stability (flourishment, even.) The prospect of digging someone else out of debt and re-establishing their habits is legitimately daunting to me (if we got married some day, etc.). She has expressed sincere willingness to change, however, which means a lot to me.
2. I'm concerned about her mental stability a little. She's on various medications for depression, bipolar, etc. By and large her and her therapists have figured things out and she's stable. In the year we dated there were two episodes I had to help her out of (short, manic episodes of \~1-3 hrs of... mild freaking out (idk what else to call it)). Also every couple months she gets depressed for 4-6 days. I always did my best to be there for her and support her. It impacts her work and social life however, and it's something I'm not used to dealing with. From what I gathered, it runs in the family quite a bit, and there are some disturbing stories of women in her family really losing it. She is nowhere near that point.
3. If you didn't notice, we have a bit of an age gap. There is zero sign of problems now, but I'm worried in the future it could push her to want kids sooner than me etc.. Also I'm probably an asshole for even thinking like this, but since she's substantially ahead of me in age I'm worried I'll lose attraction to her early. I see guys dating girls 5+ years younger than them, and I can't help but do the math in my head a little on how this all plays out. Ya know what I mean?

On the positive side, our personalities meshed incredibly, we share the same sense of humor, our sexual chemistry is unlike anything I've ever known, and we rarely fought or anything. We were an amazing couple and had such a good run. Also, I think I love her. It's been 10 months since I broke up with her and she's tried dozens of times to get us back together, though I've held firm. I think about her multiple times everyday and consider getting back with her often.

We get home and we are talking about how a great night it was then I remember what his friend told me and I say your friend thinks your asexual and he doesn’t really say anything and I look at him and say are you asexual cause he looked guilty and he said not really. I asked what he meant by not really and he said he finds me beautiful and he doesn’t mind having sex with me to make me happy. I asked what about him and he said he doesn’t mind having it with me, but he doesn’t really see it as necessary and sex is just not really appealing to him like most people. I asked him if he was ever gonna tell me and he said that he really loved me and he didn’t mind having sex with me, if it meant  we were gonna be together and that he happy when am happy. So basically he wasn’t gonna tell me.

It kinda of make sense because he doesn’t ever initiate sex, and never really like me going down on him but also doesn’t make sense because we had a good sexlife. He always Prioritized me durning sex and I always finished and was satisfied so it hard looking back to those moments thinking he wasn’t as into it.

Can we really continue on as we are, wouldn’t it be selfish to continue being in a relationship and intimate even though I know he not enjoying.

We hit it off since we laid eyes on each other and started talking, texting and hanging out since. I developed feelings for him, he is everything I look for in a boyfriend. He treats me good, we talk on the phone, we text all the time, he is fun, he asks me to hangout, he finds the time to see me even if it’s just at my place to watch a tv show or a movie or to go to the gym to workout together. Sex with him is the best I’ve ever had, he has short and long term goals in life, he’s confident, tall and handsome and the most important thing, I can be myself around him. However, he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. I’ve made it clear to him how much I like him and care about him. I’ve been telling myself to just give him a bit more time and he’ll eventually ask me to be his gf but Idk if that’s ever gonna happen. He tells me he likes me a lot and that loves spending time with me. He’s given me all the signs to make me feel like we could be something else, but it’s just not happening and Idk why. 
When we started hanging out, everything worked out so organically and we clicked instantly that we never had that talk where we tell each other if we wanted something casual or if we were open for something more. I think that was a mistake and now I regret not having that talk with him since the beginning. I really want to straight up ask him if he wants a relationship with me or not but I’m so scared of doing it. I’m scared he’s gonna say no and I’m gonna lose what we have. I REALLY like this guy, I knew I wanted him as bf after the 3rd month. I know men and women think very differently and that’s why I wanted to give him more time and didn’t want to seem desperate wanting to be in a relationship with him so soon, but it’s almost been 6months now and I feel like I need to know if we are on the same page or not, that way I don’t waste my time with him and I know for sure I’d have to move on.
My question is, how do I approach this conversation with him? I don’t wanna just ask him “what are we?”. I want to make it clear that I want him for a serious relationship but I am gonna be okay if he doesn’t want anything serious. 
I’m a shy and introverted person, I come from a family that never talked about our feelings and avoided conflict at all costs so just by thinking about having this conversation with him gives me anxiety. I know I’d even have to be intoxicated in order for me to have the guts to bring it up cuz I know I just can’t do it sober. It’s just so hard for me, I’ve tried to have that conversation with him a few times now but I just overthink the situation and don’t end up doing it, I get very nervous. 
I would like to know from a guy’s perspective what he could possibly be thinking or be waiting for? 
I know I have to have this conversation with him, I just need help with how to do it. I’d love to be with him and losing him will crush me, but at the same time, I don’t want to waste my time. I’ve thought about doing it via text or phone call but I think it’s better to do it face to face, even when that gives me so much anxiety.

I’ve been having this problem where I consistently oversleep and sleep through alarms. It’s been chronic and I’ve been talking to my therapist about it. We had tickets to see a play on Saturday (free through my college, he was my plus one). We missed the train into Philly, and I offered to pay for an Uber. He suggested taking a bus instead but we were too late to make the bus and he’s had a habit of picking wrong bus lines and we get stranded in some not-so-great areas. 

We had more time then planned. I was going to have a granola bar, but my boyfriend insisted I eat something real. He waited outside the check-in area and I told him I’d text him when I’m wrapping up. 

7 minutes later he steps by the checker side and starts staring at me. He doesn’t text or call or respond to my texts. I call him and he already called the Uber. I have to throw away my food and leave.

So I’m a little pissy. I don’t say anything outright mean, but I definitely have a short tone and tell him how I’m feeling. 

We delay the conversation until we eat after the play so we don’t subject the driver to our arguing. At the restaurant, I say that I wish he had communicated with me. He says that I am entirely at fault for everything because of my perception of his actions. I ask him if he really means it and he doubles down.

We took a break and revisited the subject and now he’s saying he never said that I was entirely at fault and that I’m not remembering correctly.

He has a habit of stuff like this. Last week I was in a play and I asked him what he thought of it and he told me “comedy was not my thing.” When I said that the role really wasn’t comedic, he said that was only because my delivery was wrong. I got upset and started crying. He said it was my fault for asking him what he thought and made me apologize to him.

My partner and I have been together for 1.5 years. Ever since we’ve been together I knew that they smoked marijuana, legal in our country. They used to smoke everyday, multiple times a day as a coping mechanism to escape depression, anxiety, past traumas, and day to day stressors (their words). I have been known to partake from time to time, maybe once or twice a year, so I don’t have a problem with marijuana use. However, I don’t like how often my partner is using their marijuana. 

This has been an ongoing conversation between us since we started dating. I let them know that I don’t like how much they smoke because of health reasons (in addition to lung cancer and everything else that comes with general smoking my partner also has asthma). They agreed that they smoke a lot and were willing to cut back, even went as far as saying that they recognize the unhealthy behaviour of using it as a crutch and wants to stop. Everything seemed to be going well with their use and eventually we moved in together. 

While living together for about the first six months my partner never really partook (maybe once or twice with family on weekends) but it was pretty mundane. Then they started smoking more, at least once a week if not more on weekends. I communicated my concerns, general health, slipping back into unhealthy coping mechanisms, and how I felt being around them while they’re high. TW***About three years before I met my partner I was the victim of a sexual assault at a house party. I’ve done a lot of work with my therapist to work through this trauma and wouldn’t be with partner if it wasn’t for that work. One of the things that has changed for me since the assault is my feelings being and being around people who are not sober. I don’t feel safe. I would like to emphasize that it’s not my partner that makes me feel unsafe when they’re high, it’s more like I don’t feel like I have my security person with me anymore. They can no longer lookout for me because they’re not sober enough to do so, so I feel alone and unprotected if something were to happen. It’s also important to point out that my partner generally smokes and stays at home, so it’s not like I’m in a situation where it’s likely I’ll need actual help, but that’s PTSD.*** They agreed to once again cutback and then the next week put me in a public situation where I felt pressured to drive them and their family member to the dispensary. They proceeded to smoke knowing how I felt, what I’ve been through, and then we had to continue to the movie (while they were high and I was the only one sober) we were going to see as the three of us had already bought tickets. This was my breaking point. When we got home I absolutely broke down. They said they were sorry for putting me in that position and would stop all together, going as far as saying they would get rid of everything. 

The next few weeks went by and they brought up how they wanted to smoke with their family member. I told them that they still haven’t gotten rid of their paraphernalia and I feel vilified for stepping in between their good time with family for my concerns (said between breaking down again) even though they said they wanted to quit too. They went and broke their bongs in a garbage bag immediately after this discussion, I don’t know what they did with the marijuana. This was 100% their own idea, I didn’t think they needed to be broken, if anything sold or given to family. 

They stopped smoking for about 4 months after this, saying how much better they felt physically and how happy they were that they felt like they didn’t need marijuana to decompress after stress. I was so proud of them. Recently they’ve taken it up again, albeit maybe once or twice a month a this point. 

Yesterday my partner told me that during our first few months together they didn’t actually cut back at all with marijuana, they would only not smoke it around me (I usually went to their place Friday-Sunday night) but they would continue to smoke it all work week. I was surprised to hear this and they said they only told me now because they know I won’t think any differently of them for it being how committed we are to each other. 

We recently moved into a new environment and this week my partner has gotten high three times, much more consistent around me than I have ever seen (we had the same discussion these times as well). Tonight they went to go for a fourth session when I expressed my concerns again. I told them when they smoke I not only worry for their health but that I feel alone and like how I feel is less important than their high. I told them I am tired of having to repeat myself or break down trying to get them to hear me, we’ve had this conversation so many times. I told them that I’m giving up on this conversation as I’m sad, tired, and disappointed. I don’t want to fight anymore even if it means I’m uncomfortable. I told them that they can do whatever they wanted but I was going to go relax before bed. They said that I was setting them up for failure because if they did smoke, even if I said it was their choice, I would still be upset with them. In the end they decided not to smoke tonight. 

Reddit I don’t know what to do. I love them so much and I know they love me. I am so tired of having to advocate for myself and my feelings with this only for them to agree with me and them back track with their actions. They’ve promised me so many times that they’ll give me space on this for my feelings and that they’ll cut back or give it up and it just doesn’t happen. I don’t mind if they smoke once in awhile, special occasions or a weekend a month or something like that. I just can’t get onboard with the consistency they smoke especially with their old addiction to it (their words), and with my PTSD. They said they understood and agree with this and we even made an action plan for how often they’ll smoke and giving me notice so I can mentally prepare. They just haven’t stuck to it in our whole relationship and I feel so alone. I know I have work on my end to get more comfortable with their use, I just don’t think that how I feel is being respected.

We’ve talked about them going to therapy for their own stressors and traumas, stopping the coping mechanism before it begins.

Then my husband explained it's normal in his family and she didn't mean anything bad. So I forgave.

I didn't mean it in a cruel or disgusting way, but I did mean it in a way that I implied having sex and romantic moments is a desired part of a romantic anniversary trip that they can't really have if their adult kid joins them.

My husband is now deeply offended. He says it's not normal to talk about family in this manner. The word divorce was mentioned many times.

My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost two years and are living together. My GF sometimes has trouble with feeling down, she says it happens randomly for no particular reason, and this feeling usually goes away in a few days. I’m not really familiar with this feeling myself, but i try and support her as best as I can and she says it’s helpful to her. 
The last few weeks she seemed down again. It could be because of seasonal changes, or that a few months ago we had a bit of a rough patch, but we’ve talked this through and know what he both can work on. The said that she’s been pondering this a lot, which might be why she started feeling a little blue and now spiraling into something bigger. I was not really worried before, and we can openly talk about everything. However, it’s been a few weeks now and her somberness does not seem to get better. Now she even says she doesn’t enjoy things the same way as she used to, like meeting with friends or going away for a weekend. Her emotions have overall flattened, including the feelings towards me. She’s afraid (and so am I) that this is not going to change. We both hope and think it’s the somberness talking, and that her true feelings are just temporarily buried somewhere. I am very confident in what we have, and we both still very much want to get old together. But I’m having a hard time too. 
I don’t want to loose her and I want to help her become her own, happy and loving self again. However, I’m not sure how to do this. We have agreed to talk to, and check in with each other a lot more, also when there are doubts. She’s also going to contact her GP to see if she could get some kind of extra help. Besides that, I’m not sure what else needs to change or what I can do more to help her. I want to take good care of her, and kind of rekindle our love by doing nice things together, but I also don’t want to overwhelm her. I need to be strong for her and make her feel secure with me, but this worrying is also making me feel bad, which is not good for either of us.

I m27 was seeing this girl f27 for about a month and a half since august, and everything was going great. we talked every day and met about 3 or 4 times a week. I thought she was perfect as we shared a lot of common interests and the same background.

I says she even initiated quite a few of our dates, even on our 3rd date she told me she wanted to be spontaneous so I should come over to her place to watch some cartoons and go to work from her place in the morning ( nothing happened besides kissing and cuddling).

I started catching feelings pretty quickly and wanted to ask her if she was seeing anyone else and if wanted to be exclusive, though she did show me her tinder account was deleted.

So one day after work I get myself a kebab with garlic sauce, she then texts me half an hour later to come over to her place so we can go for a walk in the park. At this point, i tried to kiss her but she tells me not cause of the garlic but we still go to the park and walk around. This entire time I'm acting off both nervous and closed up which is the opposite of how i usually was with her. She asks me multiple times what's wrong but I just tell her nothing and not to worry about it.

After the walk we decided to go get sushi and then I drop her off at home, I text her once I leave for home that today was great and are we still on for tomorrow for furniture shopping. She then replies back that she had a great time and likes spending time with me but only wants me as a friend. but we can still meet tomorrow.

The next day i ask her if we are still good for tomorrow and she says yes i then reply can we meet in the car park of the shopping center as need to tell her something. I wanted to tell her how i really feel, but she says no and ends up canceling telling me something feels off. i tried calling and texting her that it's honestly nothing just wanted to talk somewhere private but she doesn't reply. she later texts me saying sorry she should have seen my point of view but she was hurt in the past and we can have coffee Sunday.

During the next few days, I message her and try and talk to her and ask about her pets but get stiff replies, Sunday morning I ask if we are good and she tells me she needs to help her mum and cancels. i try to call her and cancels my calls and tells me not to call her anymore and goood luck. she then blocks my number.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. A few months ago I met another man and developed feelings for him. He is a LDS missionary who lives in the US. I live in Canada. 

I haven’t done anything inappropriate- not even flirting. I have also confessed to my boyfriend that I have feelings for this person. 

My boyfriend was a sweetheart about it, and says he understands that we were in a really bad place when I developed these feelings, and that it’s not in my control. He wants to work on things. I really believe things could truly improve in our relationship, and I think things are headed in a good direction….

EXCEPT…

I know my boyfriend loves me more than I love him. The thing that I am missing, is that gut feeling, that intuition that “this is the one I’m MEANT to be with.” 

I don’t know why, but I have that gut feeling towards this other man. I feel like he’s the one. I don’t have sexual thoughts about him, just emotional and spiritual. I have no idea how or if we could make it work to be together since we live in different countries. 

Do you really know intuitively when you’ve met the one? Is this intuitive feeling something I should ignore? Does this mean my boyfriend isn’t the one?

i really miss my ex but we have been super back and fourth


my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

it was bad bc we hadnt had sex in 2 months and just i felt pushed aside. 

we break up and well i beg and cry and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
“ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…” i beg cry and say all i did for him etc


then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me and missed the sex 

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building 

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels but said he would make it up to me

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety

i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later he
screenshots someone's story on instagram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz”

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text
im
scared” 

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

he comes back hours later and talks to some girl next to me. and i pass by and look at each other and wave and i leave",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604073,public,self,should i ask my ex out for coffee,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0shhb/should_i_ask_my_ex_out_for_coffee/,all_ads,6,

I’ve (25F) recently discovered that my ex (26M) has been sending cryptic messages professing his love for me despite having a gf. We were hs sweethearts and we mainly broke up because he wanted to, not me. 

We used to have these private social media accounts when we were 16 where we only knew about, no one else. When I was heart broken, I would post about my feelings on there, but I have not logged onto that account in over 7 years. 

About a month ago, I logged onto that account because I remembered a particular playlist that I had made on there and wanted to remember some of the songs I used to listen to. To my shock, I see my ex interacting with that account and even the old lovey-dovey posts about him and the ones I made when I was going through the breakup. This was a complete surprise to me, as I had known he has had a gf for years now. He also knows that I have a bf for a while now as well. 

He has mainly been posting about how much he loves me and never got over me. How he has a new gf, but it’s not the same. How much he regrets breaking up with me. How he wishes that we would cross paths again and that he loves me so much, the pain of not being with me makes him want to commit suicide. One of his posts even shows a picture of a gun with a caption alluding to suicide. Some of the posts even seem a bit delusional because he thinks that I might still have feelings for him. By the time stamps of the posts, this seems to have been going on for over a year now. This completely shocked me because we never really interact. I consider us to be friends on a respectable level, and would wish each other well in our life endeavors maybe once every couple years. I never had the inkling that it was any more than that based on our conversations. 

He has no clue that I know about these posts. In a way, he is shouting his feelings into the void. On the other hand, he is also doing it in a way where he hopes that I see these posts if I were to ever go back onto that dead social media platform again. 

I’m extremely conflicted. I want to tell the gf because if I were her, I would want to know. At the same time, I’m afraid that telling her would prompt him to actually commit suicide. I’ve lost a friend to suicide before, so I really want to avoid any possibility of that happening and I take it very seriously. I’m not sure what to do. So far, I haven’t done anything because I don’t know what to do. I’m also currently a medical student with finals coming up and going through my own health issues, so I’m not sure if I even have the capacity at this time to deal with any drama right now if it were to blow up.

I like him a lot and I want to try dating him. 
While who he is is a huge green flag: he’s thoughtful, sweet, honest, and loving. 
His life on the other hand concerns me. Or rather my lack of concern concerns me.

He’s been very upfront about where he is in life.
So his friends died 4 months ago and ever since he’s been in a slump of not doing much outside of smoking, sleeping, and hanging out with friends. He hasn’t worked since. 
But he wants to start working again and to quit smoking. 
But saying and doing are two different things.
He lives with his grandma and cousin I believe. His dad and brother are in prison.
He just seems very stuck and as much as I want to push him it’s not my place. I think apart of him is starting to realize it as when we try to plan to do things he doesn’t have gas money and much less date money.
He says things like “ I really need to get a job so I can come see you” which is sweet in my opinion.

I told him early on that I would support him and love him as long as he’s trying. 

My two concerns are this:

1. He doesn’t pick himself up within the next month.
I don’t want to change him or who he is. But I want out relationship to be more than just good morning and night texts. We can’t even hang out because I have strict but loving parents that want our first dates to be places nearby cities until I know him. (He’s an hour away) But we can’t even do that cause he can’t drive to me. But I know he can and will find a way as he has one time before where we spent the day together laying in bed talking and cuddling. It just puts us apart for long periods of time. I also don’t want to be with someone who isn’t living their life either. 
It feels like he’s just avoiding the world and his depression with weed.
But I already know that if something doesn’t change I’m going to have to move on. 

2. If my parents don’t like him. 
I’m trying to keep them as uninvolved as possible until I’m ready for them to be involved. 
One for his looks. He’s a scruffy stoner guy with two toned hair. He has black dots at the very top of his front teeth from what he shared was when he did hard drugs in high school. 
For me none of these things bother me tbh. I still think he’s very attractive and would choose him over and hottie that would walk through the door.
I’m worried my parents will judge him for this. I don’t want to do a makeover to hide these flaws because it’s not fair to him. But I feel like I no ay have to for him to be accepted.

I have shared on and off with my parents but the little I did share they did a deep dive on him and found Facebook pages one being a old satanic one. I scolded them for this Unrequested invasion of both his and mines privacy even though I knew they meant well. At that time I knew him for a week. But it also left a bad impression with them. I’m trying to be as upfront about him as I can be sharing these concerns with them also.


The reason they’ve been accepting this far is because when my dad met my mom he was in a very similar spot in life. A broke gangbanger with little to no motivation in life until he met my mom. They were in two very different spots in life. 

The only difference was he would always pick himself up as fast as possible and made sure he never went long without a job. (Also something my dad judges him for)

This is why despite his situation financially and physically the most important thing to me is who he is. None of these things play a factor in my mind because everyone’s life is different and we are all in different places.

I really want to believe that I could build something real with him.
But with it being so early on with so many flags these are things I’m forced to consider. When we have our first date soon we’ll make it “official”. This is also a conversation I’ll have with him then. If he thinks he can start his life back up again and if he can’t it’s ok but I can’t and won’t be there waiting.

So my question is do I look at all the red flags on the outside and am I ignoring to much or do I trust he is the man he says he is and that he will make the effort for me while improving his life like I feel he will?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604059,public,self,Do I judge him based on his life or who he is?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0sfxv/do_i_judge_him_based_on_his_life_or_who_he_is/,all_ads,6,

My 12f daughter Maddie, plays rec league basketball all year round and it’s pretty serious. She’s also really good so the wife and I splurge on extra coaching outside of regular team practices. 

6, sometimes 7, days out of the week, my family attends something basketball related whether it’s a tournament, game or practice.  The 13f, Kayleigh, and 8f, Sierra also have extracurricular activities like playing the trumpet (Kayleigh is in her school’s symphony) or young kids rec softball for Sierra but both admittedly aren’t that great at it. It’s hard shuttling the kids around to their respective activities, but we make due. If there’s a concert for Kayleigh’s symphony, my wife goes and takes the other kids while I take Maddie to basketball coaching or practice. Sometimes we have to skip out on Sierra’s practice for Maddie’s games. Sierra said it’s okay since she’s really not into softball that much anyways.

I have two younger brothers (30m and 36m). My youngest brother, Mike, has 2 young children (4m and 5f) and the middle, Craig, has none. I’m pretty close with my brothers. We have a 3-way call every week to catch up. Naturally, I talk about Maddie and how awesome she’s doing at league. I became really good friends with her teammates’ parents as well and it’s like they’re my second family. I like sharing all the things that happen during practice or the drama that’s happening between any parents and/or coaches because it is literally what I do all the time. Last week, I said something in passing about having an event (non-kid related) to go to on the weekend and how bummed I’ll be to miss Maddie’s first tournament game that day, and Mike asked more about the event and pretty much ignored my feelings about missing Maddie’s game. I said I don’t think the event itself really matters more than your niece. Mike said it’s not that he didn’t care about Maddie, but he wanted to know more about the event because I don’t really talk much about the things I do that isn’t dad-related. Craig agreed with Mike and also added that sometimes it would be nice to hear more about just basketball. They both pretty much laughed and joked about how I can give all the details on all the kids and parents in basketball, but give no details on some silly event I didn’t even care about but had to attend for work. That really set me off. I told them that of course I talk about basketball, I’m doing something basketball related most of the week! I said they were being extremely rude to me and to their niece. I hung up.

The next day, they tried calling me but I haven’t answered. They then text me separately apologizing for saying what they did. Mike’s apology was basically a sorry, but… then brought up ways where I wasn’t there for him in the past few weeks and overtook every conversation with Maddie and her team. Craig said sorry for bringing up this issue and that he could’ve been nicer about it. He said I didn’t need to talk about other things if I didn’t want to, but that it just would’ve been nice to hear about something else from time to time. I didn’t accept either of their apologies because I felt that they were backhanded and disrespectful to me. I do a lot for them and have always been there for them when they needed help.

A few days afterwards I send them both a long text message explaining that I didn’t want anything to do with them for a while and to not even respond to me because they straight up attacked me for just trying to exist and share with them. I think I’m a good brother to them and that I didn’t deserve any of the treatment they gave me. Craig sent a short passive aggressive text message saying that he’ll be there for me whenever I’m “ready” to talk and Mike didn’t respond.

I don’t know what to make of that comment nor do I know when I would be “ready” to talk to them after it was so easy for them to say those things to me. My wife thinks they were out of line, so do a few of my friends that I’ve shared this ordeal with.

Basically she is a goth girl from his class in high school(I'm 2 years older than them) and being a brother of someone who has a goth girlfriend is not nearly as pretty as you would think, she literally fits almost every possible stereotype: she has a black hair, uses black lipstick, polishes her nails in black, wears all black: boots, skirts and crop tops, often wears a necklace with some symbolism etc, he is not any better... He was always a fan of ''edgy things'', since like 3th-4th grade, he was obsessed with Creepypasta stories during the middle school, got in abandoned ''haunted houses'' with his friends in the forest close to our home, tried summoning human spirits and whatnot etc. He calmed down *a little bit* about all of this for a few years and then got together with her last year and this shit started again, they talk about horror movies, games, anarchism and animes non-stop, always listen some stupid music etc, every time I try to hang out with them, they don't have anything else to talk about. At least he is asexual so I don't have to worry about becoming an uncle while still in high-school...

He had a short curly brown hair all his life, now it's pitch black straight as arrow and shoulder length, he had a blue-green eye color, mostly green, now he wears white eye contacts, when I say white, I mean pure white, his eyes are literally pure white color with just black pupils! He has a weaker sight on his left eye so he must wear contacts, but when we wanted to buy him colorless or in some beautiful color, he chose just pure white. This Halloween he scared me half to death when he showed up with a ''blood'' smile makeup on his face(kind of like Joker), it was so realistic that I though it's legit blood on his mouth, I calmed down as soon as I realized it's just a makeup and he literally spent hundreds of dollars of his budget on a doll Chucky from horror movies for this Halloween!! It's his budget, I don't care he can spend it on whatever he wants, but still WTF.

The main problem in this is that they are always like this, I don't give a shit about what they do and talk in room alone, I can even endure them for a few hours myself, but it became worse when the rest of the family saw them and knew about them, our parents are divorced and mother doesn't have a problem with it, never had even with him before, father would probably kill them both on spot if he saw them personally(he is fairly conservative), one time they were sitting on couch in living room when cousins came, he literally either didn't give a shit about them or didn't hear them and continued cuddling with her while they watched TV, they of course saw them, thankfully our mother always fixes the situation or problem quickly and they ran in his room after, but I was still embarrassed that they saw her and him *like that.* Grandparents know and don't give a shit, I can only imagine what would the father's side of the family think(they don't even celebrate Halloween let alone...). The other time neighbors saw them and it was awkward, we know each other since childhood and see each other, well basically everyday, but it's still awkward nonetheless, cousins who came are polite and played it cool but it was a wtf moment, they literally kept cuddling not giving a damn about cousins who came first time in like a year and that wouldn't be much of a problem at all if they don't look..*.the way they look like*. Most of the family who didn't see us for a year or longer won't recognize him.

So how do I cope with the fact that my brother and his girlfriend are like this, if you think about ''well just ignore them'', it's impossible, they are together every day, in school they don't separate from each other, sometimes they even ''escape'' from classes when their bullshit works on teachers, heard about it a few times, after school they always come to home and smooch and hug for like an hour in his room, then they bore me for like 4 hours until someone doesn't get back home, they go to room, watch TV and then and all over again, for weekends it's the same except it's all day and she sleeps here. It's more awkward because of the family than me, since holidays are slowly coming, family gatherings are coming with them, as I said the cousins who came are polite and played it cool, didn't even give us ''the looks'', but that isn't even remotely the case for...some of the other members of family who are coming, last year we dodged it because of virus that was still going on, but now God help me...",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604049,public,nsfw,"My brother and his girlfriend are starting to get on my nerves, how do I make the situation better for all of us and our family?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0sesc/my_brother_and_his_girlfriend_are_starting_to_get/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,

We tried to be friends after, then I found out he had tried to cheat on me for 2 years out of the 3 years we had been together.

He was my first serious relationship and I haven't felt ready to jump into dating, I just don't feel the type for it and online dating freaks me out. 

Anyway, I cut him off the moment I found out. There is no friendship when you find out something like that. I was serious about him. I wanted to marry him so finding that out after we had amicable break up snapped something in me. I have been so pissed ever since but it's been 2 years now.

But in the past month in my new country, I have met another person (22f) that has broken my schemes.

The problem is that she has a boyfriend in her home country (She is from Europe and I'm from Africa) so it complicates things... My issue is that she is clearly indicating throughout her actions that she wants something with me irrespective of her situation, and we have been doing many plans together and can't seem to separate from one another.

My gf had a really good idea and was super excited about it relating to a trade up for some items in a video game. She called me to tell me about it this morning and we were planning on having a date later that evening. I went ahead and purchased some items to complete her idea, but after speaking to her again later, realized she was wanting to do it herself. I did not tell her that I had went ahead and purchased anything and helped her instead get some other items. We went through our date and she had not received all of the items yet, however I had already. It was now around 10 hours later after she had told me her idea and since she did not receive all the items yet and it was getting late, I decided then to tell her that I had already purchased enough items to do the trade. We then got into a huge argument. 

The trade we were doing was just a test to do for another trade. When I purchased the items it was for the pattern of another item she wanted and the items she was getting was a different pattern ID. She accused me of lying and trying to hide it from her and also trying to hoard items with that pattern so I could do a different deal behind her back. We have been together for a year and a half and that is not something I have done in the past nor would I. I love her with all my heart and always try my best for her. When she got upset, I got very defensive and tried to explain that I honestly was not trying to undermine her and my reasoning for not telling her was because I felt bad about jumping the gun on it and was just trying to be supportive by helping her get items. 

I apologized and said I was sorry that I should not have purchased the items, and that I should have told her about it. I did a fair bit of over explaining my position and was telling her that I had no intention of doing something really bad or hurting her and that if her trade up would have worked we could have used the ones I had with the correct pattern to go ahead and start on the real one. She said that I can no longer be trusted. I am really trying to figure out what to do because she blocked me saying I was not actually sorry and that I am untrustworthy. 

I can somewhat understand her perspective of thinking saying that I should have just told her about it from the beginning.

I really wanted to be a supportive partner to him and as a result up-ended my life to accommodate his move. As his wife, I assumed I would eventually move with him a few months down the line. We moved out of our small apartment, moved all our stuff to storage, I moved in with my mom, and he moved to Southern California. I visited him a couple of times in Southern California and would ask him when I could expect to move in with him, to which he would answer that he didn't know. Last March he finally told me that he had no intention of me moving in with him. He said he felt he needed to be alone but that he didn't want to lose me and insisted he wanted to stay married. When I'd ask him how long he needed, he said he didn't know and that he didn't want to give me an answer he wasn't sure about. He insisted that he didn't realize he felt that way until he finally moved. I never visited him in Southern California after that.   

I was left feeling extremely torn and bitter. On one hand, I loved him and wanted to believe our marriage was worth fighting for. But on the other hand, I deeply hated him for lying to me and putting me in that position. We tried to have a long distanced relationship, but I was so hurt that I could barely tolerate speaking to him. I can attest that how I communicated with him during this time didn't help the relationship because I was emotional and would tell him how hurt and angry I was. He eventually took my anger and resentment towards him as me no longer being fun or easy to talk to. So, he started making excuses to not speak with me as often. The distance between us only grew bigger from there. 

Fast forward to September, we tried to continue staying in touch, but I just started noticing that he would reach out very casually. He told me that he had moved into his own apartment and was settling in. I would ask him where he lived or I would suggest visiting him, to which he would shut down and avoid giving me his address. I confronted him one day about why he avoided giving me his address, to which he said he was afraid I would find him and hurt him. This was stunning to learn because I've never been and would never resort to being a violent or aggressive person. At this point, this was all too fucking ridiculous for me to continue putting up with. I told him that we would take a break with limited contact and revisit the idea of separation then. 

It's now November. We text a few times back and forth during our break. It was even my birthday a couple of weeks ago. He didn't even text or call me to wish me a happy birthday. I text him a week ago asking to speak and we did. I told him I didn't need to wait another month to know what I wanted. I just wanted to ask him one last time if he wanted to get back together hoping that he'd taken the time to seriously reflect. He said it felt like we had just spoken 2 weeks ago (even though it had been 2 months), and that he hadn't thought much about the relationship since then. He ultimately said he loved me but didn't think he would make an effort to change for the relationship. 

So, here I am. 35 years old, living with my mom with my shit still in storage. I'm definitely not looking to get back with him (we are done aka divorcing). I know that I was breadcrumbed and pushed out of his life. I know he lied to me to avoid the guilt of breaking up with me. I know that he no longer loved me (who would treat someone they love like this anyway). I'm just trying to separate the person I believed him to be from his actions. I just find it so hard to accept that he would treat me this way. I know he is not here to defend himself, so I won't push all the blame on him, but I just don't understand why someone would do this. 

Do I still love him? Unfortunately, yes. Does a part of me still hope and fantasize that he changes his mind and realizes he was wrong to treat me this way? More often than I'd care to admit. I know it will get better with time, but it fucking sucks right now. Our relationship wasn't perfect, but I also don't believe our problems lacked solutions. I think he thought the grass was greener on the other side and thought he needed to run away to embrace it.

The bright side to this shit storm is that I've finally had the opportunity to do some serious self reflection. Nothing is more sobering than getting kicked in the fucking stomach.

So, Reddit, have any of you gone through something similar? This shit sucks and I could sure use a fresh perspective for why people do this to their loved ones.

Im sad and his unstable behaviour makes me anxious, my gynecologist detected me PCOS like 2 months ago, she said stress is one of the causes that make PCOS flare.
Im sad , but i act like everything is normal bc i dont want this nightmare again. 
Today he went out to get some stuff at a store and he called me and was very angry bc another car was « chasing him » and then he changed positions he drove behind that car and was angry and almost crashed , so he told me the other car of course just drove away.
He told me that if he have had a gun in that moment he would have done something stupid. He thinks everybody wants to fu*k him but im sure its mostly his mind.
I know his family but they are not as supportive.
Im anxious and worried.
I told him he needs to go to a psychiatrist asap but he wont go, he says its expensive but omg im desperate.

i believe it would also help if i gave you all some context of what has been going on in my social life during the past years.


i am currently a 15 years old guy, and, before coronavirus was a thing, i had this friend i would hang out with everyday. we were most likely best friends, although things started decaying when we didn't get into the same class (unlike most worldwide schools, my school mixes students from a specific year in 3 sections where they take the same classes for 2 years until getting remixed). this was in 4th grade, i was 10 years old. we would still meet during breaks, but, eventually we started spending less time together to the point he wouldnt even bother waving when we crossed paths and wouldn't even invite me to his birthday even if i did (birthday invites were the  things we used to identify people's friends haha).

i believe this is what fucked it all up; in 5th grade, i finally got a phone number. i was added to a group where you could find everyone from my year. because of my childish behavior and lack of knowledge regarding what people found fun in texts, i got kicked out and my reputation lowered in a not-so-bad scale. i still can picture how everyone yelled at me asking ""WHY DID YOU SEND THAT"" (dw it wasn't anything inappropriate. all i did was send the @ symbol too many times to the point i was spamming). the hate obviously didnt last long, because of our weird behavior and shit. it was hilarious. however, something in him seemed off about it, because it looked like he hadnt got past over the hating phase and stopped talking to me for months

when i was in 6th grade, we got into the same section again. i noticed his conduct had changed, although he kept emitting the same friendly vibes even if we didn't hangout together. we reconnected, although i had a feeling it wouldn't be the same as it was in the past. i was right. i remember having that one moment where you realize the friend with the exact same hobbies and likes you would spend time with and hug almost everyday to relief yourself off a bad bully moment because of how you had fucked things up and stayed silent. thats how i was like, so my feelings split between blameful and blameless when i remember it. i tried to talk about it, but, by the time i gained motivation,
covid came in. i wanted to text him but my phone number was locked and eventually got taken over. once we returned to a face-to-face school, we wouldnt even talk to each other. we would just make eye contact for less than a second and then try to hide the fact you had looked at him. i still see him everyday after school ecause i live close to it and the extracurricular activity places he goes to after class, which makes it even more uncomfortable since we keep walking on the same sidewalk yet on opposite directions. we haven't had a conversation for almost 4 years (end of backstory, sorry for the extra details that are too long to type out)

last night i had a dream where i was in some sort of place with a few friends from school. the (former) friend i was talking about was also there. we were minding our own business, until we two got stuck in an empty room. i was trying to figure out how to get out, since the only exit was a window that was too elevated in order to be reached. while i was running out of energy, he was standing at the back of the room, and i felt how he was looking at me. suddenly, we started talking about how we had stopped doing what friends would do and made up a great distance between us. i dont remember the exact details, but i began crying and hugged him as a comfort source (it was that dramatic). he told me to calm down and that it was okay, which made it even worse. i was feeling like all the pain he had was being layered on me in a guilt form for never talking about it. the weird part goes here. *he kissed me out of nowhere like if we were gay* (im attracted to men but i dont know and dont think he does even if he never talked about who he liked). it was unexpected, but, for some reason that only happens in dreams, i enjoyed it.
going back to reality, i woke up as soon as that kiss happened, and i felt really weird. i was in a tight rope between regret and enjoyment, since its someone ive stopped talking to years ago

it would mean the world to me if anyone could tell me what this could mean (idk if this counts as moral judgement but i believe it's worth a shot) and what i should do about it. thanks",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7603962,public,self,me and a childhood bestfriend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0s3xg/me_and_a_childhood_bestfriend/,all_ads,6,

Early on in our long distance relationship, we both traveled to meet each other. So I don’t think I ever felt this way. But off late I have been feeling like there is no love. He isn’t someone who is expressive while talking, but he has his ways of making me feel loved. In person I’ve never had this issue. 
But since last month, it has felt like such a drag, the calls have gotten very short (5/10 mins a day tops) and it feels like a chore more than something I’d be looking forward to.

i really miss my ex but we have been super back and fourth


my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

it was bad bc we hadnt had sex in 2 months and just i felt pushed aside. 

we break up and well i beg and cry and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
“ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…” i beg cry and say all i did for him etc


then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me and missed the sex 

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building 

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels but said he would make it up to me

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety

i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later he
screenshots someone's story on instagram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz”

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text
im
scared” 

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

he comes back hours later and talks to some girl next to me. and i pass by and look at each other and wave and i leave",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7603946,public,self,i wonder if i can talk to anyone on here about an ex situation thats really bothering me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0s1zl/i_wonder_if_i_can_talk_to_anyone_on_here_about_an/,all_ads,6,

Arthur isn’t a bad guy. He works really hard, he gives me lots of attention when he can. But truthfully? I need more. I have a lot of needs and I believe my need are valid. I think Arthur gets his needs met much more than I get mine.

Sometimes Arthur will get home from work, I’ll walk up to him soooo happy, activity in hand, and he will say “Not right now, go away”. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m very friendly. I don’t do mean things and I try to keep my volume under control. 

I would love to walk with him more. I think we bond a lot over our walks. Arthur has refused to walk with me for about a week because last time I got a little too excited when I saw people and apparently I came off as aggressive. Pretty fucked up if you ask me, he says he will take me again but he’s “too tired” like ok take a nap bro?
