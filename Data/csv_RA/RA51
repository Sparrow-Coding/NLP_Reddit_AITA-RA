We agreed to leave right after work on Friday and I would talk to my boss about getting thanksgiving week off or what we can do. I’ve been at home helping out around the house while she works remote this past week. 

Later tonight to get her minds off things we went to target to peruse and get more Christmas lights. 

I wanted to get a usb c cable to play the switch during our drive if we ended up swapping and “down time” when we’re just at the house. It’s over a 20 hour drive. We walked past the new Pokémon billboard and me excited for the game, and also trying to keep her mind off worrying since we had our plan in motion asked her which one she would choose playfully. She walked up and very loudly cussed and was like “I don’t give a sh*t”. So I said ok and kept walking to which she trailed behind me. 

On our way home her mom called and was excited she was coming out and suggested to go to Disneyland. 
When we got home I tried to talk to her about it but then it blew up. She said that I can never play any video games, doesn’t want to date someone like me, I don’t do anything in this relationship, and how she has to handle everything and feels second to video games even when her grandma is sick. 

I tried to explain that I was just trying to get her mind off things and that I was only going to play the switch when I was in the passenger seat or laying in bed. I snapped and said a snarky comment about how I just have to do everything she says, which I regret and apologized immediately after. However it pissed her off even more and said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. She was screaming and hitting the bed. 

I later came back to apologize again, explain that all she had to do was have a conversation and asked why it blew up in the store. But she wasn’t having it. 


She stopped and started to say really hurtful things, which I tried to be understanding but she broke up with me because of feeling my priorities do not align with hers and that I’m not a partner because I don’t help out. Which I feel invalidated for because I had a week off of an in office job, while she worked I spent a mix of time between cleaning the house, decorating for the holidays, spending time with her or our dogs, and then playing games while we sat next to each other hanging out.

Thanks to Facebook I got back in touch with her, this happened around 2017, we organized a meeting to see each other again.

In that meeting I met her friends and her boyfriend, to this day I continue to keep in touch with each of them.

Since that meeting I continued to treat her as always, supporting her in everything I could and trying to make her happy as much as possible, this behavior continues to this day.

All those years around I had some relationships, but after each one of them ended somehow I end up thinking about being with her again.

Lately some of our common friends have told me that what I feel is not love, but rather obsession.

We switch off weeks waking up early to take our daughter to school. We’re both naturally night owls and like to sleep in til 10-11am so it’s nice for us to both have “off” weeks. When it’s my week of being able to stay up a little later, probably 3 out of 5 school nights I’ll fall asleep on the couch. It’s not about being away from him it’s about just being able to relax, alone, be by the kitchen for snacks, watch my videos loud, watch my shows, listen to music, etc. it’s a break. I’m a stay at home mom and I don’t often get any time alone. (We have a younger son as well that’s attached to my hip). This has never been a thing until August when my daughter started 1st grade (skipped kindergarten) so it’s not like it’s been happening for years (me sleeping on the couch).

Here’s the kicker. He does it too. Except he usually wakes up 3-5am and comes to the room after initially falling asleep on the couch (when it’s my week to take her to school.) he says it’s different. Because he still comes to the room eventually. I told him if he slept through the night and didn’t wake up he’d stay on the couch. It’s not like he’s got an internal clock set that says “go lay next to your wife” he just happens to wake up and come. I don’t mind it at all. He could stay out on the couch all week if that’s what he wanted. 

It started off with a few sarcastic comments about me sleeping on the couch but we’d laugh them off. After a few weeks of it I finally made it a real conversation tonight. I told him it’s no different than him falling asleep on the couch and coming back at the crack of dawn. I told him he’s making me feel bad for something he does too. And he just continuously brings up “well I go back there eventually”. I told him where I sleep in the house does *not* define my love for him and I feel like it shouldn’t be a topic at all. I enjoy some alone time of staying up late and that’s that. It has zero to do with our marriage. 

Throughout the conversation he kept being sarcastic and making it a joke and it feels really serious to me. It feels unfair and it’s annoying. Many couples have separate bedrooms and have a wonderful relationship. He just kept saying it feels like me distancing myself from him. 

Also it has nothing to do with sex either, as our 2 year olds bed is in our room so the magic most definitely never happens in the bedroom at night. I just don’t know what to do. He completely brushed the conversation off with jokes but likely next time i sleep on the couch he’ll go back to making comments about it. 

I understand that it’s different. We’ve always slept together. The only time either of us intentionally falls asleep on the couch is when we’re sick. But he’s fallen asleep on the couch (accidentally) after work nearly our whole damn relationship. And I’ve never once had any negative feelings about it. 

It feels so petty and immature but it’s rising a lot of anger in me that he’s making me feel guilty about sleeping on my own couch.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7570309,public,self,My husband thinks me sleeping on the couch somewhat often is me distancing myself.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxibj5/my_husband_thinks_me_sleeping_on_the_couch/,all_ads,6,,,,

Every time i force she tells me I don’t respect her time , she is busy …. 
I couldn’t control myself those days bcz I can’t see her everyday only this happening in between us was just this communication suddenly 1 day I felt like its gone.
After few days she went back home i was that happy bcz no more bc bc stuffs will happen . So I requested her lets talk abou this . But she always stays silent…

But everything went wrong when i became angry she told me if im like this she don’t wanna continue this relationship.
I don’t know what to tell her . Only thing in my mind was I don’t wanna lose her for ever . So I convinced her ill change pls Don’t give me space.
After few days again an incident happend and i was sure that was not my problem. I forced her so she tell me she was in a physical relationship with someone else while she was on her internship.

Sometimes things ramp back up, and sometimes they don’t. Seems very random which way things go when it happens.

When it’s abundantly clear that she is not very into what we’re doing anymore, I’ll usually stop and ask if something is wrong. She used to lie and say everything was fine, but after I pressed the issue multiple times, we finally discussed it.

She told me that sometimes she will just spontaneously stop being into sex, even once we’ve started. She insists it’s not a performance issue; I’ve asked what I can do to help, but she keeps saying it’s not about what I’m doing and it’s out of her control too.

I don’t really know what to do at this point. I am getting frustrated with the situation — mainly because I don’t fully understand it — and I don’t know how to handle this. Is this like a female form of ED? Is it a libido thing? Is this something other people have experienced?

My current GF  when I ask her does she want me I receive an annoyed answer which isn't a yes. tonight I casually mentioned it while driving and she asked""in what way?"" I say ""in general"" she said ""that's a hard question to answer"" I then ask ""well what ways don't you want me "" and she said that's hard to answer"" she asked me if wanted her and I answered ""yes"" she asked in what way"" I said I accept you fully as who you are and everything about you""

After that she said ""in that way, yes I want you, you're a good boyfriend""

Before that we both had a long relationships which didn't end well. My last relationship was a mess which left me insecure and with lots of issues that pop up from time to time. 

We have a great loving relationship and we're both happy. There were few problems, mostly related to my insecurities and overthinking, which we've solved by simply communicating. 

But I think this one is bigger and I need your advice: She is going to visit her friend in another country for a month. At first that was kinda odd for me, but we talked and everything got settled (Another lesson learned). Won't bother you with that part. 
But yesterday she said that she was going to shave (she didn't shaved for like 3 months now) which was weird and made me confused. I mean, I know she doesn't like it shaved, I am really ok with it, so why would you shave before your 1 month trip without your boyfriend? I immediately started thinking why would she do that and many unsettling thoughts came to my mind. I was silent and felt like everything was repeating like in the last relationship. Then I thought that this was another scene in my head which I had to deal with, I couldn't find out why was I thinking that she would cheat, because I trust her and I'm sure in her love. I started blaming my insecurities again. 

When she saw me clearly struggling about something she asked what was wrong. At first I didn't wanted to share, but after some time I shared my confusion, that it was odd to shave before a month-long trip without a boyfriend, when you don't even like that. She explained she sometimes wanted to shave and it was not related to a trip. And after thinking about it she admitted that my thoughts were logical and assured that she wasn't planning anything wrong. 

Thing is that I still have bad thoughts in my head which makes me mad. Despite my trust in her love I still think of cheating and that she will leave me at some point. Then I was thinking that such thoughts will make her leave because I can imagine how annoying that can be.

So, being that I'm 36 and shy/socially awkward i avoided them for a whole month and then after awhile I gave in because I think she is beautiful.

So I'm deciding to back away before I get into a mess of trouble. And my family and friends tell me it makes me look bad at work. However, it is a huge warehouse known for tons of dating and its allowed too. But they say the age gap makes me look kind of bad and a bit like a Pedo.

At first I thought he was talking with my mom, but I know they aren’t as close anymore due to past issues and they barely say “i love you” to each other and it couldn’t have been my sister because she had class at the time.

We moved things on really fast and I'd thought everything was going great, I stayed over at her place a couple times and we cuddled and watched our fav dumb movies/shows, we went to an amusement park together, mini golf, and we both like art and did like improvised comic drawing together- basically it's my dream relationship, yet we've only been together for a month. Just this weekend I spent the night with her and I along with her, crossed a boundary that I set myself, which was no premarital sex, which was very stupid if you think about it, like I'm the one that said it, but I'm the one that initiated breaking it, but we did together and we enjoyed it. For context- I told her I loved her reallly reallly early like I'm stupid and am not thinking early, I'm just saying how I feel. But afterwards we had a call where she basically said the relationship was moving too fast and she needed some time to reciprocate the verbal and sometimes the physical affection I show, since she's had bad experiences in the past. She also felt guilty about encouraging my breaking of my boundary which i told her was my fault entirely. She needed some space and just wasn't ready for all the things that we did in the month. I told her that I'm fine with that and I'd give her all the space she needs, but I also asked if there was anything I could do to make it better and if she was ok, to which she told me that the best thing to do is nothing but give her some time, which I obliged to. This would've been fine for me to leave off on but we had a very personal conversation afterwards where she mentioned later that if I felt she was moving too slow, she'd be ok with me breaking it off. I'm either dumb, stupid, or dumb stupid but I told her really sorrowfully that there's no way I would do that. She also told me that she was content to see it through, but nothing is set in stone. I honestly love her like I'd die for her which is so stupid cause we've only been together for a month, but I just am like that.

I dealt with the usual feelings of a break-up; lack of sleep, not eating, loneliness, etc. come to find out before I knew of this girl he cheated on me with, he was dating us both and sleeping with us both, thankfully I had proof and once I found out who the girl was I showed her everything but for some reason this girl didn’t believe me, or the proof, I got accused of editing the proof, crazy right?

Once my boyfriend noticed (technically ex at the time) he started talking to me more again and getting upset with me even though he had a whole ass new girlfriend. Started telling me he missed me and he hated what he’s done and his choices blah blah blah.

She’s bubbly, blond, sweet and hyper feminine, a lot like a modern Marilyn Monroe. She’s very social and works behind the scenes in entertainment. If you saw us together you’d probably wonder how much I had to pay her to date me. 

Amanda is mostly open and honest about everything. She has no problem showing me her messages on text, IG, or anywhere that you can talk to other people on. We happily share locations with each other and she is never anywhere she shouldn’t be. She loves me a whole lot and the trust level is strong between us.

But lately I’ve realized this: she has a sick, secret obsession with leading men on and making them think they have a chance with her, and then shooting them down and calling them out for it when they make a move. She said she always tells people she’s in a relationship, but they pursue her anyway. I get that it’s not uncommon for that to happen to beautiful women, but… she gets a little too giddy when she tells me about it. It makes me think that 1. She’s acting in a calculated, flirtatious manner around these men, and 2. This happens more often than she lets on. 

Amanda has told me about 3 couples she’d broken up. The first was right before we met, when she worked as a dog walker/sitter. The husband tried to kiss her, stupidly in front of a neighbor’s security camera, and she immediately told the wife which led to a swift divorce. 
The 2nd time was a year ago. Her cousin’s boyfriend confessed his feelings for her, she told her cousin, they broke up. The 3rd time only happened a month ago, and that’s when I became suspicious that she genuinely enjoyed doing this. Her coworker texted her a rather sexual invitation to which she showed his then-gf (in person!) and watched the shitstorm unfold. 

Every time this sort of thing happens, me and her friends are always comforting her and telling her she did nothing wrong and that these guys are gross and entitled. She does a great job of being the victim but it’s starting to get ridiculous.

Because she works in entertainment, she gets to establish a lot of personal connections with people. This is where I think she does all of her dirty work. She dresses in sexy clothes and always looks her best, and works her sweet/open personality and perfect figure on some poor sucker until he takes the bait. She ALWAYS claims she was “just being herself, just being friendly”.

To be clear, no, I don’t think she’s cheating on me. She constantly tells me I’m one of the only “good ones” left. We spend almost all of our free time together, and she would happily let me raid her texts and emails. I’m her first long term boyfriend and she seems to take it seriously. 

My girlfriend has a gigantic vigilante complex and uses her charms to bring other people down a peg. I don’t know how to feel about it, about her, now that I’ve realized it. It seems twisted and unnecessary, and I don’t even know how to confront her about it because everything she’d done has been shrouded in plausible deniability. She’s always been so loving and caring that it’s hard to accept this dark side.

TLDR: my girlfriend loved to flirt with guys in a way she can deny, just to humble them and act like a victim. She’s so subtle about it that I have no idea how to confront her without seeming overbearing.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7570169,public,self,My (M25) girlfriend (F25) is a temptress and enjoys ruining other people’s relationships.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxhuru/my_m25_girlfriend_f25_is_a_temptress_and_enjoys/,all_ads,6,,,,

I'm fit, she's fat. I'm streetwise, she's academically gifted. I hate and avoid politics, she only reads about politics and enjoys her blood boiling. The one thing that made us so close is that we share quite a traumatic childhood.

We are in our 30s now and have moved on from the pains of the past - at least I have. I got married, had a gorgeous child, and spent A LOT of time ""healing"". Life is short and I actively try to be happy.

My sister is still not married and she's reaching the age where having children will be dangerous. She doesn't date or go out for drinks or even try to enjoy a comedy - she works, complains about work, then works more. (I've told her I find her complaints extremely offensive because she makes triple the money of what an average person makes... She still hasn't stopped complaining)

I've dealt with her negativity for decades. I've tried to be a crutch for when she needed help with her mental issues. I've helped her financially because she was in school forever. Basically, I've ALWAYS been there for her. And she has too for me (driven me around, made me meals when I was pregnant, helped me overcome post-partum depression, etc)

The problem now is that she spills her misery unto my toddler. She keeps Googling different exotic diseases and sending me links to them to keep me ""aware of what to look for"". As an already paranoid new mom, I don't like to hear about this stuff. I've told her this before, but she just doesn't listen. She's made my toddler a hobby of some sort.

Things came to an explosion about 5 weeks ago when I told her on WhatsApp to basically get a life and stop making my kid the centre of her paranoia... Instead of apologizing, she began typing a list of why she's not wrong... I got really pissed at that moment and blocked her from everything... We haven't spoken in 5 weeks. We used to talk everyday.

She's coming to my city in December and staying with my parents. I know I will be asked to bring my kid over to see her. I'm thinking of saying no and just allow this relationship to die - I'm very hurt that her ego is so huge she didn't just say sorry.

For context, the two of us were close friends since we were 13-14 and we dated from the summer of covid up until around January 2021. From that point on we haven't spoken to each other at all besides maybe one phone call. Now we have a third friend who is my best friend and her neighbor since they were 6 and he thinks I should say something and go to the wake. He thinks that just because I'm her ex it shouldn't mean anything since I was her close friend for a lot longer and if I don't go to the wake the friendship will be gone with no chance of recovering it. I'm hesitant on sending her a message as I feel like it's not my place, we haven't talked in two years and I don't want to cause any distractions or layers of stress while she's grieving. Going to the wake seems even worse as that would be the first face-to-face interaction we will have it just seems to me that I would be doing more harm than good as I would be just another person saying ""I'm sorry for your loss"" and forcing an interaction. However, I do feel like I'm being cold and my friend seems to be pushing me into saying something/going to the wake. If anything I feel like I should say send a message that way it gives her the ability to ignore it but even then I have no idea what to say. I recently lost my grandfather which I know isn't the same as losing a parent but I just kinda hated all the forced sympathy and the people who weren't there for years suddenly coming when they had a lot of time to visit but chose not to.

But apparently, over the summer, he started acting like a dick to her, and that's when she met me. I think that's when she realized she deserved better, as she has mentioned to me. But she was hesitant to jump right in because she was going to go see him and she didn't want to hurt me. I understood and respected that, and I tried to keep my fair distance. However, over the time, we got so close naturally, and there was nothing both of us were really forcing. After 1.5 months of being with her every day, we hooked up for the first time and it was special. After that, I had to leave the town for rest of my summer. But the time apart felt so difficult, and I knew I felt really specially about her. She cried when she dropped me at the airport, and it kept playing in my head because I had never felt such genuine appreciation. So I booked a trip back again to see her for a weekend. It was a long trip, but we spent our times together, and it was very intimate. I couldn't help but express I love you to her, and she told me she had been feeling the same. But we still didn't go exclusive because she had that trip coming up.

A week later, she made that trip. I think she was on the fence about meeting him. But I think eventually they did. We had been calling each other every day until that point, constantly talking and supporting each other. One night she called me, bawling her eyes out. And she told me they hooked up, and she felt extremely awful about it. We weren't exclusive at that point, but it really hurt a lot. I didn't process my feelings then, but it's coming to bite me now, and I don't know what to do.

I don't know if my feelings are valid since she had been clear since day 1. And I feel awful that I am having these feelings. I want to love her so much, but someday I ask if I deserved better. But at the same time, it feels so difficult to ask that question because she is so special to me. And treats me with such respect and love and kindness except for that one incident. Which is painful. And she is never the one to ever hurt anyone. Yet I feel hurt when I think about it.

What can I do in this situation? What can I do to bridge the trust? Because I don't want to think maybe I deserve better.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I had expressed love for each other before going exclusive. She hooked up with someone before we committed, and I am hurt. I can't understand if my feelings are valid.

I, F26, met a guy ,M28, a few months ago. 
I liked him, but wasn’t too physically attracted to him and decided to be just friends. He was a little bit disappointed but agreed. Well, however over the past few months I got to know him better and we are in daily contact, even now that he moved cities, and he is the first person I want to tell whatever (good or bad) happens that day.
Recently we got drunk when he was visting, and hooked up. 

It was fine, but I don’t know if I‘m in love with him (and it doesn’t help that I‘m a huge a romantic) - or really that physically attracted. 

The times I was sure I was in love before were when I constantly thought about the guys, being extremely physically attracted to them and actually obsessing over them. It was awful and my mental health declined severely. After I learned about anxious attachment, I realized this was a huge part of me being „in love“. 

So I‘m currently struggling with what it means to be in love in a healthy way. I really like him, but I dont feel like my friends and family when they talk about their honeymoon stage after meeting their longterm partners, but I really want that for me. 

I guess I see some potential with him and I‘m scared of having a skewed view on love and missing out on a good thing.On the other hand, I‘m afraid of messing this up and hurting his feelings.

I can't see myself away from him and I just love him, just to put this out here. 

For context, I've been always more open and outspoken about my emotions, and my boyfriend was more stoic and on the logical side. Through the years, he opened up to me so much and we've been joking about how I'm his pocket therapist and always here to listen to him. 

On one hand, I'm so proud of him for being able to express himself and also putting effort to understand me and my feeling too.

On the other hand, to put it simply, I'm going crazy. It's not his fault, but I feel like I'm drained and squeezed out of my last bits. 

Even for the smallest dilemma in his life, we have to discuss it both logically and emotionally for however long or wherever he wants, and then when he finishes he goes off to do whatever he wants to do. 

And when it comes to me, I want to share something with him, he is too busy, tired, and has to think about something else, and if I catch him rarely listening, he doesn't reply. Just simply sits there, listens and when I'm done talking, picks up his phone and just does whatever. 

most he has said to me about anything is ""and what do you think about that?"".

I know he is very busy, works long hours, exercises hard, and literally has no time, even to have dinner some days but I'm just, not okay. 

I'm currently living with my boyfriend, in a different city from my family, and recently lost my job, while my boyfriend is just helping me out so much financially until I can find my footing again. Emotionally though? I feel like running towards a wall and SPLAT like a mosquito.  

I've been trying to talk to him about all of these and he just lays there, plays with his phone, or falls asleep. I'm so tired and I feel like I'm better off moving back to my family's house. For emotional support and also not to burden him financially too. 

I'm so sorry if this wall of text is a mess, he is very stressed lately about many things and I'm one ""shirt gets stuck on a doorknob"" away from a meltdown, and I don't know how to approach any of this.

last week i saw her liking facebook stories of another woman, complimenting her and i didnt bother coz i was like “oh well that girls really pretty so why not” but then in the evening when i checked his phone, the conversation with that girl was gone..i had to google how all of a sudden the thread of conversation was gone, and then i figured he deletes conversation..i was sooo devastated i confronted him again. but this time, he just kept silent..while i was crying that night he had to leave because of work and he said he needed to process his thoughts


we usually meet every other day and now hes avoiding me, saying he regrets what he did and its up to me if i want our relationship to continue or not..after thinking about it for the next few days, i realized that what we had is more important and i texted him coz hes not talking to me since and its killing me.. i asked him if hes mad at me he said ""are u crazy, why am i gonna be mad at you?"" 

to be honest i dont know whats going on with us anymore. In my head its perfectly clear that i want him back, but i feel like hes slowly fading away from me and it makes me really anxious.

I guess I thought I have been reassuring him, but he said that he thinks words don't mean anything and that I could say whatever I wanted and that doesn't mean I actually mean what I am saying. so basically me saying ""I love you"" and ""I see a long future with you"" didn't reassure him like it would me. he thinks that I might just be saying it just to say it.

and I have asked him about this, I asked what I can do for him that would make him feel secure in our relationship and he only said it was actions. so I'm just asking for ideas on things I can do for him that will reassure him.

At first she wanted to have sex somwhat frequently but I think it was just to keep me around, which she didnt need to do. This lasted a few months then really tapered off. I mentioned if a few times and it would improve for maybe two weeks and then it would go back to normal (once every week to 10 days) . I would try to initiate fairly frequently and would get turned down about 75% of the time. Therfore initiating lost its appeal.

 During this time I started experiencing a hormone disorder and lost some drive and initiating didnt feel as natural. Wed have sex about once a week to 10 days. Sometimes two weeks. Kinda disappointing, but not the end of the world because of my hormone issues. Quite a bit she would say lets have sex later which would get me going and excited and then later on she would say ""not tonight"" or ""another time instead"". This happens about 60-70% of the time she says lets do it which makes me less exited about things and it just turns into disappointment. 

After about 4/5 years of dealing with hormones, i got it addressed and fixed for the most part. Now my drive is way back up, and when we have sex she says its the best its ever been. However, our frequency is getting worse (ie 3+ weeks in between last few months).  

I know her drive isnt high and she admits that, so I know she doesnt really want sex often so i dont even push the issue anymore. Plus with all the times she says lets do it later and then backs out it makes me less excited about our sex life and now I just expect her to change her mind later, which she does most of the time. 

This wasnt as much of an issue before I started medicine, but now that I feel much better Im realizing again how disappointing our sex life is to me. Also we dont have kids yet so I only imagine its going to be much worse once we have kids. 

Thoughts on approaching? I feel bad trying to convince her to have sex more often when she doesnt want it. Lastly, aside from this our relationship is near perfect in my eyes and in hers. We get along so well, dont argue, and what few issues pop up we can work through fairly quickly and reasonably.

I \[30s M\] have 3 daughters \[ages 7-11\], and currently 50/50 care with my ex-wife. I won't attempt any psychiatric diagnosis, but I think she has some severe mental health issues combined with narcissistic tendencies that have totally blown up since Covid. I want to help my kids as much as I can, and I just don't know how best to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

The mom has twice moved cities very abruptly and given the children little or no warning, so they had no chance to even say goodbye to their friends. Once when leaving me (taking kids without my consent while I was asleep), and again when she decided to move 2 years later. I definitely think this damaged their sense of stability, but she defends this and denies that this did any harm to the children.

She has multiple times decided to get back together with me, and told the children first before talking to me. They get their hopes up and when I refuse to take her in on her terms (typically that I pay for a lot and make no demands), then she tells the children I don't want the family to be with me.

She has fallen deep into the Q conspiracy theories. Has repeatedly and forcefully told them that anyone who gets a Covid vaccine will die within 2 years (which has been revised to 3-5 years). That includes me, all their grandparents, and most other adults in their lives. She tells them there are Satanic forces everywhere, shady conspiracies that want to harm them, demonic powers, etc. Generally trying to train them to live in fear. I've also seen her posting online about Jewish conspiracies and that Germany was on the right side of WW2, holocaust was fake, etc. Also now a flat earther.

For about 8 months she stopped taking them to school and decided to home-school them. During this time they were extremely isolated, and also receiving a very low-quality education. The youngest developed severe social anxiety around strangers, and was basically unable to function around other people. She also gets highly anxious on her own, for instance was only able to sleep together with someone.  I was only able to get them back into school when I took things through Family Court, and I think that has helped with these social anxiety issues.

My ex regularly tells the children that I am evil and doing everything in my power to hurt her and ruin her home. She also routinely demonizes everyone in the ""government agenda"", anything ""woke"" and most people who are different. One of our daughter's friends is Muslim, so my ex told her that the friend belongs to a Satanic religion that aims to steal, kill, and destroy.

She basically doesn't listen to anything they say they want. For instance, they have had many birthdays where she decided who to invite and where it would be, and she invites her extended family but doesn't let them invite their choice of school friends. Or one time she told them she would take them out for sushi, but instead went to a hairdresser and got them haircuts they didn't want.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to provide stability, sense and reason. I have 50/50 care, and also a court order ensuring they stay in the same school and don't move away. I am trying to be there for the children, listen, and give a positive example. Try to show that it isn't necessary to live in fear. I try to avoid directly addressing what their mom says too much, but that is very difficult. I do get caught up fairly often telling the children that vaccines are safe, Earth is round, and there are no evil conspiracies out to get them, but I try to catch myself and stop overdoing it. Is there anything else I can do?

I believe the kids are suffering because of how their mother behaves. Soon I'm going to have to face Family Court again, so this could be a time to try to get more of the care. I believe this would be a realistic outcome. However, I believe that increasing my care would result in the mom attempting to abduct the children (again). I really don't want that. But I feel like I need to do more to try to keep the children away from the toxic stuff they deal with from their mother.

But then like a year after, I started thinking about him, cause I seen a picture of him online and he looked good in it, but then I started obsessing over him, even making me own nude Twitter, cause I thought it would attract him
Months after I ended up messaging him and he seemed so weird, like telling me all these big ideas he had, when he don’t have the grades or anything,then I found out he dated some super dodge people

When I am with my girlfriend, most of the time things are wonderful. But the moment I am alone, I have no desire to see her again. I even dread talking to her on the phone now. Her parents will be meeting mine for thanksgiving (with travel already arranged) so I have no idea what to do. Some context:

I have been dating my girlfriend (lets say Grace) for 10 months. We met through my best friend’s sister (Dee) on a vacation, and started dating about 5 months later. During the course of our relationship, Grace had a falling out with Dee: in short, Grace made new friends in college and hung out with Dee less, which eventually led to them cutting ties. I am of the opinion that both of them were hugely immature. Our largest fight centered around this, with Grace feeling like I was not supporting her. Grace wanted me to cut Dee out of my life, and I told her I was not willing to do so. We almost broke up, but we eventually got over it.

We have also argued about Grace feeling like she is not a priority. I am in my final year of school, I work, and I am constantly studying for and taking actuarial exams. Juggling all of these with Grace has been tough, because she hasn’t felt important and I haven’t felt like I’ve had enough time away from her to do my work.

In the past two months, however, we have done a much better job at making time for each other and feeling supported. Grace shows me love and compassion every day, and always tries to make sure I am happy. She plans cute dates, talks about our future, and is super committed to our relationship. Despite this, I have been feeling less and less in love every day. I don’t know if it’s because I’m expecting us to fight more when my next exam comes around, or if it’s because I just feel like we aren’t compatible, all I know is that the spark isn’t really there. 

I constantly flip back and forth, trying to decide if I want to breakup. Since her parents and my parents are traveling to my residence for thanksgiving (they will arrive in two days) I feel like I have to wait until after then if I’m going to breakup with Grace. At the same time, I feel like waiting will make it hurt Grace even more.

One thing holding me back (which I know shouldn’t) is that Grace will be completely blindsided and emotionally destroyed by me leaving. She and I have talked about marriage, if only sparingly, and she really thinks I am the one. I know how bad she will hurt and I am struggling to get the courage to breakup. I selfishly want to wait for us to get into an argument so I have an excuse to get out of the relationship, but I know that I just need to tell her how I feel. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do. Advice?

Quick note: I am atheist, Grace is christian. We have great conversations about religion, and it has never caused issues in our relationship, I just think it may be important for context.

I like to talk things out and come to a solution, especially if it has to do with something that involves me. If I don’t, I worry about it until it’s resolved, and that could be for days. I have a hard time sleeping and overall feel more and more eager by the minute to talk things through. Nothing gives me more anxiety to hear that he’s feeling down and that he doesn’t want to talk about it.

He got in the habit of writing his thoughts whenever he felt this way, which I encouraged because it’s a wonderful coping mechanism. He shared them with me once and there was a whole lot of frustration and anger about me. I’m now horrified that there are more feelings that he’s kept to himself about me and our relationship. 

I’ve opened up about that a few times and expressed how important it is for me that we communicate, and I don’t think he’s been writing ever since. He gave it up because he thinks it hurts my feelings too much. It did, but if he isn’t in a place where he feels comfortable opening up to me, then writing is better than nothing. He didn’t seem to agree with that.

Whenever I push to talk and work things through, sometimes he’ll walk away, or ask mid-conversation if he could just get back to what he was doing. I hate pushing him like that, but being blocked out is so so painful and worrisome. One of the things he wrote about was his frustration with feeling like I pressure him to talk when he doesn’t want to.

I just hate hate hate the damage it causes when we don’t communicate. I hate the depressive mood it puts me in. I hate the curiosity and anxiety over what I’m doing wrong and don’t know about. I’ve expressed all of this to him time and time again and with great calculation in my words. I’ve done everything possible to stress how important this is to me. When it comes down to it, he just doesn’t want to talk.

For the record, when I do push and talk things through with him, we always move on from everything swiftly. That’s why I push… That’s what I want, i want to grow together, I want to learn how to manage unavoidable conflict better.

He’s mentioned before that he just doesn’t feel like what he has to say is productive or beneficial to the conversation, or that his emotions are too strong to tackle the issue in the heat of the moment. I completely understand and respect that, so I’ve learned to give him the space he’s requesting and bring it up during a time where our emotions are in a better place. Even then, he doesn’t want to talk. He hates it being brought up, it completely ruins his mood and he shuts me out all over again. There’s never much of a difference between working it out during the moment or working it out later.

Another important detail is that he also shared with me that he feels like I communicate to win. He feels like he’s always wrong. I’ve worked on this a lot and feel like I’ve been better at communicating what i really want, which is a solution - not to win or make him feel like he’s wrong. 

I worked on it immediately when he told me, and even though it was a learning curve and I made mistakes along the way with how I spoke, I feel really confident with it now. I try to be super thoughtful and careful, and I truly never want to make him feel that way ever again.

I mention that because I think it’s a huge factor into why he shuts down. I have no idea how to approach him when there’s conflict in the relationship. Does anyone have advice for other ways I can try to resolve this?

We've known each other for almost a year now, and it was purely sexual right off the bat. We both enjoy our time together and communicate that to each other frequently.

About 1 month after we met he wanted to discuss how our relationship was casual and he would eventually want to look for someone to get married to, and was worried he would hurt me. However, I was completely fine with this because I was not looking for an established relationship at the time. 

Some months passed and when we were together he asked me if I wanted to be exclusive. I immediately interpreted it as he would want to get married to me and that scared me because I have negative connotations with marriage. ( I know I'll eventually need to seek a therapist to work these emotions out as well as attend couple counseling with my partner.) So I shrugged off the idea of being exclusive and he accepted that.

So we've both meet other people outside our fwb. I know he's still seeking other people, but I've stopped because it's not really an interest of mine anymore.

For birth control I got the Mirena IUD and gained some weight. I also breastfeed. I've been trying to eat less and more healthy, but he keeps telling me to eat whatever I want and will make these really carb loaded meals. He'll tell me not be ashamed of my body while we're having sex, but I recently caught him on Instagram after he told me he deleted it. His phone wasn't turned off, it was sitting right on his desk so I of course looked and it hurt me. Because why would he tell me he loves my body but be looking at and jerking off to these women who look nothing like me? It hurts and causes me to overthink. I didn't like how much p*rn he would watch, but he's tuned that down a bit (I think). We've been arguing the past few days about various things. But I finally told him I got an abortion, I took the pill, and he lashed out. He wanted me to get an abortion when I first got pregnant but ended up miscarrying and then a few months later I got pregnant with my daughter. Same thing, he didn't want another kid and I gave him the option to leave and I wouldn't put him on any type of child support, but he kept denying saying he's not his dad. He was really stressed throughout both of my pregnancies and it took a major toll on me as well. I didn't wanna have that stress put on him again, or myself, so I made the decision myself. Told him the abortion is the reason why I've been emotional and all over the place and why it hurts to have sex. But he didn't understand and just told me to fuck off. I'm really hurt and don't know what to do.
