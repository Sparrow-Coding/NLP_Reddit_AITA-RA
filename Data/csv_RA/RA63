I have expressed my concerns over wanting to spend more time together but in vain. I feel like he is not prioritizing our relationship. On top of that, I feel like he lied to me.

One such example is that yesterday I sent him a message and he didn't reply for hours. I saw him online on the very app and a few other social media sites, so I took snapshots. When he did reply, I confronted him with those and he denied it. He said he does not know anything about being online because he has been asleep all that time. He came and went online multiple times (like 3 to 4 times every 10 minutes) but still denied it.

I would have believed him it happened on one app or one or two times. How do I believe this? I already felt crazy for taking snapshots and then he made me feel even crazier. Does this look like he is being honest? I'd rather he told me he was talking to whomever instead do this to me. What do I do? :/

I'm 36f and my step mom, who I have only known for 6 years, has taken it upon herself to find me a husband. She is from China and we live in the US. I have been single for a few years and she did ask years back if she could set me up if she found someone. This is a normal thing in China for parents to do. I agreed because I figured she just wanted permission. 

Recently, she became serious about finding me someone. First she recommended her nephew in China. The nephew has a daughter and a dramatic relationship with his ex wife. So that went nowhere because one of us would have to immigrate. Me being single and childfree makes me the obvious choice and I don't trust the regime.

I was next to this guy, who wasn't talking to me and moved his chair away from me when he sat down. My step mom was encouraging me to talk to him and I told her I found this very uncomfortable. A couple days after dinner I told my dad I wasn't interested in him. He understood and let me know he didn't know she was going to do that. I let him know I'm not interested in her setting me up with anyone.

I gave a forceful ""no"" and told her to stop. It stopped when my dad came back into the room. He backed me up so she stopped.

We have never met irl, but are planning to do it soon. We are both virgins. This is just to answer your questions, now the actual problem:

Sex has always been an important thing for me, the intimacy it brings, the feeling of being close to one another. Lately I‚Äôve found myself in a situation where I lack it. Not physically, just the attention and intimacy. I want it the way it has been until we will actually be able to do it irl. It‚Äôs either through sexting or when we have our weekly video calls. We used to sext a couple of times a week, maybe even everyday and now I am the only one initiating it. After I communicates it to him he tried to arrange a romantic call too. Anyway it didn‚Äôt happen in the last 2 weeks. I thought he was just busy because he has midterms and exams in the university he goes to. 

We have talked about it more than once but I never pushed him into having sex with me, that‚Äôs just super toxic so I was patient. He never mentioned the fact that he simply didn‚Äôt want it. I thought he wanted to have sex with me but was too busy or tired.

Today I found out that he just doesn‚Äôt feel like doing it. We talked and I tried to understand but the situation really freaks us both out. 

He is a person that has phases for things. Theres a time where he would rather read books than play games, then two weeks later he is bored with books and focuses on sports like bike riding. It was never an issue for him or me, but now we think it could be similar with sex. He says he is confused because when he sees me he gets hard, horny and etc. Everything is normal, except for the fact that he just doesn‚Äôt feel like fucking. 

We are confused as hell, and we are trying to deal with it so that both of us are satisfied with how things work in our relationship. 

How do we fix it so that both sides are satisfied?

Do you have any thoughts on it? Maybe some of you had a similar issue? I don‚Äôt know how to phrase the problem into Google so theres not much I can do than posting it here. Hope it‚Äôs not too confusing!

I work and live in a city where I don't really know that many people and I live in an apartment with roommates that I don't get along. Now I have a friend who moved to the city a few months ago and though we weren't close in college back home, I've been making an effort to hang out with them since they're the only other person I know. We both work at the same place. In the early months we would go walk together from our apartments to work since we live a few streets down, and it was nice. We would go get coffee after work or during lunch, go on walks when its nice out, have dinner at each others places, and sometimes go for a run on the weekend. This was earlier in the year and a couples months in I started to notice that he was ""busy"" or that they was out of town more often.

Examples:

\-He told me 3 weeks ago he has no desire to ever move away from this area bc of ""family obligations"" (I'm from a place 1700 miles away and moved here for work, bought a house bc of the market being better than renting, I didn't ever say I planned to stay here the rest of my life)

\-His family. They're okay but really strange and the more time I spend with them, the more they actually make me physically miss my ex boyfriend's family. Current partner's family is nothing like me. They don't like animals, are into competitive shooting and gun hoarding, arts and crafts, none of which I am.

\-He's a bull in a china shop. I don't trust him to do any fragile/high risk tasks because there's a risk he will go in overly confident and break something (Ie, I do not trust him to carry my laptop), and if I ask him to do something, there's a solid chance he will not remember what i asked (example: We went somewhere on a weekend trip, and I asked him multiple times to load a cardboard box, a crate, and a wagon in the car. We made it down the road with ONE items.). I trust him with tasks now that I would feel confident giving to my 15 year old brother.

&amp;#x200B;

Amongst other things, I'm just kind of over it. In the middle of all this, I got laid off suddenly a week ago. I went from a 6 figure salary to nothing overnight. I'm still figuring out what to do next, my family is across the country and if I break up with him right now, I have no one emotionally close or to help me with anything. The holidays are also just around the corner, and I already bought the plane tickets a month ago for us to go spend thanksgiving with my family. I was planning to stay here for christmas, because it's too expensive to fly to see my family and board my dog that week. His birthday falls right in the middle of all the holidays too.

The final straw as circa 2 AM this morning--He spent the night at my house, and I'm so out of it right now I forgot to take the trash can out. My trash pickup comes at 2 am. I heard them coming down the road, was very upset, and realized I couldn't make it to the street in time. His response was to yell at me from bed and tell me, ""It's fine, I'll just take the trash to the dump this week (no he wont, also there's a lot of gross stuff loose in the can)."" then ""Omg we missed trash pick up? You're right, we just kill ourselves."" None of which I feel like is a very empathetic response to someone who just got laid off and is having an emotional crisis for the last few days.

And the last thing she told me that it was different, which to this day, I still don't know what it means. I felt hurt at the time and tears came down because of how hurt I have been.

We'll call her S. We broke up because I wanted to be alone and work on myself but I do want to get back together with her. I have a history of emotionally cheating on her and making her feel like an option so her terms for reconciliation are that I take the time apart to work on myself like I said instead of pursuing other women because to her it feels like I'm telling her to wait for me while I explore before I settle. I agreed to those terms.

Flash forward to now, S and I have gotten really close. I realize that I have issues with communicating and opening up to her. We were together for 3 years and have known each other for 6 and I'm just now communicating with her and respecting her basically. During this time though, I have gotten really close with a coworker, T. T and I are in similar situations and I've been talking to her a lot and we both just vent what we wouldn't say to our partners. T has a very flirty personality and we end up flirting occasionally through text or in person. I think it's just platonic. 

Recently, I was hanging out with my ex and she noticed I was on my phone and hiding my screen so she wouldn't see my texts. I guess she got nervous given that I've cheated on her twice and openly told me that she's a little worried I'm crossing a boundary. She said that she knows we're not together but she made it very clear that she doesn't want to waste her time anymore and if im just repeating making her an option she'd like to know so she can move on. I voluntarily showed her my phone to let her know I'm committed to keeping my promise. Then she saw my texts to T and how we were flirting with each other. She immediately shut down.

I get where she's coming from because while we were together and going through a rough patch, I emotionally cheated on her with a coworker, K. During that time S was working on herself and trying to find ways to get us out of a rough patch. For context, this incident was the second time I cheated on her so I guess S got suspicious of my behavior, went through my phone, and found out I was flirting with K and I admitted that I was cheating on her emotionally. 

I'm trying to get S to understand that I know what I did before was wrong but this isn't what I'm doing with T. She's been distant and has been very very angry with me. Idk if im an asshole because it feels like she doesn't want me to have female friends and that's not fair. I genuinely enjoy T's company.

I wasnt tryna get with her or anything cause it couldnt happen. Sometime later my friend (M) got with this girl and things happened. She told him I told her i had feelings. 

Now my Friend (M) is angry or whatever at me for still shooting my shot even though i knew that he liked her. I knew that eventually they would get together. I wasnt ""shooting my shot"" or anything to get with her. 

What i dont understand is that fact that he is angry at me for admitting feelings to her, but he was destined to get with her anyway. Why does he care so much? He got the girl. He succeeded I'm very annoyed at him.

Long story short, we started fighting (mostly) because she was quite often drunk when I got back home (she didnt work for quite some time and obviously started drinking heavily due to boredom &amp; fighting). However, we had two incidents, one in June and one in September that got me really worried. It happened after a bad fight and lots of alcohol.

In both incidents, she had a few days of REALLY scary behaviour. 

In the first incident, she was absolutely convinced that our first neighbour is telling bad stuff about her, that he can see in our house (houses are merged, we share a wall and terrace), that she will sue him etc.

This first time I didn't really know what to make of it (she had nothing like that before), I even thought that it might be possible she heard something and just drawn the wrong conclusions.

However, after a fight in September, I absolutely knew something was off.

A day or so after the fight she texted me while I was hanging out and told me that the whole neighbourhood has some videos of us fighting &amp; are sharing it on social media. She even told me that some people came and yelled stuff about her in front of the house (stuff I said during the fight, e.g that she has a problem with alcohol). I rushed home to see what was happening, and she seemed fine (not drunk), but convinced that the neighbourhood has videos of us fighting, how her life is ruined, etc.

She was in that mode for a few days and I asked her to go to her parents house because this environment is not good for her and that she needed to reset. She is still there (I told her I needed a break because that scared the sh*t out of me &amp; she wants to go back with me).

I am in dilemma because I dont know if this is some kind of a psy break because she was under stress from all the fighting and alcohol, OR was it something like a start of mental disease?

I know its a bit long post, but i am really depressed and anxious and i am in the toughest period of my life, and would appreciate your kind suggestion :(

I loved a girl deeply whom I met 4 months ago, we met for the first time in my country, where she spent her exchange semester, she came to visit and i asked if we can meet, we met she seemed quite interested in me on the first date and she was just looking at me while i was a bit shy but we hugged and kissed each other and i booked a hotel where we spent some nights together and had sex. it was more like a dream come true for me as she was so beautiful.

She came to Germany due to her business trip and i went to her country we met continuously and we have had sex every time plus we enjoyed each and every second specially me. i bought her presents, and once flowers and always bought something for her which she likes.

Once she mentioned her therapist told her she needs a good sex, and she thanked me multiple times, things went quite far and i become very attached to her as she was sharing each and everything with me, calling me, and wanted to talk almost everyday even i was busy but i gave her all my availability and time. i thought she loved me as she was always interested to meet me as we stayed quite far but she always wanted me to take the first step, i took paid and unpaid leaves from my work just to meet her and spent time with her.

while i assumed she loves me, but it was more like FWB thing for her which i got to know after some months. she sometimes said you are good friend etc. but everytime we went on a date, i paid for the restraunt, grocery and even whenever she bought for herself i paid for it, i don;t know probably my stupidity.

I got signs of being used sometimes but i ignored them as i loved her, eg: she asked me to book a theme park which she likes and wanted me to pay for her, until i asked should i sponsor ur ticket too, she said no no i can pay for u too as u are a good friend, and i told her no thanks we can split it.

things became worst when we met on a date 2 months ago, when we went on a restraunt and i paid there after we ate, and went a bit fast to the door, while i saw she is still sitting and i went back, which made her feel angry and mad at me, i felt sad as she misunderstood and i told her i came back for u as i didn't notice, she was a bit rude u went fast and bla bla, my fight language is just to stay silent so i don't say something wrong which might hurt her. she bought something afterwards from a store for me and i had my flight and she had a train to her city, i decided not to go with her and made a excuse on which she said f\*\*k you which made feel sad and because of what happened in restraunt and her words, and i decided to leave the appartment and she started to cry and appoligized and said she says it as a joke to her friends and they dont mind while i cried for the issue of restraunt and also her words(probably it was my childish part) but it hurted me.

She used to text me almost everyday but after that she stopped to contact and was contact every 2 3 day. It made me feel anxious if something is wrong after a lot of struggles I asked what she feels for me yesterday and she responded you are a nice person and no one treated me like this u treated me like ur gf maybe in future I might get same feelings like but then she said she don‚Äôt want to give me any hope. and i deserve someone nice.

It made me feel heartbroken. I don‚Äôt know why I love her. Even after this my mind is not ready to cut off. What I should do here? I don‚Äôt know why I care so much for someone for whom I am more like a option. she sees my messages sometimes and replies after 2-3 hours which was not the case before.

I don‚Äôt know why I am holding on to her but I would be grateful if someone can advice me something It‚Äôs my first relationship and which never even existed :( and i can't even focus on my job nor my studies, i am checking her insta and fb almost everyday and thinking about her and these thoughts are making me feel dipressed, i can't even have a therapy as its very hard to find it in germany if we don't speak german :( I would be grateful for your kind advice and suggesion. as i live alone her while parents live far away from me nor i can share it with my friends.

First she just doesn't have conversation over text. It's usually very practical texts that are short. She also waits a very long time to text me back. Usually an hour or two, but some times it's half a day or so later. She even told me when she was with her friend that they thought it was weird that she would see my texts and would ignore them. I told her that I'm happy that she has her own independent life but it does bother me a little to know I'm being ignored.

Another warning sign is that whenever we make date plans they're always tentative plans until the day before. We've never actually canceled a date, but she still doesn't like to finalize the time until just before. She is also normally 5-10 minutes late to our dates. There's always a good reason, like taking care of her dogs, but it makes me not feel like a priority.

To me these signs read as not wanting to overcommit to the relationship yet, but she also making longer term plans for us like to watch all 8 harry potter movies over the next 8 weeks and being the only guy she's introduced to her dogs in over a year, so there's a some mixed signals.

She is also extremely introverted, went to all girl private catholic schools, is a lawyer and is very independent. When we're together things feel very different. She's started giving me a kiss when she first sees me and usually snuggles in close to me. I'm coming out of a long term relationship and I know that she's never been in a long relationship at all.

The house is in her name, and I am posting the mortgage and some extra since she put down the down payment. Her credit was much better than mine. She loved her area and never visited me (due to the circumstances) in my hometown, but still made the sacrifice and moved to my area. She did this because I make twice her salary, but my qualifications are very, very specific to this area.

She has not been happy here. Her new job is extremely boring and COVID made socializing impossible. I have been intentionally pivoting my skillset to be more generic for the past couple years, as I liked her area as well. 

A traumatic event happened to her a few months ago and now she cries almost every day. I think she's depressed, but she doesn't want to see someone. Instead, she insists that the next new project will help, but she commits to something for a short while and a few weeks later she's back to crying, either due to stress or because it wasn't what she wanted.

Before we moved in together, we made an agreement that we'll give it two years, but I genuinely don't know if she can last. Everytime I bring up the idea of moving, she tells me that I'm the one who brought her here and basically I'm an asshole for NOW trying to get up there. We both would have to get new jobs, then apartment or house hunt.

A few days ago, she found out that I had turned down a job, before she moved down here, that would have let me work from up where she was. For some reason, she believes that I primarily turned it down because it was a few grand less than what I was making. In fact, I turned it down because the job would have immediately set me up for failure and stress out of the yin yang. It was doing everything that I was trying to avoid because I simply hated it and could not get the hang of. 

Last night, she dropped it on me that she thinks we're falling apart. I felt like we were doing well. The only thing I can think of is that my anxiety has been really high lately and something about that made her  think I didn't care about her. I recognize her feelings mimic something that happened to me with depression, so my brain is also wondering if that's where it came from. I just want her to be happy. 

I can't help but wonder, if she's this depressed since moving down here with me, maybe I am the problem. Maybe she'd be better off without me. She is independent, wonderful, smart, and all good things and I know she'd be fine without me, but I love her. And I also don't want her to have this huge house debt because of me. I'm working on paying her back, but I don't know how that'll work if we split. She wouldn't keep the house if we split. 

How can I support her and let her know we're alright? Is there a way to encourage her to seek help?

But having a partner and friend is different and I do feel lonely a lot in some ways.

She said it was to get rid of him as it was his last request when they broke it off. He offered to continue hidden but she said no. 

Yes it's weird i don't see it as logically or a valid excuse, i fully do not understand her way of thinking in general. She has no emotion, she's ungrateful, she can be very controlling and everything is a competition or a conflict. It's like she is emotionless in every environment and feels very heartless at times when she talks about people or family. She sometimes does try and ""play along"" though but it's confusing. What do i mean by this? She never gives compliments and never tells me i'm doing well, but will jump at the chance to tell me i've done something incorrect or badly in her eyes. i told her i loved her and it took a long time for her to say it back, it was like it was painful for her to say it. when we fight she will bring up weird things like that though that give the impression the reason she is saying the words back to me etc is to satisfy my need, and she doesn't really care or mean it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's partially some of the background (sorry it's long i know!), when i'm single i relax, go to bed on time and laugh, watch tv, films, chuckle, go out with mates and do hobbies that i enjoy! with her currently (and i've forgot the last time i felt happy)  but it seems she loves to make me feel bad or start conflict out of nothing. 

The last two examples of the unnecessary conflict are - 

1. She is staying at my house for the next 4 weeks on and off due to her work being closer from here, she is not a morning person and saved 30mins travel, i get up before her, make breakfast, wake her up and prepare her lunch for the day and make sure she is not late. She is upset with the work  and came home crying on her first day. I consoled her and tried to make it better by reassuring her that it will be ok and will not last long.  I make her dinner and get her a drink, i have a headache and i'm tired as she always moves in bed and makes it hard to sleep, i end up sleeping elsewhere because of this. As i give her the plate she is asking me ""what's up?"" i tell her that nothing is up i've just got a cold and a headache and i'm tired from no sleep. She disregards what i say and thinks there is something up with me and starts to act quiet.  later on my cat jumps up on my lap and i affectionately call the cat a ""pet"" name that i also call my girlfriend. She starts asking why i call the cats the same name as her, ""you love the cats more than me"" she states. This is done is a way that means i can't relax and have to respond and accept that it's going to be another long discussion or argument over something silly. This time i'm so tired i can't put up the front of calmly replying to her and accepting that her weird intense ways of asking are ""normal"" to her so i just explain that i love the cats and i love her and the words i use are used for ""people"" i love. it's a term i use when i feel a bond and connection. She keeps asking and it makes me anxious as i feel like i'm being interrogated, we are just about to sleep so now i'm on high alert and stressed. I sigh and say ""really? why are you doing this? it's like you want a fight?"". She twists this back on me later when i ask if she has chilled out now and she says ""have you?!"" and will not resolve the fight / argument / misunderstanding, but simply want to do something else.... This type of scenario happens way too often.

2. She might be allergic to wheat, in the past i thought i was, and i might still have an intolerance, but as it's mostly her staple diet of wheat she was upset, i eat a lot of proteins but i decided as she was sick i would also try again to eat no wheat with her and at her request bought a bunch of different breads and pasta all gluten free. She decides part way through the 3rd day to stop it and go back to wheat due to reasons i'm still unclear about, as it was helping with her pains. there was no communication about stopping, it was in the middle of a meal and i picked up a piece of the gluten free bread just after. later that night she then lectures me for 1.5 hours in another very aggressive and intense way that i'm an idiot and she thought i was intelligent but  I'm clearly not if i'm giving up gluten without the doctor telling me too. I explained that i was not  doing it to see myself and mostly to support her at the time where she was getting emotional and upset over having a restricted diet. She will never agree or see things from my side and always thinks i'm doing things for me not her... when clearly in a lot of other occasions that are for her. You would have to bend the truth and my actions with extreme overthinking to think i was buying her ""good luck"" balloons and flowers for an exam for me ... for another example (sorry i digress!) 

I've not smiled or joked like i used to with friends for a long time. When i'm with my girlfriend i'm constantly thinking what i'm going to do or say that will avoid upsetting her. She never relaxes and puts me down for watching tv or playing a game after work after i've worked hard all day and cooked for her also. She is currently not working full time due to her education, it feels like she is pushing her anxiety on to me and making me feel bad for not working 24/7. if i try and bring any of this up with her she goes full on rejection mode and tried to say ""watched tv all the time i don't care i will work here and you can stay at yours and watch tv all night then"" . When really i just want a nice work / life balance and to have some quality FUN time with her.  

I cook for her, i wash up and i help clean, when i help her out with jobs like diy etc she never says thank you and says that she expects that from a boyfriend. 

in all honesty i feel she doesn't respect me but i'm trying to be the energetic and perfect boyfriend here to try and keep her happy but i'm sad and tired and i need to know if there is a way to salvage this and make it better?

She almost always apologizes to me after the argument for being defensive or talking to me a certain way and says she will work on it, but not much as changed. She says she will work on it but she may never be able to completely get rid of these bad habits because that‚Äôs who she is and she wants me to accept that it may slip out time to time no matter how hard she tries.

They have been dating for maybe 9 now.

Julie presents herself very piously, but tends to pick-and-choose which Catholic rules she follows.

She had one long-term boyfriend of years, whom she cheated on WITH my brother, before dating my brother.

At first, my family was as upset as me, but they look down on my brother. They believe because he has little going for him with school and work, that he is not going to do better than a girl like Julie.

Julie does not believe in birth control. She and TJ are depending on the pull-out method.... She also supports him financially. He has NO job, and lives with her. She pays rent, for groceries, and is even paying for his remedial classes since he failed his courses to graduate.

From my perspective, they are just as bad as each other. But ideally, both would move on and grow from this. It is evident Julie is ""making up for"" her mistake, and now they have ""sunken cost"", from many things they have shared.

Now, I am not as forgiving or understanding. I have no patience for cheaters. When I see her, I feel disgust and anger. I find it extremely hard to be around her, and have to force myself to not speak to her or avoid her, because I truly don't know if I can control being mean to her.

Either that or she was just going to have her friend show up without telling me which would just make everyone uncomfortable because i do not want to be around people who put me down or has put me down for my autism. 

This lead to big argument where she accused me of not wanting her to have friends which honestly i don't see how she can say.

I F(23) and my GF(24) are in a same-sex relationship in a country where people are very conservative about it. 

I never really had close friends. Throughout high school I dreamt about having a friendship where we can have fun, study together, etc. I was super lonely and never met any other lgbt+ friends. The first person who was ever my real friend and a partner was my girlfriend. She is the first person that made me go to a coffee/bar. She's been my closest person since and I will always respect her and her boundaries. 

At the beginning of my masters degree I met a gay guy in my program. He's super shy so we turned out to have the same poetry class. I do poetry and he loves reading. We started discussing art and in general became close. We can also talk about our different sexuality/gender experiences in a country where this isn't really accepted. We've known each other for half an year now and we get along very well. I send him drafts with my poetry (I want to share them with my gf too but she doesn't read them at all) and in return I help him with the theory of the course. He comes from a poor family so from time to time I bake for him to show appreciation. 

I do much more for my girlfriend. After all she is my partner, and I believe I love all people in my life equally, but differently. 

The other day she said I spend too much time with him and she's ""worried she is stupid enough to be with someone who cheats behind her back"". This comment hurt me a lot, I love her so much, but I appreciate him as a very close friend. These two are very different. Also, me and my gf live together, I take her places to spend quality time, so she sees me 95% percent of the time. (She even comes to my classes, although she isn't from my uni) I see this guy once or twice in a week, we literally grab coffee, talk/study at the library and that's it. I said to her I only hang out with him in friday after classes and we chat from time to time. We have common hobbies and it's fun. She was however super sceptical and said this is getting too much. I told her she can also meet him. I've told him I have a gf (he is gay as well).

Sorry, the title and the issue I'm having are a bit odd.

Bit of backstory:

I know this guy (We'll call him Sam) from my course at Uni. I wouldn't say we know each other very well. We've done some group study sessions together before, and I helped him run an errand into town - I also happened to be going to town anyway that day, so it all lined up. This was over the course of like 2 months.

The actual 'issue' I'm dealing with:

A few days after we'd been to town, he messages me out of the blue saying he's been hospitalised with pneumonia!!! He told me that he has a history of medical issues (including asthma). I don't know all the details, but yeah, this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. It was awful because the nearest hospital was pretty far away, so he was really isolated. On top of that, most of his friends were leaving pretty soon (the next week was reading week, lots of people go home for it) and none could visit him until after.

I didn't really know what to do, but I didn't want him to have this whole miserable week ahead of him, so I offered to come visit him and bring him things from his room that he might've left behind or wanted. I went a few days later and brought his stuff - I could only visit for an hour, unfortunately, due to the possibility of contagion. While there, we made some plans and stuff - we messaged his mum and she agreed to drive and come pick him up when he was discharged, so he could spend reading week at home and actually be looked after. Later in the week, I also emailed the university team who deals with extensions due to illness to let them know what had happened, they then contacted him about it all. He was luckily discharged a few days later, and went home to rest for the week.

He's back at uni now, but recovering slowly. It all sounds brutal.

This is definitely going to sound terrible, but I'm struggling a bit with it. I'm very happy to help him if he needs anything while recovering - I'm helping him with some chores and stuff later today. I'd also be happy to help if in future he had any other medical issues, or smaller issues or whatever.

I just don't want really want to be friends with him 'in general'. I'm very antisocial, if I'm honest, and not really a good friend type. I have about 3 friends here at uni and I already struggle to message them frequently, organise enough time with them, etc. Sam is perfectly lovely - I enjoy chatting to him when we do see each other. He's funny and friendly.

My avoidance to actually commit to being friends is not really anything to do with him as a person, I just don't think I could handle having another person who I have to remember to regularly set aside time for. I will happily help him where I can, but I don't want to become like 'good friends' who talk and hang out frequently. More like friendly acquaintances - wave and make small talk when you see each other.

And yeah, after typing that out I feel like my problem might just be ""I'm selfish, is there anyway I can do this selfish thing without receiving any consequences?"". I am naturally very selfish, but I don't want to be, so please call me out if that's the case.

I guess I just wanted to know if there were any reasonable way to go about continuing to help him without it coming across as 'we are now good friends'? Can we go back to just being friendly acquaintances or is that rude of me?

TL:DR; I visited a sort of friendly acquaintance while he was in hospital and I've been trying to help him while he's recovering.

I am lost. I don't know what to do. I'm watching my family fall apart right before my eyes and I feel as if I can't do anything to stop it. My heart hurts.

My (26F) Fiance (30M) and I just welcomed our first baby 6 weeks ago. We are living with my MIL and brother(his mother does not own it). Ever since LO arrived life has been a living hell. She oversteps her boundaries, is overbearing and make me feel as if I'm the nanny and she is the mother.

My fiance keeps letting her get in to his head. When I defend myself she will go and cry to him, make herself look like a victim, make me look bad and get her way. This often ends in him accusing me of basically manipulating him and having to defend myself. 98% of our arguments are because of his mom.

This morning she did it again. LO woke up crying because it was feeding time. Not even 1 minute passes and she bursts in the room saying ""What's the matter now?! He's waking up the whole house!"". I tell her ""He's a baby. He's going to cry. I'm sorry"" as I'm trying to comfort him. She then says ""I know"" and leaves.

2 hours later Fiance calls me on the phone(MIL is in the background crying and spewing nonsense about God knows what). I just hear him apologizing to her while I'm waiting on the phone for him to say something. He then tells me ""Things have to change. We'll talk later"". I agree and we both hang up the phone.

He then blows up my phone with messages like ""I didn't want to see it, but now I'm opening my eyes"", ""She is who she is, but she's my mom"", ""I've let you make all decisions for our son"" and ""I think your mom should only see him on the weekends"". I knew this was going to happen once I heard MIL crying in the background. He insists his mom has nothing to do with anything, but I know it's not true. This happens every time.

I have post partum depression and anxiety so this is getting too much to handle. I love my fiance and want our baby to have a united home, but I know that won't be possible if he doesn't take the blindfold off and stop letting his mom get in the way. He's brought up moving out many times as he can't take living with his mom anymore yet he always ends up acting as if everything has been magically resolved. We have the funds!!

Idk what to do anymore. I hate her so much for ruining my family!! She pushed his dad away with this behavior and now she's ruining our family too!!My fiance is allowing it by not taking off his blindfold! I want to reach out to his dad so badly as I am desperate to save our family. My heart feels broken.

He brought me out Saturday night for dinner and an event, and it was a really fun night until we got back to his place and we got into an argument over something so stupid.  I ended up leaving, not knowing that he ended up leaving after me to meet me at my house. 

Apparently he ended up speeding past a cop but kept going, roads were wet and he took a turn and crashed his car into a pole. That car is his baby and it‚Äôs totalled.

He lives alone and doesn‚Äôt have family other than a small support system.  He also has no car now which he requires to drive out to school which is 2 hours away.

Life really wasn‚Äôt going my way with law enforcement as a career choice with the way management is, and I‚Äôve been job hopping since to the point I finally decided to make a positive change in my life and join the military for ONLY 4 years. I‚Äôm currently unemployed but have my own house and passive income with my construction license. But when I decided to go into the airforce to enlist, It was like a switch had flipped on for me and I was driven and I completely detached myself from reality and family, and before then I have always kept a tight lock and key on my emotions bc the way society views men and how we‚Äôre supposed to hide our depression and anxiety. 

A few weeks ago I swear I met the love of my life, it‚Äôs like nothing I‚Äôve ever felt before and it‚Äôs like my heart and soul just knew. I‚Äôve been dating around for awhile since my break up in march but nothing really went anywhere and it was just girls using me but again it didn‚Äôt really affect me that much. But the girl I‚Äôm talking to now (22 F) has given me more anxiety than I have ever known how to deal with. We have a lot in common, she has a stable career in law enforcement which I‚Äôm happy for her, but now it‚Äôs like I almost don‚Äôt want to leave to the military and risk losing her. We‚Äôve spent time together every day she‚Äôs had off since we met which is actually incredible considering how tiring you can be after working shifts as a cop. With her time just stops and I feel like I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been, I breathe different now, it hurts when I‚Äôm away from her, it sucks having to be the one to worry about your partner at work rather than being the one worried about, and I‚Äôm just really scared of scaring her away and/or losing her. 

She had gotten out of a relationship as long as I had, only a month ago. We both admit to each other how much we deeply like and care about one another even in such a short time span. I admit that I loved her within a week and she was really happy and reciprocated it back without using the exact words bc she‚Äôs still recovering, but she also told me she wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. I‚Äôve been a lot more open with her more than anyone but she is still a little reserved bc she doesn‚Äôt want to get hurt.  I want to believe her bc of how she makes me feel, But I‚Äôve been used and led on so many times I just feel like I can‚Äôt trust it, and I have such bad anxiety now bc I don‚Äôt want to lose it.

We talk almost 24/7, Things are going good with us but I‚Äôm just so lost at what I should do as a career bc now I don‚Äôt want to enlist to stay close to her even though she said it would be fine and my depression has come back and I now have new found anxiety bc I over think a lot now due to my feelings for her‚Ä¶..

We're both Bi &amp; have had a FWB thing in the past. Things changed when we both got bfs (Lonnie-Ray27M, Me-Kai23M). We didn't see each other as much as we used to &amp; it upset Lonnie. She complained that things became ""weird &amp; awkward"" between us. She said it was because of her bf &amp; no matter how many times I said it wasn't, her &amp; Ray didn't agree. Lonnie can be really negative &amp; it was too much.

Later, she was asking if I thought the change was because we weren't intimate anymore. Saying how it was a big part of our friendship in the past. She then asked if we could sleep together, I said no. She stopped asking after I said Kai said no to it all.

May 2022 Kai &amp; I broke up. Ever since she's started back about us having sex. I told her I felt it would complicate things further. She disagreed &amp; Ray's okay with it. Lonnie asked if it's because I didn't think she was attractive anymore, I said no. She's felt insecure with us and with her &amp; Ray. Ray has a type, &amp; it's not her. He checks out other women &amp; watches thirst traps that upset her. Lonnie said he leaves her unfulfilled &amp; that she craves the ""intimacy between women"". I ignored it.

Week or so later, I went to hang with them &amp; we played games &amp; drank. At some point Lonnie put a move on me &amp; after some time I agreed. We ended up having a threesome in their room. I was pissed with myself the next day since I made it a point to not cave &amp; the first I drink it goes out the window. But whatever.

Days later, I get a call from Lonnie. She's crying, talking about Ray being an A-hole &amp; I ask why. She tells me that he took a video of the threesome. I was shocked. After asking some questions she tells me that she knew there's a camera in their room, to keep an eye on their things (they have shady roommates). I had no idea about that &amp; was upset. I said she should have told me because I wouldn't have had sex with them in their room had I known. Lonnie answered she never thought he would go back &amp; record it.

She went on to say that he sent himself my nudes off of her phone. I hadn't sent nudes in years. She said she keeps them on a secret album in her phone &amp; everyone does that. Which, I guess is true. But I was still upset. I felt so betrayed by them both, &amp; told her she was just as culpable in this as he is. That they both betrayed my trust. It became a huge argument &amp; I hung up on her.

She's gone around telling everyone I'm a homewrecker and ""a s\*\*t"". A lot of friends take her side because I have been ""a s\*\*t"" in the past. I had a pretty big casual sex phase a few years back. I've gotten nasty messages from friends about me ""trying to play victim after what you've done"".

I snapped, I went off on FB. It's caused a huge stir among friends &amp; Lonnie's family. Lonnie says I'm trying to ruin her life, turn friends against her, &amp; make her family hate her. I'm just so mad &amp; heartbroken about it all. Feels like everyone has been ganging up on me &amp; I wanted to set the record straight. I just want people to get where I'm coming from.

I cheated on her on holiday a few months ago, after I told her right after she also admitted to hooking up with a guy about a year ago. When it happenend she told me she only flirted and danced with him, I trusted her but she told me the whole story a year later. We¬¥ve been working on those issues a lot, but obviously it¬¥s still a big problem.

Since a few weeks she is in south east asia doing volunteer work, when we talked on the phone a week ago she told me about a guy there she likes and that she ""flirted and cuddled"" with him. I didn¬¥t say anything at first, but later admitted it made me feel uncomfortable, especially with her history of not telling me the whole story in things like this.

We agreed to talk about it, and had a phone call yesterday. It was awkward at first, but then she told me that she thought about the possibility of opening up our relationship. I didn\`t know what to say and just sat there quietly while she outlined her reasons. She thinks it could help us trust each other more after all that happened between us, and that she thinks it could really help our relationship.

I couldn¬¥t help but think about the guy she told me about, she assured me it wasn¬¥t about him, liking him just made her think about the idea of an open relationship. She said she wants to be honest with me and herself. Now knowing she has those thoughts and needs makes me feel like shit. Everytime I try to explain that to her she only tells me she had good intentions and that she thought it might be good for our relationship and the both of us individually.

I¬¥m really confused and can¬¥t think straight at the moment. Every time we talk she just tells me I don¬¥t even try to see her reasoning. I think I understand her thinking in this matter, she likes the idea of being honest to each other about finding other people attractive, and being able to have fun with them while being honest to each other about it and without doing it behind the other persons back, and therefore hurting them. I told her I don¬¥t like the idea, but she still tried to convince me.

She keeps telling me she\`s just being honest with me, that she likes the idea of an open relationship and if I don¬¥t that¬¥s fine. But I feel like that¬¥s not a question where you can just answer no and then taht¬¥s that. It feels weird knowing that¬¥s what she wants. It feels weird knowing that she¬¥s telling me this now that she likes this guy, even though she assured me it¬¥s not because of him ( she told me that situation only made her think about it and realize an open relationship could be a possibility).

We met online and had a bumpy start with drama, mostly related to a lack of communication and sex. 

We grew into each other and accepted the others' differences, but always came back fighting about the original issues. I do have an anxious attachment style and I‚Äôm pretty sure he has an avoidant one. Every time I start talking about issues and how we can solve them, he always thinks I‚Äôm starting a fight and becomes very defensive. I tried multiple ways, of how I phrase it and in what situations I bring it up, without success. 

One of our biggest issues is that I am a highly sexual person, and he‚Äôs not. For him, it‚Äôs not a big deal if we don‚Äôt have sex in a month and for me, it‚Äôs devastating. Usually, we have sex once or twice a month (since the start), which is way too little for me but I love him and I love the life we‚Äôve created over the years. I couldn‚Äôt imagine even thinking of leaving a man like him for something like this, but here I am struggling with my thoughts. 

He‚Äôs truly the kindest, most warm-hearted person I‚Äôve ever met. He would never cheat on me and I can‚Äôt imagine a better life partner. Except that I‚Äôm in a constant fight with myself over not getting my needs met, in terms of communication and sex. I suggested to schedule sex 2x a week so we keep it up to speed and make it a habit but there‚Äôs nothing he wants less. I also suggested an open relationship and that is not even an option, for him. 

We‚Äôve been talking and fighting about this for years, and nothing changes so we have booked couples therapy for the upcoming week, as we cannot solve this ourselves. He ensures me that he thinks I‚Äôm attractive but this behavior doesn‚Äôt make me believe him, and I know he‚Äôs not unfaithful as I know he and his previous relationships have had the same frequency in sex. He recently told me he has anxiety and is an overthinker, and that might be the root of the cause. I‚Äôm trying to be the best partner I can be and be supportive but I need the psychical part after years of rejections and fighting. I‚Äôm exhausted.

People say ‚Äúsex is everywhere, but support commitment and loyalty are not‚Äù. The quote haunts me because he is all of that, except sex. Anyone that‚Äôs been in the same situation? How did you solve it?

I see him online all the time yet he does not reply because he was ""busy"" at the moment or he chooses to call me at a time when he knows I won't be available.

Now yesterday I sent him a message and I saw that he was online on multiple sites. I did not say anything but I took snapshots. When he finally responded after a few hours, I confronted him. He said he does not know why it shows that he was online because he was asleep. If it was only one app, I would have believed it but I saw him coming and going on those sites multiple times during those hours. He simply denied it and said he does not know anything about that.

It is almost a everyday routine how she says ""I wanna die"". And this has come to a point where I don't know how to deal with it anymore. Everything I do has a reaction on her. And I feel I can't keep going . She has been to therapy before being with me and stopped being on meds . I've tried to get her back to therapy but it's really hard to get her there.

Her mom and her don't really have a good relationship but at the same time she does listen to her mom. But she doesn't seem to do anything with her , she only tells me about how she's suicidal and sometimes even threatens me with suicide . Not directly but this is a common occurence nowadays , "" tell me I can die so I can die "" ie asking for permission from me. I just don't know how to deal with this situation anymore.

I feel terrible because a part of me just wants to get over with it but I do love her and hence I can't let myself do it. But she pushes all my buttons and I know she just wants to me give her permission to die. 

Breaking up isn't an option because anything close to breaking up I'd do it gets into a very bad mess ( I've tried multiple times ) . She doesn't tell me she'll kill herself if I break up but it is indicated . And she begs to me if I do break up . I want an out because I just feel really bad .

Anything I do ( be it not wanting to hang out one day owing to having work/college ) she would get sad/suicidal and this inturn dials back to being my fault , me being not caring and I just feel this is something I don't want to go through.

Last time I got her on meds and therapy but she doesn't wanna go to therapy and the meds ran out and things got worse , to the point that when I said I can't hang out with her/be with she got angry and i just felt not nice so I sort of didn't wanna keep chasing her. Seeing that she started to poke me trying to make me talk and saying sorry but I wasn't feeling so good but she turned really annoying and when I asked her to leave me alone she kept telling me "" either talk to me or let me die , tell me I can die"" and i really felt disturbed . I thought she was bluffing/she won't do it and more I just didn't feel like it. That ended up me feeling scared and she actually writting me a sorta suicide note which made me call her mom, a bunch more people . I got really scared , and this happens quite a while.

I'm not perfect and I feel like I'm her abuser because most things do stem from me , and after this particular incident her mom thinks I am not good for her and that I don't respect her and part of me feels the same now , I don't wanna be involved anymore but I cannot break up. 

I don't know what to do but I've grown as pessimistic as her and I know at the end one day I'll slip and she'll do what she wants to , and I am scared that'll break me for ever . Because i do think it is my fault . 

And I don't know what to do about it, I feel really stuck in one place and i can't really talk to her . I'm not a great boyfriend but I try my best to be there for her. But it's just hard to be there for a person , take them out every day just to keep them from killing themselves . It's just really tiring and hard and I feel really not good about it.

I think we may have rushed into things. We met online and had a talking stage of about 2 weeks, then told our parents and met up on a date. That was supposed to be like the beginning of our relationship marking us as 'official'. I think that may have been a mistake.  I really like my boyfriend, I'm attracted to him, I like his personality and he treats me well. That's part of what makes it so hard to accept we may not be compatible. 

He texts me throughout the day which is great, but I'm someone who needs a lot of attention. Even though we text throughout the day, we don't really go back and forth a whole lot if that makes sense. I understand a lot of people may think I'm crazy or excessive, but this is just kind of a need for me in a relationship. We don't call every day either. The other night we were on the phone and messing around, kinda teasing each other and he said ""I don't have to be calling you right now."" I said, ""Do you want to be calling me right now?"" He said "" I wanna be watching my show"" I was kinda quiet after that. I know he was joking and everything, but I've heard people say before "" guys are always joking, but they're never really kidding."" 

Yesterday the not texting was kind of eating me up, because I'm in a stressful situation right now, and this is the type of thing  I'd like to talk to my boyfriend about. He had helped me earlier in the day but more stuff had happened and I was just kinda struggling. He did end up texting me and we called. On the call, I asked him whether his last girlfriends were high maintenance or low-maintenance. He said his last gf was relaxed, but his first and longest was high maintenance and needed to be texted every 30 minutes or she'd freak out on him. He said it was really stressful and he's trying to be more relaxed. 

I can totally understand how that would be stressful. I don't want him to be stressed and I don't need a text every 30 minutes but it would be nice if he would text me more on days I can't see him. I understand I require a lot but I don't know if its simply a me problem or we just aren't compatible. I mean I know I need to be less codependent, but I also know there are guys out there who are needy like I am, and would maybe be a better fit. 

Last night he also warned me that a game he has been waiting for a long time is dropping on Friday. He said he will get pretty involved with this game for like a few days and likely won't talk to me very much. He said if I was at his house, we could still like be together and everything he would just be busy. I could live with that, but considering how I'm struggling as it is with our online communication, I really don't think I could handle him not talking to me for four days. I tried to express this to him but he wasn't really taking me seriously and told me it would be fine. So idek how I'm gonna handle that, because I don't know if I can go to his house every day for 4 days. That's another element though.

He's great in person. He's actually kind of the clingy one in person, he likes to be on me and stuff and everytime we hang out he wants to hang out all day, which is newer for me since I'm used to hanging out with ppl like maybe 4 hours at a time.  I hang out with him from like 1 pm-9 pm though.(which I love). That's a hard part too. We both live at home still and we don't drive, so I really can't see him every day, it's simply not plausible. If I could, the texting thing wouldn't be a big deal at all. 

I just don't know what to do. It's gonna be hard for me to break it off with him if I had to, but I could do it.  It's hard for me to leave relationships in general.  I have had 4 relationships including him. The first was statutory, the second was with a guy who I wasn't attracted to and didn't feel that way for really, but he asked me out and I said yes, that was the longest. The last one was very toxic and with a manipulative guy 23 years my senior. As you can tell, I don't have the best track record with relationships, and I'm always scared to leave because I know it will be a long time before I'm in another.

If we aren't compatible then there's no point in us staying together, it would probably be better to end it sooner than later, so we get hurt less. However, If I'm simply being irrational/ the odds of me finding a guy who is needy like me is slim, then I don't wanna throw away a good thing over nothing. I'm unsure what to do next.

Thoughts?

TLDR;  I am needy and need a lot of attention. I recently got in a relationship with a good guy, who I don't think can give me all the attention I need, so at present, I'm kinda unhappy. He recently warned me a new game has dropped and he will essentially be ignoring for 4 days starting Friday.  If I could find a guy I'm more compatible with that would be good, but If I'm just being crazy and the likelihood of me working out with anyone is low, then I don't wanna throw away a good thing.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7555621,public,self,I think my(19 F) boyfriend (19M) and I may not be compatible.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvzofb/i_think_my19_f_boyfriend_19m_and_i_may_not_be/,all_ads,6,
