Our personalities match pretty closely so seeing her in person is always a fun time, the same goes for DMing her. 2 weeks afterwards I asked her out for a date which unfortunately due to schedule mismatches took another 2 weeks to happen but it did and it was 2.5 hours of laughter and non-stop chat, it went better than I could've hoped for.

Unfortunately, after I walked her to her door she gave me an awkward hug and explained to me that due to coming out of and rushing into long-term relationships for the past few years she's too closed off emotionally to get into anything and wants some time to be with herself only, even though we do have a connection and she does really enjoy my company. I told her that I was more than happy just being friends and maybe in the future when she's figured her stuff out we could have a second date, an idea she seemed open too.

Since then I've still seen her at our society meetings and have shared drinks with friends, all of which haven't been awkward and very enjoyable. We'll normally share quite a few laughs and individual conversations. There is still a feeling of solid friendship but she doesn't really reply to messages anymore, as in she'll take a couple days (maybe longer) vs a couple hours and the conversation doesn't really go anywhere.

I have very little dating experience and absolutely no relationship experience so it's pretty hard for me to gauge where the line is (though upon writing this it seems a bit clearer). I don't want it to become one of those ""let's be friends"" things that fades into nothing because I really enjoy the time with her but I also don't want to try push too much in the opposite direction and make her uncomfortable around me.

Now I've written this out it seems a lot more obvious what I should be doing but even still, am I worrying too much about this? Is it too much to expect a similar (but lesser) level of relationship to before our date?

We were very much in love and even talked about getting married.

He ended by saying that he still treasures our friendship and would still like to be friends.

That was about four months ago. I am still very devastated by it. He was my best friend and he completely broke my heart. I was trying my best to find a job close to him but he essentially told me that if I was good enough to get a job close to him, he would consider dating me again. This was very hurtful and after the breakup I asked him to stop contacting me. 

I was just getting my life back on track when a few days back, he contacted me again and shared a job advertisement. I tried to be formal to play it cool but for the next 2-3 days all I could think about was the breakup and him. I decided to tell him a bit sternly that I wish to be left alone.

Typing this out helps me heal, and vent and especially try and analyse and explain my intense hatred towards my ex, his family and his new girlfriend. My ex is 26m and I am 21f, and no, age was not an issue between us but maturity definitely was. He would take more interest in drinking, nights out, female friends, having no deeper thinking while I on the other hand would pride myself in reading, understanding life and especially my relationship and value to others. We were both two peas in way different pods, to the point where when I first video called I actually wanted to block him but I gave him a chance because he has heart conditions, and overall I wanted to feel loved.

Our relationship spiralled out of control when he began putting others infront of me, and ultimately , I lost him the same way I found him. He had sexual and romantic relationships with his female best friend which he had to cut off, which extended into him having relationships sexually and romantically with co workers and the girls across from his work place. You’d always think accountants are so busy on excel, they are actually quite busy in the room lol. However, our relationship involved me always finding nudes on his phone, sexting messages and he would blame me for him cheating on me saying it’s because “I don’t listen” and “I insult him” which only really started when I found out the dirt he was doing to me.

He would growl at me, bang his head on walls and counters, scream at me and blame me every single time, he made me want to take my life. everything seemed better than having to deal with him, but it also seemed worse being without him. we were trauma bonded.

The thing that hurt me most is- his family were aware of one particular relationship he was having with his co worker. A chartered accountant girl,  while I remained finishing my degree in the hopes of landing an amazing job which I did right after we ended. So, because he wanted this girl, and the benefits she gave him (80/20 rule) him and his family invited me to their house, swore and insulted me and he made up some coward excuse and told me “his family will never like me because i’m an embarrassment to their name” and the next day he was messaging his girlfriend on instagram and told me “I wanted you to see the messages I sent to her” and “I never was going to get engaged or marry you, so move on”

He discarded me like I never meant anything. And left me two weeks before my birthday. And a day before my huge final assignment.

I just turned 18 and I have never picked up a call from him since middle school.

Mentally I have a long history of being in and out of psych for BPD, PTSD, and bipolar from childhood trauma. I have mobility issues and have recently had a brain surgery. I am on SSI and have been since 22. I have never been employed but am going to school now to hopefully become a phlebotomist, tbh I'm not that hopeful because of my diaabilites, but that's not what I came here to talk about. A year and a half ago I met someone online who we'll call K. K convinced me to leave my long term on and off abusive partner (of 10 years) who we'll call J. J was abusive because he slapped me when he found out I cheated on him previously a few years ago and he SA'd me in my sleep.  When K and I started talking he was a drunk and an addict and has now been sober for almost 11 months, but used to drink a lot every day and now says that's why he used to tell me things like ""I'm going to get a job and move out of my parents house and come and get you"" after I told him about what J did to me (K and I literally live across the US from eachother) but me having BPD quickly formed a favorite person attachment and found what I thought was a safety net out of my abusive relationship. I ended up moving to the other side of the US (closer to K) because J was moving to live with his grandparents in a state close to K and wanted me to come with, and I figured it would make it easier for me to get to K, but I ended up moving back to my home state because it wasn't working out with J. K convinced me to break up with J at this point, as I had told J we would be in a long distance relationship, but now that I was away from him that was unnecessary. K and I decided that I should stay single and focus on my self for a while because at this point I had been in back to back relationships since I was 14 but it didn't last long and we started a long distance relationship, but for the weirdest reason? He had grown conserned over the amount of guys I was messing around with online, while I was still also sending him nudes this whole time, so he decided to actually make me his gf ""for your own sake"" because me acting out sexually online was self-defeating behavior, because I would always regret it later.. but we broke up after I kept ""obsessing"" over ""what we were"" because I was under the impression we would move in together someday (like he told me all those months ago) 


Anyway, that was 6 months ago, about 2 weeks after that I found out I had to have brain surgery. I had the surgery 3 months later, and I recovered ok. I ended up having to put school on the back burner for now because of it but I'll be resuming in the summer. For now I'm mainly focusing on therapy and recovering from the surgery and the complications I have from it (I developed migranes -from- the surgery even though the Drs insisted migranes were a symptom before the surgery lmao that's a funny one) so the main issue this entire time is the fact that I want to meet him and be with him and that I left my ex for him (there's a lot more that goes into that, but I don't feel it's relevant) and I feel like he used the idea that we might get together someday as a metaphorical carrot on a stick to get me to leave J, because he knew that if I didn't have that ""safety net"" of a next relationship I wouldn't of left because I was so used to being in back to back relationships at that point. I feel lead on. He even admitted to me at one point that he had used his past to get me to like him more so I would leave, let me explain TW: self harm/bloodplay. I have been self harming since I was 14, K told me that he used to practice bloodplay in his early 20's with some girls but he hadn't done it in a really long time, but he would be willing to do it with me when we got together. He later went back on this and every time I bring it up be tells me I'm fucked up for being into it. When he broke up with me 6 months ago be told me if I figure out some of my shit in therapy then we can get back together, and now he tells me he doesn't want to date someone who has a physical/mental disability ""that could potentially cost hundreds of thousands of dollars"". Is he right? Do I just need to get over him? How do I get over him? J was basically my highschool sweetheart, we were going to get married, we suffered loss together (our mom's committed suicide within 26 days of eachother a year after we met eachother) and J had saved me from a lot of really bad situations (this was also not the first time I cheated on him) so I just kind of feel like if I don't get with K then this was all for nothing?

So basically trying to get this off my chest because people have said things like these can help you move on….

I met my friend in the grade 9 ( we are 21 now), she switched schools but I went to visit her all the time at hers. Very early on in our friendship she told me she had feelings for me. I was very anxious and shy about myself and romantic same sex relationships, so despite liking her back, I never really told her 100% that I wanted to be with her too. Long story short, I ended up with a long time guy friend and I introduced her to my guys best friend. They have now been together for two years and during their relationship and mine, we would always talk about how we had crushes on each other and I could still be with her if I wanted. We were very hot and cold and this drama caused us to kind of lose touch. Lots of arguments, and weird vibes. For example her boyfriend did not want me sleeping at her house without him and my boyfriend there as he would see it as a date. We’ve been friends for years at this point so that really hurt. It didn’t help that he was right. Because as much as I told her it would be fine, I was jealous of them and mad at myself for leading her on and not telling her I wanted to be with her equally. Then it became too late and we had this huge argument because I wasn’t talking to her very much for awhile because I was going through mental health issues. She was angry with me thinking I wasn’t putting in effort for our friendship. We haven’t spoken since like January so almost a year. 

I miss her still, very often I think about what could have been. She seems happier without me around and made it clear by ignoring my messages that she was just over it. So I just wanted to admit on here that I love her as a friend and more than that, and I’m sorry. I wish we could give each other another chance and I miss her. I miss her company and going to her house. I wish I was more confident back then and didn’t mess with her feelings and told her I liked her too. She seems happy from what I’ve seen and despite my hurt I just want to see her happy. I will have to accept that I am only going to be an item in her memory box(I gave her a ring that said keep fucking going because she was nervous of turning 20 and a card that said something sentimental. She was going to put it in her sentimental box) .

Td;lr: Anyways I obviously have feelings for her still and want them to go away.

(TW fears about SA)

I have had ocd my whole life and have been dating my boyfriend for 8 years. When I started dating my boyfriend my ocd started revolving around our relationship (I would get intrusive thoughts like “is he cheating on me?” (Stuff like that)

At the end of 2017 I had some really stressful life stuff come up. I transferred universities and he had to move for a couple months which caused me to have a lot of anxiety and ocd. It was pretty much just standard ocd checking things and then free floating anxiety. Anyways after I went to go visit him I was feeling sad bc I missed him and was having lots of just generalized anxiety. 

These thoughts started during the start of the me too movement and I read this article about a girls boyfriend assaulting her. This gave me such bad anxiety for some weird reason (I’ve never been assaulted) and I got an intrusive thought “what if this has happened to you” I started getting bad false memory ocd about things that did not happen and I thought I was actually loosing my mind bc my ocd had never been THIS bad before. I couldn’t figure out what Was going on but could not stop obsessing over rape/assault. I started doing all this research and was so scared this could have somehow happened to me. (It did not).  It would change my memories around and I knew none of it had happened but it gave me such bad anxiety. 

Eventually my boyfriend moved home ( I didn’t tell him any of this I literally tried to ignore it bc I didn’t realize this was ocd- I really thought I was loosing it) and everytime we would have sex I would have lots of intrusive thoughts (I wanted to have sex! But my ocd was so bad) and would kind of act weird. If he would initiate it I would say no and I would have to be the one to initiate or I would have to have a clear yes or no for either him or me bc my intrusive thoughts were so bad. 

This leads me to the current episode I have been obsessing over- me and my boyfriend were in bed and he asked if I wanted to have sex. I said maybe later (I didn’t mind if we had sex or not but my ocd was telling me to say no so i said later) This was later- We were laying watching a movie and about to go to sleep and he asked if we could just put it in and not have sex. And I said yes sure! (This was not coerced at all, he wasn’t constantly badgering me for sex or anything and I truly didn’t care and was totally fine with it) anyways we were laying there (just to clarify he did not start having sex with me.  no one was having sex at this point , I think he may have been falling asleep , or he may have moved but he did not start having sex with me) and I said “are we having sex yes or no?”  (also to add this was a non threatening situation I could have said no at any time and he would have stopped) when I asked if we were having sex or not he started moving a little but he didn’t say yes or no he just said “mm”. He was just kind of initiating it after I asked if we were gonna have sex or not (which initiated the sex in the first place) I then started having bad intrusive thoughts “why didn’t he give u an answer” “you need an answer to continue to have sex” “am I allowed to be having sex now bc I said maybe later” “is this actually rape?! U need an answer” and then I turned to him (we were laying on the side) &amp; we stopped having sex and said “are we having sex yes or no?” And he said yes yes it feels good and I said okay. And we had sex like normal.
Is this bad - or was it just a misunderstanding bc I wanted a clear yes or no at the beginning?

Does this sound anything like rape or just a misunderstanding and ocd intrusive thoughts? I am the one who asked if we were gonna have sex while he was already inside of me and I even stopped and turned and asked him again bc my intrusive thoughts were so bad. I never wanted to NOT have sex my ocd was just making me say all these things.  I remember I said to myself to my ocd “oh my god it’s not shut up”
 This whole thing is giving me anxiety bc it’s so weird and awkward and my ocd is trying to tell me somehow it is rape when I’m pretty sure it is not??? I keep reading articles about ppl who have actually been raped and then it gives me anxiety bc it all seems so subjective and my ocd is like how do I know what if I was and didn’t realize it and then it’s really bothering me that I had the intrusive thought is this rape? But logically if I wanted it to stop I would have said I don’t wanna do anything instead of literally stopping and then saying are we having sex yes or no? It doesn’t even make sense. 
I can’t even remember correctly bc my ocd is adding in false feelings to. And my ocd is making me ruminate over it and ask why did I ask if we were gonna have sex? And I’m pretty sure it’s bc I wanted to know if we were gonna have sex or not and that’s it!!! I even was the one who initiated it by saying are we gonna have sex!

 I even talked to my boyfriend about this and he confirmed that the only reason he started having sex with me was because I asked if we were going to have sex.
I told him my intrusive thoughts and it made him really sad and he told me it’s making him feel sick that I am thinking these things.
He won’t have sex with me either and he wants me to be the one to initiate it so there isn’t any confusion again. 

 I guess I’m just asking is any of this even bad? My ocd keeps going around in a loop and won’t stop. I keep having all these different variations of the event and it gives me such bad anxiety and it won’t stop. Im scared something bad happened even tho I know deep down it didn’t and it’s driving me crazy. I have a therepist and am working on all of it (he knows everything) but my ocd is still so so bad.

This is my second time writing this post  and I just downloaded reddit to post this 😭
Anyways,  there's been this guy –he's not exactly a friend nor are we dating– but we did admit to each other that we liked each other at some point , however I told him I'm not ready for a relationship and he said the same and we decided on not to date for the time being. After a while though, he started doing some romantic things and I'd let them slide because honestly at first I liked it but then it felt too much so again I did talk about how I don't want things to be romantic because I've already mentioned I'm not ready for a relationship and we should remain friends for the time being 
He got upset but he said I can take my time but again he's starting to slip in some romantic acts but when  I ask him he says friends can do it too, like he wakes up early and drives a lot just to get to uni and spend an hour or so with me even on his off days , he goes out of his way to buy me food and snacks before the lecture or after , bought me a new charger because mine was about to break , sends me good morning and goodnight texts everyday and gets slightly upset if I don't do it back and there are other things that he says such as  ""you're so beautiful "" ""I love your freckles"" ""you look hot"" and not to mention all the long stares when he thinks ""I'm not looking"" (to the point where some of my colleagues asked if we are dating) and so much more. He also says I love you often and expects me to say it back although tbh it makes me uncomfortable and he even asks me to tell him ""drive safely"" everytime he let's me know he's driving somewhere...
And something else that was a bit off , I changed his name in my phone back to his first name instead of his nickname and he got really upset which I guess is understandable then he pulled out his phone and changed my name too but I didn't react really then  suddenly he went awfully quiet , I kept asking what's wrong and if he was okay but he snapped at me saying ""what do you want?? Yes I'm fine ARE YOU okay?? (In an accusing tone as if I'm acting crazy or something) what do you want from me?"" I honestly got scared and discarded the whole thing but then I confronted him about it and he apologized saying he was too upset and he had things going at home but it was not an excuse , I'm not sure how to act about this , I did let him know I will not tolerate this behavior from anyone and not just him and he said that's understandable and how it should be. I'm not sure how to act from here ? 
I feel bad because I feel the romantic acts are all nice and anyone would like their partner to do them and even more but at the same time , like I mentioned we aren't even dating. I'm not sure if I'm  overreacting or not. And how should I act about that outburst ?

We lost touch with one another after going to middle school but we followed one another on social media for years. We caught back up once I saw that we went to the same college. He was still with his ex at the time who also went to the same college as us. I’d notice whenever I’d post a photo of me looking pretty nice he’d heart my story but I wouldn’t pay much attention to it. They ended up breaking up like last month. And basically after that he  tells me that he's been liked me and that he
wants to be more than just friends. So a few days ago before we went on thanksgiving break, I was getting to know him better and I started to consider giving him a chance. 

But then I noticed he kept whispering something to his friend and he was being a little off while on the phone. So he tells me he's gonna step out for a bit. So a few minutes go by, me and my friends go outside and we see him talking to his ex girlfriend. His ex girlfriend starts following him around and pulling on his
sweater and trying to be playful with him so I walk away and go to class. He tells me later on that he wasn't being playful back with her but he wasn't trying to hurt her feelings. He then proceeds to tell me that he only went out to
talk to her because had she came into the gym, she would have wanted to fight me and my friends because we were around him.

After that he goes and tells my friend that he wasn't trying to talk to her or act playful
with her like l assumed because she stays calling his phone off of burner numbers and texting him off burner accounts. But
then my friend sees once he switches to another account her Instagram is still in his recently searched. So now I am just like do l even want talk to him? Or am I just overreacting? Like do I really want to deal with a crazy ass ex who wants to fight me over a guy!? Not to mention I have a
class with his ex. As of today he has been calling me but I don’t answer. It’s a mixture of catching up on school work and just not wanting any parts of what he has going on.

We had been friends for 2 years before we started dating four months ago. T is sweet and very caring. Initially, we both found ourselves agreeing on everything and it seemed like we were pieces of a puzzle fitting together.

But now as time is passing by, we are almost always arguing about something or the other. For instance, if I ask him something about the classroom lecture, I would say things like ""You're so stupid"". He was also inconsiderate when I lost 8.5K before his birthday (which I had withdrawn for his birthday present). He casually said that now everyone is looking for your money and my birthday is spoilt. I feel sometimes feel he has a superiority complex and always makes me feel dumb. He wants things to work out his way and doesn't shy away from making hurtful sarcastic remarks. 

That being said, I wouldn't say I'm the best person either. I've conveniently procrastinated helping him when he had asked me to do an assignment for him (it's a common thing for us to do assignments for each other when deadlines are approaching). I've been through quite a number of bad relationships so I sometimes project my insecurities onto him. And though he always promises to improve, I'm very impatient. I'm considering joining therapy soon hoping it would improve the quality of my relationship with T.

T hasn't had much experience in dating so usually, it's me taking the call on how to resolve an argument. I really enjoy T's company when we're not arguing. And even during the worst arguments, I'm very sure I want this person to stay. But since I've had many failed relationships I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. Am I being too hard and toxic on T? Are my expectations of a person unrealistic? When and how many times should one take the high road and not quarrel?

Sex happens once a month, if not less. Both of us have expressed wanting more intimacy and sex at different points.

I know that for a lot of women, foreplay starts way before the bedroom and they require sexual build up throughout the day and to feel pursued and sexy to help them get in the mood, and my girlfriend herself has told me that she has responsive desire. I’d love to be able to provide all that, but the problem lies with trying to weave it into our busy lives.

We’ve got a toddler, as well as both of us working pretty much full time. We don’t see each other until it’s already just about time to eat dinner and go to sleep most days. We don’t have a night out of the week where it’s really possible for us to have any kind of date night or anything like that.

The daily routine at this point is that one of us goes to work for the day, the other stays at home with our toddler and by the end of it both of us are tired, there’s been zero build up, and I don’t initiate anything sexual because I don’t feel like I’ve done my job of trying to get her in the mood throughout the day and for the sake of letting her get as much sleep as possible before our next stressful day.

I had a good friend in college who I used to be very close with. He was a little older than me so he graduated a couple years before me. Right before he graduated, when I was 20 years old I got into my first serious relationship. 

Everything was great at first. He was 10 years older than me and he had his own money and was very career motivated. And of course he was funny understood me and loved me. Or so I thought. I also developed severe acne and felt so ugly. My parents were going through terrible financial problems and I literally sometimes couldn’t buy school supplies. He helped me. With everything. 

After I graduated, I moved to another state with him. I was so excited for this new beginning but didn’t know anyone. My acne in fact got somehow even worse. Where I worked I was bullied. I cried everyday. He made me feel beautiful. Until the abuse started. I won’t go into heavy detail but he had terrible drinking problems and he was a brewer. He would call me every name under the sun. Told me my family didn’t care about me. Told me I was lucky I had him cause no one else would stand that face of mine. Spit on me, threatened physical violence you name it. 

My friend from college came and visited me during this time. He knew something was wrong and he and my friend had a heated argument.. I don’t even remember what it was about. My friend told me I needed to leave and he’d buy me a plane ticket to come live with him. I knew he was right. But my partner and I had bought a house of furniture together. We had pets together. I was madly in love with kids I took care of. And to be honest I loved my abuser cause we had good times together. And had been through so much. I thought he would change if he got sober. In the meantime, he isolated me from friends and family. He told me my friend was jealous of our relationship.

After my friend left, I didn’t haven’t contact with him for awhile. My partner convinced me he was trying to ruin our relationship. He also would look through my phone and I didn’t want to upset him for my safety. 

Long story short, I got out of that relationship. It took me awhile but I did it on my own which I’m proud of myself for. But my friend and I recently reconnected and he told me last night that “abuse was a choice” and I could’ve left with him so I deserve what happened to me. That he needed me and I wasn’t there for him cause I chose to be controlled. I cried and apologized and he yelled at me and told me to handle my emotions. Do yoga, go run. I hung up on him and proceeded to think of past trauma all night. 

My question is, should I even try to salvage this friendship? He text and tried to callback apologizing. But it was extremely hurtful. I told him that I’m not the same person as I was then and explained what happened and he was so cold about it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7590631,public,self,Friendship advice,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yziavp/friendship_advice/,all_ads,6

TLDR:
A guy has been making inviting moves on my girlfriend and I am not happy with how she has dealt with it as whenever my girlfriend has even had a suspicious of a girl I have complied with her rules (potential double standards ??)


Background:
* My girlfriend knows this guy as he was friends with her ex (over 3 years ago)
* I am under the impression that they added each other on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram whilst she was still with her ex (before my relationship with her)
* my girlfriend got cheated in her first relationship (maybe 5ish years ago) which has probably left her with underlying trust issues - you be your own judge though.

Timeline:
* In August 2021 my girlfriend was invited to his birthday (supposedly after over 2 years of no contact)
* In January 2022 this guy invited my girlfriend and 2 of her friends to his house for a party and she went over
* In February he “🔥” reacted to a selfie my girlfriend put up on her story to which she left on read
* also in feb he went to one of my girlfriends friends house party (where my girlfriend was present)
* in March the guy started talking to her about sport which apparently ended quite briefly
* in May he invited my girlfriend and her two friends, along with some other people to his house (my girlfriend couldn’t go because of family commitments)
* in August he replied to my girlfriends story of her and a friend playing pool saying “I bet I can beat you” and then continued on to invite my girlfriend out to play pool with him (she declined because of work)


* There is supposedly no communication between these events 
* at the parties that they have been to together he has made multiple attempts to hit on her and flirt with her (my girlfriend told me this) 
* my girlfriend hasn’t invited me to any of these events where he has been present or invited her to


The problem:
- At the start of our relationship my girlfriend was worried that another girl (let’s call her Emily) liked me and was uncomfortable that I was talking to her and would hang out with her and her friends with my friends  (all as one group) —&gt; my girlfriend was invited to all these occasions.
Because my friendship with Emily made my girlfriend uncomfortable I stopped being friends with her as I valued my relationship over my friendship with Emily
- at university this year  I made another friend (let’s call her Jess) and once again my girlfriend again got extremely self conscious and wasn’t happy that I had made a female friend. Jess and I are doing the same degree and have a few of the same classes together so we help each other with class work when needed and sometimes study together at the library - most times Jess will bring some of her friends too so it isn’t just one on one (my girlfriend doesn’t go to university and works a 9-5 so is he can’t join us to study)
-my girlfriend and her friends think another girl (let’s call her Jaime) likes me. Jaime is in a relationship with another boy. I have met Jaime twice, maybe three times, all of those times my girlfriend has been there as they were parties/ gatherings with my girlfriends friends. I am in a Facebook groupchat with my girlfriend, all of her friends and Jaime. I am not very active in it, however, most of the times that I have posted something in there Jaime has laugh reacted to it. After the second time I met Jaime, she friend requested me on Instagram, then I friend requested her on Facebook.  My girlfriend and a few of her friends now have a suspicion that Jaime likes me. Because of this my girlfriend doesn’t want me talking to Jaime at future parties/ gatherings. I agreed and said fine as once again, I value my relationship with my girlfriend with, not even formed, friendship I have with Jaime. 


Now the main part:

3 weeks ago my girlfriend went to a birthday party where she only knew the birthday girl (not very close friends at all) and the guy that has hit on her. Once again, the guy made multiple attempts to flirt with my girlfriend at the party but she denied and mentioned our relationship. 

She got a little wine drunk there and mentioned that she wish she had MDMA with her (when she is wine drunk/ on MDMA she gets very h*rny)
Because she didn’t know anyone there but the distant friend who’s party it was + the guy that has hitted on her I thought this was quite odd. 

When she got home I questioned her relationship with the guy and wondered why this guy would keep hitting on her if she kept telling him she was in a relationship. So I asked her if they had ever talked on Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram. Initially she said no conversations on Facebook, left him on read when he 🔥 reacted to the selfie on her Instagram story, didn’t respond when he later replied to another one of her Instagram stories trying to invite her out to play pool with him and only talked on Snapchat once about sport in March.

After repeating this back as she made it quite difficult to get a straight answer, my girlfriend said “is knowing these small details really going to help?” And continued on that she actually responded to his second Instagram message inviting her out to play pool and said something along the lines of “sorry I can’t I am working [at the proposed time]”

My girlfriend has struggled on a couple of occasions to decline flirtatious activity from men  as she “feels bad” and “doesn’t want to be rude”.
All I wanted my girlfriend to do was mention in the second Instagram reply (the one where he replied to the game of pool and invited her out to play) something along the lines of “hey, sorry I have a boyfriend I’m not interested” and then if it continued to block him (????) instead of using work as an excuse (there is a big difference in my eyes between the two else’s). There is a history of flirtatious activity so I’m not sure why she doesn’t pick up on it and suspect that the innocent seeming invitation to pool is actually something a little more flirtatious

Is that too much to ask lol?



P.S. has formed friendships with some of her friends failed tinder where the original friend doesn’t even speak to the guy any more (on both occasions the guys have gone from matching with my girlfriends friend to then hitting on my girlfriend where she “feels bad” and “doesn’t want to be rude” again…) and continues conversation and is now friends with them
Cannot imagine the shit I’d be in if I’d done the same thing and she found out

Regardless, what’s resulted from this is my realization of how codependent I have been my entire life. To give a bit of insight my childhood was rough and I was constantly fighting for attention and validation from my parents. I was severely depressed as a child and when I finally was happy was when I met my old best friend. Then my family and I moved states and I was depressed again for years. Then I met my boyfriend and began to feel happier. 

So to move forward I’ve created a list of ideas I have to try to become less codependent. I wrote out what I relied on my bf for, what I don’t rely on him for, and what I can do to be better. So my thought process is that I can begin with therapy again because my mom agreed to pay for it which will probably be the most helpful. But online I read that you need to invest into yourself to lessen dependence. 

Therefore, I want to begin working out without my bf (I pay for the gym membership but he comes with me as my guest). I also don’t want to share my car with him anymore (he doesn’t have one so he uses mine) but I feel this will only cause conflict because he will have to make other arrangements to get to his new job. The reason I don’t want to share it is because I am tired of changing my schedule for his when he won’t do the same back. It will let me focus more time on my extracurriculars in college. I also want to work more at my job to save more money to buy a microscope (I’ve tried to save for it before but my bf and I end up spending the money because broke) and in general have savings. I also think I could branch into older hobbies I had like painting but that would be further down the road. 

Lastly, I need to try to make new friends. Any advice on this would be helpful because I have a hard time trusting others. 

Overall though, do you guys think this is a good plan? I guess I am seeking validation in the fact that I’m making the right decision to distance myself and lessen my codependence, not just with him but for my future relationships too.

My girlfriend and I have been together since November last year.  In July this year she broke up with me because I did something really shitty and I totally understand why she would break up with me. In spite of this we kept on seeing each other like before and she eventually ended up asking me to be her boyfriend again in September.  Then this Monday she broke up with me out of nowhere saying that she needed to try being herself without me and that it had nothing to do with me etc.... Then she elaborated and said some stuff that has my mind racing: 

\- She is not 100% sure it is the right decision 

\- She really hopes to still see me after we have broken up as she wants me in her life(as a friend)

\- She could see us being together in the future

\- She does not want anybody else and is not looking date or hook up with anyone. 

**The timing of the breakup**

She has been sort of unhappy for a long time but thought that moving out from home would solve this. She recently moved out and got her own place 2 weeks ago and then suddenly broke up with me. My thought is that she thought moving out would make her happy but it didn't, so she wanted to try leaving me to see if that would solve it. 

**My big question** 

We have had an amazing relationship which she also acknowledges. She says that she still loves me a lot. I am obviously still in love with the girl. How do I play this in order to get her back? 

Should I give her space and not contact her although she encouraged we should talk often? Should i give her an ultimatum: be with me or never see me again? Should I do anything right away or wait and risk that she meets someone else?

I have an idea that it would be dumb of me to keep talking to her now as I fear that she would see me as a friend. We have arranged to talk tomorrow because I wanted to clear some things up.

We used to fight once in a while and now it feels like one of us is leaving every two weeks. Anytime I say you aren’t helping me and I do everything it turns into a fight. I cook, I clean, I do laundry, I buy groceries, I drive, I pay for gas, I pay for laundry soap, body wash, I pay for his kids clothes, I take his kid to school, pick him up from school, do homework. I am also a teacher and still going to school myself. He buys stuff for him and that’s where all of his money goes. He gaslights and is extremely narcissistic. 


I feel like I am starting to resent him a lot. Yesterdays fight was because I came home after running around doing errands  and working all day. He was in bed laying on top of clean clothes with garbage on his side of the bed, garbage overflowing, dishes dirty. I was overwhelmed and snapped. I was wrong. I had a bad day and shouldn’t have snapped, but he doesn’t see the issue and just says I’m the crazy one. 


He won’t tell me he loves me. I have to force him to show me any affection and when he does it’s like it’s painful for him to kiss me. He says he doesn’t want to get married or that I’m trying to rush getting married after three years. 


My issue is I love him and his son who has become my son and his family. We have an entire life together. When things are good they are really good. He is my best friend and I tell him everything. We laugh all the time and I can be myself around him. More than anyone else. I feel stuck and not sure what to do anymore.

Our relationship is not the best, and my best-friend(f25)wants me to leave him. I don't feel ready to do this now, and we have a 3 years old on top of that. 
He left and I got home with my best-friend and her husband and spent the night at their place. The morning after we were still arguing over the Phone but at 2/3 pm my friend starter telling me she'd like for me to go so she could have time to do her things and spend some alone time with her husband when he gets home. 
I told my boyfriend I needed to leave but he was still mad. 
My friend said we could wait for her husband so he could drive me by car but he was getting more and more late and she was getting pushy about me leaving do I tried cabs but no one would come there. She ended up asking my boyfriend herself and he finally came. 
Right now we're not talking, things got briefly heated on the way home in the car with my boyfriend. He told me he had invited a few friends over to get dinner and then we stopped talking. I don't mind the idea and since things are so cold here maybe a bit of compagny won't hurt. 
Anyway, I told my friend by text that he had invited people and probably did not invite them as we were supposed to be together. 
She said something in the line of ""oh so it's like nothing ever happened"" and said I ""F*CKED"" her day for nothing and seemed mad that they werent invited. But she initially told me to leave because she had enough of people and wanted alone time ...
Now I told her that this time away was very much needed to both steam off and most importantly, avoid putting our child in the middle of this.

This is a throwaway account since he is very much active on reddit.

It is my first post because I am completely lost and stressed out. Sorry for the very long post. But please hear me out.

For the background, we have been together for 7 months, three out of which we live together. I know it was quick but it made sense for us. We love each other very much and he's been the best boyfriend I could ever imagine. he's very caring, loving, understanding. Very intelligent and funny. We have great chemistry together and we just click. He is my best friend and my greatest support in life and I love him very much. I am sure I am the same for him. When we met, He really showed me how much i meant to him.I was treated like a queen in his life. We have our ups and downs lot of times. We used to play cards, try new things together, he would cook for me. It was our thing. Now we rarely do any of that. It doesn't mean he does not put effort anymore, He has supported me through dark times, takes me out every now and then. or literally does anything he thinks i would like. He will make sure there's tea ready every morning before he wakes me. Every small things or detail he will do and remember without me having to mention it.

We might have been oversaturated by me being home all the time and him having to be with me every waking minute. Maybe that puts him off. I try to give him space as much I can. But when you live together you're always around each other.  I don't know if he respects me anymore as much as I do him. Currently, I am unemployed and unable to work since my residence permit is in process past couple of months. So he is the sole caretaker of the finances. for which, I am really grateful to him. For a year I have been really stressed out with looking for a suitable job as per my visa while working odd jobs and somehow I have become the person who I am usually not, Burned out, stressed all the time, and unhappy with my situation. I am not that fun loving, carefree type anymore. I have no friends in this city. But I have tried to not put that upon him as much as I can. I hate myself for it but I am unable to change the dynamic till I get my documents. I feel like I am wasting my time sitting at home every day. And i am unable to bring in money till things are sorted with work. But i takecare of the house, cook, clean and do everything else. So its pleasant for him when he comes home. On the other hand, he is addicted to this particular online game and will game straight for 6-7 hours or more and ignore everything else  when we fight, or when he needs his space. Sometimes i don't know what will set him off these days. These are two of the reasons, why we have issues.

But I do know when my work starts, things between us will change for good and better. It won't be like this anymore. And hence, I want to be with him and support him and put an effort into building a life together. Currently, my self-confidence is severely low due to these issues.

**Fast forward to the current situation.**

We had an amazing week together last week, Doing things which make us happy. There was not a single argument. he was sick with the flu but I took care of him. He drove me to my job interview and after that, we went to eat and then shopping for a few things, and to my surprise, he wanted to buy Christmas stuff together. It was like one of the earlier days we used to spend. Both of us agreed, it was the best day after a long time.

The next day he was a little bit down but nothing so bad. He was gaming and I asked him if he wants to smoke a cigarette with me and can give me some love and affection before he starts another game since I was also feeling down, then I could go finish some work and cleaning. ( **this is where things went wrong** ) He said sure. the moment we got up he went to bed, I didn't know why so I kept asking him and he didn't respond for a while and then said he was having a panic attack. so I gave him water and sat with him. After a while, I tried talking to him and he just got up and started cleaning up and refused to talk to me or even look at me, while I kept asking him what was wrong or what I did. Since then he's completely stonewalling me and refuses to look at me, eat my food or respond at all. He's been gaming for the past 4 days nonstop. I don't know what I did. I cried, begged, and followed him almost 50 times at this point so he could just tell me why he doesn't wanna talk but he is Ice cold. He pretends as if don't exist or I am invisible next to him or he doesn't hear me. He will walk past me even if I am talking. If I am on the balcony near him, he will leave and come back after I'm gone. He sleeps in another room. avoids all sorts of contact. I really miss him a lot, just want to hear him or hug him. This triggers my abandonment trauma to the worst possible I had ever had. I just want to know what I did and how we or I can fix it. He's never done this before. I let him calm down for a day or two but it's been really long. I am going crazy in my head. I haven't slept for more than 2-3 hours a night. Unable to eat and constantly locked myself in another room. I am also sick with the flu.

Today morning I had enough of his gaming and asked him to go to work and he refused, he didn't wanna tell his boss either. who emailed him to ask why he is not responding and called him 3-4 times. so I emailed his boss back that he is sick. Maybe it was a wrong thing but I don't want him to get in trouble. Or have a bad reference (he is aware of it). At this point, I want to call his mom. I have never met her before, She knows about me. He and she have fallen out for a couple of months. which I know is a bad idea probably but I don't know who to talk to.

I am completely losing my mind, I don't know what to do but I can't see him throw his life away like this. I really love him a lot, and I don't want to give up on us. Please tell me what to do.

They started dating this July, and they're in love, and he's always around. I (21F) have tried to be cognizant of this, but I think it's gotten to a point where I'm really starting to think she (22F) does not value or friendship, and I was only a placeholder friend till she got into a relationship.

This past week, I finally told her that I've been feeling like I was left out of her life. We don't talk often, and I don't expect that we do because we are both extremely busy with college and our own lives. But for the entire semester, our calls have been relegated to either when she's at work or on her drive home, to which she always ends the call before she enters into her house. I mean, it's like a script where she gets home, and she'll say, ""Hey, it was great talking to you! I just got home, so I think I'm going to head in, shower, and eat."" Every. Time.

She is constantly not responding to my texts. Whenever I visit home, over holidays or breaks, seeing her has always been a priority for me. This last time, she asked me to meet her boyfriend. The entire encounter was super uncomfortable and weird to me because there were many times she and/or her boyfriend made rude comments.

Now, I've told her how I felt. I cried a bit on the phone, said that I missed our closeness, and I felt like a last priority. She was super nice and validating, and we said I would let her know when I was free the following day, so we could chat. I texted her right after, and she didn't respond. I waited to chat those few hours I was free, and I was super upset that she didn't. I texted to ask if everything was okay, and I was really looking forward to us talking, and she said her car broke down, and she was super sorry that she forgot to give me a heads-up.

We, also, both really love Taylor Swift, and we've shared her music together. I planned on going to my hometown for the concert, and I mentioned that I wanted to go together despite my friends at my college going here. I didn't get pre-sale access, but she did. And this may be stupid, but I feel really hurt that she didn't offer to get me tickets. We explicitly talked about it and everything. My friends, here, who I've known for substantially less time explicitly offered. And it bothers me to think that she would rather go with her boyfriend or friends instead of me.

I know this is a block of text, and I might be overthinking some of these scenarios. I've been feeling down about this recently because I really do miss our closeness and the times we would spend on FaceTime or in her car, listening to music, drinking tea, and being really open about our lives. Our friendship has started to make me feel like my last relationship, where my ex-boyfriend explicitly said, and made me feel, that I was always his last priority. I've been trying to give her grace and understand she is busy with her partner and own life, but after explicitly saying how I felt and being ignored and forgotten, I've started to feel like her feelings are very clear. Any advice on how to handle this or understand this? Anything would be appreciated.

TL;DR: My (21F) best friend (22F) got into a new relationship, and I have started to feel like a last priority for her, with her boyfriend and her other friends. I told her about how I felt, and we planned to talk on a day. She ignored my text asking for a time, and she, also, didn't call that day. When I asked if something came up, she said she had car trouble and forgot to text. I'm not sure if my reaction to any of this is justified, but I've been feeling super down about all of it.

However, I would talk to her every day and we would hang out one on one because she didn’t really have many other friends. But to me, I look at her as just one of the guys rather than a potential love interest.

A little over a year ago, at the start of college, I started dating my current girlfriend. She knows that I am close friends with my ex-girlfriend and has always been uncomfortable. My current gf says she knows I’m not going to cheat or anything but she says she just feels uncomfortable with me talking to her.

I’ve reassured her that she’s the only one I love and also tried to discuss a compromise but she says the most she feels comfortable w me talking to her is once a week and not at late hours. On top of that, I can only hang out with her once every 4 months.

I feel like I'm in a position where I have to essentially choose which person I value more even though both are very important to me.

This isn’t the first instance of him doing badly in school, but it’s escalated to him now skipping classes and not even attempting his coursework. 

&amp;nbsp;

He doesn’t live with me as he lives a couple states away with his mom (we have different moms), so I’m unable to know exactly what’s going on with him bar the times I call to check up on him.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve volunteered to help him with his homework as the subjects he mentioned hes struggling in are ones I did well in when I was in school, however this was when I was under the impression he was at least trying to do the work and something just wasn’t clicking with him. 

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn’t until my father told me he’s been receiving calls from the school saying George has repeatedly been absent when attendance is called, that he’s failing classes etc. However, when I ask George how things are going he’ll tell me he’s “stressed” and “struggling” but not the extent that he’s failing school yet again. I even asked him if he’s actually going to class and he told me yes. He doesn’t know that I know that isn’t the case, nor do I want to reveal that I know he’s lying to me.

&amp;nbsp; 

He doesn’t talk much to our dad as their relationship is a bit murky, so whenever I talk to George our dad will ask me what’s going on with him etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

George told me he wants to go to college, but given his seemingly lack of interest in high school I really doubt that’s the case. I think he just tells me that as he thinks it’s what I want to hear. I’m wondering what I can do to prevent him continuing to fail and also how to get him to open up to me with any personal problems he may be having that might be affecting him?

A couple months ago, I (F23) became very close to my coworker (M23). We noticed we had a lot in common, so since then we hang out basically every week. Anyways, the whole situation is quite strange, because at work we don't usually talk to each other or interact, but wen we meet things go pretty intense. We hug, tell each other our problems, and we are very close emotionally. I have never thought of him as anything more than a good friend until some weeks ago. And there are some complications with that:

I think I really like him (I have never felt anything similar to what I feel for this person, still trying to understand my emotions) but I know I wouldn't be happy if we were in a relationship. I know him well, so I know it wouldn't work out. I would probably be miserable as his girlfriend, so I convince myself that staying friends is the only valid option. I am not interested in becoming more than friends, for the sake of my mental health. And I was very, very sure that he doesn't see me as anything more than a friend as well. I'm still convinced of that.

So last week I hang out with some other friends (they don't know my coworker) and spoke with them about my situation. I told them some things he had done or said when we are together in order to explain to them what a great friend I have. They bursted out laughing and asked me how is it possibe that I don't get it. They are sure that he is interested in me. I defended myself telling them that all of this things were out of context and that I really feel that he sees me just as a friend. Here are some things my coworker told me (remember that they are out of context). (I haven't told all this things to my friends. Just some of the harmless stuff, because I needed some POV. And they don't know him anyways):

He said he can't explain with words what he feels when he is with me. He said I smell well and that my skin is soft. He never refers to me as his friend, he just avoids the subject when it comes up (I think maybe it means that I'm not even his friend, but just a coworker). Sometimes he says things like ""It's addictive"" or ""This is dangerous"", and I don't know wtf he means, and when I ask I just recive ambiguous answers. And he gave me his hoodie (But belive me, I was freezing), then refused when I tried to give it back.

So for my friends it was obvious that he is kinda interested in me. I am still pretty convinced he is not. But I am really curious about what a bunch of strangers on the internet think about this. Maybe my friends are exagerating. Maybe I am confused. Maybe my coworker hates me secretly. I don't know. Please bring some light into this. And I need some advice how to handle my emotions, because I really like him but I want to stay just as friends.

And if my coworker finds this: Please don't be mad at me. I just wanted to let this out.

We use to live together and I would have to do everything (clean the house AND pick up after him), or leave him a list and specifically ask him to do chores if I wanted anything done. Which made us both feel like i was mothering him, but if i didn't ask, he just would not do anything. Example: It's like the bathroom trash would be overflowing, and if I didn't specifically ask him to take it out, it would just keep getting more and more full. I don't live with him anymore, and the apartment we use to share has gone to shit. We have had conversations about this issue 1000000x over, and he says he will try, but it always goes back to the same argument.

My current gf says she knows I’m not going to cheat or anything but she says she just feels uncomfortable with me talking to her. 

I’ve reassured her that she’s the only one I love and also tried to discuss a compromise but she says the most she feels comfortable w me talking to her is once a week and not at late hours. On top of that I can only hang out with her once every 4 months.

He has this female friend from work. They both work and met on the ambulance and do the same exact job. I knew she was a coworker since about a year ago and it seems like her and my bf are closer than I thought. She's not and never was his ambulance partner. They just know each other from the station. She first invited us to her engagement party a year ago. Yes, she has a fiance but from what my bf tells me, her relationship with him is like on the rocks, not doing good at all and she doesn't even want to get married because of financial issues going on, but not sure if its *more* than that. I didn't go to this party because I had other plans so I never actually met her. I've seen pictures of her and boy she is not attractive, however my bf has a thing for unattractive garbage bag looking girls from his past (I am in fact way out of his league but thats completely besides the point and I don't say that to brag but maybe that means something?).

Anyways, a few months ago she called him when we were together to tell him that she was in the hospital and she was putting him down as her emergency contact. I was like WTF, why the hell is she not putting her own freaking fiance down?! And my bf made up same lame excuse saying that hes immature and whatnot and I don't even remember. It wasn't a clear cut answer. I responded, ""I didn't know you were THAT close with her"". and he said ""Well I didn't know that means I'm not close with her"". Btw, her boyfriend, also does the same exact job as both of them. So if you were thinking that oh maybe it was because they're both in the same field and my bf could understand the doctors and the problems and whatnot because he's in healthcare, no thats not it.

I know they talk on the phone here and there and he's told me that she'll call him at night venting and talking and crying about her problems and he just sits there and listens. And I know they've had several conversations like that, but to what extent, I don't truly know. Do they talk everyday? Now just recently, I call him one day and he didn't pick up. Calls me back 2 min later and says sorry I was on the phone with her, shes on her way to work. And I'm just frozen again like um what?! You guys call each other on your way to work?! Again, I had no clue. I didn't say anything. I was just like Oh..ok.. I didn't want to come off as controlling.

Are these things I should be weary of? Red flags? Should I sit him down and just ask him some questions and talk about it?
