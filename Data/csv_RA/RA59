So take this post as a cry for help cus I’m getting married in a month and I am clueless as fuck.

At one side, my wife to be is super emotional. We’ve been together for years. But on the flip side, so are my parents.

Since I belong to an Asian household, it’s very normal for brides to live with their husband’s families after they’re married.

But we decided to break this norm and live separately because she wanted independence. However, we talked through this and my parents agreed.

However, with only a few days left, my father, out of nowhere got super emotional and is now asking me to stay with him or he won’t meet me for life. Once I’m married.

I talked to him and convinced him that I’ll be staying with him for two months after I’m married just so he doesn’t feel like I’m snubbing him.

However, when I brought this issue up with my fiancé, she started crying and straight up said ‘No’ to my request of staying with my family.

What’s worse is that she started crying SO BADLY that she started slapping herself over call and asked me to pray for her death.

She’s been super emotional lately. Every time I try to discuss something, the fireworks start.

The question is - I’m being forced to pick a side. What do I do here? I can’t pick one side without disappointing the other.

I want everybody to be happy so I can focus on what’s important - the wedding.

She is a stay at home mom and I work about 40 hours of a changing schedule in fast food. We have a 10 month old daughter. I am also currently working on starting a business to hopefully be able to transition to working from home. 

The root of the problem is me, I already know this. I have ADHD and come from a family that didn't believe in emoting. She comes from a very touchy and loving family. Things like remembering to hug her occasionally just don't cross my mind sometimes. Outside of my feed assigned chores I struggle to even notice when things need to be done. My ADHD also exhibits in hyperfocus that too often is directed at unimportant things.

I want to be better and am curious if anything has advice on how to kind of rewire my brain to be more aware of her and what she needs. My current thought is literally just to load my phone with hourly reminders to check on until it becomes commonplace. Any help would be appreciated

We've known eachother since we met online when we were both 13 and kept in touch with eachother for  a couple years eventually starting an online relationship. Her mother grounded her for several months taking her phone and changing her passwords severing our communication. She and I had depression at a young age and she often talked about self harm and suicide, with a couple genuine scares at attempts. So being a teenager I jumped to the conclusion that something mustve happened to her and thats why she never came back. Fast forward 4-5 years later and she suddenly pops into my messenger while Im at work, causing me to nearly fall off a ladder haha.. She didnt know if I was the right person, I use a different name for my account now to keep it seperate from work, but I was and it was her and suddenly she was back in my life again just like before we almost immediately picked up where we left off. And im still so happy she's back in my life.

She came to visit a couple times over the next couple of years and 2 years later she moved across the country so we could move into an apartment together. We had our arguments like any new couple moving into their first apartment would, where do the shoes go, whos doing the dishes, how we divy up chores etc. but nothing much more serious than that for the first few months. Eventually I got laid off from my job and she supported the both of us while I got back on my feet. I bounced around to a couple different offices that never really felt right but I was always almost always steadily employed. She didnt really like my job hopping, said thats not what adults do. I understood but I think lifes too short to work a dead end corpo job at 22 if youre not happy with that kind of work. While were working and thriving we make a couple trips to visit her mom (dad is deceased) in her home town and its very lovely. We get engaged to be married while on a hike one day and life is genuinely wonderful. 

After a couple years we ended up moving back to her hometown into a rental property her mom owned. We both had jobs lined up when we moved but then covid hit and they furloughed us permanently. I started collecting unemployment as nowhere was hiring at the time and we needed money. She didnt want to, various reasons possible tax liability, didnt believe in it etc. I tried to help her learn more about it so maybe she could make an informed decision but she didnt want to so I didnt push too hard, my unemployment was enough for both of us to live on for a while. After a while her and her mom started to get really snobbish about me collecting unemployment, said I didnt deserve it because I could work etc. I think her mom had a hand in that she may not of wanted to collect on her own but I dont think she would've become outwardly borish about it on her own. She never had a problem taking the money and spending it though lol.. 

Covid ends and we both get jobs, hers a little better than mine doing what she loves. I go back to office hopping. I cant stand the work but it pays the bills. Eventually I cant take it and go start substitute teaching. Love it. Im working on my teaching degree right now to be a fulltime teacher. Shes working in a field she loves in her dream job. We live, laugh, love all that good stuff. 

I tell all of this to say, I love my fiance absolutely deeply and truly love her more than anything. I want to be with her forever and that was the plan.. but lately over the past couple months she's been more insistent on being called a he, going by a male name, and talking about eventually transitioning. She had always occasionally mentioned feeling like she might be a guy but never really fully committed so I never really took it too seriously. But now that shes diving deeper into it Ive had to ask myself alot of questions.. and It kinda scares me it breaks my heart and I dont know what to do... I know Im not attracted to men. Ive never really seen her as a man. But I dont know what I would do without her shes been my bestfriend for so long my everything(pardon the phrase not trying to sound obsessed lol) and I know Ill love the person she is forever. But if she transitions I cant help but feel Ill loose all physical attraction and thats not healthy for a relationship either. I just dont know what to do..

Or whether I should at all.

We were in a relationship during the end of highschool that lasted over a year but we went long distance because I went to university and she stayed in our home town to take a gap year. She slowly became bored of our long distance video calls and I got bored of the lack of intimacy which was already something that I disliked in the relationship but wholly accepted because she was not comfortable with it. As this continued for awhile, on one of our video calls she admitted that she thought that she was mostly Asexual (not completely as she still wants some intimacy) which I had suspected for a long time. At that time I thought of how long the lack of intimacy had gone for and made a rash decision to break up or find some other solution. 

I suggested an open relationship where I may hook up with someone every once and a while. She didn't like that solution. I suggested we break up and reconnect once I had finished university (3 years). I'm not sure how she felt about this. In the end she just wanted to be friends but later she seemed to change her mind so I decided to leave her alone.

The breakup went calmly and we both were rather composed about it but we're still sad it had to end.

After breaking up I have regretted my decision ever since but thought that if I messaged that she might hate me for it or it would be an awkward situation with her family and friends.

When I stand up, from the front it doesn’t even look like anything?? 

Idk, he backtracked and said nothing is wrong with it and it’s just a personal preference, but what am I supposed to do, just not have one? I asked him if being waxed helps (I wax regularly) and he says it doesn’t matter, he just doesn’t like it. I asked him what to do to fix it and he said nothing, it’s just the way it is. I told him I just want to be the exception to the rule, and he said I am bc I am his gf. That honestly didn’t make me feel much better.

I’m (21 F) now a senior and I live with my freshman roommate/best friend, Cece (22F) in an apartment with 2 other friends. Cece and I are a three person friend group with another person let’s call her Jess (23F) since freshman year. Jess, Cece and I lived together last year but because of some arguments Jess decided to live elsewhere but we’re still best friends and meet often.

Cece is dating Winston 23M and I don’t exaggerate he’s over ALL THE TIME. He has his plants in our apartment and asked me not to open windows so they don’t get cold and die (despite the fact that he has his own apartment and we’ve never discussed him keeping his plants here). Winston, Cece, Jess and I are kind of now this 4 person friend group and we have been since sophomore year. 

This year I’ve been branching out and making my own friends because I’ve honestly felt like Cece, I and Jess could get toxic, especially because I’m horrid at confrontation and she has a habit of saying mean things as a ‘joke’.  I’m also an English major and they’re all STEM majors and sometimes when I want to discuss things from class I feel looked down on. I’ve made about 6-7 new friends from class who I hang out with. 

For the incident in question that has me questioning myself : I have a 7 pm class that’s a bore and goes till 10 pm and is a fucking pain and my (new) friends and I pregame it at my house. When I say pregame, I don’t mean an all out party I mean 2 people coming over taking 4 shots in a span of 30 minutes and leaving and there’s no music, no unruly behaviour basically nothing party- like. It’s also once a week &amp; I clean every glass before I leave. 

Two weeks ago, on one of these pregames I could see that Cece didn’t seem like she was having the best time and I texted her after to ask and she said she was hungry so she wasn’t super interactive but it’s all good. 

Keeping this in mind, I messaged her before this week’s pregame word for word - Is it alright if 3 people (one extra) come over before class? 

Cece : yes 

Me : are you absolutely sure? 

Cece : yes don’t worry. 

So day in question : they arrive (it’s half an hour before class) and we’re all standing in the kitchen and Cece is making dinner for herself and her boyfriend and honestly, I’m not looking at her. 

I have my friends over and we aren’t playing music, we aren’t loud and she’s fully aware we’ll be leaving in 30 mins. The next day, I just get a feeling something’s off and I text her asking if she’s mad. She says yes we’ll talk later. 

The next day she says : I felt like it got a little loud and crowded and they were standing in my way to the fridge which frustrated me. Also, Winston had an exam and I had to cook for him so he could eat fast and I couldn’t do that and I just wasn’t vibing.

Me : I’m sorry 

Her : it’s fine don’t worry

In my mind, the first bit ok fine. I should’ve asked my friends to move, maybe she should’ve asked them to move (she didn’t). I do genuinely feel bad. THE SECOND PART WHAT! Respectfully, I don’t give a fuck if he has an exam or a race in the fucking Olympics. He is a guest and this is my home. His needs or wants don’t take ANY precedence over mine. Her guests don’t take precedence over mine. Go fucking cook at his house (which is his alone and he shares with no housemates). Now this happened a week ago but I find out from Jess that she went to hers after I left to rant about me and Jess told me she told Cece she thought I was an alcoholic. 

Now I’m starting to get a little upset a week later because I feel like they’ve been talking behind my back. I feel like it stems from slight jealousy that they’re not my only friends anymore like they’ve been for three years.

I’m starting to feel like a bad roommate but I also feel like she’s a toxic friend and idk if I’m insane. 

I told her I would be hosting no more pregames at our place and 100% meant it. I even told her two weeks ago I would always check if I brought people over. If i agree to be this transparent, I feel like she could’ve been too and said she didn’t want people over. Im so bad at confrontation but im upset at both Jess and Cece but I also feel like that makes me a shitty person? I don’t know, someone please help. 

Bg: Cece has a pretty controlling personality and most of the times things don’t really bother me so I feel like our friendship works. For example : we all try to decide a place to eat on vacation i say italian she says barbecue. Now, I tell her I’ll go to barbecue if she wants (despite her knowing that I won’t eat a thing there but mashed potatoes because I’m a vegetarian) and someone in the group points out I wouldn’t really be eating. She makes a face and says fine Italian it is and is in an off mood the entire night to the point where I would’ve preferred not eating. The next few days all we eat is where she wants to and I did have to skip multiple meals because I’m a vegetarian and all these places were meat-heavy.

I made a previous post (couldn't locate to link it) about our breakup and what led to it. To make a long story short her father passed away this morning and she reached out to me for some comfort. I had not spoken to her in weeks and I decided sure whatever and I took her out to lunch. She was going over her father's or arrangements and I noticed she kept hiding her phone screen from me. She eventually slipped up and it showed a picture of her and another guy together. I became extremely upset because of how fast she had moved on. She then told me she had been dating several guys since our breakup and was essentially rotating them. Initially our breakup didn't bother me because I got out of a fucked up relationship and I honestly should have never been surprised with her response considering her behavior. However, I genuinely was in love with this woman and I never got any closure. During our first initial break up it bothered me to the core to the point that I could not sleep and I had to seek therapy immediately. Seeing that screensaver just bothered the shit out of me and rattled my nerves. I had a therapy session today and I discussed it with her which I explained that I was just completely heartbroken and I still haven't fully been able to absolve myself from that feeling. The relationship still lingers in me and it's the absolute worst feeling in the world. I literally gave this relationship everything that I had and I tried all the way to the very end to save it, I did everything I possibly could and I never got any closure. A part of me just wants her to tell me that she had been using me this entire time and it all meant nothing, instead I can never get a straight answer but she tries to get some sympathy out of me and tell me that she still loves me and misses me but in reality she's already moved on and she's dating multiple men simultaneously. I don't know what to do at this point other than continuing to seek therapy so I can move on from this traumatic event in my life. I am absolutely heartbroken and meeting with her today is something that I regret. My condolences to her family but I sincerely regret meeting with her or even answering that phone call. How do I get over this feeling? I essentially don't have a life right now but I'm slowly working on changing myself because I literally lost everything in that relationship. I had to start over from scratch. Right now I'm working two jobs to keep myself busy so I don't go crazy, I started my first business which  launches next month, I go to the gym twice a week, I've been dieting, and I'm looking to start Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the next month. I hate this feeling and I want it to go away, I don't like feeling or being heartbroken. I can't stand it, is there anything else that I can do that I'm not already doing now to help resolve this dreadful feeling? Or is it something that's just going to take time?

When I met my partner, now husband (m26) he seemed like a very straight kind of guy. Like he genuinely wanted good things for our relationship and wasn’t the slightest bit interested in anything to do with girls, alcohol or anything of that nature, just a simple down to earth me and you against the world kinda guy. I (f27) at that time fell for him as I’d been having fun in my life and doing the typical mid 20s aged thing and I knew this man would settle me down and start a beautiful family future. Soon after we met he gave me small signs that he was interested in a bit of a naughty bedroom stuff, which was fine by me… not long after we got married and I fell pregnant, after time I started losing confidence and started being a little more open with him (letting him watch corn with a P and looking at other girls half naked on social media and telling me how ‘yummy’ they are as something naughty to spice things up) after that we started exploring doing naughty things outside the house, talking about bringing other people to bed with us, just as a bit of banter because I knew I wasn’t that ‘wow’ to look at while being heavily pregnant. After my pregnancy I started getting more confident and stopped doing all of these things like talking about other people looks and bringing others to bed with us and asked him just to focus with me and give me more attention as I felt I needed it. I got really self conscious after in our pregnancy he was looking at other girls which in my eyes were above and beyond what I looked like. I started getting a little depressed and tried to make bedroom fun just focusing between the two of us and let him know I wasn’t interested in all the things I’ve been talking about and it was simply just to get him hot when we were in the mood. We began fighting a lot during this time and I noticed he was losing interest in me and he would soon leave me so I begged him to stay and told him I’ll work on myself and be more open minded. So lately we’ve been talking about bringing other people to the bedroom and watching some corn (with a P) with him because I know he really likes it (I hate it). I let him download dating apps to look for other people and last night while making love he thanked me (with the most happiest look on his face) and he’d never thanked me like that before for anything. He thanked me for being more open and fun and I just knew that this is something he really needs in his life. The issue is that I’m only doing this so he can get it out of his system in hope that he will stop eventually and come back to focusing on our relationship and fall in love with me all over again as I’ve already had fun in my life but as his family were really religious growing up he didn’t explore too many things. I’m not interested in doing any of these things but I can’t imagine a life without him and I’m only doing it to make him happy, while I’m showing him a happy face, I’m dying inside. How can I get through this without hurting too much? Will he eventually stop all of this if I go through with it and have fun with him?

So I went to high school with this guy(27M) and I’ve known him since 10th grade. I didn’t really keep in touch with him since high school but he stayed friends with some of my best friends and they love him. He reached out to me after he saw I deleted all of the pictures of my ex and asked what happened and if I was doing okay. Then after some talking he asked if we could grab dinner sometime(just as friends) and I said sure and we had a nice hangout, he didn’t make any moves or anything. 

He’s a genuinely very kind hearted, caring and loving person. You can feel the good energy radiating from him. He confessed that he’s been in love with me for over a decade and after all these years he’s never stopped thinking about me but he never made any moves on me since high school because I ended up in relationships of my own but after this breakup he said he didn’t want to live life without telling me how he felt about me. He told me I’m his dream girl and that he would treat me like a queen. Plus he’s not the kind of guy that would even think about cheating on me. I was just a bit surprised that he said he “loved” me instead of “liking” me a lot or something. But I know he’s a very genuinely good person.

I (f25) and my friend (m26) have been friends for 12 years. He’s been in and out of prison for about 5 years for drug use. He’s currently serving his first “big” sentence (previously he only did a few months to a year at most, 2 or 3 times) and he’ll be serving 7 years for possession of fentanyl. Outside of his addiction he’s always been an awesome friend and I try to stay supportive when he’s sober, even if it’s due to being in prison because it started when his mom suddenly got diagnosed with brain cancer and died shortly after. I don’t interact with him when he’s using because I have kids &amp; simply don’t wish to surround myself with active  drug users. 

But I do mean it when I say he’s an awesome sober person. Every time he’s in prison we write letters and talk on the phone. I lost my dad suddenly last year and he was able to help me through some of those hard emotions I was dealing with. In February of this year he started asking for money. I’d put money on his books usually monthly maybe $20-40 at most, just a little for the few phone calls a week we had. I helped him out once with a larger amount he asked for ($80). Shortly after this I fell into a deep depression surrounding the loss of my father and I stopped talking to everyone. Including him. 

Last month I reached out to him to explain to him that I was dealing with a lot emotionally and that I was sorry for not answering his calls in 6+ months. He understood and we’ve been talking again for about a week. But then today he called and almost immediately asked for money. And wanted me to send it to some random phone numbers ca$happ. Seemed weird. Almost like he wanted me to pay a debt for him. He didn’t ask for a specific amount but even when I told him “if I can it wouldn’t be til next week when I have extra money” he was clearly disappointed. And the phone call ended shortly after. 

I just felt extremely disappointed that he asked for money so quickly into us speaking again &amp; at this point it doesn’t feel like a 2 way friendship.

We instantly clicked and were dating within two months. We had a great relationship we were very close, always spending at least a day outside of school with each other each week, and spending the days at school with each other and our friends as it was a small private school in England. Over the next year and a half we rarely fought, never actually raising our voices at each other in the relationship. 

However, we got to the end of the senior year and would be spending the summer apart so we decided to breakup, we had considered for a few months staying together, but ultimately decided it would be best to seperate. 

Over the summer we had many instances of having issues moving on, and we realised we set up the breakup wrong and had a few talks to help transition into a friendship, this is where I screwed up. I said that I wanted to know if she was getting with anyone new over the summer, and also told her at one point that I thought if she did get with someone else within like a month of us breaking up it would be disrespectful. I know that was stupid and not right but I was in a bad place. Summer went on and she was a bit annoyed with me for that second bit, rightly so. 

She never did do anything in the summer with someone else and neither did I, and before going to school I asked her to get back together with me. She seemed willing, but was questioning me if I was certain that’s why I wanted or if I just was afraid of losing her. I wasn’t sure, because I hadn’t tried anything with anyone else and told her that, we decided to give the decision a few days. I had a lot of outside influences telling me not to over those next few days, mainly my dad telling me not to and that’d I’d miss out on the college experience. So in the end we decided to stay friends but potentially reopen that discussion later.

I visited her some two weeks later as we had been planning for a month, and we pretty much fell back into our couple pattern, being together in the same way we had before. However, she was also confused because we had said only two weeks prior to be friends yet here we were like that. There were times where she seemed to switch mode, and I was later told by her it was because she was just not sure if it was right what we were doing. There were also some times where she would say to me that she wanted to talk abt the state of our relationship, which led to her just asking what I wanted and not actually saying what she wanted. So we never really got anywhere with that convo because I would say “idk where I’m at maybe let me get to college and settle first and then we can revisit this as u have already done so”. The trip ended with both of us happy it happened and I immediately moved out to my own college and got accustomed to life there. 

Over the first month of college we had a bit of a tumultuous time, as we both were adjusting to college life. We had several talks where in later ones I pretty much lied about my feelings and said I had moved on and had done so since she hasn’t immediately wanted to get back together when I asked and that had hurt me. She said she was also moved on, and over the next 3/4 of a month we talked less and less. 

Over that almost month I started missing her again as it was the first time she didn’t feel present in my life in almost two years. I recently called her to tell her this partly and also apologise for a lot of what I had said and done in the summer, and she seemed very receptive and glad I was apologising. I also told her “I didn’t know where my head was at right now when it comes to us and that I’m not saying we should get back together but I just wanted to let her know that I wasn’t entirely over her like I had said in previous talks”. She said that she will always care about me but she doesn’t know if forcing a long distance relationship is the best thing right now.

I knocked on the bathroom door to ask who Sandy was. He came out angry and said , “oh you tell me who Sandy is. “ I was confused and said what? He said, “ she is you!! So why don’t you tell me whats going on?” I said what the hell are you talking about? Why would I text you as someone else?? He told me his ex did that. I said oh so you text this person back and plan to meet up? I said call the number and let’s find out who Sandy is. He sat shaking and called the number but some how it rang to my phone!!! That part I will never understand how he did but he did it. He then said it was spam ;it seemed like a bot because the convo was choppy. It didn’t look choppy when I read it. He said it had to be a burner phone because he couldn’t figure out who the number belonged to. The story changes every now and then when talking about it. He said it could be from some app or some gambling site that he used once which explains why his bank account keeps getting hacked. He says he’s a good person and cheating isn’t in his language. He could have cheated on his former wife but never did even though he had reason and opportunity too but he’s a good man. Does a good man do any of this??? How did he link the two numbers?? That blows my mind. 
He said he was telling the truth and and will remind me of this every time it comes up. I can go through his phone and he gave me the code even though he’ll say things like you should just trust me and my phone is private. I don’t go through yours because I trust you.

Ive been dating my boyfriend for a while now, and I knew how he lived his life very early on in our relationship.

I love him with all of my heart, and still have plans to marry him, but this petrified me. Since that moment, Ive started being more interested in why that happened, and(against his incessant warnings) started prying more into his life.

We are both pretty active and fit, but our eating habits are quite different. 
I like to think I’m a healthy eater, making sure to get my fruits and veggies (my friends joke about my love for spinach, which is somewhat true … it’s natures candy) but I’m not a health nut and I love to eat the things my girlfriend will bake (it was just my birthday and she made me an awesome red velvet cake).
I wouldn’t say my girlfriend is a picky eater, but her diet consists of a lot of takeout and quick food with not much variety to it. She also struggles with an iron deficiency and other things that I sometimes think an expanded diet would help with.
I don’t want to feel like I’m changing her or forcing something, because I like her for who she is, but I also want to be able to share the foods I like to cook with her.

I (29M) love her (28F) dearly and she is my best friend. But things have changed so much in the last few years that I have been miserable for the last 12+ months.

We started dating in early 2015, we are currently engaged, and have lived with each other for almost our entire relationship. 

She has turned into a totally different person. Always angry, blames me for everything, constantly makes drama between her friends and I, and generally has no respect for me.

She is a shell of the woman I met, and after years of struggling to make her happy I have finally given up… I know it’s all my fault somehow or another (she is incredibly manipulative and takes 0 responsibility for her own actions), but I’m happy to announce that we are in the final twilight. I have been mentally and physically abused by her for too long and I am just done. 

I moved to another state to be with her and have her close to her family and school. I have some money saved, and will be moving back to the east coast hopefully before I turn 30. I’m taking my dog with me as well. I just can’t be here any more. I can’t take her incessant berating any longer. I’m giving up. Throwing in the towel. I tried. I get to cry later but it’s worth it come this time next year.

We instantly clicked and were dating within two months. We had a great relationship we were very close, always spending at least a day outside of school with each other each week, and spending the days at school with each other and our friends as it was a small private school in England. Over the next year and a half we rarely fought, never actually raising our voices at each other in the relationship. 

However, we got to the end of the senior year and would be spending the summer apart so we decided to breakup, we had considered for a few months staying together, but ultimately decided it would be best to seperate. 

Over the summer we had many instances of having issues moving on, and we realised we set up the breakup wrong and had a few talks to help transition into a friendship, this is where I screwed up. I said that I wanted to know if she was getting with anyone new over the summer, and also told her at one point that I thought if she did get with someone else within like a month of us breaking up it would be disrespectful. I know that was stupid and not right but I was in a bad place. Summer went on and she was a bit annoyed with me for that second bit, rightly so. 

She never did do anything in the summer with someone else and neither did I, and before going to school I asked her to get back together with me. She seemed willing, but was questioning me if I was certain that’s why I wanted or if I just was afraid of losing her. I wasn’t sure, because I hadn’t tried anything with anyone else and told her that, we decided to give the decision a few days. I had a lot of outside influences telling me not to over those next few days, mainly my dad telling me not to and that’d I’d miss out on the college experience. So in the end we decided to stay friends but potentially reopen that discussion later.

I visited her some two weeks later as we had been planning for a month, and we pretty much fell back into our couple pattern, being together in the same way we had before. However, she was also confused because we had said only two weeks prior to be friends yet here we were like that. There were times where she seemed to switch mode, and I was later told by her it was because she was just not sure if it was right what we were doing. There were also some times where she would say to me that she wanted to talk abt the state of our relationship, which led to her just asking what I wanted and not actually saying what she wanted. So we never really got anywhere with that convo because I would say “idk where I’m at maybe let me get to college and settle first and then we can revisit this as u have already done so”. The trip ended with both of us happy it happened and I immediately moved out to my own college and got accustomed to life there. 

Over the first month of college we had a bit of a tumultuous time, as we both were adjusting to college life. We had several talks where in later ones I pretty much lied about my feelings and said I had moved on and had done so since she hasn’t immediately wanted to get back together when I asked and that had hurt me. She said she was also moved on, and over the next 3/4 of a month we talked less and less. 

Over that almost month I started missing her again as it was the first time she didn’t feel present in my life in almost two years. I recently called her to tell her this partly and also apologise for a lot of what I had said and done in the summer, and she seemed very receptive and glad I was apologising. I also told her “I didn’t know where my head was at right now when it comes to us and that I’m not saying we should get back together but I just wanted to let her know that I wasn’t entirely over her like I had said in previous talks”. She said that she will always care about me but she doesn’t know if forcing a long distance relationship is the best thing right now.

He’s told me he doesn’t mean to be patronizing or anything, he just gets excited, or just wants to make sure, which is most definitely connected to his OCD.

less than a month ago i met this incredible guy. we hadn't kissed or anything since it was a long-distance relationship, he's a couple hours away and it's been tough meeting up. we've tried to take it slow, and we avoided the l-word (""love"") but there was often talk of getting more intimate and stuff.

well, i began realizing something. we've both been through a lot, emotion-wise, but i've been discovering more and more that i am most likely aromantic. this took a lot of self-reflection, but i really don't feel that kind of love towards people, i never have. i also get massive anxiety in a relationship, and i love my independence and being alone.

that being said, i really, really like this person, but i also don't want to be intimately involved with anyone - so i ended things over the phone, our preferred way of communication due to the distance. i was completely honest with everything, and he understood. i didn't want to lead him on.

sadly, i made him cry, really badly. and i felt horrible about all of this, because i cried too. a lot.

here's where the problem is. the next morning i should have left things alone. the damage had been done, but we needed to recover from this. instead, i called him back and said i wanted to make it work. i was running on pure emotion, i was terrified that i'd made a mistake, and i said i wanted to give it a shot. i'd get past my newfound aromantic identity, somehow. he was...wary, but hopeful. even happy.

and then about two hours later, i chickened out. i got so scared, the anxiety kicked in, and i fully accepted myself as an aromantic individual. so i once again broke it off, and broke his heart a second time in less than 12 hours. i feel like such an asshole, and not only did i give him false hope, but i feel like i betrayed him by doing that.

a bit more information. we're both in our early 30s. we didn't have a ton in common, but we've both been burned by relationships. we also lead perfectly stable lives otherwise, it's just...relationships make things complicated.

TL;DR: i gave a great guy false hope after a breakup because i'm sorta discovering myself as an aro, and i feel so godawful for doing that to him.

i'm not entirely sure why i'm posting this, other than i just want it out there, maybe get some advice. i'm also being a little emotional right now, so i'm sorry if this story goes against the rules of this subreddit. thank you for your time, all. have a wonderful night.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7560694,public,self,"(32f, 34m) Gave False Hope - Am I Horrible?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywil4r/32f_34m_gave_false_hope_am_i_horrible/,all_ads,6,,,

at first things seemed fine, like he was happy to listen, then when I started rambling on about VVER reactor cores he interrupted me and told me he didn't want to be told stuff he knows. I know for a fact that he doesn't know about RBMK and VVER reactor cores. 

he explained to me how he wanted to talk about something else I'd brought up earlier that day that my stupid brain overshadowed with Chernobyl thoughts and that he didn't much care for the topic. that's fine.

except he talks my ear off for hours about marvel, DC, anime, videogames so on so forth, and I'm happy to listen to every second of it. he tends to talk about things I'm already aware of, but I still like listening to him, even if the topic is dull for me, personally.

it's not the first time he's done this, but now I'm mentally backed in a corner. all of my thoughts I have about Chernobyl and the information my brain is collecting wants to be mentioned in a meaningful conversation with him but he's not interested, he'd rather talk about his things, but that's not even what I'm really upset over.

it's just that it's so hypocritical. he's been stressed with uni and his dissertation and I've been giving him suggestions about scheduling but he probably won't bother, my ideas tend to not be very helpful. but it doesn't change the fact that I've just been pushed down for talking about something I enjoy.

I can't help my fixations, I get extremely focused on them and can spend hours looking at information, watching videos, reading books and articles so on so forth when I should be doing my uni work. it's like an itch that turns into a rash and then a sore if I don't scratch it. and now I have no one to share my information with. it's made me feel like all of my interests are boring

I (27M) and my married partner (29FTM) have been together for 5 years, married for 2. He began his transition 2 years ago. In the beginning of our relationship, we were monogamous. I was completely against having anyone else between us, and had a hard time even rationalising his mention of every having another partner.

Fast forward 4 years, and I softened to the idea. We opened our relationship, and sought other partners. His fell through, but I found someone and fell in love. During this time, my husband never said once that he was against this, and we did ask him constantly.
Now, it's been dropped on us for the last 2 months that our relationship will kill him, because he's been having suicidal thoughts, and I need to choose between him or my girlfriend. The thing is, I love them in different ways and I can't lie, I have grown more attached to my girlfriend than my husband.

I've been questioning my sexuality for years, and this has been a struggle from the start as my husband transitions. I.. Am struggling to stay in love and I have told him this before. He's the kind of man who believes love surpasses all hurdles, but I'm not. I know this makes me an asshole, I'm not asking about that.

I ended my relationship with my girlfriend a month ago, despite knowing we both still love each other. I'm now struggling because I feel like I can't be happy anymore. All of the hard work I've put into therapy has come apart, and I'm in a pit. My suicidal thoughts are also now running freely and I feel like I'm not safe for myself. My therapist recommended a split from my partner because I can't force myself to love someone.

My husband asked me to give him a few months and see if we can fall in love again. What do I do here? I don't know if I will be happy if I stay, or happy if I go. No matter what I choose, someone is going to hurt. He'll always be someone I loved, but is that worth sacrificing my own happiness along the way?

Fast forward to April, my wife is now 6 months pregnant and gets a job in a male dominated field (prison guard), the guys she works with flirt with her and send her dick pics, she blocks them and tells them to leave her alone. I think nothing of it. 

My wife gives birth to our child in July, she goes back to work a month later since she couldn’t get maternity leave. She also developed post birth depression so she became more distant. 

I felt like something was wrong about august since normally she doesn’t care if I go on her phone to look something up or show her how to do something if she has a question but she rapidly took it out of my hands when she got a text, i asked about it and she said nothing was going on. I thought it was strange but ignored it. 

In September she tells me that she ended up sexting with one of her coworkers and only stopped because he was being an ass. She doesn’t even seem sorry about it. I feel completely betrayed and lied to. I’m not sure what to do really. I want to work it out with her but I’m not sure if I can truly forgive her for cheating and lying to me or if I can even trust her again.

Now recently my ex reached back out to me saying that she’s moved back to my town and that we should hangout. She admitted that she still loves me and has very strong feelings for me.

It really started when she wanted to hang out together more and more and it lead to us texting a lot. She opened up to me about her personal life, her job frustrations, and her health issues. She made it pretty clear she's unhappy and is struggling. Something that struck me as odd was that she asked me if we thought similarly, specifically when it came to politics, rights, guns, religion and stuff like that. Never in my friendships or relationships have I had that conversation.

What makes this situation difficult is that she is married. She also told me about the issues in her marriage. Including her husband's past vices, his daughter with his ex, and how her in laws don't like her and her parents aren't on good terms with her. When I brought up how she should talk to her husband, she said he doesn't understand her.

Why I think she wants something more was she had invited me over when no one was home in a suspicious way. She cancelled before I arrived. She gets upset if I'm around and don't come spend time with her. If I don't respond to a text, she sends a follow up each day until I answer. If I give too much attention to my female friends, she gets upset and treats them different, then they'll tell me how she acts and they always say she seems jealous I'm not giving her attention. We've also joked about sexual stuff, but it doesn't go far. Plus now she won't text me personal stuff anymore, but will call for very dumb things. She'll still tell me personal stuff when it's just us.

She hasn't mentioned any intent to leave her husband, but she definitely doesn't seem happy and it feels like she likes me. But I would thing the ball falls in her court. What makes this more complicated is we met at work, she has some kids of her own, and everything just seems messy. One of my friends say I need to go for it and ask her out or stay boring.

A while ago though I asked when she started being extra towards me if she was feeling a certain type of way about something, and she ignored the question.

But everything is different and she is acting too weird lately. She seems like she's interviewing me for lack of better words.

I wasn't hurt or anything, just a little confused because I've always just referred to the person I'm dating as my ""girlfriend"" or ""boyfriend"" and told her as such.

Ok guys let me open up a bit need your advice -
So i have started dating this girl and the relationship is still fairly new like 2 - 3 months ? However the thing is that she was in a relationship prior to me which was like for 5 years and she told me that the dude was his friend for 2 years before they got into a relationship
Then for a year she was single - that's when i came into the picture -
So she have already told me about when we were first starting to get to know each other that she was already almost physical with her ex she still keeps assuring me that she is still a virgin but you know she admits they both have done all the foreplay stuffs 
She even used to call the dude her home when no one was around so that they can do all those stuffs 
And lemme tell you it first never bothered me much and  I'm still a Virgin as well 
But since now I'm dating her and when we have those kinds of talks between us 
Sometimes I can't help but imagine that there is someone who have already felt my girl embraced each part of body,
That dude cheated on her later and i understand she knew the guy as they were friends before and it was a 5 yrs of relationship so indeed trusted the guy and never thought this would happen
But man i can't get over the fact that a dude has already done stuffs with her which she would even have liked yk 
And i start overthink stuffs and gets real sad ..
This is the only problem in our  relationship that I'm having
Recently she keeps apologising about it like if she would knew that this will happen she would have never -
The fact that i can't get over it makes me sad and making her feel guilty makes me more sad .. idk what to do about this .

Now Abby is extremely happy to have a new partner, and I can empathize with that. She's been out more, talking more, and all around just up at the front more. And we want nothing more then to give her that happiness.

However, She doesn't do our homework for college. She never really had to before as she normally spends most of her time in the headspace, but she has been spending 90% of her time at the front and not getting any work done. We've found notes detailing the things that WE have to do in the 10% of time that she gives us, and the partner Minnie wants to talk to us over the phone even during that time that we get. It's not only stressful, but we're falling behind.

To add on to all of that, I'm not interested in Minnie at all. They're a nice person, and Abby seems happier now, but Minnie seems to be more of a distraction from our work then anything else and most of us aren't into them. They've been moving very fast in the relationship, which Abby seems to be okay with, but the rest of us are extremely iffy about the whole thing. we'd prefer to move much slower, as we were with our last partner for over five years.

We obviously can't really confront Abby, as we're all living in the same head, but I feel like I should simply make the executive decision of either ghosting them or trying to break it off. I know this will hurt both of them and I don't want either of them to feel hurt or heartbroken, but this has effected our grades and as the host of the system, I don't have the energy to talk to this person, especially since I'm not fond of them, and trying to pretend is so mentally draining.
