I’m afraid to get answers or seek counseling due to upsetting my SO. 

We’ve been together 10 years and it hasn’t been easy. There has been good times of course. But after his TBI things have gotten so bad. 

Where to start? He has a big ego and can be aggressive. I would say aggression has been a new thing after the brain injury…in a bad mood most days. He is usually silent and angry. It literally radiates from him. He throws he head back, blows his breath, gnashes his teeth and covers his face with his hands over the tiniest things the kids do. Or stomps into another room and knocks things off the table or throws things. 

It’s frightening to me and makes them cry or jump. As sometimes it unexpected or worse, if they’re already crying or upset. 

The worst behaviors are him screaming at me until he’s hoarse, breaking things, throwing things at me or he’ll start punching himself. He’ll be yelling so hard it’s like he’s foaming at the mouth. My dog will hide, my children will run to me and cry…it’s scary and I’m just at a loss. 

He’s never hit me or them but I feel like it’s starting to effect them. And I’m worried if I’m overreacting (which is probably from my abusive past as a child) I’m also worried that I’m under reacting…what do I do???

I’m tearing up writing this…he’s a loving involved dad when he chooses to be. And it seems like that’s everyone’s image of him. Except for his close friends, they know.

TL;DR at bottom.

My bf and I have been dating for \~1.5 years. In general, our relationship is pretty good. We're very similar in our interests, goals in life, and senses of humor. He makes me feel comfortable and I feel like I can talk to him about basically anything. When I bring up an issue, he's very patient and willing to have a conversation about it. He apologizes and tries to do better.

I don't know if it's just the stress of being a senior or something, but recently there's been a series of small issues in our relationship. He does something small that I get upset over, and we'll talk about it and he'll apologize but then something else will come up. It's kind of become a cycle. I can think of reasons for these things that he does, but I don't know if I'm just making excuses for him. I'll put a quick list below:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Late to our calls consistently** \- We call daily for \~30 mins because we're both pretty busy and don't have time to talk a lot at school / text throughout the day. A third of the time, he's 5-10 mins late and/or sleeps through the call. He says that sometimes he'll be doing something and forget about it, or fall asleep in the afternoon accidentally and not wake up in time (I can understand this, since he has a wacky sleep schedule and sleeps around 3am).
* **Late birthday present** \- My birthday is one of the last days of October. Around the beginning of October, we talked about my birthday and he told me he would have to give me my present a few weeks late because college apps are due early November and he doesn't have enough time to make a thoughtful present. I thought it was fair enough since he spent a lot of time on his present last year and I know he wants to match the quality of what he did last year. Still haven't gotten the present tho and it's been a while.
* **Spends more time w his friends at school** \- My bf and I are a part of a bigger friend group with mutual friends. When we're all together, he chooses to talk to our friends a lot more than he does with me. In this big group, I feel more like just another one of his friends instead of his gf. But I also get it since he doesn't have any classes with a lot of his best friends and he doesn't have the call that he has with me with them either.
* **Doesn't like PDA** \- Compared to when we first started dating, he's a lot more iffy on PDA (nothing drastic, just hugs and handholding). In private he's still very physically affectionate. This hurt me at first because physical touch is an important love language of mine and we're rarely by ourselves. However we've talked about it and I understand that this is a personal boundary that I should respect. We've compromised on occasional quick/side hugs.
* **Unenergetic/negativity** \- I guess I just wish he had more energy and took better care of himself sometimes. A lot of the time it seems like he doesn't really have energy for me and he seems constantly tired when we're together. He also complains a lot about school/general stuff which I think is also related to how tired he is. It's understandable because of how little sleep he gets though. However when we're on dates he makes an effort to be a lot more present.

What do you guys think? Are these all things that I shouldn't worry about and that are normal in relationships from time to time? If so, any advice on how to stop being upset at these tiny things? Thanks in advance!

**TL;DR:** My bf does small things that upset me from time to time like being late to calls and choosing to spend time with his friends instead of me in person.

I've also noticed that she aligned her days off with his but I haven't really said much about it to her..

He’s a 3rd shift first responder and I’m a student with a 1st shift job. His regular sleep schedule is ~8am-5pm. 

We recently went on our first vacation, I even felt like I fell in love with him a little more with him. It was so perfect. 

Everything turned to shit when we got home. He spent the rest of the vacation time (2 days) at home playing video games, which I totally understand. I’d want to play too if I had to go a week without them! 

I went a week without seeing him due to catching up with school/work after getting back from vacation. On his next day off (yesterday) I came back from work around 6pm. He left and got a drink with his friend and came back after about an hour. At this time, I figured we could spend the night together to make up for the time lost. We spent about an hour (*maybe* two) before he resorted to video games. He played until 7am. 

He woke up at 2pm on his day off today. He greeted me briefly before going on his video game which I assume will be his plan for the rest of the day/night. I don’t know what to do as I feel like I’m just taking up space in the house. I’ve been watching Netflix in the living room while he plays in the bedroom. Not sure if I’m being overly dramatic or not but I quite literally haven’t had an ounce of quality time with him since our vacation last week.

We have been ENGAGED for 5 years now. Long story short, my mother passed on the year of our wedding causing us to get postponed due to my depression and then COVID smacked everyone in the face. So, leading up to this moment in time. I've been all over the place with my moods, and he puts up with me. But! He has been virtually cheating on me for years. He even did it on the day he proposed to me. I guess everyone's opinions are different on cheating. It's not just porn. I don't mind porn to an extent until it becomes the only thing he gets off too, but he hasn't done that in years, I'm his sexual partner still. But he sexts girls, sends and receives pics. He went out of his way to make hidden emails and profiles on his phones and computers. It took 4 years for me to find that stuff, out of gut feelings for years he was cheating. He paid for women, he went way out of his way to get off to other women and hide it from me. We have talked about it over and over again. Recently I caught him doing it again after months and months of him not, and this time it pissed me off but didn't hurt like it used to. We had a long talk, and every time we do I feel like he's listening but then he ""slips up"" and acts up again. He also tells me to show him proof or it didn't happen. Then he looks at the proof to better hide his actions. So I'm on a stand by where I don't know if he's still cheating. I love him to death and I have stopped doing things that bothered him. I don't want to lose him. But at the same time, I dont like myself anymore. I have no confidence. He doesn't compliment me very much anymore. The only time sex is a thing is when he wants it, but if I'm not in the mood he will sit there and jerk off to other women in front of me. I need advice on how to convince him to stop and work with me if he wants to be with me. For years I have forgiven and forgiven. But he barley cries, he cried the other night because he thought I was actually going to leave this time. But I didn't mention it, just thought about it for days and he felt it.

I'm (22m) making my girlfriend (21f) an advent calendar for her birthday (It's on the 17th of November) where the 24th present is her christmas present. 

1. Does this come of as cheap? I don't wanna seem like I'm trying to save a present or something like that. Also she won't be getting anything on her birthday since it's not in December. Is that weird?
2. Do you have any creative advice for approaching this? I've made a sort of ""weekly themed"" calendar where theres little gifts every day that have something to do with eachother and a bigger / more expensive / more laborious gift on the Sundays / Christmas.  
My way to do this was to simply pack all of the gifts and put little Notes with the numbers and a little message on them but I feel that doesn't really give off advent calendar vibes.   
Has anyone ever done something along the lines of this before and can give me any advice on how to make it seem more like its an advent calendar instead of a pile of presents with little notes on them?  
There's bigger and heavier presents too, so it'll be hard to have the whole thing be in the air or something like that.

This guy is someone on her course. I've known that they have become pretty good friends but I've always trusted her so it's been fine. Two other people on her course are also a couple and I've become quite friendly with them because the four of us hang out as couples. The guy in the couple is also apparently close enough with the guy in question and he told him that my girlfriend finally agreed to go out with him and that he's going to shag her. He had no other real details as he said he didn't want to know and didn't want to be involved but I'm not sure if I believe him. I get the impression that he didn't want to be talking to me about this but he probably told his girlfriend and she was making him tell me something at least. He admitted that he was told this over a week ago so I'm terrified that if this is true it might have already happened. My girlfriend never mentioned hanging out with anybody but I'm working full time during the week and she's not in college every day so it could have happened and Id never know.

I don't really have any other friends here so I don't know who to talk to. The advice I'm looking for is what is the best way to approach this? I don't want to accuse my girlfriend of anything as this could all be bullshit or a misunderstanding and just because this guy has said he's going to shag her doesn't mean he gets too. The only thing is if she agreed to hang out with him and it's innocent on her part she would have told me. I'm not sure what to do? I asked the female friend if she would be open to talking to her and seeing if she tells her anything and she said she would but Id be putting her in a shit position and thats not fair.

It’s your life so you can live it how you want

So i am a virgin and i have always planned to be until marriage with the love of my love because i want to be both each other’s first and i can understand to an extent why some people might find that weird because of the prevalence of hook up culture (again not shaming anyone who does)especially in college.

so a couple of my friends invited me into a college party which i really didn’t feel like going (i’m not really a party person)but i went anyway and immediately my friends went dragged me to go to talk to some girls and wanted me to hook up with one of them.i told them and my friends that i would only like to be friends because i’m saving my first experience for my soulmate and i guess to them it was surprising and one girl even told me “but you don’t even look like that type of guy”.

for more context i am a very athletic person (compete boxing and MMA)i have a good body,height of 5’10 and my face looks handsome (that’s what my girl friends tell me).

So after what i said some of them tried getting closer more than i was comfortable with so i excused myself and left the party and went for a walk to clear my head before i headed back to the dorms.ever since that night i notice that everytime we go out girls try to get closer to me or some guys talk to me like i’m way different from them.

i asked my friend what is going and he told me that me being a Virgin and wanting to wait and to top it all off being as “handsome as i am”has made me a sort of “Perfect Prize” for the girl who can sleep with me and be my Girlfriend and some guys detest me because in their words “i can get any girl i want yet i act like i’m above them”.i’m still confused on why would they think like that.i’m not a prize neither am i better than anyone.im just a normal person with his own beliefs",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7538950,public,self,I get treated differently because i’m a Virgin in college,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yubclk/i_get_treated_differently_because_im_a_virgin_in/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So, I first started talking to him in this group chat with me, him and another person. All of us met up and me and the guy really hit it off. We met up alone next week and had an amazing time together, he also hugged me very tightly goodbye which was very nice.

I don’t know where to go further. We talk everyday in the group chat, and I’d like to start texting him individually, but I feel weird not doing it in the group chat.

We weren’t official, but I’d still count it. I was in love with her, but she ended up “losing feelings” and being a total bitch (see my post history for more info). I was depressed for a month, but ended up recovering for a few days.

That is, until she texted me asking to call. I was weary, but I called her. She was upset that we weren’t friends. She wanted to be on good terms. (For context: I haven’t been an asshole to her. I’ve just straight up ignored her). I told her how things were and she cried a little and hung up. I was happy at first that she FINALLY showed emotion, but I woke up and felt like absolute shit.

There are two other women. One is a very close friend who I have good chemistry with, but everything else is just a huge no go. She was who I turned to when I was upset about my ex. She’d turn to me with her issues. I knew things about her no one else knew. But I recently got told that she has developed feelings for me even though she’s talking to someone. I liked her for a year, but I stopped a while back. I think I may be getting feelings for her and I don’t know why. I know things wouldn’t work out and I know that it would ruin our relationship and I have someone else (more in a second). She also has someone else. 

Then there’s the last girl. A week ago (when I thought I was finally over my ex) I asked for her number and have begun talking to her. I’ve liked on and off for a year and was going to ask her out when I asked out my ex, but I chickened out. We’ve never talked before last week. I can tell that she likes me though as she will always look at me and look away and she’ll text me back immediately unless she’s doing something. And I really like her. It’s not a rebound thing. I genuinely like her for her.

So that’s the context. As an introvert, I’ve been in my head nonstop about this situation. Sometimes I’ll think of Girl B and push away. I’ll wonder if I still have feelings for Girl A. And I stress about starting a relationship with Girl C (although I REALLY want to) because it’s stressful and I don’t think it’s be fair to her right now. I’m trying to take things VERY slow with Girl C which I think she is okay with because she is very shy. I just don’t know what to do. None of my friends can help me because they’ve never been in a situation close to this. And even with the context, I’m sure it’s probably hard for some random people on the internet to help. But I genuinely would be interested and thankful for anything you guys have to say. Thanks.

My gf [f21] and I [m21] have been dating for about a year and 8 months now. We've mostly had a good relationship, but we occasionally run into miscommunications which inevitably lead to me receiving days of silent treatment. Some of these have genuinely been my fault, never due to malice, but usually just poor planning and bad choices of words. Others have been unlucky coincidences. I don't want to pretend I've been perfect, but the issue I've had has been how she has handled communication when things like this happen.

This used to be a relatively rare thing, happening once every few months, but it has happened twice in the last week and I'm starting to get very worried.

Here is the first case.

A week or so ago, we were both performing in the band for a university theatre production. Over the few months of rehearsals beforehand, she has been treated quite terribly by the band director who took every opportunity to exclude her. I've tried my best to be supportive of her and show that I'm on her side, but in the interest of keeping the peace with the rest of the band, I haven't directly had any arguments with the band director, since as I was the head of arranging it would have resulted in massive issues for the rest of the production if one of us had to leave. I've kept my working relationship with the band director as respectful and professional as I can. 

On one of the nights, the band did an extra surprise performance for the other people in the production, and apparently the band director was very nasty about my gf being excluded from the piece. I was not aware of this happening, and I only saw the music for it a minute before we performed it - I didn't even realise that she hadn't been given a part - all I knew was that she wasn't there. After we played that piece, we played a second piece which did have a part for her, however she didn't turn up even though we called for her. I tried to stall for as long as possible thinking she had gone to the loo or something, but eventually we had to start playing. Halfway through this performance, she ran down from the audience, grabbed her instrument and ran away, looking visibly distressed. While she was there, I tried to ask her what was wrong, but her response was inaudible over the music. 

When the performance was over, we had to pack up immediately since there are strict times by which we need to be out of the theatre. As soon as I was packed up, I sent her a message to see if she was ok. This was roughly 20 minutes after she had grabbed her instrument and ran, but it was evidently too late. She refused to talk to me for days, aside from a few passive-agressive responses to my attempts to check on her.

When I did talk to her, I found out that she had a wildly incorrect understanding of my role in the situation. She assumed that I had arranged the surprise piece to purposefully exclude her, or at least had been complacent with it. This is not true: I knew it was being arranged by someone else, but I didn't know the instrumentation or anything - I didn't even see the music until a minute before we played it. She also thought that I saw her crying at the back of the theatre while we were performing. I did not - the lights were off and I had no idea where she was. 

While I understand why she was upset, I can't help but be frustrated by her poor communication with it - if I knew what was wrong sooner I would have been able to help her feel better, and at the very least stop her from feeling like I was conspiring against her. The only thing that I did which was wrong was choosing to continue the performance, rather than going after her when she ran down to get her instrument, and while I'd definitely do it differently if given a second opportunity, I hardly think my actions were unreasonable.

When she was finally open to talk about it, she communicated in a way which I feel was quite manipulative. She was happy to tell me how I had chosen the performance over her (the situation wasn't that simple), and how I didn't make an effort to make sure she was ok (I did, but she chose to ignore my messages), and how I was too focused on making it about me (no I wasn't?). Sure also told me that 3 of her friends told her to break up with me, even once she knew that she had misunderstood the situation (I did not conspire against her) - I might be reading too deeply into this but to me it felt like her suggesting what a good person she was for bothering to talk to me rather than breaking up, as a way to back me into a corner in terms of the communication by leaving the threat on the table. I don't want my interpretation of that to be correct, but that's certainly how it felt. Eventually we did manage to come to a mutual understanding on the issue, but it was a very stressful few hours of discussion.

That brings us to today's issue.

We were both studying separately and she finished about an hour and a half earlier than she suggested she would. She came to my room to hopefully enjoy some time with me, however I didn't hear her knocking because I was wearing noise cancelling earbuds. I do this when I study because I am easily distracted, and need to shut out as many external stimuli as possible if I want to be productive. After she knocked she sent me a message, but I didn't get a notification because I had messenger open in the background on my laptop, which silenced the notifications on my phone. My laptop was in do not disturb mode, so I didn't get a notification on it either. 

In the past I have had problems with missing her knocking on my door and missing messages. I've worked to address these by only wearing my earbuds when I don't expect to be interrupted, and by ensuring her message notifications ring through do not disturb, as well as communicating more clearly about times when I can expect her to show up at my door. Sadly I haven't found a way to make her messages give notifications on my phone even if the desktop app is running in the background. I also check for messages from her frequently so I don't miss anything due to the buggy mess that is Facebook Messenger's notifications.

Anyway, not even 15 minutes after her message was sent, I saw it and responded saying ""yes a study break would be nice"", however by this time it was already too late in her opinion. She agreed to let me come to her study room so I could apologise for missing her message and not hearing her knocks, and I did, but this was not good enough. She accused me of prioritising my study over her, suggested I don't care about her, and said a number of other cruel things about me that I don't believe are true. 

She knows that I use noise cancelling earbuds to help combat distraction when I'm trying to focus, but when I brought this up she accused me of using my ADHD traits as an excuse to avoid accountability. She knows that sometimes I miss notifications due to issues I haven't figured out how to control, but that I try to check frequently enough to not be too late, but that isn't good enough for her. It feels like she is demanding constant attention from me, but every time I've tried to express my concern about this towards her, she's accused me of putting her at the bottom of my list of priorities, which is both untrue and very narrow-minded. I understand that it's important for us to spend time together, but the fact is that I have a lot of other commitments that I need to attend to if I want to keep my jobs and maintain my good grades to get my degree.

She also managed to bring up my struggles to access professional help for my ADHD traits. She has accused me of not putting in the effort to get help because ""if I get help I won't be able to use it as an excuse anymore"" (not a direct quote, but very much the vibe of what she said). Although I haven't done it as fast as I probably should due to life getting in the way, and various other unrelated setbacks, I believe I've made much more of an effort than she has let on. I don't feel very comfortable going into the details of the issues I've run into, but getting a diagnosis and access to affordable therapy/treatment has been expensive, tedious and difficult. I feel like her bringing this up was extremely uncalled for and highly inappropriate. Keep in mind that this was due to me missing her knocking because I was wearing noise cancelling earbuds while I studied.

It's extremely frustrating, because I feel like I can't bring up any of these issues because doing so is ""blame shifting"" and ""twisting the problem"". It feels like there is no way for me to express my frustrations about her poor communication without making her mad at me.

It feels like every issue, no matter the cause, seems to lead back (or be led back) to me supposedly not caring about her enough, or prioritising other things over her.

Some of her specific actions have also had very similar vibes to the way that my step-father has treated me in the past, in terms of him not caring about my perspectives in arguments, and bringing every issue back to me supposedly not caring about things enough. She knows that that kind of dialogue is very upsetting for me, but whenever I have tried to communicate this with her, she gets upset about being compared to my step-father, which completely misses the point that the way she handles these issues strongly reminds me of the way he has treated me in the past.

Typing this all out, it's clear just how toxic the relationship has become, but the most upsetting thing is that for almost all the time things are usually so lovely. She is usually a wholesome, kind and thoughtful person who I absolutely love spending time with, and I really don't want to lose that. It really frustrates me that things go from completely fine to feeling relationship-endingly bad, literally within a matter of minutes. It feels like my emotions get manipulated as a way for her to express her own feelings. At the same time however, I really don't want to lose the most wonderful person I have ever met - she is one of the only people who really gets me, and she is usually so understanding of all my quirks and shortcomings, and knows that I try my best to be as good as I can be for her. I don't think there are many people who would be anywhere as lovely to spend time with as her on the good days.

What I would like advice on is whether this is worth trying to salvage at this point - each time this happens, it has a huge impact on my mental health (I haven't been able to sleep and it's currently 6:05 AM), and I don't think I can sustain it into the future - I have too much work as it is, and I can't afford any more late nights.

If you think it is worth working on, I'd really appreciate advice on how I can communicate all this with her. I'm bad at words at the best of times, and when choosing language delicately is important I often tend to say things that are much less constructive than I would like - I'm not saying I say cruel or malicious things, just that I sometimes make bad comparisons or choose poor phrasing which can lead to more anger and frustration than I want.

We met in college, we’ve been together 5 years. Based in the US but I’m Mexican and he’s Pakistani and Muslim (though he doesn’t really practice, it’s more cultural). I know we are both still young but so many of my friends and ex schoolmates are getting married/having kids and it’s really starting to get to me.

First, our cultural differences haven’t really posed a huge problem, except for this one thing. His family has no idea I exist. He said he’ll tell them about me as soon as he gets into a graduate program, but right now that’s looking like it’s at least 2 years away. I try to be understanding because I understand he has familial pressure to date within his race/religion, but it still hurts. Especially because my family is very close, he spends Christmas with us, and we travel to visit them when we can. I just feel like I’ve put in all this effort to bring him into our my family and that effort isn’t reciprocated. Not to mention that whenever he does tell them, we’re gonna have to deal with the inevitable backlash from his family.

Second, he’s wanting to get into the medical field. Meaning he’s going to go back to school and then his residency. Which just makes me think we won’t start our life together officially until around 7 years after he starts? And it makes me even more worried because I already finished graduate school, waiting to take my licensing exam, but I’m already working. I can’t just get up and move with him because my licensing is state specific. But the alternative, being long distance, sounds even worse. I don’t think I would be able to handle being apart like that.

I find myself stuck with a “grass is greener” mentality and it makes me feel so guilty. I love him to pieces but all this waiting and indecisiveness is taking a toll on me. I wonder if I would be easier with someone else.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Some days I feel like I’m overreacting but it’s been bothering me more and more. I’m looking for any advice or tips on how to handle this. TIA!

Back in June I had fallen pretty hard for Rick (Fake name 25 M) he and I shared a lot of the same interests and for months I thought he liked me until I confessed and he told me he never felt the same way. I’ll admit that was one of the darkest points of my life. And although Rick and I decided to stay as friends since we got along great. It still hurt seeing him everyday. We’re co-workers. So I’m attempt to get myself over him I downloaded Tinder as I am not a social person and where I work, aside from Rick, is full of old men. I ended up matching with Mike and we instantly clicked. Unlike with most people, there was no awkwardness. We got along great like we were old friends. 

Back in October Rick and I were planning on going to a concert. Just us. He calls me and tells me I’ll need to purchase another ticket. As he wanted to bring the girl he’s been seeing. And it hurt, a lot. I knew I needed someone to talk to so before even meeting Mike I asked him if he could call me when he was done work. He knew immediately something was wrong and ended up calling me. We talked for nearly three hours and he was nothing but amazing. He kept me happy and did all he could to keep my mind occupied. Knowing I couldn’t bare to go the nearly two hour drive to the concert with Rick and his girl. I asked Mike to come with me. Despite never meeting me or knowing the bands he agreed. 

Mike and I agreed to meet one day as we get along so great on and text and on the phone, we knew it was time. But a couple days before that he sent me a message asking if he could be honest with me. Turns out he has a girlfriend (22 F) who he’s been with for a year. She knows about tinder and they’re in an open relationship. They both see other people sexually. I was fine with that. Thinking he and I could be best friends instead. So the first time I meet him. I also met his girlfriend. It was weird but over all I think went alright. So to get more comfortable around him before the concert I invited him to my place two days later. Safe to say we did more then just friendly things that day. 

So in a sense we became friends with benefits. Friends who do stuff with no strings attached and still act like friends. I got myself into this knowing full well I would end up getting hurt because this would never give me the the love and relationship I deeply desire. 

Days come and go until one day he calls me while driving because he wanted my advice on a situation. Another girl (20 F) who he’s known for two months who he has been seeing caught feelings for him, left her boyfriend and wants to move in with him and his girlfriend. As a second relationship. And it just stung. I know I got myself in the situation but the thought of that hurt and made me feel beyond unwanted and worthless. Because I was never even considered for something like that. But I try to be as supportive as I can even though it destroyed me. 

Just a few days ago I met the other girl because I felt maybe befriending them would make it hurt less. It really didn’t. 

Everybody is telling me to drop him and find somebody else but I feel like I can’t. He and I get along so well and I’ve never clicked with somebody like this before. He means so much to me but I know if I stay it will destroy me. I want to talk to him about it. Because I know I can talk to him about anything and maybe at least get him to not talk about it with me but I’m so scared it’ll mess things up and I just can’t lose him. Not after everything. I feel stuck and I honestly just don’t know what to do.

I got my heart broken so I downloaded tinder. Found a guy who was perfect. Turns out he’s in an open relationship, I became one of his friends with benefits.

I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for 3 years. We moved in together on our 1 year anniversary and have been living together for the past 2 years. Fast forward to now, I kicked my boyfriend out yesterday morning after an incident the night before. The “incident” has been a recurring argument we’ve had many times since moving in with each other. These incidents have progressed and gotten worse over the past probably 6ish months.

So the problem is when my boyfriend and I get upset at one another over a disagreement, miscommunication, etc. things can sometimes get chaotic and we both tend to get irrationally upset. We tend to clash even worse when it comes to resolving the argument. I prefer to take space and not speak to him until I feel ready to communicate. I can go hours after an argument without speaking to him. He is the complete opposite and prefers to talk about what happened like right then and there. He immediately wants to apologize and talk things out. This tends to overwhelm me and
I just don’t function this way. I have told him I would like to establish a boundary where I can take space and time but we’ve not had much progress. He’s very aware of this as well; we’ve been attending couples therapy for the past two months and this issue has been a main topic so I knew he’s aware of what he’s doing. 

Back to what happened- Friday night after binge watching a show with me, he got upset because it was 11:40 and he had an assignment due at 12:00. An argument ensued and I went to our room.  

For context: Our house originally only had a lock on the bathroom door and the bedroom doors didn’t have them. So I would either lock myself in the bathroom or sit on the other end of the bedroom door and try to keep it closed with my body. He almost always tend to bust the door down. So much so that I had him go out and get locks for the bedroom. He went and got the type of locks that are hook and eyes that just screw into the wall. This didn’t work as he ended up busting down the door with one of the new locks. His excuse was that it was in the wall all the way…. Not that he was yet again trying to push the door down. I would lock him out the entire house but he broke the lock on our back door and before that he busted our kitchen window banging on it because I had locked him out. 

So back to present, after he broke down the lock I just had him install in our bedroom I had enough and told him to get out and go to his parents for the weekend. Is there any world possible where we can work this out and move back in together?? Has anyone kicked out their significant other and stayed together with them? Did you move back in together with strong understanding of each other’s boundaries? Or should I just cut my losses now? 

I love my boyfriend so much and he grew up in an unstable environment with really narcissistic parents so I try to give him the benefit of the doubt because I know a lot of this is learned behavior from his father. He’s broke down many times trying to come to terms with this behavior and promising to get help but it hasn’t happened yet and I’m losing faith. 

Also as of right now he is under the expectation that he will be coming home tomorrow. I really don’t think will do us any good so at the very least I think he should move out if we are to stay together at all.

My gf (20f) and I (19f) have been together for months now and we usually appear as the funny and looks just like ""they're really good friends and not a couple"" type of couple, but recently I have noticed that she tends to be set off by the simplest things. One time I asked what she was doing at the moment and she full blown guilt trip, then she proceeded to ignore me for over an hour long. I obviously panicked since I have a hard time knowing if I had done something wrong, but in this case, I am 100% certain that I've done nothing to upset her. 

Another is when she really forces the idea of me having another lover or partner. I do understand that it's a common joke, but she really does pushes it to the point that it's annoying. Sometimes, we do joke about it, but there are times when she really is serious and terrifying. Like this one time, we were at the mall and we sat down in a fast food restaurant. I refused to use their restroom because it was small so I had to use the mall's restroom. In front of the restroom was a toy store, I checked if they had the item that I wanted and it took like 5 mins long. After checking the store, I went back to the restaurant which was a few steps away. As I sat down, she bombarded me with questions like where was I, who did I meet with, and why did it take so long. I explained, but she didnt budge. She continued to harass me with questions I already answered. At some point, I got fed up and ""shouted"" (I raised my voice but I have a loud voice so it made it seem like I'm shouting) and asked her to stop. She eventually did, but then she did this sad dog eyes thing which lead to me apologizing for ""shouting"". After, we talked about it and agreed that she would no longer accuse me.

What really set me off is when we were walking in the hallway and I gazed at someone simply because I was wondering if I knew that person. She looked familiar and I hadnt notice that my eyes stared at her for 5 whole seconds. I don't know what crossed her mind but she had a tantrum. She accused me of having another parter which was the random person who walked by us. As she was yelling and screaming, I left since it was infuriating.

As soon as I got home, I texted her a bunch of messages calling her annoying and insecure. I got carried away a bit and continued to rant how I was getting annoyed by what she had been doing. I think I overstepped the line because she hasnt been answering my texts and calls. I wont see her for over a week due to emergency purposes, but I'm starting to feel bad.

Our sex life is pretty active, averaging around 3-4 times a week. We have gone a week without having sex partly because she was on her period and the last 3 nights she was not in the mood even though I was, which I completely understand and am ok with. Today she tells me she wants to have sex, I was honestly not in the mood and could not get myself to be in the mood mentally no matter how hard I tried. She was visibly bothered by this but again I just couldn’t get myself there so I just pushed through with the day. I noticed she went to the bedroom and was there for a bit so I called her to come to the living room and watch tv with me because I wanted to hang with her. She wouldn’t come ( no pun intended lol) so I asked what she was up to. She come out the bedroom and said she was masturbating because I wouldn’t have sex with her. She then tells me that if I don’t want to have sex with her she’s going to go ahead and use her vibrator. She also mentioned that she told me she wanted to have sex and that this is what happens because I said no.

I have zero problem with her using a vibrator or masturbating, zero. I cut back my masturbation because it was affecting our sex life but that was my choice and she should be free to masturbarte as much as she desires as long as i doesn’t affect our sex life. My concern is her intention, I feel like she did it as a punishment and that to me is a big problem because weaponizing sex or sexuality is a big red flag in my book. In my mind it becomes well if I am ever having a sexual lull that is not due to her am I going to be punished? Is there a long jump from a vibratorio to another man?

Over the last five months I’ve been with a 16 female. It was going great, we went to homecoming together and other wholesome activities. 

Although not nearly as much as most would seeing as we live in a small farm community and I work on a farm everyday while maintaining an A average in all my classes 3/6 are AP. And she works most days and has very strict parents. So we didn’t hang out that much. We have had the last few days off of school because it was finals week. Then on Thursday (one day after our five months) she said she was done.She said that I made her uncomfortable. ( we had a single class together and I would frequently show harmless physical attention. Like touching her leg.) She would tell me to stop and not do that at school but I didn’t listen to her. 

 I was and still am devastated, but I believe she is too. And that her friend who is a known homie hopper influenced her to make the decision she now regrets. After she said she was done she would still answer my texts when she was online. 

But like I said she has strict parents. Mostly her mother. Her mother had also taken quite a shining to me and seemed to think highly of me. When she found out her daughter broke it off she became very angry and grounded her. 

I still believe that we could get back together, but I haven’t been able to talk to her. 

So redditers this is where I need your help. I have written an apology text that I would like help with any advice and tips is very much appreciated.

(Her name) I’m sorry for the way I acted and didn’t listen to you. There really is no excuse, it was unacceptable. I never meant to make you feel uncomfortable and I’m truly sorry, I can’t express it enough. But I don’t want to give up on this. It’s going to be hard at times, and this is one of those times, but nothing in life worth doing is ever easy. This relationship is the most worthwhile thing I’ve ever done. It would be a shame to throw it all away because of my mistakes. We fit so good together. I promise you that I will listen to you more, show you more respect, and communicate with you better, just like you deserve. I want to be with you, although I can’t show you that if I don’t get the chance to. I’m not asking much from you. Just for you to think about what will really make you happy, if that’s not being with me then so be it, but I really do hope that you are at your happiest with me. And that we can get past this rough time to get to something worthwhile. And if you’re on the fence still, let me show prove this to you. Saturday night let’s go out you can invite your friends if you want and we will do whatever you want to do, I do know you missed out on shopping trip and bowling.

I felt like there was chemistry right away, which is why I'm still talking to him but we have really only been on like six dates since I have been very busy with work. I was spending 12 hour days for like a month to get things done for a very tight deadline - thankfully I now got severance pay and will be going to Colombia for a few months while applying for similar remote jobs.   


I did tell him that I prefer a slower pace from the beginning but he's allowed to not be okay with the lack of commitment/attention. I was feeling sparks between us up until the last date when he gave me a hard time for not giving him more attention. Now I feel like I should end it because I don't feel the same way, even though I don't feel like I've given myself enough time to really get to know him or to really think about how I feel since I've been so busy with work. 

Part of the reason I'm not willing to commit or give him more attention is that I am seeing another guy \[30M\]. My boss and I developed feelings while working together on a project that just ended. Our project ended so he won't be my boss anymore but the job was remote so he lives in another state. It was pretty obvious that there were mutual feelings. We did discuss both being open to moving (which would be easy since we both work remotely) and he told me he wants to meet my parents when he comes to my city. We haven't been talking everyday but we are planning to give a presentation at a conference together at the beginning of December.

I'm currently thinking that my former boss is a better fit for me and I have a lot more feelings for him but I don't want to make a decision until I've met him in person and we have been on actual dates. 

I also just feel like if I gave the guy that leaves near me as much attention as he wants, then I would be leading him on. I also just don't feel like I know him well enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR 

I \[29F\] have been seeing this guy \[28M\] for a two months and I told him I wanted to take things very slow on our first date. I just finished a really big work project that required me to work 12 hours a day for 21 days and I also told him that I would not be as available during that period. Despite that, I did set aside time to see him during the last month but he got upset at me for not giving him as much attention as he wanted. I see potential in him but I don't want to get too invested right now because I told myself I would explore my options and really take my time to get to know someone before committing. 

I also just had a new thing that just kinda happened with my former boss \[30M\]. The job I just finished was remote and my former boss lives in a different state but we are making plans to go give a presentation at a conference in December. I personally feel like my former boss and I are a better match but I don't want to make a decision even though I have a lot of feelings because I want to meet him in person.

Or “ I don’t want to hurt you because I care about you”. It truly bothers me how quick and easy it would be for him to cut things off between us.

A few months ago I did sleep with another guy and he found out and was extremely angry and blocked me on everything. We did eventually start talking again and we’re fine now but I don’t see why he cares what I do when he doesn’t have “ relationship feelings for me”.

I was seeing a female therapist. I was telling her things that make me depressed and make me want to avoid men.

She had a mental breakdown soon after I had had many sessions with her. Should I therefore take her words with a grain of salt? Is she a voice of reason or somebody that I can trust? 

I told her that I don't want anything to do with men because they don't appreciate v aginas. Then I gave her some examples.

She said the m ajority would not agree with me, 

She said o ral sex is 50/50 between the genders, one night stands and all. She said the only reason b lowjobs might be slightly more common is due to men having a higher s ex drive and so getting b lowjobs as s exual favours from partners.

She said the vast m ajority of men have zero interest in women who have p enises and t ransgender women, p re o p or p ost o p. I gave her an example if a study. She then said that the m ajority of people would not interpret that it is s traight men watching t ransgender women if they saw that""t ransgender"" was number 10 most popular category on the the p orn h ub annual review for 2021. And she said people would not think that it's s traight men who use l adyboy s ex tourism.

She said v aginas are not appreciated any less than p enises, b oobs and b utts and that b oobs and b utts are talked about more due to size difference preferences whereas v aginas look more similar.

She also said v aginas have no s tigma.

She said the majority of people do not believe that men prefer younger women for s ex and b eauty nor that men leave their wives for younger women when they have affairs nor that rich men prefer younger women. She also said beauty is not believed to be all about how much younger you look, that it's not widely believed that women become invisible with age also that it's not widely believed that women are obsessed with their age and ageing and that it is not widely true that people are d isgusted by old bodies and the idea of old people having s ex.

She said it is not widely believed that women hate each other and instead it's believed that women mostly support each other.

How many of these things that she told me do you think she got right or wrong?

Also, I did see this therapist and these things did happen, as strange as her words were, for a therapist. I was surprised because she told me I was wrong for the majority and even promised that we could do an online anonymous survey for me. She said no other therapist would answer my questions because that is not what they are there for, but that she saw how much I was bothered by these things so she did that for me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7538786,public,self,"My therapist had a mental breakdown, should I disregard all the words of wisdom that they gave me?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yuapp1/my_therapist_had_a_mental_breakdown_should_i/,all_ads,6,,,,,
