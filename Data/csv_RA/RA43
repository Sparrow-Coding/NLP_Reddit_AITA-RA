A few other colleagues of her will also come including guys. I have met them before, but generally didn't have a good impression of them. 

My girlfriend has been to parties without me before, but normally at least with some of her girl friends that I also know. I have been to parties with her colleagues before. 

For the current party she said she wanted to go alone because she also wants some alone time sometimes and would like to see her former colleague. 

I understand that everyone including people in relationships need alone time. I allow her to go to the party, but it still makes me feel worried a bit, which she knows. My girlfriend says she won't have much fun at the party now because she knows I'll be worrying about her.

Like I trust my girlfriend and I love her so much. However I have no mutual friend at that party. So once there is alcohol involved and me not being there I feel like u never know what other guys might try to do.

She is 31 but youthful looking, beautiful &amp; athletic (abs). She loves exercise, playing the piano, watching football, writing and baking for family &amp; friends - her cakes look amazing actually. She is family oriented- spends a lot of time with her little niece and nephew and they adore her. In terms of her personality... she is kind, caring, laid back and doesn't take life too seriously.

She went to two very good universities so she is intelligent. She is currently an elementary school tutor and hasn't really had much of a career as she's still figuring things out. At present she works 20 hours per work tutoring in school, 1 hour every two weeks doing radio reporting, 2 hours a week doing sports writing and 1 hour private tuition... so this is about 23 hours per week. Therefore she is working part time. She comes from a wealthy family but she's down to earth. However I feel as though she isn't as motivated to do well in life as she has her family's money to fall back on - she only has $27k saved up, doesn't own a car and relies on her parents a lot (still lives at home although it's a huge house).

I'm a bit worried as she's been complaining about things that are affecting her work and, as her current contract ends in about 8 weeks time, she is looking to take a break from work for a bit then. She suffers with anxiety which impacts her breathing. She tells me her breathing is the worst it has been - she often struggles to catch her breath and she has a constant trapped sensation in her throat. She claims that at work she feels she is constantly trying to breathe especially as her school is quite warm - it's worse in hotter temperatures and she has to plan her outfits around this (she can't wear polo necks as she feels more suffocated or thick jumpers etc).

She's meant to be running the London marathon next year and whilst she is motivated to do it, and I think she will, she isn't doing much training the last few weeks. Running usually helps to ease her anxiety but I've noticed she hasn't been watching her diet as much recently and has been out running a bit less.

I’ve been with my partner [M30s] for years and we live together. He knows it pisses me off when he makes sexist jokes. And now it sets me off more because of the a lot of things that were said during our rough patch. I should say things are fine now but I guess I need time to recover. 

He was making a lot of sexist jokes for 2 days and was getting entertained that I was getting pissed off about it. He said he would stop about the sexist jokes on the next day and he did. Now maybe one or two might come out of his mouth. Because he kept making sexist jokes and enjoying annoying me, I started arguing with him. And it lead me in feeling down afterwards. I don’t think I’m particularly difficult to deal with when I’m down. I just don’t laugh as much, or I don’t have as much energy and might get annoyed easier. 
He told me today that I’m difficult to deal with when I’m down and he wants me to be happy again. He did say he loves me. He told me because it’s difficult then he avoids me more, even though he knows I love cuddles. 
I told him that he could just try to cheer me up instead of saying that, because hearing that makes me feel less loved and bad. He said that I wanted him to communicate with me and now I’m shutting him down. I thanked him for communicating with me. 
But it did make me feel bad. That I’m too much for a loved one if I’m not happy? I don’t want people to want me around only when I’m happy, cuz then what’s the point. Why should I always be happy. 

I told him that if it’s too hard to deal with me when I’m feeling down, then I can go away for few days. He said he doesn’t want me to. And because he doesn’t want me to go away for few days, that’s his way of dealing with me for being down. 
He said he’s been avoiding cuddling me because he tried it in the past when I was feeling down and it didn’t work so he won’t do it again lol (even though when he knows I love it and ask for it all the time because I don’t get enough of them). 
He did also tell me that I annoy him when I’m feeling down. Now I should mention a lot of the times I can’t tell when he’s serious and when he’s not. But I’m assuming this is not a joke, since he said I’m difficult. 

Anyway, how do you guys deal with your partner when they’re feeling down? Do you just ignore them till they feel better? Do you tell them they’re annoying you? 


He’s been better lately. But what he said made me feel even more unloved.

I did not realize what I was doing was trauma dumping, and I never tried to use it in any way to get anything from them. I dont have many friends who I trust to talk to about my emotions and I've been in the midst of a pretty severe depressive episode. I recognize I need(and want) professional help but simply cannot afford it, I did not intend to use my partner as a substitute for this. I just wanted to talk about how I was feeling with someone I trust and receive support and comfort. I didnt even think I was talking about my depression that frequently, every once in a while I get particularly sad or we get into an argument that prompts a fairly strong emotional reaction from me, but they said im negative all the time (ie: complaining about my friends flaking on me/ignoring me or complaining about work) and that it's abusive. I feel like shit because of this. I feel like a bad partner. We had gotten into a few fights over this exact thing several months back in which they asked me to stop, and for a long time I did. I rarely if ever brought up how I was feeling and it kinda drove me into a much deeper depression. Recently(about a month ago) we were having a conversation about it and they apologized for asking that of me and said I should be able to talk about how I'm feeling and receive support. So I thought itd be okay to start talking about my feelings again. The last couple months have been really hard and it was nice to not feel like I was facing it totally alone. But now obviously I have to go back to not talking about it. I don't know where the healthy middle is. I don't know if there is a healthy middle, should I just not be speaking about it?

It seems ridiculous to really say the relationship is possible. I see no reason why something like this may be a thing, if the relationship is in fact there it could be an idea to be really slow or potentially almost nonexistant throughout the process. I like the idea personally because it allows for the relationship to really make connections I hadn't had the opportunity to make before. If the relationship continues then it may be possible for a relationship to be there, like this it appears there are parts causing the relationship to be very slow though.

I persuaded her to leave her job to come join me in California where I reside so we could be together instead of leaving her there and doing the long distance thing. She finally agreed then we flew back to Cali together and happy.
Things was going on smoothly for months , we had lots and loads of good times together and to be sincere I've never had such times in my life cos I'm always working and all that . She made me feel alive for real until one night I walked up to her in the room and I overheard her talking in the phone arguing with someone saying ""I'll be back soon .I just need to finish up things here"" I was surprised at first and wanted to go ask her what she was up to instantly but I refrained and kept calm ......
Long story short. She was whiling away time with me while scheming me for money to prepare for her wedding with another man....

There's this girl(F20) I(M20) asked out 3 months ago. It was a spur of the moment decision, we didn't know each other beforehand, but it went well and we decided to keep seeing each other. She's very sweet and kinda quiet, but I make sure not to hog the conversation and she opens up a bit more.

The thing is, she takes a while to respond to my texts - a few days usually. We're both 1st-year university students doing different degrees, so we don't often get time to see each other. I'm always willing to make time, but she usually says she's busy / responds after the plans I wanted to make could have happened. I understand life can be busy, but we've actually only been on like 4 dates and met up on campus like 3 or 4 other times. In 3 months. Yeah.

Added to how she takes a while to respond, we don't have much texting connection either. We'll let each other know how we're doing at least once a week, and wish each other good luck for whatever we're busy with, but it doesn't get much more than that.

I don't mind too much to take things slowly, but this is too slow even for me. I feel like I'm being ghosted, and now that we're finally on our Summer break (we're in the Southern Hemisphere) we haven't made any plans yet. And not for my lack of trying.

Please bear with me as I give the entire friendship history.


I am an introvert and have a few friends. From high school to college I’ve always had a big group of friends but due to gossip and misunderstandings (from both sides), the groups would break and I’ve been close to one friend from each group. And now I’m used to having just one or two friends when we meet or hang out. My friends are on the soft spoken side and are very mature and we have deep and meaningful conversations, sometimes we talk silly stuff too. They are also not heavy drinkers nor do they smoke which is what I am comfortable with. I meet my friends maybe a maximum of 3-4 times a year, I prefer staying at home and spending quality time with myself. 

My husband on the other hand is an ambivert and he gets along with all my friends too. He prefers going out and he’s fine with a big group of friends or even individual meet ups. He has friends ranging from soft spoken to super loud. I get along very well with his soft spoken friends but he meets them rarely. He meets this one group of loud friends regularly and obviously expects me to come along with him. They are also heavy drinkers and smokers and they drink every-time we meet, there hasn’t been one sober meet up in all these years. And they gossip about everyone they know and even about each other (when the other is not present). My husband himself told me never to share any secrets with them. They are also immature and laugh about the dumbest things and they also body shame(passers-by). When I do contribute in their group conversations I have been interrupted and I just stay quiet while the others talk. 
But they do treat me well and are nice to me and always ask about me if I don’t meet them. 

While we were dating, it was difficult to meet my now husband as I’m Asian and it’s difficult to lie to my parents (yes I used to live with them). I could only meet him during the day and some nights on rare occasions. His friends always went out during the night so I rarely hung out with them. And whenever I post photos with them, I would get a lot of questions (from close and distant friends) about them as they (the girls) are super hot. And my husband had sent me some pictures with them which I didn’t like because they seemed inappropriate and clingy, (like they were falling on him and falling on top of each other on the floor - apparently some tickle fight?) So you could say that made me insecure. My husband brushed it off as a friendly fight and also apparently sees them as sisters so I didn’t make a fuss about it. During the early dating years, there have been instances where he cancelled plans with me because he was hungover after a night with them. But after a few fights he stopped doing that. Initially he was also a bit like them in terms of drinking and maturity but after we got married I could see a significant change in him with his friends, he just listens to them and drinks moderately and also tries to squeeze in non-gossip topics to talk about. He just wants to laugh and have a good time.

He hangs out with them every other weekend and it’s usually till 3 or 4 AM and ever since we got married I have been falling sick a lot so I don’t go out to meet them but when I do go, I don’t enjoy it and I’m also a morning person so I fall asleep by 11 and would want to go home but would stay up for them and my hubs. But frankly I would rather stay at home or meet my own friends. My husband is fine if I don’t go with him as long as I don’t make it a habit. And most of the times when he has gone out with them, I’ve been sick and I would make a fuss and ask him to come home early like around 11 and he would say he can’t and I’d get upset so he would get upset but then come home anyway. We’ve had fights about me doing this on purpose and I denied it saying that I needed him with me as I was sick (I usually have a bad cold, cough and fever or severe period cramps and didn’t want to be alone)

Today he told me he is meeting them again and I got upset for no reason (didn’t tell him this). I realised that I have been throwing tantrums every time he went to meet his friends and now I don’t know what to do. They mean a lot to him so I want to make some effort to get to know them and hang out with them but I don’t know if I can. I don’t want to get upset every time he goes to meet them.

TLDR: My husbands friends are not my type of friends and I also feel insecure as I’m not as hot or as pretty as them (and I’ve also gained a little weight ) and I know they talk about us when we are not there. But they mean a lot to my husband so I want to change how I feel about them. I don’t want to get upset if he meets them. Any advice is appreciated.

Due to his excitement I trusted him to be a great father and get his act together, which he promised.

For the first 6 months he was diligent, committed and involved, but it all went out the window pretty quickly, he was back to drinking heavily, spending most of his time with his sister (which is a whole other can of worms), and just not being a very responsible father. Now we are very fortunate and are able to have 24/7 help, a nanny, housekeeper, we had a wet nurse at beginning. So it’s not about work load as all of the hard work is done for us, but I like to make a point of spending as much time as possible with my daughter because though we have help I don’t want her to feel like she was raised by strangers. 

Now some context about my husband, my husband had confessed to me a couple of weeks before our wedding he had been diagnosed with ASPD (anti-social personality disorder) and the reasons he can be impulsive and reckless is because of his disorder. After doing lots of research I realize there is a lot of stigma around the disorder but I trusted and love my husband so I accepted his diagnosis and have come to terms with it…But after our first child I realize he may not be fit to be a father because he still acts like a child himself sometimes. I don’t know if this has anything to do with his diagnosis or it’s simply in his personality. I’ve asked him many times to spend more time with our daughter, but he insists she doesn’t need it and he was raised by “the help” and she’ll be fine, but he should know better than ever that’s not the case because he has sexual trauma from his nanny (which he insists isn’t trauma) I’m not saying i’m afraid of that with our lovely staff but he should know better that it’s important to have communication and closeness with their children. ANYWAY sorry for ranting.

I just found out I’m pregnant again I haven’t told anyone, me and my dr. are the only ones on earth that know. I know if I tell my husband he will insist I keep the baby again, because he’s expressed he wants more than 1 child, I’ve pretended to be enthusiastic about the idea but I have not been. At least not until he gets his act together. I love being a mother and would love to have another beautiful baby but it wouldn’t be fair of me to bring another child into this uncertain situation…I don’t know what to do.

Tldr; my husband has aspd he won’t spend time with our daughter and barely acts like she exists, Im pregnant again and even though I want to keep the baby because I love motherhood, I also don’t think my husband is fit to be a father, I’m afraid to tell him because I know he’ll insist I keep it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7579337,public,self,(23f) I’m pregnant again but I don’t want to keep the baby because my husband (27m) is a terrible father.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyf86g/23f_im_pregnant_again_but_i_dont_want_to_keep_the/,all_ads,6,,,

About 5 years ago, during a rather tumultuous year in my life (man who raised me died and I was pursuing a career switch) I dated a guy for about a month. It was casual but he wasn’t in a good space at the time and I wasn’t up for putting up with mistreatment so I ended it. Since then this person has profusely apologized for the way they treated me and we stayed Facebook friends. I move on, get married, move several states away, and continue my life. 

Covid time hits and said person expresses that they’d like to see me since they now travel to my state for work. I’m single again but not interested in dating so I put them off. Cue 2 YEARS (I am not exaggerating) of them consistently reaching out to say hello, asking about me and family, and asking to take me to dinner. 

Eventually I’m headed back to the city where we met for a vacation to see friends and attend an event. They ask if I can make time for them and I tell them I’ll let them know. We ended up missing each other. He then decides the week after to take a day long train ride to come to my state and invites me to dinner. Pays for everything and brings me a gift that demonstrates that he’s paid attention and knows my interests. 

We hang out for the evening and have great conversation (my first date in years) but I also realize we have some fundamental differences about certain topics. We’re both minorities and he has some general resentment about societies treatment of minorities and culturally he was raised to reject homosexuality whereas several important people in my life are gay and I long ago decided that I’m not letting anger at the world kill my joy. 

Aside from those two things I had a good time and it seems like we’re both on the same page about seeing each other whenever we’re in the same area. 

I let him know last week I’ll be in his city in a few months. Today he messages me and says he’d like to see me before then and that he wants us to be more than rendezvous, that he wants us to build something. 

I’m not sure what to do. I don’t have the best record of picking partners and I spent years not dating and working on me to get to a happy and healthy mental place. I’ve started a business that has sustained me for the last 2 years and allows me to work from anywhere.

I’ve been friends with Will for about 5 years. We’ve gotten each other through some extremely dark times and are pretty close. We live an hour apart, but we text fairly often. 

Will usually reacts or responds to things I send him. Even though a lot of our communication is just sending memes back and forth like anyone else, he’ll usually respond or at least react to the message. 

Here’s the kicker: whenever I vent or even just talk about what I’m struggling with, no matter how insignificant, Will leaves me on read about 8 out of 10 times. The 2 times he does say anything, he gives me very heartfelt and caring responses, and we’ll end up talking a lot more than usual for a week or so following a heartfelt convo. It’s almost like a honeymoon period in our friendship. The last time I vented about something big, this exact scenario happened. It felt great for the time being. 


The other 8 times, he ignores me completely and goes silent for a while, or completely disregards what I say and sends a completely unrelated meme or changes the topic entirely. It doesn’t matter how small my issue is. It could be me letting off steam from a bad day. He’ll ignore it. 

If you asked Will if he cared about me, or if I mattered to him, he’d tell you yes. I don’t think it would be a lie; I get the feeling he does genuinely think he cares for me. I think he thinks that the 2 times he does listen, and the period of closeness that follows, are significant to him. But is it worth it to continue a friendship with someone who ignores me almost every time I open up about my struggles??

the guy texted me asking to hang out. i asked my boyfriend what he thought and he said i should go for it and he trusts my judgement, so i agreed to hang out. 

when we were hanging out this guy kind of made it obvious that he was into me so i told him i had a boyfriend. after i said that he sort of didn’t want to be around me anymore and i didn’t really either so i left. when i got home i told my boyfriend i had a pretty uncomfortable night and explained that the guy was clearly only hanging out with me because he was interested in me.

So for context Im 18 (male) and I work with these 2 girls. We’re all part time high schoolers In a retail job. One of the girls I’ve became friends with and she already has a boyfriend. I trust her and she trusts me as I’ve vented to her about someone I don’t like and she’s done the same with me. We mutually decided to not be scumbags and keep these secrets to ourselves and that led to us becoming friends and trusting each other. I’m single and there’s a girl at my work I’ve slowly gained a crush on. Ever since she’s started I’ve felt like she’s kinda had a thing for me. She ALWAYS stared at me and wouldn’t look away when She first started, and to my knowledge she didn’t do this with anyone else. She stopped doing that but me and her have talked a lot more and we actually know each other a bit now. Today we worked together and I just really enjoyed talking to her a lot

She’s funny and I could make her laugh easily and she was kinda coming to me for advice. One time I glanced over at her and didn’t realize how pretty she was till that moment, and ever since I saw how pretty she truly was i liked her even more. She’s adorable and so gorgeous, she even called me an angel!!
 
I’m getting way off topic tho. My friend (the one I don’t have a crush on) actually goes to school with the one I like. I know I can trust her, so should I just tell her I like this girl and see if she can help me? I have no problem asking her out but since it’s at work I don’t wanna cause unnecessary embarrassment.

I didn't know anyone in this new area, and accepted a contract for 2 years, so I was very interested in making friends during this time.

Almost immediately, I formed a very close friendship with this girl we'll call Sarah. The friendship was completely platonic, and we formed a good friendship circle as well. Both being new to the area, we basically did everything together. It's a small town that we live in, so there isn't much to do anyways, but once the weekend rolled around it was very common for either of us to not be doing much on the weekend and spend time with each other. If there were any events on, we'd normally go together, usually with other friends too.

After a few months, she started to be attracted to me. This was not something I was reciprocating, and I was unkeen to have sex as I was concerned this would hurt our friendship. She persisted and eventually we did have sex.

We decided not to date (we both agreed) but have a friends with benefits relationship. In hindsight this wasn't something I was ready for, as when she started seeing this other guy we'll call Jerry, I became pretty jealous.

Eventually it became obvious that her and Jerry were becoming somewhat serious, and we ended our friends with benefits relationship.

However, now that Sarah is dating Jerry, she does not seem interested in being friends with me anymore. Sometimes she seems very close to me for example, when we saw each other at a mutual friend's party about 4 weeks ago she sat next to me and held my hand. One person even commented that it seemed like we were flirting when we were talking to each other.

However other times she ignores me or doesn't seem interested in example, the week after that party I messaged her asking what she was doing on the long weekend that we both had, and she basically blew me off completely which is very strange for her. I got quite upset because I felt she was being rude to me, and we haven't spoken since.

I realize that her relationship is more important to her now, but I would be devastated if we couldn't remain friends. She has said similar things too in the past (we both commented that if we couldn't be friends we would consider leaving this town. We have also said that we loved each other numerous times.)

Right now, we haven't spoken or seen each other in about 3 weeks. We have activities/friends in common, but it seems like she is avoiding those events.

There are pros and cons of either decision. Grandma has money but I still pay her rent ($300/month) and I buy my own groceries, do my own laundry, etc. I bring home $3,100 a month take home. Car is paid off, but will need replacement in a few years. My current budget after auto insurance, food, iPhone, gas, life insurance, gym membership, etc leaves me with $1,850 a month. The area I want to move to has an average 1 bedroom rent of $1,100. Utilities/internet would cost $320 a month. It still leaves play money, it even leaves room for a used car payment. If I was to move I would likewise promote and take home an additional $320 a month. 
Tell me what you would do in my shoes? I have thought about waiting until next summer to move and leaving grandma a nice check for $5k as a “here, this will help with hiring snow shovelers and lawn mowers.” I love grandma but I need change in my opinion. I’ll be honest though. Getting to sock away $1k-$2k a month is nice. What is the point of socking away all this money though if I don’t get my own place?

We are long distance now. Because we both have things in our hometowns we have to take care of. We were planning on moving In together in a couple months. I am seriously struggling. I don’t know what to make of it. I have been through a lot of abuse In my life. And she has too. But I have a history of abusive narcissistic relationships. And this one is starting to seem more and more text book. I just need clarity to see if what I’m going through is narcissistic abuse.  She is older than me. By 15 years. She had a history (from her own admission) of being a womanizer. But told me when we first met that she changed. And I was the only woman to ever “sit her down” that this is the only relationship she’s never been unfaithful in. Or disrespectful in. That if it weren’t for me she would be out there doing the “old her”. So we are long distance we sleep on the phone together. She has been recording me in my sleep. Snoring. Sleep apnea. She’s been accusing me telling me she hears a man or woman in my home having intercourse all while she’s on speaker on the phone with me all night. She had played these recordings for me. And yes some of them sound weird. I can hear other voices. But idk if she’s tampering with the recordings or our phones are picking up other noises. Because I haven’t ever flirted with anyone but less cheated. I live with my mom and grandparents in their home. I never leave now, or I cancel plans with my family. I have no friends. I stay at home. In fear of upsetting her and getting accused. I talk to her all day and she swears I’m putting her on mute. In cars with people. Etc. I try to explain I am not. I get called names. She’s also broken multiple serious promises to me. The trust and respect is gone now. I thought she could never treat me this way or say these things to me and she has now. And neither the both of us have any proof of the other one cheating but now there are trust issues. She had a family tragedy years ago and the month of November if hard for us both. And significant. She is using the month being the reason why she treats me this way. “I know your not like that I know your not cheating, I’m so sorry your not all those bad names I called you. All I do is hurt you but you talk to me like I don’t mean anything and it provoked me” type of apologies. I have a feeling she’s cheating. But I have no proof other than her changes. But an intense gut feelings. She will break up with me tell me I’ve broken her heart by cheating and then say awful things to me and then call me apologize and I’m just suppose to get over it. If I stay upset. I don’t love her or care about her. When I bring up issues that hurt me. She says “well you’ve done this and that too” she won’t take responsibility. She will gaslight me. If I ignore her. After she’s treated me badly. She accuses me of cheating and she will send me things to get my attention like her doing things we agreed we wouldn’t do anymore. There’s more to everything but I be been doing a lot of research on manipulating tactics. Relationships. Emotionally and mentally Abusive partners. And covert narcissists. She had a lot of these signs and qualities. Makes me feel bad about everything. Guilt trip me. Truth every argument around in me. Or have me feeling guilty and questioning my own perception memories etc. she’s recorded me so much I started to think I was sleep walking. I am depressed. Walking on egg shells. I barely eat because I am in a constant state of panic and on edge all the time. I have swollen my feelings and hurt just to avoid arguments. She will laugh and say “you like that don’t you cheating on me” call me names in these recordings.  “Your over there getting it. Yea your taking something someone’s giving it to you” she does all of this and she’s knows my history of sexual assault and abuse. I suffer from severe it’s. Panic disorder and depression. She knows I have regular flash backs and episodes. She acts like she cares in the moment. But even when I’m having night terrors she says it’s me moaning. And will start arguments and fights over everything. I don’t know what to do anymore. We will talk she will apologize I will forgive her well have deep conversation about changing things doing better being better for each other and then she will do it again. Call me names accuse me tell me I broke her heart that she’s never been this good and faithful to a girl in her entire life. She will hang up on me ignore me as long as she wants and then will turn it all on me. And then apologize. I’m lost and struggling I have no idea what to do. I have started to ignore her during these outburst and sometimes it makes things worse sometimes it gives her time to think and then she will apologize. She also has been saying she hope she dies because she can’t live without me and I broke her heart by cheating and I’ve never cheated. She says no one will ever love me like she’s does and she wishes she never fell in love with me. She makes it seem like I’ve hurt her or abused her and I’ve never done anything. I’m sick to my stomach constantly. I’m struggling so bad with this right now. Any advice any help would be greatly appreciated.

Prior to that we had sex once in the last 3 months. The 3 months without sex were due to her having a lot of stress so I understood and said nothing, but now it's over and she doesn't seem to want to have sex either.

Also there's some weird things going on. During that time she's been ""pooping"" a lot. And by ""pooping"" i mean going to the toilet and when she comes back she says, I thought I'm gonna poop but didn't. This sometimes happens like 7 or even more times a day (didn't really count, but seems like too much).
She also kind of hides her phone from me. Tells me I can see whatever I want on her phone, but when I tried to take it so that I can look into it at her presence she told me no, because I might found out what gift she had bought me for my bday. 

Also, another weird thing is, that whenever I go to toilet she asks me what I'm doing on my phone. I reply that I'm looking at memes or reading news or something else. But most of the times there's a follow up every few minutes if I'm still doing the same thing. Which is weird, kinda feels like projection ( i don't know much about this, it's more of a guess).

Am I reading too much into this? I feel like she's hiding something, but I'm emotionally invested into this, so its hard for me to look at it unbiased. Would you mind helping a fellow redditor out?

We’re working on moving out together soon, I have a 6-year old that he’s very involved with, both heavily involved and invested in each other’s families, etc. I’m happy (up until this point) to say that we have always been very respectful to one another and we have never had any trust issues. 

Here’s the backstory of what happened: I was MOH in my sister’s wedding a week ago. It was a really stressful day for me as the bride’s right hand man (running around trying to help coordinate the bridal party, photographers, reception, etc.) 

So when my family had an afterparty at a nearby bar, I really wanted to let loose since my MOH duties were finally over after a year and big day of stress. My BF (who was also my wedding date) isn’t a big social guy but agreed to come with me to the bar to be my DD. I ended up getting pretty wasted, to the point of almost blacking out. When I say “almost” I mean I can retain most of my memories from the bar but they are pretty fuzzy. I typically don’t get this wasted, but I felt safe to do so since all of my family AND my BF were there with me. 

Towards the end of the night my BF decided to go grab the car since we parked a bit far from the bar. The bar was closing and everyone was herded to the front outside patio area. From what my BF tells me, as he pulled up the car to the front he saw me with a guy he didn’t recognize, and according to him — I was way too close for comfort, flirting, and he said it looked like we were about to kiss but he pulled me into the car. 

Like I said, I was pretty wasted. I have bits and pieces of this memory: the bar closing, going outside, waiting in the front with my sister and cousins, mingling etc.  I have NO recollection of this strange dude or any of the things he saw. I remember being pulled into the car, and him immediately yelling at me and accusing me of cheating on him. Essentially he dumped me that night and took me home and left to his own place. 

I just want to say I am in no way claiming innocence or denying what he saw actually happened.  Unfortunately I was beyond wasted and I can’t trust my own memory of the incident.  My sister and cousins claim they didn’t see this happen but he’s never accused me of anything before so I am taking his full word for it.  Regardless of whether I did anything or not, I hurt him. I hurt him and crossed a line and I want to take accountability for that. 

Fast forward to a week later: We are now trying to work through this but he has asked for space to decide if this is something he can live with or not. I have apologized profusely and I want to take a serious self look at my drinking habits. I feel terrible. I would never want to hurt him in any way and I feel like I really messed up. 

He has maintained daily contact with me even though I have offered to give him complete space.  He still chooses to text and call me to check in and have normal day-to-day small talk but sounds so distant and cold each time I speak to him.  He says he still doesn’t know if he can continue our relationship after this. I honestly feel like I’m just a sitting duck until he decides he wants to leave.  

I feel like I should give him this time to mull over his feelings but I also feel like it’s not really fair to be kept at arm’s length at all times walking on eggshells when I willingly offered to give him complete space and he still chooses to talk to me.  

I don’t know what more I can do other than show him with my actions moving forward. I don’t know how long I should wait around for him to decide if our relationship is worth it or not. Another week? A month? Two months? How long until it becomes unfair for him to act so cold and distant? I don’t expect anything to go back to the way it was but I feel at the very least like I deserve to know if he wants to continue our relationship or not, without disregarding the pain I’ve caused him. 

TLDR; I got too drunk after my sister’s wedding and my boyfriend says I cheated on him (kissed someone).  He says he wants space but continues to contact me even though he said he’s not sure he still wants to be with me or not.

I'm (21f), husband (23m), grandparents (74m) and (71f)

1. Being uninvited from Thanksgiving is an extremely big deal in my family. I hold all holidays at my house because I have a large enough kitchen to cook for everyone. It is tradition to have anything major at my home. We are an extremely close family and this is the first time I've ever told someone they cannot come. 

2. Blitz was in a foster care system for two years before my grandparents adopted him. Before that he was in a very abusive household. Even with being on a very high anxiety medication he is still extremely aggressive. In foster care it was reported he attacked two different workers and one small child. All attacks were unprovoked.

3. Since we all were told that information we told my grandparents if anyone comes over we do not want the dog out and roaming. We asked for the dog to be placed in their bedroom until we leave. This was a reasonable request at the time for my grandparents. 

So to what happened. I was visiting my grandparents to discuss what they could bring for Thanksgiving. When i first got there everything was fine. After an hour of talking I stood up to get my jacket from the dining room so I could leave. 

My grandfather decided that he wanted to do a ""test run"" without my knowledge or permission to see if blitz liked me. Blitz is a very large rottweiler Springer spaniel mix. The moment I turned around to grab my jacket I felt horrible pain in my ankle. 

I yelled and realized it was blitz biting me. I yelled at him twice ""stop it your hurting me! Ouch!"" Because if I say ouch to my dogs they will stop and let go. This only caused him to bite down harder so in a panic I punched him in the nose. He let go and ran back into the kitchen.

He left six puncture wounds in my ankle and leg. I fell on the ground because my foot hurt so bad and blitz came back AGAIN and attacked my knee this time. Luckily my grandfather came and grabbed him off of me and locked him back up. He only left a large bruise on my knee thank God. 

My grandmother rushed me to the ER because my leg wouldn't stop bleeding. At the time we thought the dog somehow got out on its own but the moment I found out what actually happened I kicked my grandfather out of the ER room. My grandmother was crying and apologizing left and right but I was just extremely upset. 

After I was treated I called my husband and told him what happened and he immediately came to the hospital to pick me up. He got into a screaming match on the phone with my grandfather about how dangerous and stupid that was. After we got home my husband called all my family and his and told them what happened. 

The entire family blew up on my grandfather like a bomb and everyone told me i shouldn't let him come to Thanksgiving. I agreed what he did was extremely reckless and I could've got way more injured. It's really destroying my grandparents right now. Especially because the dog was taken from them and might be put to sleep. 

I feel guilty about telling them they can't come but I also don't want him around after what happened.

So for context Im 18 (male) and I work with these 2 girls. We’re all part time high schoolers In a retail job. One of the girls I’ve became friends with and she already has a boyfriend. I trust her and she trusts me as I’ve vented to her about someone I don’t like and she’s done the same with me. We mutually decided to not be scumbags and keep these secrets to ourselves and that led to us becoming friends and trusting each other. I’m single and there’s a girl at my work I’ve slowly gained a crush on. Ever since she’s started I’ve felt like she’s kinda had a thing for me. She ALWAYS stared at me and wouldn’t look away when She first started, and to my knowledge she didn’t do this with anyone else. She stopped doing that but me and her have talked a lot more and we actually know each other a bit now. Today we worked together and I just really enjoyed talking to her a lot

She’s funny and I could make her laugh easily and she was kinda coming to me for advice. One time I glanced over at her and didn’t realize how pretty she was till that moment, and ever since I saw how pretty she truly was i liked her even more. She’s adorable and so gorgeous, she even called me an angel!!
 
I’m getting way off topic tho. My friend (the one I don’t have a crush on) actually goes to school with the one I like. I know I can trust her, so should I just tell her I like this girl and see if she can help me? I have no problem asking her out but since it’s at work I don’t wanna cause unnecessary embarrassment.

I dated my ex for 2 years , she had money $300 and gave it to me in the context of safe keeping because I was more financially responsible and she didn’t even have a bank account, to which I declined at first , 
but after much persuasionI took it.

She began to use the money bit by bit despite my suggestions that she should save , we’d go out to eat , she’d buy me stuff and other leisurely activities. 

Seeing that she was willing to do away with the cash I asked her for a favor to lend me the remaining $180 dollars and she agreed . It was neither by force nor by intimidation, but very casual and friendly with no formal agreement.

December 2019 , It was now time for her to leave the country going to the USA and she never even mentioned the money.
We continued a long distance relationship which came to an end last year 2021 in July.

She later contacted me in March 2022 and apologized for what she did to ruin the relationship , to which I forgave her and got back with her , while she is still in the USA. (Long distance) She didn’t mention the money.

After about a week of talking , exactly on the 6th of April 2022 I realized she had not changed and I decided to end the relationship again . She still didn’t mention the money.

About 6 months passed and I get a call from her friend saying she wants her money back from 2019. To which I asked her friend , “does she not have a job , because she just graduated” and the friend says no . 

Now she’s been going around telling people I owe her $300 and yet I only borrowed $180 and the rest was used by the both of us. 

They I say why didn’t you mention the money this whole time , And then she tells me “I thought you’d be an adult and do the right thing “ as though to taunt me. 

And let me just say I’m far from broke and I can pay her back but I feel I’m being disrespected for her to go telling people I took money from her makes me look bad, she gave me that money wholeheartedly because she trusted me. I did not steal , and I honestly think $300 shouldn’t be a reason to come back.

So for context Im 18 (male) and I work with these 2 girls. We’re all part time high schoolers In a retail job. One of the girls I’ve became friends with and she already has a boyfriend. I trust her and she trusts me as I’ve vented to her about someone I don’t like and she’s done the same with me. We mutually decided to not be scumbags and keep these secrets to ourselves and that led to us becoming friends and trusting each other. I’m single and there’s a girl at my work I’ve slowly gained a crush on. Ever since she’s started I’ve felt like she’s kinda had a thing for me. She ALWAYS stared at me and wouldn’t look away when She first started, and to my knowledge she didn’t do this with anyone else. She stopped doing that but me and her have talked a lot more and we actually know each other a bit now. Today we worked together and I just really enjoyed talking to her a lot

She’s funny and I could make her laugh easily and she was kinda coming to me for advice. One time I glanced over at her and didn’t realize how pretty she was till that moment, and ever since I saw how pretty she truly was i liked her even more. She’s adorable and so gorgeous, she even called me an angel!!
 
I’m getting way off topic tho. My friend (the one I don’t have a crush on) actually goes to school with the one I like.

I was with my previous husband for 10 years before he passed away from terminal cancer. We had a child together, who was 4 when he died. 

I am going to explain the latest “issue” because it is the most recent example. 

My son is now 8. He is currently learning how to ride a bike. The first time I took him out was a bit emotional for me. I was frustrated with not knowing how to teach him and I was also sad because I was thinking about how it’s something he should have gotten to do with his dad. I had tears in my eyes and stopped for about ten minutes to collect myself. 

While I was sitting down, I watched a YouTube video about teaching kids to ride a bike and it said to take the pedals off so they can learn to balance first. During that time, my husband tried to help my son but he fell and got upset. So my son and I headed back to the house to take the pedals off of his bike while my husband continued on with his daughter. (I told him we were doing this.) 

Later that night, my husband asked me why I was upset. I was honest with him and told him why. He told me that I need to talk to my counselor about it because having “debilitating grief” isn’t normal. He says it was debilitating because I had to sit down and then I had to leave. I reminded him that I left to take the pedals off not because I was too sad to function, but that didn’t matter. 

I got annoyed because I am sad for like 20 minutes maybe once every couple of months. And every time I am sad, he tells me that it’s not normal and that I need to talk to a counselor. He’s made it abundantly clear that “he can’t be my counselor” so I don’t even talk to him about my grief or tell him if I’m sad about something. 

And the icing on the cake is that he goes into his “dating a widower” groups on Facebook and Reddit and complains about how I refuse to go to a counselor and that I expect him to be my counselor and that I’m having “debilitating grief” but that I don’t think it’s a problem and that he doesn’t know what he’s gotten himself into. (I am in therapy and have been for about a year and so is my son.)

I took some medications a couple years ago that made me clumsy and gave me injuries while working at Doordash and lived in a very toxic environment which was so bad due to COVID lock down. I began to get chronic pain from the injuries and stress. I only talked to one guy friend because I was so paranoid of Covid and had no motivation to talk to anyone after the chronic pain. He sort of emotionally abused me though and told me I couldn't be independent because I was too weak to move out so I was too scared to move out and find a job (to be fair I was REALLY weak from the medications but I didn't even realize it at the time). He also was super clingy and kept guilt tripping me whenever I tried to cut him off. It messed with my confidence and I was in such a shitty environment at home that I didn't know wtf to do. We were basically acting like a couple hooking up and it was so bad of me to stay I know, but I was so weak from the bad environment, COVID, and the medication side effects.

The pain was so bad it crippled me, and I took more drugs and they left me disabled for a few months. I only got better recently a couple weeks ago. 

I'm applying to jobs now but I don't really have any friends. Like I have people I catch up to time-to-time but I didn't put in any energy to have any other close friends.

I feel. like I'm just stuck with the person who emotionally abused me in the past because I'm so lonely. It's a bad cycle but he doesn't emotionally abuse me anymore after I recommended him to a therapist. However, he's just a bad influence on me because hes 29 and lives with his parents and doesn't have any ambition or goals in his life. I kept trying to cut him off before and I should've earlier, but I just kept getting injured from the medications I took. They made me weak. 

He is supportive now and we don't hook up or do anything sexual anymore. But we would cuddle and hug and stuff so I just told him I didn't want to see him in person anymore because I would regularly resent him and get mad at him for it.  


I don't know what to do anymore. I feel stuck and trapped. I tried to make a friend for the first time and we hung out one time and then  she flaked on me last minute and never got back to me again. It's hard after college and I'm sad :( I keep wondering if I did something wrong, but I really don't think I did. However, it messes with my confidence even more

I haven't seen him in person for almost two weeks but I get lonelier and lonelier and find myself just messaging and calling him. 

Do I just keep talking to him and forgive him? Or just let myself be alone. I still live with my toxic family and it sucks but it's gotten a little better. 

I know it's my fault for staying stagnant in that friendship and not socializing and trying hard enough to move out and find a corporate job. However I don't think that the medications side effects and the shitty environment I was in were my fault... My parents are very narcissistic and would abuse me/neglect me since I was a child and my brother has schizophrenia due to their abuse/genetics 

I feel stuck I guess and really sad :( I'm seeing a therapist and it's kind of helping but she advised me to just be okay with being alone. I guess I just don't feel comfortable being alone.

My bf (24m) and I (22f) have been dating for over a year now and we have a great relationship. Small detail but in 2020, we dated for a few months but got back together after a year apart. Anyways, back to the situation.

Yesterday evening, we checked in via text after work and my bf told me he was grabbing a drink with a friend. I met this girl previously when we first dated, however, he told me a few months back that they had hooked up once in that year we were separated. After some consideration, I said that I wasn't sure how I felt about this. He asked if I wanted him to cancel and I said no. We agreed to chat again later. After calling a friend to help me figure things out, I saw that he had texted me explaining that the reason he met up with this friend is because he had commissioned her to make me a Christmas present [I'm not sure what he asked for, but I know she makes jewelry with polyclay]. To me, this was categorically, and overwhelmingly worse lol. 

When we got back home, we called and he explained saying that he had commissioned her for the present [he never said what it was] on Monday and she told him she'd actually be in town this week, so he suggested they meet up. He told me he never thought I'd have a problem with this as I'd never expressed feelings like this before. We talked for an hour or so and he apologized but I said I needed some time and space. 

I have several issues with this whole situation:

-he met up with someone one on one for drinks who he's had sex with without checking if that makes me uncomfortable 
-he initiated this meeting and knew about it days in advance yet didn't mention it to me until last minute 
-he asked this person to make me a present, when he realistically could have thought of something else or used etsy, and didn't consider that receiving a present from him made by someone he's fucked  it will only ever remind me of that
-though historically I've never been a jealous person, I HAD in fact told him about similar feelings a month ago during a Halloween party where a different girl he's slept with was present. He told me he had forgotten about this conversation. 
-at the beginning of our relationship, there was some overlap between him and another person I was seeing which really hurt him. Moving forward, he told me the worst thing he could imagine me doing is meeting up for drinks with this guy one on one. 

After our call yesterday, I haven't been able to calm the rage and jealousy. I genuinely am considering breaking up with him because I cannot imagine a single thing he can say or do to make this better. Looking for resources online, jealousy is always treated as something unfounded, but I feel like my feelings are completely legitimate and justifiable here so idk what to do. 

What can I do to overcome this rage to at least have another conversation? Any help, advice or insight?

We met shortly after the end of a relationship of mine and quickly, but accidentally became pregnant with my daughter, who is now 1. 

He was horrible through my pregnancy, causing stress about where furniture and clothing would come from despite our steady income and starting fights with me over nothing. 

I gave birth. It was a lonely experience. He slept through everything but the 30 minutes I took at the end to push her out. He had a guilty look on his face, but purposefully waved off my needs for the other 13 hours while he slept. A nurse pushed for me to cut her umbilical cord (which I did) when he refused. 

When she was born, he physucally took my phone to keep me from talking to my mom. She wasn't able to be there because of covid and the last thing I told her was that u bled a lot. She was terrified and I couldn't respond. He refused to let mom come by when we got home. (These were things I wanted and demanded) 

After that, he wouldn't watch our daughter. Even for just 20 minutes, to let me shower for 10 months after the fact. I wasn't able to shower for five days after I had my baby. I felt repulsive.

From when she was born, to now, he has NEVER fed her, napped her, taken her out to play, had her own his own for more than an hour, etc. 

Since I was pregnant, until now, he has been extremely controlling to the point of abuse. He convinced me to be a stay at home mom, then turns around and gives me only enough money to pay bills most of the time. He thinks that everyone I interact with, is someone I'm potentially cheating on him with. Sometimes I can't even convince him to give me enough money to pay the bills (all of which are in only my name) when I know he has enough to give me and we live together. 

I've been trying since June to get a job to leave him. What can I do to keep him from my daughter? He has little involvement in her day to day life and has no care to. The most he does is hold her for a couple of minutes and kiss her. If I need a shower, he is so controlling that he doesn't trust her to play by herself so he keeps her in her high chair the entire time. He's told me as such. 

I dont trust him to have my baby for any period of time and I'm terrified that if I go for full custody, they'll let him have her for weekends or something. He let her EAT PAINT while he watched her during one shower of mine. I'm terrified of what he could do in an entire weekend. I'm so scared. 

I'd really appreciate some insight into relationships where this dynamic is present and how you/the court dealt with it. Was safety taken into consideration?

My girlfriend (21) and me (22) has been in a reletionship for a about a year. One and a half years before we started dating she had another boyfriend that broke up with her while she was working on a comitte with some older people. One of the guys was in his mid 30s. The two of them became friends and he tok an interest in her sexual life, talking about how she should find someone to get laid with and stuff like that. 

He then set her up with his 30 year old friend who is a gitarist in a famous band. They slept togheter for about 5 months after the set up. She bragged about this to her friends also. Around 3 months before I met her, he broke it off with her because he found someone he liked. This is not confirmed, but I have a suspicsion she liked him more then he liked her, in another words, she had a crush on him while he did not on her.

Now, after a year into the reletionship she is going on a concert of his with her friends.

So the two questions I am asking is:

1. how should I feel about their reletionship before me?

2. how should I deal with her going to the concert?

I don’t like them, am I a asshole for that?  

I (23m) been dating my girlfriend (22f) for close to one year now, other then my mom, grandmas and sister she’s the only other woman I think I’ve truly loved. I’m able to be myself, be vulnerable and know what it’s like to be honest with someone. I struggle with retro active jealousy, and I’m upfront about it. I don’t like talking about her past partners or experiences, and she doesn’t like talking about mine. Her friends always seem to bring up someone she used to have relations with or things she’s done in the past as a joke or jab at her. That alone hurts my feelings and makes me not like her friends, her friends also bring up the nastiest most fucked stories. For instance, I work nights. We were sitting in bed last night about 15 minutes before I had to leave watching tv, when her friend FaceTimes her and proceeds to ask her if she remembers such and such. She then proceeds to go on about how she cheated on her boyfriend and fucked three different guys in one weekend. Her friend then says your boyfriend (me) probably thinks I’m crazy. I wanted to say “ no you’re just a gross pig” but I didn’t. After she hung up I asked my girlfriend how could she be friends with her. Not only based off of this but also how her friend only gets ahold of her every couple weeks when she needs something. My girlfriend immediately tells that I don’t like any of her friends and never give them a chance. She tells me how I don’t know any of them so how can I not like them. I’ve met all her friends, which is only like 4. One of them I like and I think is genuinely cool. The other 3 constantly bring up people from her past or tell her some crazy story about how many people they’ve hooked up with this month or when they cheated on their boyfriend. I also know everything my girlfriend tells me about them which all seems negative.

I (22f) enjoy playing video games casually. I play with my sister and brother and a friend of ours and we always play very late at night. My bf (20m) and I are long distance, and sometimes he would play video games with me and my siblings. Our relationship is great, we are very happy and I love him a lot. 

He doesn’t play games with me anymore because he works so much and comes home too tired, but always makes time for me if I want or need it. Tonight he came home late per usual and this week has been especially taxing at work so I assumed he would go to bed quickly like he does on these kinds of nights. 

It was after midnight and he usually sleeps by 11 because he starts work at 5, and he was still awake talking to me. Which was great I love spending time with him, but I was looking forward to talking with my siblings and playing some games (we all live in different states now and that’s our time to catch up and talk with each other). We play about 3-4 nights a week. 

Tonight my bf and I were talking about our days and he said he was exhausted and gonna sleep soon but then he got into a spicy mood. We obviously flirt with each other a lot, but tonight he wanted me to be spicy with him and I was trying to balance that and starting a game with my siblings.

Eventually I couldn’t keep up with the spicy that my boyfriend was asking for because I was in game and he decided to call it a night and say tonight didn’t seem good because he wanted to wait for a time when he could have my full attention. 

He never pressures me into anything I don’t want and always assures me that I never have to be spicy if I don’t want to, but I love him and making him happy makes me happy so even if I’m not really in the mood I still enjoy that time with him

Now I feel guilty that he went to bed because I wasn’t giving him my full attention, and I didn’t tell him it was because I was playing a video game. I don’t think he’s upset with me, but maybe a little sad that he tried to set aside this time for us and I wasn’t there fully. He didn’t ask why I was distracted so I think he knows it was because I chose a game over him 

I feel really bad. He works so much and sacrifices a lot to make time for me and I couldn’t tell my siblings no for a night to have spicy time with my bf. We have a good sex life aside from the long distance thing and I send him flirty pictures often.

He has also expressed before, he sent me long paragraphs of his feelings and thoughts before after our first date and said that he tends to get emotionally attached but usually when if he starts falling from them he starts to distance/ghost them which is what he’s kinda been doing recently when we aren’t together. I don’t want to be naive and say it’s been all sunshine and rainbows because it hasn’t but I also don’t feel like I’m completely crazy from having these thoughts that there is something more.

He’s on the autism spectrum so he struggles sometimes with socializing and processing things, but he’s a wonderful person. He and I live by ourselves and he’s told me he doesn’t really have any friends and that I’m the only person in his life who he trusts and cares about.

Today he asked if we could talk and said something happened to him a few nights ago and he felt like he needed to tell someone. He told me that he went out to a bar in the hopes of finding someone to hook up with and finally lose his virginity, and this girl started talking to him who seemed charmed by him and they went back to her place. Then he said they were kissing and doing usual foreplay stuff, but then suddenly she pushed his face onto the bed and got on top of him and began to insert something into him without any sort of warning. He said he completely froze and “let it happen to him” that she finally did stop and after they were done, it sounded like she realized he had shut down and told him he needed to leave. He asked if I noticed him walking a little funny on Sunday or Monday and said it was because of that

I was just kind of sitting down in shock and horror as he told me. He said he was really scared to tell me because he thought I’d be disappointed in him or laugh at him or tell him it’s not a big deal. I repeatedly told him it’s not his fault and that I believed him (those are the only two things I know).

I don’t know what to do now. I want to tell him something helpful or do something helpful but I have no idea how. My baby brother means the world to me and it boils my blood that someone did that to him.

For my other friend, she predicted that they would marry someone rich and have an affair with a young guy. It seemed funny and light hearted so I asked her to do mine too. I did not expect what she would predict to me.

I felt that she got a bit more serious and basically said I will have a “hard time” finding romantic relationships.

And honestly, that triggered my insecurities. I did think it was probably just something lighthearted so I wanted to ask her about it in person.

I clarified with her today about her prediction for me and she said it was “just a feeling”, there’s no explanation for it, and that she can’t predict the future.

I’m really trying to not let it get to me but I think I’m taken aback that someone close to me would say something like this. Worse, that they would think about me like this. It honestly didn’t seem like a joke, regardless, if it was, I would never say this to a close friend.

We’re all part time high schoolers In a retail job. One of the girls I’ve became friends with and she already has a boyfriend. I trust her and she trusts me as I’ve vented to her about someone I don’t like and she’s done the same with me. We mutually decided to not be scumbags and keep these secrets to ourselves and that led to us becoming friends and trusting each other. I’m single and there’s a girl at my work I’ve slowly gained a crush on. Ever since she’s started I’ve felt like she’s kinda had a thing for me. She ALWAYS stared at me and wouldn’t look away when She first started, and to my knowledge she didn’t do this with anyone else. She stopped doing that but me and her have talked a lot more and we actually know each other a bit now. Today we worked together and I just really enjoyed talking to her a lot

She’s funny and I could make her laugh easily and she was kinda coming to me for advice. One time I glanced over at her and didn’t realize how pretty she was till that moment, and ever since I saw how pretty she truly was i liked her even more. She’s adorable and so gorgeous, she even called me an angel!!
 
I’m getting way off topic tho. My friend (the one I don’t have a crush on) actually goes to school with the one I like. I know I can trust her, so should I just tell her I like this girl and see if she can help me? I have no problem asking her out but since it’s at work I don’t wanna cause unnecessary embarrassment.

Now they’re not nudes or even slightly inappropriate. The photos are of girls fully clothed modestly. We are both asians and all the girls photos that he has saved are also of the same ethnicity. However, i have dark curly hair and tan skin. The photos he saved were mostly of light brown/ golden straight hair and light skinned girls. He always tells me i’m the most beautiful girl he has ever laid eyes on but this is making me think i’m not his type or that he has been lying about thinking i’m pretty. 

I talked to him about it and he apologised immediately. He said he’d never do anything like this again and he doesn’t even know why he did this. He claims he almost never even goes back to the saved posts to look at them again, and that they are not for any sexual purposes. 

I don’t know what to feel or think about this whole situation.
