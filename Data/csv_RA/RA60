TLDR: Girl has problem, isn't comfortable with talking to me about it yet. Should I bring it up on our next date?

It's important to note Sam and I are not officially dating, but I still want to make it work and it seems like she does too.

It's been about one and a half months since I started going out on dates with this woman. We'll call her Sam. After the first date she told me she had a great time and wanted to go out again; she invited me out to breakfast the next day as well. 

She told me when we first saw each other that she's a really bad texter, and she comes across as dry. Sometimes there's a quick response, sometimes there's not. She's a busy person which I understand, she goes to work, then the gym after, and immediately goes home to shower and sleep. Typically she'll respond with a couple words, maybe a sentence, so she's not super wordy over text, which I also understand. However, when we're together in person she's totally different. We have good conversations, we laugh, we smile, and we enjoy each other's company. I also called her today and we've got another date planned for this Sunday.

The texting part is a small issue since I'm used to longer conversations over text but that's not the main issue.

Sam has had something going on for the past three weeks or so and I have no idea what the problem is. I've told her I'm here for her if she needs to talk, I ask her if she wants anything, coffee, snacks, company, etc., and I've gently tried to pry and get her to open up. Despite me trying to talk to her about she's told me she isn't super open about her feelings to other people and she doesn't feel comfortable talking it with me *yet.* The last time I brought the problem up was about two weeks ago when I noticed she was acting a bit off. I really want her to open up to me about it but I don't know how far I should go until I'm coming off too pushy. This is something that is obviously bothering her enough to cry so I would imagine it's worth talking about. 

I think due to what she has going on has to do with her not scheduling dates herself and ends up with me having to ask her by texting or calling. She hasn't said no when I've asked yet so it leads me to believe I'm just overthinking like I usually do.

I feel like she isn't putting in the same amount of in because I have to be the one who texts first, I have to be the one to schedule dates, I have to be the one to initiate a conversation. But at the same time she always responds unless she doesn't want to talk about it for whatever reason then I change the subject and it's typically a fairly fast response. 

It's a strange situation I haven't really been in before and therefore I don't know how to go forward with it. I plan on talking to her about all of this, paraphrased and more diplomatic of course, on Sunday. I really want to talk to her and find out what's going on but I don't know if it's the right move.

Like I said I'm probably just overthinking things and need to calm the fuck down and slow down.

Reposting here from another subreddit. Throwaway because talking about money is weird online and also bc some family are probably on reddit too.

So a little backstory on my family in that I have two siblings, along with my mom and my dad. We had a mostly normal upbringing. Some of my siblings feel like our parents were kind of not around when we were kids (which is true) and that feeling has created some distance and tension between some family members.

My dad has typically been one of the voices of reason in my family, mostly because my mom is mentally unwell and has been for a long time. We know she has mental health problems, everyone has been impacted by it and it has caused much harm to everyone really, but typically we have managed OK enough. There have been times where we have wanted to have an intervention as a family, however it has stalled because some think that if she is unwilling to identify the things she does as a problem, then she won't willingly seek out help.

Basically, our mom has this arrested development type of behavior where she acts like she's 18 years old-she does things very impulsively, she does not consider how her actions affect people. She hasn’t really grown mentally or emotionally if that makes sense, her day to day life is quite a mess and she can't handle even basic responsibilities like paying a bill or tidying a room. She is also a textbook narcissist, she simply will not or cannot consider anyone's feelings but her own and when she steps over the line, as she often does, she does not take any accountability for the things she does. It's pretty exhausting, and we have often had to act as 'parents' to her in many scenarios. She’s also an alcoholic that blacks out most nights of the week and falls down the stairs with no memory of it the following day. She’s done some horrible things to my dad while drinking that are best not to get in to. She’s still smoking despite beating breast cancer a few years ago and wont take any of her post-cancer medications that would prevent the cancer from returning. She’s a mess.

Anyway, her mother (our grandmother) worked very hard in her life and through that hard work, made a pretty decent life for herself. She was a great woman, with an amazing story, her legacy speaks for itself. She passed away at home peacefully this past year at the age of 97.

When we were kids, I wouldn't say we were spoiled by grandma at all, mostly our parents would drop us off and it was a safe and calm place where we could spend the weekend. We spent many weekends at grandmas house. Grandma would have us do yard chores and help out where we could. She would thank us for the work we did with a little money, which me and my siblings were always more than grateful for. We ate good and we felt loved. It was a nice place to be. Home wasn't always like that.

The house that my grandma lived in when we were young is different from the one my mom grew up in and was raised in. When I was little and my parents were in their thirties, my grandma sold their family home and moved in with her brother in a much larger and more comfortable home across town. Her brother passed away about twenty five years ago, so she had been living alone since.

As my grandma got older, my brother, the older sibling, and my grandma formed a special bond. After he graduated high school, he was the one who made time to regularly go see her and make sure that yard work kept getting done. Of course, we would all go over and spend time on holidays, but she was a tiny lady living in a big house all by herself, so it must have been lonely.

Fast forward a few years and my brother got married and had a kid. Grandma got older too and once, after a fall, there was concern. It was my brother who voiced what she really needed was some type of assistance of living care. As a family, grandma included, we talked a lot about what that might look like. Mostly it was my brother doing the work behind the scenes. My brother talked to grandma and asked her what she might want and the most favorable option was that someone from the family might move in to provide that care. My brother asked my mom if she would like to take on this responsibility, to which she emphatically said no. My mom has never been a responsible person really, and whenever there is a moment where she might have to take on responsibility of any kind, she tends to skirt the issue.

My brother talked to his wife and convinced her to move in and take care of grandma. One more thing is that grandma always spoke very candidly about her assets in the event that she might pass on. She had discussed with my brother and others pretty plainly that the person who delivers care should inherit the house. My brother once again offered the option for my mom and she said no (despite the fact that my dad had been wanting to leave and their house, our childhood home, was about to be foreclosed upon, etc).

So my brother packed up his family, moved and had two more kids. It was a good setup because his wife was an at home mom raising her kids and could help grandma while my brother worked. In turn, he provided what support he could after work and on weekends.

Grandma was happy and thankful, most importantly her needs were being met and she didn't have to struggle with daily things that get hard when you get older.

Grandma's house became more of a family gathering place, which was good for a time. My parents had relaxed into their role of grandparents nicely. Little squabbles would bubble up due to the fact that my mom would tend to show up unannounced to play with the grandkids, leave little messes everywhere and sometimes barely say hi or bye to grandma before leaving. My sister-in-law had become visibly frustrated, because this was also her home now and it fell on her to clean and accommodate after my mom.

A couple of years later, grandma's age was finally starting to catch up to her. She couldn't move around as much. She had a much harder time with her memory. She also became a bit bitter and senile, which I understood to be just an unfortunate part of getting much older and not being able to control as much about your life in those constraints. This materialized into some episodes of lashing out towards my brother and being a bit resentful to him and my sister-in-law. My brother would call me many times just to tell me that it was really affecting him and that he didn't know what to do.

Right before the holidays, she had a stroke which left her with almost no mobility and also took away much of her ability to communicate verbally. She passed away in January.

Months later, the disbursement of her inheritance came in. I didn’t know what assets she had, and I personally had no expectations regarding anything coming to me, but I did receive a generous figure, as did my sister. Her house was left to my brother and a much larger sum was also left to him and his family. My parents got quite a bit less, but still a large sum. Though not as much as me or my sister and significantly less than my brother.

My brother was informed of the details of the will first since he was named executor and told me privately that in recent years, grandma had made changes to her will, leaving less to my parents. For example, my dad had to have a spinal surgery when he was injured at work that left him bedridden for a time. His insurance essentially denied his claim to the care he needed so he asked my grandma for the money, which she gave him. Truth be told, he never did pay her back that money that he said he would, and I think that’s why his sum was the least of all. While alive, my grandma didn’t shy away from voicing her displeasure of anyone in the family when she had an opinion. She was disappointed in her daughter for not amounting to much in her life and also for becoming distant from her as she got older. She was also disappointed that the house she bought for them in the nineties (our childhood home) was really falling apart and was also extremely close to being foreclosed on (another messy situation that was caused by them taking out a second mortgage on the house for something I forget). Also, just as I mentioned earlier, grandma became resentful of even my brother/sister-in-law as she became senile, and she didn’t shy away from expressing her displeasure then either.

My thought was that everyone in the family would take the disbursement of grandma's assets humbly. I certainly did, as did my sister. My brother, who received the most, did too. However, my mom and dad did not, and it was my mom that was first to voice her outrage. It got really messy from there. My mom really went off and said some mean and nasty things to my brother and sister-in-law. She said it wasn’t fair, that she was the heir and the next in line to her mother’s estate and demanded half of my brother’s inheritance. What shocked me most was that my dad completely agreed with my mom and really thought that they were duped and should have gotten a large piece of the pie (my words not theirs).

So they concocted this story that it was my sister-in-law’s fault.. My parents never quite saw eye to eye with her, especially my mother. Their relationship had deteriorated almost completely at this point because my mom is really difficult to deal with and my sister-in-law does not have the patience for it. My parents said my sister-in-law disapproved of them and she must have whispered in grandma's ear to cut them out of the will so she could get as much as possible. Of course, when she heard my parents' reaction she was really hurt and outraged that they could even think that she was this type of person.

My brother was left stunned by my parents behavior, as we all were, and I could tell it was weighing on him. He and I talked several times over the situation. The things we agreed were weighing on us were that 1: they have said some really terrible things about our sister-in-law that can’t be unsaid and that they really should apologize for. And 2: their entire quality of life and living situation was fucked up by their own mistakes and obviously, they were hoping to use grandmas assets to crawl out of the hole they dug for themselves. Out of compassion, I suggested that my brother take his much larger amount to make a few things right for them so they could get to a better place. \~20k for a full set of dentures for my Dad as his dental health was in critically bad shape and \~20-30k for house repairs. The front porch of their house was literally rotting/falling apart and the roof had holes in it that you could see through. All this on the condition that they make things right on their end by coming to their senses about these accusations and apologize to my brother’s wife.

My brother certainly didn’t have to do it but he ended up deciding to help them out with those two things and gave them the money. The problem is that they didn’t hold up their end of the bargain and have since doubled down on their stance that my brother’s wife had a part in screwing them out of what they feel was rightfully theirs.

As it stands, my sister-in-law’s hurt feelings have hardened and she is in therapy working through this situation. My brother is too. My parents are either no longer welcome at my brother’s house or have openly stated that they won’t be over (I forget which, maybe even both). My mom’s theories on the matter are getting stranger and stranger (she called me once to try and convince me that my sister-in-law was a sociopath, for example). My sister has cut off all contact with my mother and blocked her number. My dad backs up my mom’s claims. My brother is still bringing the grandkids over to my parents so they can see them, but only once in a while and not with his wife. Because they have still not apologized to his wife for the things they have said and continue to say, he is feeling ready to cut them off, but hasn’t done so yet because he wants his kids to be able to have a relationship with their grandparents. The kids are unaware of course, but as you can imagine, the situation is weighing heavily on my family for quite a few reasons.

It's been months of this, my parents just keep digging in and the holidays are going to be celebrated separately with us at my brothers (previously my grandma's house) and my parents will be absent.

To summarize, my parents believe that during the last five years of home care, my brother’s wife convinced my grandma (while she was in a weak mental condition) that she should not give as much inheritance to my parents and that more should be given elsewhere.

I'm often looked at as the voice of reason in the family so I have talked to everyone apart from my dad (frankly we’ve both avoided speaking directly on the subject but he knows my position). I am very close with my brother and have talked at length with him about all this and am just trying to be there for him with support. I also have kept the telephone line open with my mom who I am not close with. Again, she is a narcissist that I have tried to reason with countless times but she is well versed in playing the victim. I feel most disappointed in my Dad, mostly because, in the past, I had looked to him as a voice of reason despite his flaws.

It's been an exhausting process for myself untangling this and trying to be supportive of my siblings and still hear from my mother. My perspective on this situation boils down to some simple things:

1. That my grandma's disbursement of her will is precisely what she wanted for our family, it reflects what she wanted to do with her things, and that everyone should really just be happy and humble that they got anything at all. To bring up theories that it should have been disbursed differently is selfish and dishonors my grandma's life and memory.
2. I don’t believe my parents' stance that my sister-in-law did this (and neither does my sister). To put it simply, I just don’t see her as someone that would do that, and it never even crossed my mind as a possibility.
3. According to the theory my parents currently believe, my brother would have to be ‘in on the plot’. My brother was very close with my grandma and spent time with her and talked to her every day since he had moved in to provide care. There is really no way, in my view, that my grandma would not have spoken to him about it. Everything my brother has done since my grandma’s passing has been motivated by family and not money. Specifically, trying to keep the family together; a stance that he didn’t have to take but he decided to because those are his values. I take my brother at his word, and I don’t believe he has any reason to deceive me or anyone in the family.
4. Family should always come before money. My parents have always been this way but it feels like what they are saying with their actions is they believe what is rightfully theirs is more important than the well-being of the family.
5. Our family has really changed for the worse through all of this. My mother doesn’t have any remorse for the things she’s said and done, and I don’t believe she is even capable of it, as she never has been throughout our lives. I haven’t spoken directly to my Dad about this but I tend to believe that he feels the effect of this situation and that it is weighing on him. Though of course, not enough to self-reflect on his own role in this nor to change his perspective on the matter.
6. My mother has serious mental health issues that have gone unaddressed for so long that all she does is create harm with everything she does. Just recently, because she misses her grandkids so much, she was planning on secretly showing up to where by brother wass going trick-or-treating with his wife and kids to surprise them (in costume) so that she would be able to spend time with them. Until I stepped in and told my brother so that his family's holiday wouldn't be ruined, she firmly believed that this is ok and that my brother’s wife and everyone should just have to deal with it. When I told her that it was not a good idea and that instead she should talk to my brother and his wife face to face and resolve things, she just quickly hung up on me.
7. And finally, my brother and my sister-in-law did a really selfless thing and gave my grandma the best life they could in the last five years of her life, and I really do respect and admire that about them.

That’s just about everything. One little side note that I should mention because it's been on my mind is that my parents have become really prone to conspiratorial thinking about COVID and political things and it has really pushed them hard to one side, especially my Dad. With that in mind, it is not surprising to me that this situation kind of feeds into that line of thinking that there is something darker going on. That as the conversation boils down to an ‘us vs. them’ type argument, that it's them that have been wronged and my brother’s wife must have secretly talked with my grandma to convince her that they didn’t deserve anything so my brother would inherit more.

I’m sharing this story with reddit today, because it has come to the point where I feel like I need to get it off my chest and gain some outside perspective. I don’t know how this situation ends other than my brother needed to cut my parents off.

I am going to seek out therapy soon myself, not only for this situation, but also to deal with the effect of my mother’s behavior on me in general and my stressful job. I know too that eventually, I will have to face my dad in the defense of my brother and lay out my thoughts, and I am going to have to listen to him scream and shout these wild and ridiculous opinions they both believe.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7559662,public,self,Some in my (M29) family have shown their worst selves after a family inheritance.

In the newly formed friend group is a girl(F21). I had a slight crush on her when I first met her and never told anyone cuz relationships in a friend group are complicated so I just decided to keep that to myself and see how things would play out . However Tom told our closest friends he has a crush on her and everyone started encouraging him. He followed her on Instagram in May, but never did anything after that till the end of October ( it was Summer and everyone in the friend group was out of town during that time so we didn't hangout). We started hanging out again and my bestfriend asked her out over text and she rejected him, because she was not over her ex. My bestfriend didn't told anyone he even asked her out (not even me), but another guy from the friend group learned that from the girl. That other guy is kinda the link between the two groups and he is a really good friend to her and he told me the story over a drink. I don't know when they broke, but I know they broke on good terms, remained friends and she even invited him to her birthday party. During these time my crush on her developed even more, instead of fading away and I suspect she has a crush on me too. For example I am the first of the whole friend group to receive a hug and the hug feels special?, she remembers the most minnor thing I said two weeks ago, she takes my glasses to try them on, raises her hand for me to give her high fives, always sits/moves next to me. She uploaded an instagram story a few days ago and I couldn't contain myself not to text her and we spent the whole day texting, but at the end of the day I felt bad about texting her when my bestfriend has a crush on her so I just sent her thumbs up to stop the convo (which was such a stupid idea I know). I would like to take her out on a date, but I don't want to shatter my relationship with my bestfriend. I might be delusional and she might just be acting kindly and in the end reject me, so maybe proggressing my relationship with her, before telling my bestfriend is a good idea so that I wouldn't put unnecessary pressure on the relationship with my bestfriend. On the other hand telling my bestfriend about my feeling might be the better course of action, because he was in the same spot I am in last year. Basically the crush of one of the guys in the friend group develop a crush on him  and during that time I  advised him not to go after the girl(what a turntable) . In the end he didn't listen to me, went after the girl behind the back of our friend and they went on a few days until breaking contact with her and he remained friend with the guy without him knowing about any of this. So what the best course of action would be ? Being upfront with my bestfriend, going behind his back or try to forget her ?

He does not seem bothered by this and gets upset when I suggest he get a seasonal job, claiming he doesn’t want to work a few months if the business will open again, even though he’s not certain. We did have a savings but we don’t have much anymore and he didn’t pay my mom rent this month, as well as borrowed money from her.

I could really use advice from experience and feel that I don't have a lot of people I can turn to irl about this.

So I (25F) met this guy (25M) and we'd been friends at first due to him having a girlfriend. About a month ago they broke up and in the past month, we've been getting a lot closer and I think I really like him but the problem is... he likes me too.

Historically I've had horrible relationships with any man in my life and I don't want to be a cliché 'daddy issues' trope but I've just never had any man (familial, platonic, relationship) not cause some sort of trauma in my life. Adding to this, I've also just got a lot of 'baggage'... difficult childhood, grew up poor, Autism, OCD, depression (recovering), eating disorders. 

Despite being 25, I've only dated a couple of times and they barely lasted more than a month or so because I got too scared of being vulnerable. Also haven't done a lot sexually for the same reason.

I really like this guy and it feels so different from before. Mostly, I've done a lot of work on myself to be more open and sought healthy ways to learn and cope with trauma. I do feel like I'm ready to try taking those steps in a relationship because it really is something I want. 

He's so normal and sweet and just has nowhere near the same level of issues and I'm so relieved for him.

My real question is, when is the 'right time' to share some of these problems? 

How do I explain that 'no I'm not just 'a little guarded'' but I've never opened up to someone before? 

What sort of advice do you have for someone like me entering into this for the first time? 

How do I share and be vulnerable but also make sure I'm not burdening him?

I text him why he did that and he was saying that he was unfollowing accounts because he didn't want me to think of him being immature or dumb because of what accounts he follows. I obviously questioned him because it was sus. So I proceeded to question this and ultimately made him admit that he was following a girl streamer who talked about cool animal facts which he unfollowed. He then deleted the app and said that this is why he doesn't like socials because of issues like this.

I'm just ???? I told him I don't care who he follows but that he didn't have to lie to me.

I took him to a big city last month and bought him anything he wanted. I payed for expensive meals,fun tourist adventures, as well as air fare and housing. I also took him on a shopping spree (something previously discussed that we both wanted to do for each other) where I bought him any clothes/whatever he wanted from anywhere he wanted. I loved being his sugar mama for the week and dropped a lot of money (we both work restaurant so we aren’t rolling in dough or anything). 

This month he took me to a different big city for my vacation, and so far it’s been great! He has paid for everything, and I am very grateful for the quality time and experiences. Everything is a bit cheaper in this city than the other one I took him to but no big deal; however, today is the last full day and he planned to take me on my shopping spree today, and he woke up sick. He got a cold or something likely from taking the train here. I have spent the day with him napping and taking care of him the best I can. He is only sort of sick which I know frustrates him bc he really wanted to go have a fun last day, and he feels guilty for “keeping me from having fun” on our last day.

Okay so here’s my dilemma; I am unsure if I should say anything about our shopping plans. I know I was excited and I think he was too. We have discussed together the stuff I should get and stores we both wanted to check out. Part of me wants to let go of this material urge so he can keep all the money he would have spent so he can use it on other, more pressing things for himself. The other part of me wants to ask him to take me out shopping in our home city. 

I know that he didn’t plan for this, obviously. In the end one part of me just wants to be supportive and possibly let go of my desire for money and objects. The other part me wants to go out and just be spoiled, something I’ve never really experienced on the receiving end.

Fast forward to October of 2022 I didn't even remember that I had liked two of her most recent posts on Instagram, one being a revealing maid outfit for Halloween. The second one is a sweater photo. The last post I even liked from Hyoon was back in August of 2021, so it had been over a year. I don't actively use Instagram, nor do I go around seeking other women's posts. I simply saw the post and liked it, maybe it was my shallow man mind going, ""Ooga Booga boobies."". 

In all seriousness, I don't have any other intentions.  After looking back on it I didn't think of how she would feel about me liking these photos, at the same time I never thought that she would be following my Instagram. Today she screenshotted the two posts and asked why, I explained to her that she was a streamer that I follow. I told her genuinely that, yes I liked her photos, but there is nothing more to them. I'm not pursuing other women. 

I chose my girlfriend because that is who I want. I've shut down flirting attempts made by other women in my outside life, we've both had the talk about attractive celebrities and how we can both agree that they look nice/hot. Just last night I got upset because we watched, ""Don't Worry Darling"". She's a huge Harry Styles fan and when it came to the sex scenes, or she would watch when her favorite celebs get undressed. When it comes to any other show that has sex scenes, she won't let me watch. I guess I just don't see it the way that she does but I want to learn and understand her.

I (20f) with my bf (20m) for over a year now, it’s his first relationship, not mine. To set the scene. We have a great relationship. We communicate, we haven’t had a bad fight once in the whole year, never really been angry with each other, and most importantly we have a lot of fun with each other. Each of us get along with our families, it’s nice. I am a chronic over thinker, and one thing that really helps me with this is reassurance. I expressed this to him very early on in the relationship, as our conversations seem so, cordial over text. We only hang out once a week for now due to uni life, so a lot of our relationship is online. He’s not very emotional, never tells me he loves me on text, that he misses me, that he’s happy with me. He is a GREAT guy, and when we are together he is affectionate and shows his love. We are just really different when it comes to terms of endearment. I tell my family I love them multiple times a day, give hugs, etc. He grew up in a household that doesn’t really do this. I get it, we were raised differently, but when we are apart for a week at a time, I really really need this extra little reassurance. 

I have brought this up to him about 2 or 3 times. He always chalks it up to, we’re different. Nothing changes and I continue to overthink. Last time I mentioned it, he did go out of his way to send me nice good morning messages, but that slowly faded out. I just feel as though we are really lacking an emotional connection. He never lets his guard down, never seems to be vulnerable with me and this is something that is really important to me. One of the things I love to do most is have deep convos with my partner, but he’s got nothing to say. A few of my friends and family members have described him as “so monotone”.

I (F20) and my boyfriend (M20) have been together for three years. His love language is physical touch, and mine is not. 

I am largely still pretty traumatized by sexual related incidents that I won’t go into further detail; but due to this, I don’t really enjoy sex, sexual intimacy or the likes that much at the moment. I’m no prude, but I just don’t want to do that with another person right now. He knew about the sexual trauma before we started dating, so it’s not like I lied to him, though I was a lot more sexually active with him in the first year of our relationship. After the first year, I found the trauma to be getting worse and I stopped doing sexual things with him. He did impact my trauma severely with his own actions at one point, where he stepped over my boundaries and that made things way worse (It wasn’t anything too terrible).

So, we haven’t had sex in about a year and a half since the incident. I try to make-out and stuff but since I had major jaw surgery during the summer my chin and lip area have been extremely in pain and sensitive as the nerves regenerate, so I really even have trouble doing that. This makes things worse because when I flinch or pull away from kisses he takes it very personally even though I explain every single time how much pain I’m in just to kiss. 

Lately he’s been pushing and saying that his love language (physical touch) isn’t being met and he doesn’t feel wanted or loved because I don’t do those things with him. He says intimacy is extremely important to him in a relationship and since I’m not fulfilling it he feels sad. He says he feels like I’ll never want him in a sexual way again. I honestly don’t even know if I will, but these conversations always make me feel so pressured to perform which makes my anxiety regarding it even worse and pushes sexual thoughts about him even further away. 

I do try to give him the max amount of physical touch I can conjure up; lots of cuddles, hand holding, etc- but I know that it’s not the same as more risqué behaviour.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to make my personal sexual trauma even worse then it is by forcing myself to do things with him to make him feel loved, but I don’t want him to keep being upset by my sex-avoidance. I know most people value sex and I understand why, but it’s just not where I am right now. 

We really wanted to marry each other. I love him and I love his family so much, but this is all just really confusing to me.

I am friends with noah(fake name). I met him a few years ago. He has been with me through my toughest time. He was like my go-to-guy, if I bad any problem with life, realtionship or anything. I am and will always be grateful for him being in my life.

Once we were chatting, I jokingly said that he makes my blood boil and makes me laugh at the same time. He replied with ""that's opposite for me"". I asked what he meant and he flat out said that I was annoying. After that it's was akward to talk to him, so I kindly told that and we stoped talking.

Few months later, he came to me and apologized for what he said. (It's funny but I had a gut feeling he would msg me).  I again jokingly said that I knew I was annoying and he agreed. He stated that I was only annoying sometimes but...( what's even the point of asking for forgiveness then? ) I asked if be just came to apologized or if he wants to be friends and he said that he was confused.

Few months later, he msg me and we started chatting. In the middle of the conversation, he addressed me as friend. 

Tbh I am happy to have my emotional support system but I still have that comment in the back of my head. Am I still annoying to him? Should I even be friends or no? If I will be friends what thing will be irritating to him.

I had a little sister come shortly after. My mom started schooling sometime last year, trying to get a better job and since then has stayed at home with my sister and I. I have not had any relationship with her in years, as she went to jail when I was little, and just came back into my life recently. (Maybe 4 years ago) I had no contact with her whatsoever due to my grandparents. Since then I’ve been trying to build a relationship with her and it was amazing, until I moved in. Since then our relationship has progressively gotten worse. I’ve noticed the past year and a half she has been prioritizing her college work and everyone else in the family over me. My oldest sister often comes over with her kids, and it doesn’t matter what my mom is doing, she drops everything for them and acts like I don’t exist. ( I don’t blame them) When I try to get involved in conversations I’m ignored or told what I’m talking about is stupid. I’m not a really popular kid who has all the tea, I’m more quiet and isolated and I have little friends, but when I try to talk to her about whatever’s going on in my life it gets dismissed as dumb or irrelevant. She often fusses me for the tiniest things and lately the only time she speaks to me is asking me to do something. My stepfather in this situation is a complete narcissist and is controlling over her. I feel like that is a factor but I feel so isolated and lonely, especially after worrying about her and trying to help her with her issues just to be put on the back burner.

My boyfriend (18m) and I (19f) have been together for about a month now. we're both in college (that's how we met) and we spend a lot of time together. everything is perfect... except for the fact that he's the most expensive person in my life.

He's currently unemployed and I'm a sex worker making very little income. everytime he comes over, he smokes all my weed, drinks all my soda (I'll buy those giant flats from the grocery store and it'll be gone in one night) and makes a huge mess for me to clean up. I understand that when you're high you can sometimes become helpless to your surrounding, but there's gotta be some compromise we can come to. I'm a very tidy person and it kills me how much he seems to not respect that.

like on Friday I bought a shit ton of weed and by Monday he had smoked ALL OF IT. I can't afford to sustain that habit for him.

In his defense, I'm the type of person who will never tell the person I'm with if something is wrong and as a result, it ends up festering. I don't want to make that same mistake with this relationship. But how do I have this conversation with him without sounding like a bitch? I know he doesn't have the money to do this stuff himself, but god damn he's hurting my wallet.

any advice on how to tackle this is much appreciated.

I am 25 and he is 27. We currently have no children but would like them in the future. I feel isolated most of the time as I work and go to school. I'm home a few hours a day and usually have two days when I can see him most of the day. On my days off we go out and spend time running errands together. Usually he is on his phone the entire time so I end up feeling alone. My husband does not work right now and this is not a problem for us at all. Lately I have started having problems with how often he is gaming with friends. I assume he plays video games for at least a few hours while I'm out of the house since sometimes things around the house aren't done and any time I reach out he is playing if he answers me at all. When I'm home I get the impression that he would rather be playing video games with his friends. During the day his friends are at work and he plays alone. When they get off they set a time every night for all of them to play together for hours. He will get off if I ask him but he wants to play at least one or two rounds with the guys. It can still take hours. His gaming with friends always happens to be when I'm home from work. I end up spending hours alone after being alone all day at work. I started to feel hurt because I can see him losing interest in our time together when he wants to spend time with them. When I spoke to him he listened but nothing came from it. 

Usually nothing comes from us talking about things like this. Nothing changes even for a day. I don't want to press because I know he is struggling right now and he never picks to play games when we have important things to do. It's only when I would like quality time at home after work. He goes to bed before me and stays up to play alone too.

Outside of this one issue he is a great partner. He is extremely supportive of me and makes sure I'm usually taken care of. He has always worked before this and I think part of his gaming now comes from boredom, depression, and losing that part of his identity. Due to him not working he takes care of the house and cooks most of the meals. I don't mind him playing games for a few hours a day if it wasn't impacting our quality of life. Just seems like he started playing more and more daily and now it's getting in the way of our limited amount of time together and things in our life suffer due to it. I also don't want to feel second best in our relationship if he favors time with friends above time with me. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm just tired and feel alone most of the time. I do know I will start going to therapy again. All I do is work and school anymore so that might also explain why I feel so isolated and overwhelmed.

However, the relationship is pretty much perfect. He’s supportive, empathetic, intelligent, driven, kind etc but I’d say the relationship is just comfortable.

The only thing missing in our dating life is adventure and fun social experiences, but this has been a tough area to address due to his introverted nature. 

Ultimately, I’m liking the idea of being single more than relationship life. There’s nothing wrong with him and breaking up would be horrible, but I don’t feel motivated to continue the relationship.

So with my ex, she recently talked to me bout how she was wanting to truly try again. She is another great girl and everything but I just don’t know if I would be willing to risk it with her or even how I would let her down. A pro about her is that we have had sexual tension before and it’s always been great but I’m just very lost and confused on what to do. I need help or opinions on this matter.

Let me preface by saying throughout our years we’ve dabbled in recreational drug use (such as mushrooms and marijuana) but it was a very rare occasion. At the very beginning of our relationship we partied a lot together but as time went on we started settling down. I made it clear that I was okay with certain drugs but only when used rarely and there was communication about it. Ive never seen him take pills.

About a few months ago my boyfriend started playing video games very often. He had never been into them much up until that point, but it’s a hobby he enjoys and I was happy he has that. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago..I noticed a couple of hours of game play a night turned into more and more. It’s gotten to the point that he gets home around 5 PM, starts playing around 7, and will stay up way past I’ve gone to bed at 11. Some nights he’s gone to sleep well past 2 in the morning. 

After a while of this I expressed to him it would be nice to eat dinner together at least, and have him in bed with me more than just a couple nights out of the week. He seemed a bit defensive but agreed, and to be fair our time together has increased some.

One thing that continued to nag me was how he could possibly have that much energy to wake up at 7 AM, work all day, and then play until the wee hours of the morning. A couple of nights I noticed he wasn’t in bed until 4 AM. Maybe I was being naive or just blind, maybe more focused on the lack of time spent together…

But I’m pretty sure I solved the mystery. He asked me to grab something from his car before he left for work this morning, and when I did I found a ziplock bag half full of adderall. And it suddenly hit me as to why he’s been able to stay up so late.

He hasn’t came home yet…and I’m planning on confronting him. I’m just feeling so hurt and betrayed. Not only has he been neglecting our time together, he’s probably been hiding taking adderall from me. 

I just feel so lost right now. If he is willing to hide this what else is he willing to hide? Have I enabled this by not bringing it up sooner?

We had been dating for about 6 months at this point. After the trip his sibling said that I was “too much” and controlling and that I was “creepy” with the kids. 

I was on a week long trip with about 30 people I had never met before and the adults were all acting like I had to earn their approval so naturally I gravitated towards the kids. The adults were enjoying themselves while I made sure the kids were safe and having fun. The kids loved me and sought me out.

I should also note that I took care of said siblings child, (got her ready for bed and went and watched a movie with her) while siblings spouse got into a booze fueled argument with the mother in law and drove off drunk (they had just gotten a DUI recently too).

Coming out of the trip everyone is fine with the sibling’s spouse who endangered peoples lives but everyone thinks I was too comfortable and I was drinking too much. 

Fast forward a few months of me not going to family things, sibling reached out to me telling me to put this behind me and that I’ve made such a huge stir in the family and that they should be the least of my concerns. No apology, zero accountability for their actions and a lot of accusations.

I asked 4 times for them to observe my boundary that I need acknowledgment for how I was impacted. They keep refusing and then finally, extremely condescendingly says, “I acknowledge your feelings, you are a human, world peace and all that shit.”


I realize they don’t have the emotional maturity to do any better than that but I am still frustrated and really nervous to be around them. Like I can’t drink any alcohol or acknowledge her kids without judgement.

He is 40 years old and recently divorced. When we first started dating, he told me that he was in a very adventurous relationship with a woman while he was in his 20’s, who was an exhibitionist and she enjoyed having sex in front of other people in sex/swingers clubs. She also apparently introduced him to sex clubs for the first time during their relationship. He claims they went a few times, and then eventually he had the courage to have sex with her in front of other people “only once”. She also persuaded him to take ecstasy every weekend during their relationship and supposedly they had intense, tantric sex“. He supposedly broke up with her because she was “bipolar”, she would get mad at him for “no reason“, and she threw a knife at him during an argument.

After that, he married a woman who was supposedly “very prudish and into vanilla sex“. They were married for about seven years before getting divorced. Supposedly during their marriage, he persuaded her to stay at nudist resorts, which had extreme/erotic sex club activity at night. And, he also persuaded her to visit a sex club and he persuaded her to try ecstasy a few times in order to spice up their sex life. Supposedly, she had a very bad reaction to this and had stroke-like symptoms.

Before getting divorced, they were supposedly in couples therapy together seven times because they were having issues in their relationship and she was accusing him of being a “sex addict“ (which he denies is true).

I have a fairly high sex drive, so it isn’t really a problem for me to be with a partner who has that kind of energy. However, he has pressured me to take ecstasy a few times, and I once OD’ed because he gave me a very high dose of it. It was not a pleasant experience for me and I told him that I don’t want to do it again. He isn’t pressuring me, but he does still bring it up sometimes. “It would be great if we could try ecstasy again, maybe you get the right dosage so you can feel as good as I do“.

He has repeatedly brought up sex clubs to me, but it’s not really my thing (I have never been to one) and I’m also a bit of a jealous partner. I told him that I would never want to swing or partner swap. He tells me that he never did that when he went to sex clubs, and he claimed that he just went to watch people have sex and he had sex with his girlfriend (now ex) once while in a sex club…. I think he’s lying to me because he seems to know all of the rules regarding partner swapping, who should approach the couple first, etc. As mentioned, I don’t know anyone who goes to sex clubs, and I have never done that before but I think it’s bullshit to say that someone has frequently visited practically every sex/swingers club in the area (in the past)  and they were never into the actual swinging scene.

I fought with my boyfriend last night, after I asked him what he wanted for Christmas and he was being elusive. At first, he said “I don’t really like receiving gifts, so if you’re going to give me something then I want it to be an experience“. So, then I asked him “We’ll, what kind of experience? What do you mean?“ To which he responded, “I don’t know, maybe a sexual romp or something new“. So then, I asked again “We’ll, what do you mean by that?“ And then he said “I don’t know, like going to a sex club or something“. I was really put off and creeped out by that statement and I told him that not only do I not feel comfortable going to a sex club at this stage in our relationship, but I think it’s incredibly creepy that he would tell me not to buy him any gifts for Christmas and he would want to go to a sex club as a gift… Who the hell asks for that?

So, every time I talk to him about how I feel and how certain things that he brings up regarding sex clubs makes me uncomfortable, I feel like he responds in a very persuasive/manipulative way. He normalizes going to sex clubs, he tells me there is “no pressure“ for me to do any of that, although he continues to bring it up during conversations… 

I’m not sure how to address this other than ti end the relationship because I’m worried that he’ll try to persuade me into doing things that I will later regret or feel highly uncomfortable with later on.

I didn't know anyone in this new area, and accepted a contract for 2 years, so I was very interested in making friends during this time.

Almost immediately, I formed a very close friendship with this girl we'll call Sarah. The friendship was completely platonic, and we formed a good friendship circle as well. Both being new to the area, we basically did everything together. It's a small town that we live in, so there isn't much to do anyways, but once the weekend rolled around it was very common for either of us to not be doing much on the weekend and spend time with each other. If there were any events on, we'd normally go together, usually with other friends too.

After a few months, she started to be attracted to me. This was not something I was reciprocating, and I was unkeen to have sex as I was concerned this would hurt our friendship. She persisted and eventually we did have sex.

We decided not to date (we both agreed) but have a friends with benefits relationship. In hindsight this wasn't something I was ready for, as when she started seeing this other guy we'll call Jerry, I became pretty jealous.

Eventually it became obvious that her and Jerry were becoming somewhat serious, and we ended our friends with benefits relationship.

However, now that Sarah is dating Jerry, she does not seem interested in being friends with me anymore. Sometimes she seems very close to me for example, when we saw each other at a mutual friend's party about 4 weeks ago she sat next to me and held my hand. One person even commented that it seemed like we were flirting when we were talking to each other.

However other times she ignores me or doesn't seem interested in example, the week after that party I messaged her asking what she was doing on the long weekend that we both had, and she basically blew me off completely which is very strange for her. I got quite upset because I felt she was being rude to me, and we haven't spoken since.

I realize that her relationship is more important to her now, but I would be devastated if we couldn't remain friends. She has said similar things too in the past (we both commented that if we couldn't be friends we would consider leaving this town. We have also said that we loved each other numerous times.)

Right now, we haven't spoken or seen each other in about 3 weeks. We have activities/friends in common, but it seems like she is avoiding those events.

These girls are hot as hell. Nice bodies pretty faces and get cheated on with the opposite

This morning she texted me and said she had a revelation about something that stemmed from a recent therapy session. She just told me what it was when we got together today after work. 

She told me that she realized she felt like something was off for the last month. She said she realized that I have not been giving her enough words of affirmation and she hasn’t felt as loved as she did when we first started dating. 

She did note a few times recently where I have given her words of affirmation but said she needs more. She also mentioned instances where she knows I was expressing love through my languages but they didn’t have the same affect on her. 

When we first started going on dates we discussed love languages and I told her I am not good with words of affirmation. I reminded her of that tonight and she said she knows but she wants me to work on it. 

I am more than willing to work on this but it does have me a bit concerned. 

Does anyone have experience with “working” on a love language until it becomes more of a habit?

Are we doomed for success because we express love in different ways?

Here’s the other thing… a month ago she told me she wanted more intimacy. She said she felt a lack of intimacy for 2-3 weeks and it made her feel less value in herself. 

When I combine these two instances together, I am concerned that she is relying too heavily on me to find value and happiness in herself.

(all 19f) We have been friends since freshman year, it is now sophomore year. We live in a college apartment and moved there and split a list of items we would need (toaster, pans, etc.) I am close with roommate A and we share a room. We have no problems. But B and C have been making my life hell.

B and C have very high cleaning standards that were never disclosed before moving in which simply baffles me. For example, I got yelled at for leaving my laptop and bag out during midterms. I apologized and said I didn't know it was wrong to do that, Roommate C cursed me out and implied I am not normal. She has also made fun of me for being the ""most mentally ill"" in the group.

I want to specify I am not a dirty person. I clean my dishes immediately and sweep the floor after cooking. I wipe down surfaces after cooking. I am a little scatterbrained, however, and have had a hard time with my depression this semester.

Roommate B sat with me and A to discuss the tension, talked over us and said that her pots were stained and we had been disrespecting them and her garbage can. I clean the garbage can every time I put a new bag in, so I looked at her kind of blankly. Her pans also aren't even stained and are very much fine. She said they were so bad they needed to be tossed, which was a lie. I have multiple witnesses all agreeing that they were fine.

To be nice and to preserve the friendship I offered to buy her new pans when she gets them, and offered to bring up new pans from home. B never got back to me on this. So, imagine how surprised I was when I came home from school this weekend and the pans are gone entirely. I was so tired and hungry and mad I just burst into tears. I literally could've brought some from my house but she purposefully didn't tell me. I can't even cook now.

I miss my friends. We used to be so close. But now every time I see them I feel so sad and mad. I don't know how to repair things or how to confront my roommate about the lack of pans.

My friend invited me to this group chat and Adam was in it. I was on vacation at the time and had a lot of time to spend online so I indulged in chatting with him. Adam and I shared a lot of common interests and views and even though I had no idea of his physical appearance I was kinda falling for him. 

Around two months were spend chatting non stop and I eventually returned to my hometown and I met up with him. 

Another month passes, he confesses to me. Obviously, I didn't accept immediately. Although appearance-wise he wasn't my type, he was nice on the eyes and we really hit it off irl as well. Not to mention, I felt a real connection with him. Thus, I told him to take it slow so I could make sure that I was truly attracted to him and not  just excited over a boy I just met (plus I have some bad experiences from previous relationships and don't want to rush things). 

Anyways, we never made it official but we went on dates and cuddled a lot (not even first base guys, we went THAT SLOW) and honestly it was fun. But I kept having this weird feeling and every time I tried to pinpoint it I just felt awful about my relationship with Adam. Whenever this feeling surfaced my attraction Adam would just disappear and I'd only see him as a friend(?). 

Truly, I have no idea how or why I feel like that.  My friends told me that I just don't see him in a romantic way and that kinda stuck to me. 

To cut to the chase; a really important exam came up along with some family issues. I knew that I had a lot of studying to do and that I would have to sacrifice most of my free time to family for like 2 weeks at most. So I contacted Adam and told him I'd be off the radar for a while ( I'm the type that mutes everything while studying). 

4 days after I told him Id be super busy he contacted me telling me that he was upset with something and wanted to see me immediately, I squeezed my program and went out with him for a coffee... I didn't complain but I was slightly annoyed (mainly because when we went out we didn't talk about him being upset over something). 

Today I opened my phone to check an email...it hasn't even been a week from our 'upset' meetup (btw i did text him a bit in the meanwhile) and I get a LENGTHY paragraph of how he's hurt that I'm ignoring him and there is no excuse for my behavior and several passive aggressive jabs.

After about 3 months he asked me to be his girlfriend. But there’s a few things that I really need some advice with. 

So first of all, he is the type of guy that likes going out with his mates to bars and festivals with his friends, which is fine, but I have found it hard to trust when we are about an hour drive away from each-other and I’ve never been with someone that goes out every weekend till early hours of the morning. 

In September we went away together and when passing me his phone to look at the maps I noticed the do not disturb was on (meaning I couldn’t see any messages that came through whilst I was on his phone) I addressed this and he understood why I was a bit funny about it and hasn’t ever done it again since. He said he’s just used to doing it whenever he gives his phone to anyone and does it to all his friends and family so thought treating me the same was normal since not being in a relationship before. 
So I was laying next to him earlier sending snapchats to my friend with a silly filter and also sent it to him and saw that the notification didn’t show. I asked him about it and he just said he never uses Snapchat and “never turned the notifications on for it”
I told him to stop coming up with bullshit excuses. He then said that he turned them off when we was in the talking stage and he was still chatting to other people, I don’t really know if I buy it.

We then both started talking about when the last person we slept with/ spoke to before each other and he swore on his mum and dads life that he hasn’t slept with anyone since we started talking just messaged a lot of people before we was official. Also got a bit upset I think when I said I was doing that as I wasn’t very serious about him at the start.

From there It grew serious pretty quickly, and she got OBSESSIVE over seeing me. We slept/ate/showered/had sex with each other on the daily as if we were already in a serious relationship. We therefor started to develope real feelings and a bond between each other. A time came where we got almost out of touch (not seeing/talking very shortly) for about ~7-10 days.
When I saw her again, she told me that she saw and had sex with someone else. And that she felt that she had started to get attached to me in a way that she wasen't comfortable with, since she does not want to get into a serious relationship yet. 

However, she still expects/wants us to be close with each other just like we were before. She still texts me every night, and gets mad when I don't answer.

How am I meant to deal with this? How is it  logical and/or fair in any kind of way?

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years. He's a very kind person, always seemed quite ""together"", but he's had moments of extreme upset and anger seemingly at tiny things. These are very rare but gave me a clue that something might be off.

Recently we were at a club and he was groped. I don't condone that in any way, but his reaction definitely seemed very extreme for his personality type. He became extremely upset and angry, to the point of crying and shaking, and we had to leave. I of course understood that groping is sexual assault and we both reported it, but I could tell something was up BEYOND what had happened on the day.

I became concerned that maybe something had happened. Thinking about it, he has been pretty uncomfortable with certain sex scenes in films before, but I didn't really piece things together.

I asked him a while back and he told me that he'd been subject to a rape when he was younger. What he described was the most horrific thing I have ever read. I won't go into details but I would say it was a combination of sexual violence, torture and homophobia. It took him well over an A4 page to describe this to me.

I want to be there for him, but I am shocked. I can't imagine this happening to anyone, it's so beyond what I can comprehend. I look at my beautiful partner and wonder how he's here after what happened. I want to be a good boyfriend but I'm out of my depth. I keep re reading the message, it breaks me.

I cuddled with him for hours after. He told me via text because he said it was easier to do that way, and we've really struggled to talk in person. He breaks down upon mentioning it, and then goes back to ""normal"". 

I've endlessly researched what to say and do, all I can think is to be a supportive voice.

Context: My parents have been divorced for 10 years. They divorced while I was in highschool. They originally separated because my father wouldn't stop sm_king p_t and drinking alcohol. He also would lock himself in his downstairs office for hours after work and do those things + video games. They tried marriage counseling and it failed because he wouldn't change. My mom was active and liked leaving the house - it seems like they really just grew apart. Her objective was to divorce. She could not live with him as her partner and told me many years later that she needed to save herself.

My Dad hired a PA after they separated to keep tabs on her. He actually told me(at the time) he had hired a PA to follow my mother, and I deflected The PA discovered she had found someone else and was sleeping with them while my parents were separated. This made him extremely bitter towards her, understandably.

Moving back and forth between parents was really hard for me. He and I kept fighting because I was not doing well in school during the divorce. This culminated in us actually physically FIGHTING and then I ended up with my mother/choose to live with her because I found her less authoritarian. 

After that, he REALLY hated her, and would not help me in my life in order to spite HER. This obviously didn't help my relationship with him. Now, many years later, we have a pretty good relationship. Regular communication, lunch every couple of weeks, he sends me some money, it's light-years better than say, three years ago.

The only problem is he brings up my mother frequently when we talk. It's always negative. A pyramid/stock scheme she bought into while they were together that failed, a weird thing she did one time, something about her character, or whatever. It somehow feels as though he is venting frustrations he retains about her.. AT me. Like somehow I am the target??? I really don't think it's good for our relationship, and even if it isn't bad and I'm overthinking it... I don't want to hear this sh*t anymore.

How do I get him to stop bringing her up? Preferably in a calm and diffusing way, because he is known to explode in anger. 

Info that may be relevant: he started dating his current girlfriend when my mom and him were separated - after he found out about my mom seeing someone else.

Please help 🙏

TLDR: My Dad's relationship with my mom 10 years ago has nothing to do with me and him now. It's no longer relevant, but he keeps bringing her up in negative ways.

I would normally be peeved about this. However, I am not sure how to react because of his reasoning / specific nature of this case:

-  He said he would only have these fantasies / thoughts when he felt anxious that he wasn’t going to “come” quick enough for me or be hard enough, and he was scared I wouldn’t feel attractive because of it. He said he would let his head “flood” with tons of sexual images (mostly from porn, but some of irl people like ex and past crushes) in order to come quickly.

- he said he wasn’t intentionally bringing the images of his ex / irl crushes into his head. They just kind of popped up for a split second because he had fantasies of them in the past before we were dating, so I guess it’s part of his memory. He said 99% of the time it was just scenes from porn he had seen. He has also stressed that the “flooding” itself wasn’t intentional, and it was more of him just letting the thoughts enter and a way for his brain to shut up his anxious thoughts.

- he has always been able to come with me and has never had a problem with that. He says I am 100% enough to make him come and the most attractive women he knows and has been with. He said the flooding was essentially to overwhelm the anxiety and force himself to come quickly, but it was always me he was focused on

- He told me this has only happened around 10-20 times in the past 5 years and is extremely rare. 95% of it was in the first year of dating, when he felt very anxious. We were both virgins before this. 

- the only reason he told me instead of keeping it to himself is because he has agreed to be fully open / honest with me about everything. This was due to something that happened in our relationship recently 

- he has never cheated on me, and he says he would never want to be with his crushes / ex irl. He has no feelings for them whatsoever and only wants me. 

- I feel I definitely contributed to this anxiety by accident. He tends to cum quite quickly in general (within a few minutes), and I know some guys feel embarrassed / ashamed about this. So, I have always tried to reassure him by telling him “it’s hot when you come so quickly for me.” 

- I can’t really understand how thoughts like this work, and how much control he has of fantasies “entering” or seeping through.. mainly because I actually can’t visualise things in my head (I just see black). So I guess me being upset could be because of my lack of understanding of the experience?

I feel hurt, but I can also understand this is a very different case from “im fantasising about my ex because you’re not good enough”. is this a typical thing for guys to do? should I look past this?

We've been together for over a year and he massively breached my trust 3 months ago, we're still healing from that. Last 1.5 months have been hectic and we only had a day or two to ourselves (there were more planned, but some he cancelled because he needed space). We barely had time to call and talk during this time and we live in different cities. We both work in office-based jobs and have varying workloads, sometimes we work from home and are by the phone non-stop, sometimes the opposite. We had a big fight about a lot of things and this came out, and it's such a striking disagreement I have to check I'm not crazy. I am anxious, but I feel I'm being called clingy for a perfectly human reaction.

He said I expect to be texted three times a day and it's ridiculous. 1) I don't expect, I mentioned he never texts me anymore and as an example said I think good morning, after-work and good night message is pretty standard if not worryingly low effort (talking about just single messages, no longer conversation on top of that) - that concerns both of us initiating these texts, I don't expect him to do it 100% of the time. Rolling examples if that makes it easier to judge:

I text my bf while on a trip. He sees the messages in the morning (9am-ish) of Day 1, but doesn't respond. Text him again at 6pm. Once again, 11pm. Seriously worried, the next day (Day 2) at 11am, using a codeword for being extremely serious. 5pm Day 2, nothing - only picks up around 6pm once called and explains he was sick in bed. Didn't look at his phone all weekend. Says it's ridiculous I am angry about it for the next few days.

Next, his birthday. We're unable to spend it together, but we've celebrated the previous day. I text in the morning (11am). I text again at 3pm, confessing I feel bad I'm not with him and asking about what he's doing with his family. He reads the message and gives a heart reaction. At 6pm I say it's not cool, only then he explains he had a bad day and needs space. Elaborates a bit, but doesn't reply when I say I feel shitty. Informs me he needs space again the next day around 7pm. I let him know ok, he can call if he wants though. No reply. Once again, I reach out in the morning (8:30am) saying I feel really bad and asking to talk to me. Reply at 5pm. Calls and expects to chit chat about our day, not talking about what happened the previous days because it's a ""boundary"". 

The reason he needs space is not clear to me, as his boundary is also anything to do with his family. I know it's a bad situation, but he's been going to his family every weekend for the past 3 weeks and then needed space to recover for up to 2 days. During that time he'd inform me he needs space (as we've established that after many fights on ghosting/blocking me), but expect me not to text, not to contact him in any way.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7559351,public,self,My boyfriend (30M) tells me I'm (23F) being clingy and crazy for expecting a response within a certain time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywe9d0/my_boyfriend_30m_tells_me_im_23f_being_clingy_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

He also turned out to be very aggressive, would smoke joints and drink the whole day and would harm himself whenever he got frustrated. We dated for 3 years, lived together for 2 and were engaged. 

After this relationship I dated someone for a couple of months but got a job abroad and decided to end things up. He wanted to move away with me to my new location but I realised I honestly didn't want that and also I didn't actually have as much romantic feelings as he had for me.

Cheater: Friend B

TLDR; My friend who cheated on his gf had been arguing with friend C and when I told friend A about how they grew out of the problem she got mad at me for still being friends with him.

My high school friend cheated on his girlfriend like 6 months ago, I commented a situation that happened between the cheater with Friend C (22M) friend to friend A.

They were arguing that friend B was pointing out friends C mistakes and vice versa and then they started calmly looking for a solution together, this surprised me as in that I had never seen the boys be so open about their feelings and working towards making something work regarding feelings (men I guess)

I was so happy about it, that I told friend A which had helped me emotionally for a long time now.

Turns out that now friend A is mad at me for still being friends with friend B after he cheated, since she can't stand cheaters, this is what she said:

""Im disappointed

We're very close and I tell my mom almost everything important.  I'd do anything for them, and they'd do the same.  However, over the past ~8 years I keep getting into the same argument with them.  Sometimes I won't talk to them or ask about their lives as much, won't come home from college to visit, or would rather hang out with friends or something.  I know that I can be a little self centered, I get very wrapped up in my own head especially when I'm busy.  I do usually like going out with friends more, I can relate to them more.  I'm also not great about asking about their day to day or just chatting in general.  I don't really think to tell people about mundane stuff in my life so I don't ask about theirs either.

They talk about everything they do for me and say that I don't care about them at all and would rather be with my friends even though my friends don't matter as much as family.  They say that I don't act like I'm part of the family and that I'd rather be on my own.  I try to tell them this is not true, I love and care for them a lot.  This also confuses me because at all other times, when they're not mad at me, they say to go have fun with my friends, don't worry about them, that they don't want to keep me at home, etc.  Also, I never really ask them for anything at all, but then they throw it all in my face when these arguments happen.  I don't know what to do anymore.  Every time this happens it makes me feel awful.  Like I'd be better off not existing because I'm a bad person that doesn't care about her family.  I just don't know how to do better.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7559328,public,self,My family and I keep having the same argument and I don't know how to fix it.

It’s so strange to me because I have always been so fond of him and I never thought I would get to this point. I just need advice right now. I find it hard to say “I love you” back to him and I find myself not enjoying the time we spend together anymore. The thing is, this happened over this span of about two days which seems odd to me that it could happen so quickly. I feel horrible because he is the most sweet and kind person I have ever/ will ever meet. I’m so confused because sometimes I feel like I don’t love him, then it goes away, then it comes back and I just want to love him again so bad. I don’t know what I am feeling. Does it sound like I’m losing feelings for him? I truly don’t know what I’m going through right now",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7559314,public,self,I don’t know if I love my boyfriend anymore,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywe4oi/i_dont_know_if_i_love_my_boyfriend_anymore/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
