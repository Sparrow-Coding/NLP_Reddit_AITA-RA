I will be honest I am not used to expose any part of my life on internet. Although I would like advices on the situation.


Me(M-23) , been dating a F-22 for 8 months.

I also want to add she never had any healthy relationship before me, I think it’s an important detail.



The first 4 months = Amazing, perfect, fun, insane chemistry. Last 4 months till now… meh… Well when we see each others it’s perfect, chemistry is still immaculate, the minute I am out of her sight she hates me, ignore me etc…

Well not for no reasons, to be honest two big things happened this summer.

I lied to her. In short : she asked me if I was close to others girls and I said no…

Truth was, I was talking to a FRIEND(Woman) everyday. Well she is in another country and I never even plan on ever seeing her…
I never flirted with her, never been suspicious, most of our convos were about music or her ranting about her life(She always had something to worry about), truth is she was co-dependant to me. And I felt guilty if I wasn’t here to listen to her… Keep in mind, no flirting, not even any phone calls.



I know I am in the wrong for lying and still feel bad about it, my Gf discovered it by going through my phone(I let her go through my phone, I know I had nothing wrong to hide)
My GF saw everything, she seemed… relieved that I wasn’t cheating on her.. although she later asked me to block her…

I didn’t do it on sight, did it weeks later because I was feeling guilty, and felt like I wasn’t doing anything wrong anyway.

I always treated my Gf like a Goddess, gifts, when she needed something I was here for her, listened to her problems for hours, even helped her for her professional situation getting her to various formations, when she was in any type of needs I was here(Mind you, she needed help every couple of times,)


Simultaneously she lied about something to me, that I discovered around the same time. It was a different situation, but could’ve put my health in danger, it’s better I don’t go in anymore details but she was hiding from me is something you shouldn’t be hiding to your partner. When I discovered it she begged me not to tell anyone(Obviously I wouldn’t , I only want her good), she was feeling ashamed about her, but I supported her, I was mad but barely showed it, I think most partner would’ve leave without any explanation but I stayed by her side cause she needed me the most, she was at her lowest in life. 

I also thought that since we both lied to each other(with no bad intentions, i know we both love each other) but i thought going trough this would make us stronger.


Fast forward to current times, every once in a while(once a week) she send me txt messages about what happened in July and tell me how terrible I was to her.
She sometimes blocks me, then unblock me the next day etc…

She was also so rude to me randomly(still because of that) but asked me for money or help few hours after and I was there to help her.



While I NEVER talk about what she did to me, although I am not forgetting about it.



This week she seems to be leaning to us breaking up, still because of what happened four months ago…

I can’t lie, I been at my lowest for the last ten days, I got no motivation, I am so sick because of Covid and got denied to a school I really wanted in. She basically throw me away when I need her the most.

It hurts because when she had less than nothing I was there. Did I got used ? Am I too good to others ? She was kind and loving to me but I feel betrayed. Is she not seeing the worth of fighting for her ? Did she just ignored everything I did for her ?

Should I try to get her back ? I love her to death, outside of those 2 situations in July everything was immaculate and perfect.

I know I will be good without her, I got plenty of everything in life.. 

Thoughts ?

I’ve already asked twice and told him I want to send gifts. I rarely get to see him as he lives in another country. We both had traumatic events and also conflicts with each other earlier this year. It hurts because we used to be close but had more fights recently. We had a fallout for several months this year right after I broke up with a toxic narcissist.

My dad and I then started talking again but we were still angry at each other. He sent me a video of my grandma saying that she misses me, but I didn’t call because it didn’t feel right to force it when I’m mad at my dad. My grandma suddenly fell ill and passed away shortly after that. I felt guilty and shocked but talked it out with my dad and supported him. I wanted to help him cope so I asked if I can send a condolence basket. At the time, he was emotional and said maybe a few weeks later for a memorial event. I understood he had so much going on with planning her funeral. Then the memorial event got cancelled due to Covid cases. I asked if I could still send it to his own address so he can have it at home, and he acted completely confused by what I was saying. He claimed he did not understand that I originally said I want to send the basket. But I really doubt this and it seems he was playing dumb or still taking his anger out on me. I also wanted to send him his birthday gift and he said he’ll send me his address, but hasn’t talked to me this whole week.

Now apparently he still traveled to the hometown where the memorial would’ve taken place and is celebrating my grandpa’s bday and wants me to call to wish him. But how was he able to travel if everything got cancelled due to Covid? I’m upset that he’s just refusing to share something anyone has the right know about their parent! It makes me feel so anxious and confused.

Should I even call? Should I bring this up to my dad on the call? Why is he putting up this barrier? Because he’s angry about the fallout, or that I didn’t call Grandma, or just doesn’t want any gifts now that the memorial allegedly got cancelled? I’m also not on talking terms with my mom after she bashed on basically everything important to me, so maybe that’s related? Thank you for any advice or support.

My girlfriend knows this. My girlfriend, who I live with, likes junk food a lot. I do not enjoy fast food much, but don’t mind getting it with her every once in a while here and there. For the past week, I’ve planned a whole cadre of fun dinners to cook for her at home while managing to stay on a budget, since money is tight right now. She knows this. 

However, every single night, she’s whined (sometimes jokingly, often not) about wanting Taco Bell or some other fast food that is outside of my spending range and not something I want, or how she’s miserable because she doesn’t have any wine and wants me to go buy some for us. 

This might sound silly or childish, but it’s hurting my feelings a lot. She knows that I love cooking and that I love doing things like this for her, and that I’m so stressed about money that I sat up crying from the stress earlier this week. I’ve brought this up and it’s always “it has nothing to do with you, I just like junk food. You know this. Stop taking it so personally.” Even when I, in the most gentle and amicable tone ever, say “hey, when you do things like this, it makes me feel unappreciated and frankly hurts my feelings a bit.” The closest I’ve gotten to an apology is either an “okay!! I’m sorry!!” without a drop of apology in her tone and all annoyance like I’m riding her on something ridiculous, or a pouty, withdrawn apology, which leads to her moping about how I made her feel until I sit and comfort her for an hour. I’ve already caved and just gotten her fast food twice this week and had to throw out spoiled ingredients that I bought. 

I told her that I was drawing a line and under no circumstances buying from out again for at least another week and made it abundantly clear that this hurts my feelings, and she has still brought it up. 

I compared her dismissing my hurt feelings as “it isn’t personal, don’t make it about you” to if I saw another girl and started commenting on her body and various things that I like that my girlfriend can’t give me and if she would (justifiably) get angry or upset about it, dismiss her with “well it isn’t about you, I just like (insert bodily feature). You know this. Don’t take everything so personally.” She tried to disagree but more or less admitted that I was right. Regardless, she continues to do this every day of the week when I try to prepare a fun dinner for us and makes me feel like a goddamn crazy person and like the conversation, where I tried to be emotionally mature and open about how she makes me feel when she does this, never happened. 

The worst thing is that there will be times were I will sit down, pour my heart out, try to have a dialogue, and invite her to talk or at the very, very least, give some acknowledgment to what I’m saying. Even just an “okay”. Instead I get her staring at nothing for five minutes in silence as I beg her to say something back to me, followed by the first words out of her mouth being a completely unrelated conversation starter or topic.

I really valued her as a person but I ultimately left her due to my drug addiction. Now a year and some later with 9 months of sobriety (2/22/22) felt ready to rekindle our spark. About a month ago she said she wasn't ready for a label. Her reasoning was she wanted me on the chase and was scared I would act like my old self if we had a label.

        After a month of our dynamic she had finally asked me to be her girlfriend. Well I confronted her about something she said. She gave me more info about the real situation she said was a joke saying that they never slept together. But then I remembered she had lost her corset that night. She said it must be at her friends house. However she told me she only dropped them off. She tried to lie but after her acting weird I told her I didnt believe her. She then admitted to sleeping with someone right after we became exclusive. She tried deflecting pleading and spent the whole day crying after I found out.

       My problem is that I do really like this girl, but I dont think cheating is ok. Although she was the one who wanted to be exclusive to eachother. Fml. Shes being extra nice she really wants me. At least thats how it seems. Idk can some people more mature than me give me options on navigating the situation and moving forward. Im lost and lovesick. Even though we had no labels, I still dont think ill trust her due to my dating experience in the past. She really seemed kind genuine and loving.

When W first joined, he gelled with the team very quickly. Within a few weeks he was already cracking jokes with the seniors and completing his milestones above and beyond. Frankly I was surprised how well he was doing.

He really showed his mettle during one of the companies busiest time periods last year. It was end of quarter so the company was rushing to close contracts and maintain renewals.

My company builds software for clients. Our software is highly modular - meaning that if the base image does not fit a client's specific use case, our engineers can design and add functionality and features to the software that fits more in line with what the client needs. Meaning we tailor our software to each individual company use case. My company has a division of people we call ""Customer Success Managers (CSM for short)"" whose job is to basically help the customer whom purchase our software learn how to use it + handle any of their requests/complaints. i.e. they guide the client to success.

If there are any bugs in the software or if a client wanted something new implemented, the CSM will submit a ticket to the engineering team and one of us can handle it. Usually these types of tickets are handled on a case by case basis, with priority usually reliant on which company pays us more\~

This CSM came to us mid to late last year, a young woman, in tears because she had gotten off the phone with a particularly nasty client who kept changing their requirements at the last minute and then blaming her when nothing was being done fast enough for them. The client threatened to cancel their contract by the end of the quarter if we didn't meet their unreasonable demands,  so she came to me and asked if there was anything my team could do to help.  I really wanted to help but we were severely backlogged with the end of the quarter rush, so I told her to submit a ticket and we'll get to it as soon as possible. You could see the disappointment in her eyes as she walked away but she understood.

Now as the manager, I have regular 1-1s with my team members just to catch up and adjust milestones. As the quarter was winding down and people were running around finishing last minute projects, W and I got in a meeting to discuss his projects and while talking he offhandedly mentioned that he finished the CSM's ticket. When I asked him why he did it when there were higher priority queued tasks in our bucket, he mentioned that the customer's requirement was similar to another customer he was already working on so he figured he could handle both simultaneously (I'm dumbing it down here since no two customer use case is ever the same). I knew though that W worked hard on this. I actually can't stress enough how difficult it must have been to juggle two separate client architecture within the same time period, but I never once saw W complain or change his outward demeanor. Keep in mind, he didn't know that she was stressing out about this, she only came to me. so he just did it simply because he wanted to.

While talking to him, I thought to myself, ""Holy hell, where did I find this kid."" This wasn't our first 1-1 either, thanks to my manager's privilege I got to talk with all my team members and learn about them bit by bit. Well over the past year, I got to learn some interesting things about W.

\- His parents were refugees

\- He grew up dirt poor

\- His parents never got an education so they really pushed him to learn as much as he could when given the opportunity.

\- He has a younger brother whom he practically raised himself because his parents don't speak English and were always busy trying to put food on the table.

\- His emotional intelligence is disturbing (in a good way).  The kid picks up on the tiniest of things.

After our meeting, I went to the young woman's desk and gave her the good news to give back to her client. You could palpably see her face light up, like the sun came out after 3 days of constant down pouring. Before I could finish giving the good news, she kept thanking me for taking care of it but I told her it was W who actually helped her.

In the next week, while W and I were at our desks working, she came over and handed W a gift. It was a nice gift -  some cookies, a sweater and a mug. I smiled inwardly to myself and went back to looking at my screen. I heard some snatches of the conversation between them - W said thank you, some small talk and then she asked if W wanted to go get a drink after work. Now I have no problems with inter-office relationships, they're not even in the same team, so I say let the young-ins have their fun. While pointedly trying to ignore their conversation, it came as a surprise when W rejected her. He said he was busy today and maybe some other time. I get it, he must have been wiped out and needed some rest.

Well word of what W did for the CSM quickly made it across the company. The CSM team loves to gossip since their whole job is talking to clients and looking to appease them.  (Think of highschool jocks but more mature and grownup with responsibilities). They also work very closely with Sales. Apparently his work saved the client and they were happy with the product which in turn made the customer facing teams happy.

W quickly became a company celebrity. With the CSMs and Sales shouting at him from across the office, ""you da man!"", ""beast!"", etc. Even the VP took him out to him lunch to thank him!

Fast forward a few weeks and we're out with drinks with the team. Some of the CSMs and sales folks tagged along, The CSM who W helped was also there. When we got to the bar, everyone ordered some drinks, stood around and made small talk or watched what was on the TV. I was talking with W when the young lady approached our table. I could see she wanted to spend some time alone so they could talk, but here is where things got weird. It looked like W made an excuse not to be alone with her, whether it be talking within earshot of some co workers, staying near the group or never giving her an In. In the end, he left early saying he had to go pick up his brother from school.

I felt bad for the her but I figured she could sense he wasn't interested and that was that. Now I don't think he disliked her - whenever they are in the office, he would joke around with her, make small talk and talk like friends do. He even got her a return gift to thank her for her gift. He would just always keep a comfortable distance between them. He wasn't a shy either - in fact I've seen him multiple times get in debates with other team members on best practices with implementations or act rambunctiously at company parties.

But over the next few months, I began to notice some odd behavior from W. During company parties, retreats, or team outings, it looked like W actively avoided being alone with other people. I noticed while the other young men in our team were out flirting or mingling with other people, W always seemed to only hang out in crowds.

For example, during a company retreat - a woman approached him and started flirting with him. As they were talking, she took a few steps closer and he, very casually, took a few steps back to the point that if he were to stick his arms out in front of him at full length with fingers splayed, it wouldn't even reach her.  The look on her face when he did that actually made me stifle a chuckle since that was the first time I've seen someone do that.

At this point I should mention that W has a pleasant demeanor. He's a 25 year old man in the prime of his life, works out regularly, dresses professionally, and is always amicable when speaking with others.  He is pleasant to be around, I should know from all the 1-1s we have.

I began to notice this sporadically over the next months, W never seemed to want to be alone with other people. He always stayed in crowds if he could help it. Whenever people invited him out, he only accepted if it looked like a group setting. And to get out of 1-1 settings, he used his younger brother as an excuse to leave parties early or reject invitations.

I started to get nervous and think that maybe he hated our 1-1 too but he never seemed to act uncomfortable when we're alone in a meeting room or when we get morning coffee. I appreciate him enough that I wouldn't want to make him uncomfortable if I could help it.

So my question is: What would cause this type of behavior? Should I even bring it up or should I let sleeping dogs lie? If I do bring it up and that causes him to change who is, then that would make me feel bad. 

I fear that if he keeps acting like this, eventually other people will start to notice and then ostracize him or unsavory rumors will spread. And if he feels uncomfortable because people start treating him differently then he will leave and that would be a huge blow to the team.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7584135,public,self,I'm(47M) worried about my co-worker(25M) and his social acumen,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yywub2/im47m_worried_about_my_coworker25m_and_his_social/,all_ads,6,,,

I say technically because he goes home to his place every week, but he's at my place most of the week (around 5-6 days a week). It started out as a weekly visit and staying the night thing, but we decided we wanted to stay together often since our places are a bit far from each other. It was cool and all, well, until the fatigue from the mental load kicks in.

It's *my* place of course, so it means *I* have to manage everything right? right??? For an overnight stay sure, maybe, but come on he's here most of the week. I just want him to carry his load. If I don't cook because of work, we will not have lunch or even dinner, and he'll go and ask me ""Babe where's our food? Aren't you hungry?""

I just try and find ways to just order out as I don't always have time to cook, but it's honestly draining my pockets. My salary can't afford the cost of living of two people. He doesn't even offer to pay for grocery. Well he's given me like what $10? Saying that's all he could afford to give me and when I order food so *we* can have food to eat, he just goes ""Thanks for the treat babe""

On his defense though, I have met his mother, and observed his upbringing and she did not raise this man to have the proper skills to think of things like these, so I don't think he wasn't raised to be aware of these things. His siblings are kinda the same. One time their mom went on vacation for a couple of days and no one even cooked or did chores. If I didn't cook for them, they would have survived off of toast for days. Kinda felt like the mom was like lol they're your problem now.

But, that's no excuse.

I've been paying 100% of our dates as well. I'm tired. I'm really tired. I feel like I was given a responsibility I never asked for.

I am legitimately confused here. I am also new to this so it is a little long. Sorry guys!

I (26F) am dating to find a long-term partner. I'm not one for getting into it for the physical side of things. He (31M) and I were set up 1.5 weeks ago by a mutual friend. I knew he was leaving town for a new contract (travel nurse), but I was super interested in him and he seemed to be the same after exchanging pictures. We met a few days later, on a Wednesday, and hit it off. He even mentioned during the date that he would be willing to fly back and forth for a relationship and similar things, so I took that as a green light to continue forward. 

I invited him to a game night with friends on Sunday and everyone said he was looking at me ""with wonder."" They all mentioned they could tell he liked me. We went to my apartment, and after an hour or so, we started to make out. It was totally against my character, but I had never had such strong chemistry with someone before. Suddenly he stops and mentions he wants to be clear he doesn't want a long-distance relationship with anyone due to past experiences. I was instantly confused due to his previous comments.

After talking about his reasoning (he feels you can't build a great connection that way, and we will only have two weeks to know each other in person before), I decided I was ok with a fling, and we made out again. I am a huge boundary person and had every intention of not pressing the issue. After a few hours, we called it a night (no sex, we both want to save it for marriage). He told me that he most likely wouldn't see me for a week. I was a little bummed, but I went with it.

The next day he reaches out and tells me he is free Tuesday night, and  I agree to meet up. Then he says we should have a study date Wed (I'm in grad school, and he had paperwork for the new contract). I have a conservative background, but I thought this was more time with me than the ""flings"" I have heard people talk about. Long story short, we meet up Tues for dinner and a movie/make-out at his place. Then, dinner, studying, ice cream, movie, and more make out on Wed. The combined time together for those two days is 17+ hours.

There are pre-existing plans for both of us this weekend, but he wants to see me Sunday evening and potentially Monday and Tuesday. He leaves town Wednesday.

This is where I am baffled. He wants to spend all this time together and seems to be trying to get to know me on an emotional level. He often tells me that he wishes we had met earlier in his current contract, that if he could extend his current contract longer, he would (spend more time with me), and that he is super interested in a relationship. When we are apart, he responds quickly to my texts. Then he has moments where he suddenly clarifies he doesn't want a relationship and starts acting aloof. He has mentioned that he may try to pick up a contract in my location in the spring. However, he doesn't want to text much while he is gone and wants us to see other people. We agreed to let the other know if we get into a relationship.

I understand his new contract is in place, and I don't want to change that. I also entered this thinking it was a fling, but it doesn't feel very fling-like to me at this point. I have feelings for him and would like to give this a shot. My friends want me to confront him on Tuesday because they feel he is also falling for me due to his comments and how he acts. However, I know real life is rarely a cheesy romance movie/chick flick. I want to respect his boundary, but I don't know if he is really respecting them himself at this point.

It was an abusive relationship and I'm happy I got out when I did, but I'm now incredibly wary of relationships and commitment because of it.

It honestly started off as a hookup and I thought nothing more of it. I figured once he left (he's military based out of state) that we wouldn't really talk and was kind of surprised when he kept continuing to talk to me. At the time I really wasn't ready for a relationship since the breakup had happened in January and it hadn't even been a full six months.

Posting on my throwaway account for obvious reasons.

A couple of months ago I found out that my father who is married to my mother (30+ years marriage) has been cheating on her for 6 years. 

Mom and dad have had 2 children together (me and my brother) and my father also helped my mom raise her 2 children from a previous marriage and 2 adopted babies. 6 of us in total, all quite close despite being a little bit spread out geographically.  

…So to say that this news came as a shock is a gross understatement. It has ruined my mother who has only ever worked her ass off for the family, and for her marriage. I feel for her the most even though we are all hurting so deeply in side. 

My mother has fought through the most extreme circumstances like being raped as a child, her first marriage being arranged by her parents and the man almost killing her, leaving her second marriage to an abusive alcoholic and raising 4 children out of wed lock, being pulled out of school aged 11 to work for her parents who couldn’t speak English in an English speaking country and therefore keeping a whole family afloat with zero high school education, losing all of her closest friends to cancer. 
I can’t begin to fathom how one person has been faced with so much adversity in a single life time. 

Mom has always been our rock and carried us through hard times with so much f*cking resilience and care. How on earth did she come to deserve this?

My mum somehow managed to track the woman down and asked her to meet for coffee despite being traumatised by the mess. She felt she needed some answers. The woman, 30 years my mother’s junior, met up with my mother and acted  in complete in denial. You might wonder how my family knew for a fact dad was cheating. My brother found pictures and messages in dads phone that had been exchanged between them dating back 6 years, so we all had reciepts. Turns out she is married with children also (3), and this affair actually started shortly after she gave birth to her youngest. The woman showed up to the cafe in head to toe designer clothes, wearing sunglasses and a flashy handbag acting like she owned the place. Very cocky and guiltless.  Imagine my mother who has never wanted to spend a single penny on herself showing up in her old —comparatively raggedy— clothes and feeling like trash after her week from hell and having to face this woman. She showed ZERO sympathy, and took no responsibility for her actions despite how unaggressive and reasonable my mother was in confronting her. During this meeting she told my mom that my she was surprised because my father had described my mother as a raging alcoholic who treats him like dirt and the only reason they are together is because of us children. Apparently dad also had her believe that he was a wealthy millionaire and that my mom is a gold digger. None of which is true. In fact, my mom is the reason that my father had any chance of a career when he migrated to this country as she has been business minded and hardworking all her life. 

So my mother, still needing answers and wanting to talk to the woman’s husband, got in touch with a private investigator. They found out that she is from China and her husband lives there most of the time. She doesn’t work and she lives off of the (apparently dodgy) money her husband sends her from overseas. The husband is very hard to get hold of, as many people are that operate in that area of dodgy earnings. 

My mom inherently feels that because she didn’t get so much as an apology or even confession from this woman, that she needs a way to make sure this doesn’t happen again as well as having some kind of retribution. She thought getting in touch with the woman’s husband in China might help, and after all he has the right to know what’s been going on for the past 6 years. 

We have all told mom to leave him and fuck whatever losses may happen with a divorce, to put herself first, but she has other agendas. 
She says she’s ‘too old’ to start again, and ‘doesn’t want to be a burden on us children’ if she were to move in with one of us. She’s also weary that if she leaves, their business will fail and they will lose even more. Dad is insisting it will never happen again and Blah Blah Blah 

Us children have cut dad out as much as we possibly can despite mom wanting to stay together with him. I am hurting so much for this I will likely need therapy for the first time in my life. 
I haven’t spoken or replied to his messages since I found out, and he’s apparently at home crying to mom about it all the time. Fuck him! 
My sisters, as protective and angry as they are want some kind of revenge. Loving our mother as much as we do and knowing how hurtful it is to be cheated on, we don’t want this nasty bitch to feel as though she can get away with this! Why should there be zero repercussions when she played a big part in destroying our family and my mother’s mental health?

I would love any ideas on how I can help my mother through this hard time (keeping in mind I am overseas so cannot be with her physically) and maybe some way of seeking revenge on this woman / tips on finding her husband? If anyone has any tips or stories from their own experiences I would really appreciate hearing from you.

My(19M) gf(19F) and I have been together for a year now and her best friend (18M) has always bothered me. He seems like he's always trying to get intimate with her (hugs her out of nowhere, wraps his arm around her). 

Then I found out he likes her, she told me. My gf said that she obviously rejected him, and then he stopped talking to her for a while (about 2 weeks), he would just ignore her and pretend she didn't exist. But then, out of nowhere, he texted my gf saying that he missed talking to her, and everything came back to normal, my girlfriend started hanging around with him again, and didn't seem bothered, at all, by the fact that he just ignored her for 2 weeks straight.

Now, he clearly hasn't moved on (I just can't wrap my head around the fact that someone can move on a person they loved for so long in 2 weeks and he still shows signs) and it's making me uncomfortable.

I (30sF) have a situation that is either ideal or has the potential to become incredibly messy and I really need your wisdom about it. 

Very long story short: I screwed things up badly with my ex thanks to some pretty serious unresolved childhood trauma that manifested in a bunch of unhealthy and toxic ways. 

When my ex became my ex, the grief was unbearable. A big part of this was the anger and frustration of knowing that losing him was because of how I allowed my trauma to continue to impact my behaviour. I made a promise to myself that I would not go down a relationship path with my ex or with anyone until I put some serious work in on myself to resolve the traumas that sabotaged my relationship. 

I am still completely in love with my ex and it is my ultimate hope that my ex and I will find our way back together when the time is right. 

Over the past year, I have worked HARD to heal both in therapy and on my own. I’ve made a lot of progress and I am getting closer to being relationship ready but I am still not there yet. 

I am really lucky to have good people around me who have been cheering me on all along the way. But, I’m lonely.  

A couple of months ago, I met a guy (30sM) through a mutual friend and he took an immediate interest in me. I was very upfront with him: I am in love with my ex who I hope/plan to get back together with. I am not yet ready to pursue things with my ex because I am working on myself and I am not interested in a relationship right now. 

This did not seem to bother him and he told me that he was also not interested in pursuing a relationship with anyone due to some things in his own life. Our conversation continued before he started asking to see me. I was very uncomfortable with this given my circumstances but eventually agreed so I could feel things out and respond accordingly. 

I explained again that night that I’m in love with my ex and that I’m working on myself and relationships are not in the cards for me right now. We also talked about him and his reasons for feeling the same. But we ended up making out in what we agreed was a friends with benefits sort of thing. 

Things progressed quickly to us pursuing a sexual relationship which has been surprisingly fantastic. We have solid chemistry, great sex and it has just been a lot of fun. Having sex after all the work I’ve been doing on myself has also helped me to feel really good in my own body. All in all, I feel like whatever this is, it's a good thing for me. 

I really and truly genuinely like this guy but I’m not in love with him and I never will be. Beyond the fact that I’m in love with my ex and not ready for a relationship, there are a number of major compatibility issues and there is absolutely no future for us. This should be a non-issue given that as I have stated: I do not want a relationship with him and he claims to not want one with me either. 

But...he also does things that make me nervous that he’s playing some sort of long game and hoping to eventually change my mind. For example: he really likes cuddling with me and holds my hand all the time. I don’t mind these things at all. But it makes me nervous because I've never known a guy to do that outside of pursuing a relationship. 

Our mutual friend has known him for years and told me that when he says he’s not interested in pursuing a relationship, it is not a line and that he means it. He has also told me things that make me confident that I can trust him and he’s not going to try to relationship me. Also, when we have sex it’s intense and passionate but it is definitely sex. No one is making love. 

But his behaviour is the complete opposite to every other guy that I’ve ever known who has claimed he didn’t want a relationship. So, I can’t help but still be nervous. Is it possible he just wants a girlfriend experience?

I don’t really date or anything like that, and I hardly prioritize such things over work at the moment,  so situations like this are rare for me. I became friends with her and her other coworkers who are also her friends over a short period. Anyway, about a month later and I finally get the nerve to ask her out. She rejects me, albeit softly, saying she doesn’t really hang out with coworkers. I take my lumps and chalk it up to a “oh well, what can you do?”

I initially remain distant until I believe she notices that I’m becoming such and I step in just to make sure she knows I’m not giving her the cold shoulder or anything, but just avoiding awkwardness. She laughs and we get along just fine and make jokes. A few days later of her and I’s friends comes up to me and teases me that I asked her out, stating “yeah, she just doesn’t like anybody.” I kind of felt taken aback that she knew because I had not told anyone so obviously she told her friends. I approached her and asked her why she was telling everyone I asked her out, not as an interrogation but rather a, “haha I got you.”

Fast forward a few more months and we are talking every day. Playful teasing and workplace gossip. She’s always complaining she never gets to work with me (it’s a large department). Things are going great and I feel like what the hell maybe I should ask her out again. “She’s very shy and introverted, maybe she just wanted time to think.” Until today when I became very confused.

I saw her leaving her vehicle with another guy who works at the company and I never felt a harder drop in the gut in all of my life. It’s not my business but I really like this girl and it just hurts so much to think I had been played. I even asked her later if she was seeing him and she confirmed. I told her that I didn’t know and I would’ve asked her out again if I’d had time. She again reiterated that she didn’t want to date coworkers because of what could happen when things go bad and told me maybe when she ends up quitting. She’s very sweet and I know she wouldn’t do anything like that maliciously, but my self-worth has absolutely shattered into pieces and I’m having a hard time right now. I don’t feel lied to, but I’m just upset with myself for holding onto strings I should’ve let fray. 

I’m a decently attractive guy so I don’t believe that was the issue, and I normally have tons of confidence and people tend to tell me I’m great at talking and relating to others.

I guess my question is how I’m supposed to pick myself back up after a fall like that when I have to work with this person and see this every day. I left work early because I was having issues paying attention and people were noticing I was off. I wear my heart on my sleeve and the job truly is nothing to me so I almost feel as if I should distance myself from this before I make a bigger fool of myself. I just would like to rewind time back 8 months.

I love it!! I have a lot of freedom and I love my coworkers... Except one. I work with 3 people. My boss (M60) J, my trainer/coworker (F60) P, and F (M 35). We work in a small office inside of a huge building, so its just us 4 all the time. F, has autism. At first I thought he was just quirky, but then things started to get weird and annoying very quickly. Hes quiet and never says anything about his life, he shows literally 0 emotion. Despite us not knowing a single thing about him, he distinctly remembers details about us (like the areas we live at, for example) and only talks analytically. Like, me and P could be talking about how Wendy's is better than McDonald's because they have better fries and he'll suddenly interrupt like ""OH BUT IF WENDYS IS BETTER THAN WHY DOES MCDONALDS HAVE MORE CUSTOMERS, I GUESS THAT DOESNT MAKE SENSE, THEY OPENED AROUND THE SAME TIME TOOO, BUT..."" and its the driest stuff I've ever heard. He also hoards gas station cups and has dirty, bloody tissues stuffed in his desk drawers.

Anyways, a couple weeks ago, P and F were alone in the office because me and J called in. She told me that while they were alone, she turned around in her chair just in time to see a camera flash coming from over a shelf. F was hiding behind a shelf, and all she could see was his arm and the camera he had just taken a picture of her with. He said it was because he liked the cup on her desk and she was like, what? Then why wouldn't you just ask for it instead of hiding and taking a picture of the back of my head?? And he didn't say anything at all. She told him to delete the picture and he said okay and that was that. I was like, shouldn't we report this? And she didn't want to (she feels bad because he's autistic) so I respected her wishes. He sits across from me, our backs face each other. Who KNOWS how many times he could have taken pics of me from behind without me knowing? I got a mirror since that day so I can see him behind me. He does weird stuff but not sus enough to say anything. 

Today, me and P were talking, and out of the corner of my eye I watched him pull out a camera and start taking pictures of outside. He held it up way above his head so he couldn't even see what he was taking pictures of. I was livid, I didn't realize he still had the cameras here. I told Pam and said I HAVE to say something, its so inappropriate for him to have cameras here and he has 2. So I sat down and told him ""Hey, these cameras make us uncomfortable. I'm not okay with this at all. You need to take those home and if I see them here again I'm taking this J."" His response was ""Oh, I didn't know it made you uncomfortable, okay."" And that was it. He still has the cameras on his desk and I heard him unzip one earlier and he walked away. I was so livid.

Should I just go to my boss NOW? Because I feel really uncomfortable. I'm glad I got it all out, but I hate sitting across from him anyways and he's just a temp here so they could terminate his contract if he fucked up. He doesn't fit the work culture at all. I have nothing against autism, I'm neurodivergent, hes just been creepy as fuck. P also learned that he has only had temp jobs for the last 10 years, and this is his first full time job.

My (25F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been together for a few months now. We don’t live together, but we’ve started staying at each other’s places more (1-2 times/week). The thing is, I prefer to sleep naked. I just find it more comfortable and I have a lot of trouble falling/staying asleep in any kind of pajamas. I’ve been doing it since my teens, and it doesn’t feel weird to me at all to be naked in that context. BUT, it’s different when I’m with my bf. He usually wears shorts/sweatpants and a tshirt, and it makes me feel awkward to sleep with him. I feel sort of exposed and on display when it’s just me. I told him how I was feeling and asked if he’d try sleeping naked to make it sort of more equal, and he said no. When I asked why, he literally said there was no reason, he just didn’t want to.

I’m a 24(M) she is 21(F). At first what I really attracted to me was that she was really silly and fun like me (likes to smoke and drink chill). I was really close with her could talk about anything it was like I knew her all my life it was really nice. But what I wasn’t aware of was that she was engaged just last November, I got with her in March but her ex was clearly still on her mind. I did not realize this till later when I saw she was still talking to him.

The first time I caught her texting him was in May, then again I caught her in june, then July, and August. Mind you the dude is outta state in Chicago but she would still call him and text him after she told me she wouldn’t do that anymore.

Then about a month ago I was at a party and got really hungover but I was out all day till the night and I had to give my girlfriend some keys I had but she wouldn’t let me go upstairs. I thought she was mad by what happened at the party but it turns out she had her Ex upstairs and then the next day too because he apparently left his wallet, I found out because she let me use her phone and I saw the pictures on her phone. The dude was wearing my PJ’s, she insists that she didn’t cheat on me but I would be a fool not to believe that .

After that happened in october I left her immediately but she kept calling me telling me to get my things and that she has to talk to me, we kind of made up but all of this is on my mind, I know she cheated on me. She also always brings up her ex one way or another talking about chicago or the times she was living there with him being a house wife.

Recently, (today actually) i saw a letter she wrote in August after I caught her talking to her ex , she texted him the day after we got back together

We started dating in the last year of highschool and it was magic. She came out of nowhere and ripped me out of my shell. My life went from sad and boring to something I previously thought a fantasy. Every single day after school/work we would meet up and go on adventures and live. My life was an actual movie it felt. 

This went on for a few years into college and my life was perfect. She was spontaneous, loving, kind, eccentric. Then everything slowly began to change. She had some medical issues that I won't go into and it seemed to mess up her hormones. We went from having sex almost every day to maybe once a month. Her sweetness, her reassurances, her flirting, it all disappeared. The niceness was replaced by anger and frustration and we constantly fight and argue. We stopped doing things and going out.

Despite this, I still love her and will do anything for her. I understand that nothing ever stays the same, but I barely recognize her as the same person she used to be. She is still strong and passionate and I love her for it. But there is almost nothing between us. We are pretty much just roommates. I hear stories of this happening all of the time but we are in our early twenties. 

I am still hopelessly and desperate in love with a version of her that no longer exists. A love that I can't let go of. Sometimes I think it's gone and that she has completely changed but I will see a flash of who she once was and I'm hooked all over again. And then we are back to arguing and just existing in the same space as one another. And then it happens again. 

I constantly feel like an asshole for longing for a version of her different than the way she currently is. I feel alone because the person I shared my entire being with does not exist anymore. And then I again feel like an asshole for thinking she doesn't exist when she's right there. 

I don't know what to do. I can't break up with her; I love her too much. But I don't know how much longer I can be so lonely while being in a relationship. I feel like I can't talk to her about it because she will either completely shut down, have a mental breakdown, or blame me. I wouldn't even know where to start without coming off like a terrible person. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Her(33F) Fiance died 18 months ago and we met just after that time. I (34M) met her shortly after and we knew each other in a professional setting for a year and decided to go out. We both we're healing from past trauma so when we met we both weren't in a good spot to date. 

We found we were so similar and our viewpoints on life and values we're eerily similar. We enjoyed the same things so naturally when we we're in a better spot we went out and holy cow we connected hard, fast and with so much ease. I don't know my beliefs but reading about twin flames feels spot on to how well we just vibe and work. Unlike anything I've ever experienced and she said the same about her feelings towards me. And our dating experience has been a dream relationship. She's so perfect and fits me so well. We never fight and are incredibly sweet to each other and supportive during even intense conversations. We both came from pretty toxic relationships. I was on and off with a narcissist for 2 years who kind of messed me up. And we had a child that died at 4mos old. Her ex was borderline and very emotionally manipulative and abusive. With a major drinking problem.

Well a year after her late fiances death I go to her House for the first time and she has pictures of him and her everywhere. Tons of his stuff both in display and boxes. Obviously this was understandable and it didn't bother me. Same with her tattoo of his name on her chest she got after he passed. 

Well as time goes on she never took stuff down until she moved just now and didn't get rid of all of his stuff probably a fair amount. BUT she has this tattoo on her chest and its on the right side. I tried to just ignore it as I want to respect her independence and support all of her decisions. But it literally hurts my heart to see the name and will just kill my mood when I'm intimate. And it eats at me all the time. 

I've tried to process it in a healthy way or do things so it doesn't bother me but nothing seems to work. 

We both are very in tune with each other and she's caught me at vulnerable moments and she knows something is up. So being a good partner she creates a safe space for me to express my feelings. We both are good at this which has helped us both talk about difficult things in our past. 

Anyways she knows i hate both her tattoo on her ring finger but especially the name on the chest. So we have talked about it on more than one occasion and based off her actions she seemed to not want to remove it. I've been trying to figure out how to deal with these emotions and it's hard to see her naked. It just stings my heart everytime i see it and not sure why or how to stop it. 

Last night we had friends over and one of my friends saw her tattoo ring finger and made a comment about us being engaged to which i just said ""nope that was from her ex"" she being very intune knew my energy shifted and she pulled me to the back and said she was sorry she made it awkward for me in front of my friends and that she will go remove the ring. 

This bugged me. Like first time i was upset at her since we'd met. Why were my friends suddenly a good enough reason? And the ring tattoo doesn't honestly bug me that much it's the name on the chest. 

She's a fairly tatted person so she is big on expression and i truly love her more than anything and i want more than anything for her to be herself and support her in everyway. But i just don't know what to do? It stings hard and she knows it. I don't want to lose her in any way but also can't stand the thought of seeing that tattoo daily for the next 30 years. And forcing her by pulling an ultimatum is literally the last thing i want to do. But to breakup over it seems so trivial on top of the fact that I love her deeply and don't want to hurt her in anyway.

I'm not sure if that's how I'm supposed to say that because this is all new to me. We've been dating for 4 months. 

K and their stepdad are super close. Actually I'm not sure if stepdad is the right word, her parents aren't married but have been together for like 10 years. Just to add context K's mom is like a corporate investor or whatever and sometimes is gone for weeks at a time. This hasn't always been the case and is more if a recent thing, like a year or so. 

They do everything together and I do mean everything, including work. He's a copywriter and K has been learning from him for a long time and functions as his personal assistant when he doesn't have writing tasks for them. Aside from work, if he's going out to do something, K is putting whatever they're doing on hold to go with him. If he's working out, so are they. If he's watching TV, they're on the couch next to him (unless I'm around, then they are usually next to me but will occasionally walk over and hug him). It seems like if they could always be around him they would be.

I know this is not quite right because I am out with them pretty often and they spend a decent amount of time at my apartment, but it feels that way.

Their household is very open too both physically and emotionally and it's hard to get used to. They will openly talk about our sex life with him (and their mom too), K says good things. I also know that before our relationship it was common for K to be topless at home because their mom is a nudist and they were raised to be comfortable with nakedness. I dunno if he participated in this but K says he didn't. Since we started dating they said they've stopped going topless at home. I don't mind it I guess because it wasn't my business but it strikes me as weird. 

Anyways apart from all that I'm basically always hearing about the guy. All her stories involve him. I can't remember a single thing she's mentioned to me that didn't include him or a follow-up about him. I constantly hear about what an amazing person he is or whatever and it's just kind of mentally draining making all these comparisons even if they're not being said out loud. If I have IT problems, he can fix it. If I'm not sure about nutrition or fitness, he can help. Gotta change my oil? Have no fear.

I don't know if I'm being crazy or whatever but it feels like there's way more going on than meets the eye and I'm really not sure if I'm being insecure or if I'm on to something.

K is great, don't get me wrong. They are beautiful, smart, crazy sexy, and I have a great time with them. However I'm not sure I can get over this, I can only describe it as obsession or idolization.

We're one year into our relationship and I start to get the feeling my gf isn't honest towards me-

We're in a long distance relationship and we have calls everyday. So, just now she told me about some guy that replied to her Story some time ago and told her she's funny, which is no problem. He texted her again today and asked her if she's into bdsm and if she'd be down for something. It grossed me tf out and I asked her if she could send me his insta so I could confront him about it. I'm not a person that's gonna try to intimidate someone or act violent towards them, not even verbally. She knows I would just tell him that she's my gf, a lesbian and really not interested in any of those things with him. Usually she agrees and gives me their insta, but not this time. She said she already blocked him, so there's no need for that. Few minutes later she tells me he texted her again to tell her she doesn't have to tell him if she doesn't want that. Which is obviously really weird, bc she blocked him. I confronted her and she told me she unblocked him to send me his account. I asked her for it and once again, she said she won't give it to me.

She told me he seemed like an intelligent guy, someone that's respectful and that she doesn't see the need in me texting him. For context: she would've flipped in my position. She'd insult me and the other person, get overly jealous and stuff like that.

I'm 23 years old (female) and, after a series of traumatic, unpredictable situationships, I have found the man of my dreams. He is the most healed, emotionally intelligent, kind man I have ever known. We have so much fun together and I could easily see a happy and healthy future with him.

But then something happened. One of my crazy flings from the past reached out, and it sparked something in me. We were never really together, but there is unfinished business there. The fling and I had a sneaky, sexy relationship, and he always looked at me like I was the hottest, most intoxicating woman he'd ever seen. I miss feeling like that. He also broke my heart many times as he was never looking for a relationship. But now he swears he has gone to therapy, grown, and could be good for me if I'd have him. I shut him down, of course, because I respect my boyfriend and would never want to hurt him.

But since then, I've had a ton of anxiety about my relationship. Would I feel torn and even daydream about leaving him/rekindling with my old flame if he was the one for me? Am I bored because our relationship is healthy and I'm used to the thrill of a toxic dynamic? I feel awful for even posting this.

Let's call them Rob and Sue. We were students at that time and I had recently become single after a 3.5 years relationship. The friendship with Rob was just developing at that time and I didn't even think about if that threesome could affect me nowadays.

I stopped everything sexual for multiple reasons:
- I lost attraction to Sue
- I felt constricted
- I had the impression as there could be more between Rob and Sue

Maybe months later Sue became Robs girlfriend and they have an open relationship since. We stayed good friends and I integrated more and more in their friends group. 

Around 3 years ago I lived for 9 months in a shared house with 5-7 people. Rob and Sue among them. During this time I had a short relationship and the threesome I had with Rob and Sue as well as living together with them became a problem. I couldn't behave the correct way with Rob and Sue present without causing some sort of drama. But the jealousy was a general problem and as I had to learn it (also) had to do with my ex flirting (at least) with others behind my back and lying a lot. So the relationship was all in all super rocky with a lot of problems and it divided before I knew how to proceed with the threesome situation.  

Around 2 years ago, Rob and Sue moved away (approximately 4-5 hours per car). And the shared friends group became my main friends group. With Sue and Rob visiting our city from time to time. 

Lately I am dating someone seriously again, let's call her Alice (28f). We talked very freely about past experiences which included my threesome with Rob and Sue. I don't really know if I had told Alice about it, if I knew it would develop into something serious with her. Because it does make her uncomfortable around Rob and Sue. Which I do understand, I would feel uncomfortable, too. Therefore I don't know if I would want to know...
But she knows and now I have to find a way to deal with it.

It would still be a problem but it wouldn't be that big of a problem if it kept the way it was the last two years. With Rob and Sue visiting maybe 2-4 times per year. But as I was informed by one of my friends of the friends group, Rob and Sue are planning to move to our city again. Not in the next week's but maybe in months or very few years. So they will become a regular part of our friends group again.

I don't know what to do. I am insecure in how to behave with Rob and Sue present, because I don't want to hurt Alice. Which is partly influenced by the drama I experienced with my ex and also influenced by imagining myself in Alice situation. On the other hand I feel a good connection to Rob, Sue and the friends group which I don't want to loose. Is there any chance it might work out or am I kind of doomed by staying in the friends group and by staying in touch, especially with Rob? How can I handle this in an adult manner without hurting Alice, Rob or Sue?

TLDR: I had a MMF threesome and stayed friends / developed friendship with them. I integrated into their friends group. They moved away but might move back in the near future.

Currently we live with their Dad, my Dad-in-law, due to our age and finances. Both my partner and I work food service jobs. I, at a coffee shop and them at a fast food restaurant. When we are at home they don’t do much to help out. They DO take care of their cat, feeding it and changing the litter. 
What they RARELY DO is, washing dishes, washing their laundry, putting away their laundry, cleaning up the kitchen after they use it, taking out trash, cleaning the bathroom, and washing towels. 
Now that’s a long list so for context all of the house cleaning is split between three people, my partner, Dad-in-law, and I. 
All of us work full time, all of us cook, all of us pay rent, all of us make trash.
Dad-in-law and I always do the dishes and same with the towels. I’m the only one who cleans the our bathroom as Dad-in-law doesn’t use it.
And for their laundry for the past three months the only reason they have clothes is because I did their laundry and put it away.
My Dad-in-law and I are tired of doing all of this on our own.
I’ve asked why my partner doesn’t do the dishes even when the dishes are over flowing out of the sink and blocking the coffee maker. 
They say “I work a nine hour day” or “well I do dishes at work”. Each time I hold my tongue and move on. But by their logic I shouldn’t have to clean a single thing, leaving my Dad-in-law to clean everything himself.
My Dad-in-law has asked me to talk to my partner because if he does then my partner will just yell at him and call him a bastard.

Bank statements tell another story, location gets turned off at above 80%, his relationship with another woman, and leaves me on read/hot and cold/evades simple questions. I don't know how to confront him or if I should just leave him because I feel like a clown at this point. Someone help me remove the clown makeup. ):

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** We've been together for seven years. I moved in with him four years ago, but we decided earlier this year I move back to my home country to spend time with family, prepare for life in American, and apply for a visa better suited for me. We do share banking, I left a lot of belongings behind, I still help pay bills/subscriptions, and we share our location with each other.  


**The start:** I don't know where to start, but this is probably where it started rolling. March this year it was his idea for me to leave and close up ties before permanently settling in America with him. Things were going pretty normal in the routine of life and we were always doing things together. After returning back to my home country in May, we talked all the time. He mentioned how the visa we were going to apply for would work and was very excited. He sent pictures of himself to me and made himself available to me. We texted and knew each other's agenda's for the day like as if we were telling each other when we lived together.  


**Getting worried:** At the end of June, he told me he was feeling depressed and he wanted space from me. I told him I will honor his request and I am here for him. It was hard for me because I'm not there to support him. Conversations started dwindling, he started abusing drugs, and ""sleeping"" all day when I can see him gaming or online with a green light and go idle from time to time. He has been SnapChatting (his score went up over 4k when he only sends me streaks) a lot, or playing  games ""alone"". The amount he spends when he gets fast food/takeout is enough for two people and he's been buying things from a local gift/trinket shop. I have no idea what he looks like anymore and he clearly took pictures of me down I noticed from a snap he sent me that showed a wall in the house. He brought up wanting to get tattoos which he has never wanted before. He wanted a band tattoo that he found a week before when he doesn't listen to that genre at all, in fact the very opposite. Then comes to find out it's a favorite of the manager according to Spotify. He chooses what to answer when I text him and if I don't respond to him or answer a phone call (which randomly happens or no planning). His paychecks don't line up with the ""hours"" he's working. He does say ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"" but it's random and I can't send him the same kinds of texts because it's a ""boundary"" now..  


**My reaction to it all:** I haven't confronted him because I am honestly scared. Yes, I'm guilty of keeping tabs on him, but who wouldn't when you have someone you should trust and has never acted this way AND you share money? This has to be more than depression, but I have been going along with accepting he hasn't been telling me the full truth in hopes he would just tell me without saying ""well spending habits say.."" and being crazy. A month ago I've brought up the future and said I would love to visit him for my birthday in February. He got so angry and it was confusing because he left it there. Every conversation is one sided now. He gets angry and he would give me the cold shoulder while gaming on the one day of the week we hang out. Those times don't last more than forty minutes. Not a lot of conversation can happen or tell a lot from a short time like that. Lately, it's been worse. He now tells me he's grabbing coffee with this woman before work and they hang out for hours. They're managers together at where they work, too. I've been letting him walk all over me and I just need some help. This has been really rough for me because he was never like this before and I have no one else to talk to  about this because I hang out with his friends (gaming group) that he hasn't hung out with for months. They don't even bother asking or bringing him up around me anymore like something is up. The guy who was his best friend says he hasn't heard from him and assumes everything is good because I'm still around. My fiance was my dream guy, where we were was my dream place, and now it feels like it's all gone. It's been taking a serious toll on me because I don't know what to do when we have built a life together for him to just... do all of this.

I joined the company then and the work was fully remote so our only communication was via Teams. We got along really well, everything went smooth and the vibe was great, but we never discussed anything personal.

Then the office opened and now we go 50/50. The moment I saw him I felt an insane attraction and sparks between us. We’re no longer working in the same team and we don’t interact much with one another but something weird happened:

Basically this guy touches my shoulders, squeezes them, looks into my eyes and smiles as a way of saying hello. He followed me on Instagram and he likes there all of my stories and selfies and occasionally DMs about something but doesn’t pursue the conversation even if I’m trying. Then it’s a period of coldness, he says hi from far away, not touching me at all, barely opening my stories and not liking anything on insta. And then he goes back to showering me with attention, then coldness, then attention, you got the idea. Let’s say he seems interested for one month then next month he takes a break and so on.

The thing is that I found out he’s in a relationship (for 2 years now) so it’s not like I can act on it In any way despite my attraction. I’ve only tried to DM a few times as a reply to his stories and he replies instantly but doesn’t pursue the conversation. He still makes me very confused with this behaviour. My coworkers also told me that before his gf he used to be a huge flirt with the women in the office but he stopped. The thing is that I still have the feeling that he’s low key flirting with me although I might be wrong. It feels weird because it seems like he can’t stop it but also tried to not pursue it.

Do you have any explanation for this? Is he really flirting or is it all in my mind?

My coworker is from the United States, and has moved here to Mexico &amp; is teaching science. He's such a sweet, funny &amp; caring person and it's silly to admit but I get butterflies in my stomach everytime I talk to him. 

I’ve known him for a month already, that's how long he's been teaching here. He actually introduced himself to me, bought me flowers &amp; coffee the first day I met him. He introduced himself because he's going to be helping me with the gardening program I started (I started a garden at the school) and ever since that day, I feel for the man immediately. He's very gentlemanly, and I'm honestly very intimated by him. He's the first American I've ever spoken to in a long time, my english isn't the best &amp; I really appreciate that he is helping me to improve my English (and I'm helping him with his Spanish).

In this whole month, we've kept our contact only at the school. He'll invite me to eat lunch at his classroom, I'll invite him the following day to go to mine - it's pretty much like this. I love to cook, so I sometimes make something delicious for us to eat and he's always compliments my cooking so much (I'm always flattered). We also spend so much time together at the garden after school &amp; we've gotten to know each other much better every single day we see each other. We've flirted with each other every time we're at the garden, but neither of us have made a move to actually take the other on a date.

Honestly, I really like him so much. I’ve never really asked anyone out before. I'm also super nervous to say anything, because he hasn't asked me out. Maybe it's because he doesn't like me the same way, or maybe it's because we work together - it can be anything. Personally I do feel he does like me as well, especially with how he wants to always spend time with me &amp; compliments me. I'm just a little nervous because we work together and I don't want to do anything inappropriate or too sudden that can make him feel uncomfortable.

To summarise it, We had been friendsfor a few months before we got into the relationship, He was previously in a relationship with another girl for a year and a half a few months before me,  which bothered me but he reassured me that it was over and had been over emotionally for a few months before he met me, They no longer talk or have any contact so I let it go and they haven't spoken since. At the beginning of the relationship we had not met each others parents, so we usually just met in college and hungout in town and in our breaks. Tyler and I eventually met each other parents for the rest of the time up until the end of summer, We Spent a lot of time at each other houses, Especially mine, Because he drives, And I do not. And my parents both work long hours and couldn't not take me to his house, I also have dogs, So cant leave them alone for a long period of time if both parents are working, Also on college nights, I am unable to stay at his house due to us living 25 minutes away from each other and my bus pass doesn't cover where he lives, Meaning that i had no way of getting to work and college unless his mum took me home and back to his house afterward everyday, Which i didn't want to happen because it felt rude. So we laid out boundaries, I stay at my house every day of the weekday, He comes over on a Wednesday night, and Soemtimes thursday night and then i stay at his from Friday to Monday morning. However, this is when the issue comes in, I have college and work everyday from monday-friday, I finish at 5 on a Friday and start at 10 on Monday morning, Meaning that i have no time for myself or family. Me and my mum used to be very close prior to me getting into a relationship, We would go to the cinema on a Saturday and then go get dinner, Obvisolly she understood that me getting into  relationship would impact this, But after her and my dads divorce, she has been really down, so I've been wanting to spend more time with her in general, Just for context, When summer hit i spent everyday with Tyler, Either at his house or at mine, And i have grown to feel guilty about this and feeling like i have not been spending enough time with my family. I expressed this to tyler a few months ago at his house, and explained that i wanted to try and make more time with my mum, Girl time if you wish, Like old days. He shut me down completely, saying i was ruining the time at his house because i was always thinking about home and how rough things were for them, He tried to tell me that my mums a 50 odd year old woman and i shouldn't feel bad about growing up and spending time out the house as i spend the weekdays there, I tried to explain that even though I'm home, i don't really get a change to hangout with my mum as she finishes work at 6ish usually and is very tired and not in the mood to go out after an 8 hour shift. He complained about us not having any time for each other and if i cant spare enough time to hangout at his house, We are not going to work, Which in a way, i did understand as i would also be upset if we didn't spend enough time together, However, My mum has been asking to do more with me recently and spend more time with me, Which i am absolutely elated about and am excited for, However these plans usually fall on a Saturday or Sunday when we are both free, Keep in mind it is not every weekend, Only every 3-4 weeks, and tyler doesn't like it, He has started to say that my mum is an issue in our  relationship and she is controlling and babying me, which i cannot stand as i love her and know she has been through a very tough time lately. Next weekend, I am staying at Tylers on the friday night, Going to a family bbq on the Saturday night and then going home on the sunday morning to spend the day with my mum, Tyler is not impressed, and says he is going to be stuck home all day and will be bored, I have told him that that is his own choice and i cant do anything about it. I regret agreeing to the weekend terms as he now uses that as a way to make me feel bad for wanting some time to myself or with my mum stating that its the only time we get to see each other, even though we see each other everyday at college, we argued a lot today and he bought up the fact that if i keep cancelling on him then he going to end the relationship and that he cant be with someone who is acting the way i do, I cant tell if I'm out of hand and if setting those unrealistic boundaries in the first few months of our relationship has set us out for failure.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7583754,public,self,Setting unrealistic boundaries in a relationship early on.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyvlys/setting_unrealistic_boundaries_in_a_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,

I’m unsure if I was clear during our last conversation or if I’m being delusional because I miss him.

When we were together in person everything was perfect, we got on really well and my attraction towards him never changed. It only grew stronger.

The past few months he stopped putting in effort. He stopped making time for me. I was going through a lot, he was there for me on occasion at some of the worst times. He would often disappear at some point without fail.

We’d be having a conversation and he’d just stop responding. This got drastically worse in the last two months before I ended things. I would tell him how his actions affected me. 

I clearly communicated I wanted more contact and how it feels like he’s not there anymore. I asked him directly a few times if he wanted to call it without any animosity. I cared about him a lot and would consider his feelings and emotional well-being. 

I didn’t ask him to change or compromise this is what’s making me think maybe I want clear. He did say something along the lines of “if we don’t speak 24/7 then you don’t want to speak at all” during our last conversation. I said “I want more regular consistent contact”, it’s not a great feeling when someone responds to your messages 3-5 working days later (yes he had no more time for me during the weekends anymore).

Was he sending subtle hints as he slowly moved on? I’m very confused. I still can’t process how he’s able to ignore me, shut me out and even make or accept plans with me just to not communicate with me at all on that day. 

He made suggestion and said we can meet. This confused and hurt me a lot but more if I’m honest. It just proved he had the time, just not for me. It was like he threw me a bone.

Anyone else able to make sense of it?

I’m also trying to see where I went wrong so I don’t make the same mistakes. I thought I was honest, direct and very upfront.

He decided to work for one of the classmates that we had in college, he usually refers to him as his “boss” (22M).

At first I was fine bc it was nice seeing him work after college (a huge milestone for newly-grads). However, they started becoming intensely close even outside of work. I though, maybe it’s just a boss and personal assistant type of relationship. However, it became weird to me that he also has to accompany him during dinner, watching a movie, etc. (after work), personal travels (non-work related), my bf would even watch his boss’ tennis practice, and he would play video games with him after just spending the whole day with him. He would stay the night in his boss’ condo (on several occasions), and sometimes in the same room.

It also became an issue between the boss and his gf because he chose my bf to accompany him in an expensive resort rather than his own gf (which was also non-work related btw). Which would actually happen a lot.

His boss buys him clothes and pays for other expenses (travels, drinking, etc). He also promised to buy him cars and phones. There was even this one instance he asked me if it was okay to ask his boss if he can borrow 1 million, and I said no bc the boss might think weirdly of him.

Other than the financial gain, I think their relationship developed into something intimate. When his boss broke up with his gf, he had to be one call away bc they would have a heart to heart conversation. And when we would fight, he would call his boss regarding our problems to confide with him. When we broke up for a month, he stayed in his boss condominium for a whole straight week bc he was his shoulder to cry on.

The boss’ ex spoke up and she agreed that there was something weird. Regardless, I broke up with him bc even assuming that he wasn’t cheating, it was against my morals to be with someone who uses other people for money regardless of gender.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7583731,public,self,I broke up with my bf for having a weird intimate relationship with his boss,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyvjqr/i_broke_up_with_my_bf_for_having_a_weird_intimate/,all_ads,6,,,

Back when i was literally in 8th grade i briefly dated someone (Jon) for a few months and then we have remained good friends since then. Jon and i used to have a flirtatious vibe and when i was single, he would talk about hypothetical romantic situations etc. Then i started dating my bf and its been strictly respectful since. My bf has indicated in the past that he’s uncomfortable with my friendship with Jon and because of that i have always kept a respectful distance and never crossed any lines.. jon and i would talk over text once every few months maybe. 



Recently i landed a job i had been dreaming of.. and Jon also works there. Instead of my bf congratulating me, he states how Jon and i will be working together and he would appreciate if i didn’t go out with him alone’… which i have NEVER DONE!!! it pissed me off so bad. My achievement got completely overshadowed by this message because i have literally NEVER given him a reason to doubt me EVER! and i kept emphasising that MY behaviour matters more rather than Jons but he kept circling back to this.


I am seething with anger and so upset that even after being loyal, this is the behaviour i have to deal with. 



To support his argument he brought up something i did a year ago: i started to not tell him about my friend plans until the last minute because i felt he would get upset over not being invited or not being prioritised because it was when he was visiting (we are LDR) . I would do that because the friends i was meeting were also long distance friendships and were there for the same time he was. Anyways, he used this instance to say i have acted shady before when they are NOTHING ALIKE!! 



I dont know what to do. We havent talked for a day. I dont feel like talking to him because this is childish behaviour.

When they split, she kept one, and he kept the other one. Everything was okay for a while. The only thing is, my dad and I are allergic (we live with my parents to help them out with rent and such). I can manage my allergies. My dad, not so much. So my GF made the decision to ask her ex if he'd be willing to take the cat, and him and his new girl took her in. I tried telling her that we could try and find someone else to take Mona (the cat). But she insisted because we both knew her ex would blow a gasket if Mona was given to someone else. 

Fast forward several months later my GF gets a screenshot from a mutual friend of her's and her ex's. It was a ""Missing Pet"" post on Facebook. Mona went missing, and was apparently missing for over 2 weeks when we got the screenshot. My GF was devastated. That cat was her world and was so heartbroken when she had to give her up. She always made sure to get anything Mona needed, even if it meant we had to skip out on getting anything we needed. I swear she loved that cat more than she lived me, and I was fine with that. Mona helped her through some dark times. Her ex was an emotionally and financially abusive piece of shit to her. Yet, she still had the grace to be the bigger person and let him take Mona. And what does he do? Loses her. The mutual friend said they left Mona with his new girl's mom when they moved. So they didn't even physically have her when she went missing. They left her behind. And they never said a word to us. We could have gone out and helped look for Mona. And I think that's what kills my GF the most. I know if we still had Mona and anything happened to her, the ex would have been the first to know. And he couldn't even extend the same courtesy. 

She blames herself. She keeps saying that she should have listened to me. And maybe I should have fought harder. My GF is always determined to be the bigger person and have a bigger heart than everyone who was a POS to her. And she says that's what she gets for being nice. It hurts to see her like that. Most days she's fine, but every now and then she'll see a cat video on Tiktok or Facebook where the kitty looks like Mona and she just breaks down. She said ""A piece of her heart is missing"".

We've checked all the shelters and veterinary clinics in our county. And even though this happened a year ago, we still check nowadays just in case Mona pops up somewhere...and we never hear anything. Mona is microchipped, but unfortunately we live in an area where we have alligators and coyotes, and she was lost in a relatively woody/marshy area. So her hope for finding Mona has just been dwindling. 

The ex's girl legit works not even 2 minutes from where we live. Would it have been hard to let us know what happened? 

I want to help her, but I don't know what I can do. We don't have health insurance, otherwise I would have had her in therapy a long time ago. Every time she breaks, I'll hold her and comfort and cry with her. I miss Mona too. The cat was a pain and a priss, but she was sweet and loved everyone she came across. What can I do?
