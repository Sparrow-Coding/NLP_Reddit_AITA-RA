At the hotel, while heading to the main lobby for the breakfast buffet, this stranger man, Mark (\~40M), hopped into the elevator. He started the conversation by asking if I were from town (which would have been weird as I was staying at a hotel; so he was obviously finding a way to start conversation). He came across as flirtatious and found him attractive. I told him I lived in Austria, to which he responded that he currently lived in Germany and said something down the lines of ""hmm... Austria is quite close to Germany"". We talk a bit about the reasons for our traveling; he is from the military and I work as a medical doctor in research. He headed out immediately after we entered the main hall. 

Next morning, coincidentally, we again met in the elevator. I don't exactly recall what we talked about, just that I felt this huge tension between us. The third morning, however, I went down the dining hall quite early as I had to get some work done before meetings. Mark arrived at the main hall \~1hr later but instead of heading out immediately, put his bag on the seat across of me and asked me if he could join for breakfast. I got quite nervous as I am not a huge flirt and am currently in a long term relationship, but accepted. However, after getting his breakfast from the buffet, he decides to sit elsewhere and makes up this excuse of wanting to catch up with German news on the televisions (even though the news displayed was local). After wrapping up my work I stand up and turn around to face him with my ego a little damaged. He also stands up and starts apologizing again; asks me when I was leaving (answer: midnight); what my plans were for the day (answer: work until noon); and tells me he is busy the whole afternoon and night visiting family and friends; asks my name; says goodbye. I was extremely confused at this point. Not only because of the mixed signals he was giving me, but also because I have been (and still am) in a very loving relationship of 10 years and I never had felt this way about someone outside my relationship before. 

I had already checked out in the morning and my flight was leaving at midnight, so I tried enjoying my last couple of hours in town on my own. However, after a jetlag, exhausting extended weekend working, lunch and drinks with colleagues and walking around for a while on my own I was just extremely exhausted. I headed back to the hotel and asked whether I could chill out at the lobby until I had to check in at the airport, which was fine. Had some drinks there, worked on my laptop and chatted with the lobby desk employee, Dave (\~25M).

At around 7 p.m., Mark walks in, sees me, smirks and sits down next to me. We chat a bit about our days. He asks me what my plans are, to which I respons that I don't have any. He smirks again, but then looks a little torn, respons with ""I can't do this I'm sorry"". Again, confused about the situation and kind of wondering what he had in mind as I was just thinking doing drinks together, I tell him that's fine. He repeats and then head off. Dave was spectating this weird encounter and head up to me asking if I was being harassed. I tell him about my encounters with Mark, we joke around a little and he suggests leaving my phone number for Mark, which I did. 

However, during my flight back I realize that leaving my number was a mistake and call the hotel asking them to to throw away the note. The receptionist didn't see a note anymore so I guess Mark has it. He has not contacted me yet and am currently very confused. I discussed the situation with my partner, who is very understanding and doesn't hold a grudge at all. In fact, he says it's only healthy to have such feelings from time to time and doesn't mind me having them if it doesn't change how I feel about him. I don't, but I am thinking about Mark a lot and it is not fair towards my boyfriend, but I feel like I need some explanation and really want to contact Mark and ask him what he wanted from me and why he acted so ambivalent (beside the probably being married; but in that case he probably wouldn't have approached me at all or that frequently).

Things between us have been up and down from the get go.

I would of never thought I’d be going through what I’m going through. In January of this year, I got a call from my gf on a Saturday morning telling me that she needed to talk to me. I told her to come over and so she did. I was expecting her to tell me that she didn’t want to be with me anymore but instead what she told me changed my life and not for the good. She told me that her ex had called her the prior night telling her that he cheated on her while they were together and that the girl that he cheated on her with had herpes… my stomach dropped… my heart sank. I was speechless.. I couldn’t process fast enough what I just heard, she was sobbing telling me to not break up with her and that we could get passed this. I felt betrayed. I felt disgust not just with myself but also with her. I got tested before sleeping with her as I always did before sleeping with someone new but she didn’t. The fact that she didn’t get tested before being with me made me very upset. This was barely 2 months into our relationship, it made me question many things. I wanted to end things right there and then but I didn’t because I felt stuck. I cried myself to sleep for many nights. Dark thoughts in my head asking myself many things like who’s gonna want me knowing I have herpes now?? I feel like spoiled goods. I decided to stay with her because of that. I’m ashamed to tell someone else our dirty little secret. Like how am I seriously gonna tell another woman that I have herpes??? That is so fu*king embarrassing. 

Our relationship has changed over the past few months with arguments getting louder and messier. One thing that I really dislike is that she’s a whole different person when she’s mad, she has a very short fuse. She has hurt our relationship with saying very mean and brutal things to me over the months with a weak apology afterwards saying that she didn’t mean what she said. I’m not perfect either but there’s just things I wouldn’t do or say just to hurt her feelings, like the fact that she gave me an incurable std. 

We have many things in common but we are very different people and we both know that. We had our good times but I’m just done with all the disagreements and fights. I feel stuck. How am I supposed to live my life knowing I have herpes?? How am I supposed to explain this to another woman?? I literally think about this everyday with no answers.

I don’t know if I can post his name as my post got auto-deleted on another page for writing his name (lol). 

I (20F) have been with my bf (19M) for almost 4 years. He’s a good person, and we’ve got a good relationship, and this wasn’t an issue until a couple of months ago. 
I’m a very passionate feminist, and I fight for women’s rights &amp; also mental health (mens and womens) on a daily basis. These things are extremely important to me. When AT started going viral, my bf was on my side with everything, agreeing that AT was an awful person, and that the things he said were outrageous and he deserved to be kicked off social media etc
We then didn’t speak about it for a while once the hype died down because it just didn’t come up for either of us. 
I then noticed that a friend of his (a not very nice friend of his) started sending him AT videos on Instagram, as well as other “male motivation” videos or “masculine mindset” videos which are overall quite misogynist, sexist, and harmful to men and men’s mental health in general. 
I ignored it at first until recently, when my bf was watching some AT videos on his phone, and I asked him to turn it off or put headphones on because frankly, I don’t even want to hear his voice. This sparked an argument which consisted of my bf defending AT, saying things like “he was stripped of his freedom of speech” or “those bad things were taken out of context”, “he didn’t mean it that way”. And when I said AT is a terrible person, all he cared about was asking for specific examples, direct quotes, sources, facts etc that he was then challenging and defending AT on. 

Today, I brought up the issue again. I asked for a mature conversation, and my goal was basically to find out what sort of things my bf did and didn’t agree on. He said he agrees that women and men should have equal rights, he doesn’t agree with any sexism or homophobia or anything. He thinks men can ask for help and show emotion etc. the things that were important to me, he agreed with me on. However, he still insists that AT isn’t a bad person, and he’s going to continue to watch his videos because he agrees with most of what he says. He keeps defending him, saying that the bad things that were said were taken out of context and etc. I just can’t help but worry that him watching AT means he agrees with all these terrible things he says, or that he doesn’t see them being as bad as they are. He still thinks AT is a good person and deserves social media.

At the beginning of September I ran into her while I was out with friends. We got talking, ended up hooking up, and she found out last week that she’s pregnant. We used protection, but she says I’m the only possible father based on the window of conception.  

On Saturday, I asked if she would consider either having an abortion or placing the baby up for adoption.  My reasons being, my mental health, and our financial situations. I have dysthymia (PDD) and major depression that cause severe depressive episodes. Because of this, I have trouble holding down jobs, and barely make enough to support myself. She is not much better off. 

She insists on keeping it. She got very upset that I even suggested otherwise and implied that I’m misogynistic because it’s “not your (my) choice”.  I know, it’s her decision. It’s her body, but realistically, it would be highly irresponsible for us to have a child. I don’t have to be actively involved, but if she does keep the baby, I would not feel right not physically helping out as best I can. 

I feel really stuck. I love kids but don’t want any because of my depression. There are times when I’m quite literally unable to function. As in, I can’t even get out of bed. I have to live with my brother cause I’ll end up starving myself otherwise. I think it would be best for everyone involved if we didn’t keep it. Especially the baby. She and I are exes for a reason, we can’t afford it, I’m depressed and a recovering alcoholic, etc. But she, my friend, and his girlfriend all agree that I’m an asshole for “telling her to have an abortion” because she’s excited about the pregnancy. 

I feel bad for upsetting her, but I don’t think she’s seeing it in the same, realistic light l am. I can’t make her see it the way I do, and I can’t stop her from having the baby.

We were crazy about each other and we were dating for six months when I found out she had a sexual relationship with a guy I had questioned her about numerous times.

Family gave me advice about how young her and I are and kids makes mistakes. I was told to allow her a chance to make things right if she wanted to. She did. 

Long story short, we actually moved passed everything and we’ve been dating for ten months now. She’s been good about fixing the situation as well as she can. She’s acknowledged what she’s done, and has owned up to the mistake. She’s allowed me to express my anger and hurt towards her over the situation unapologetically. I have her passwords to everything. Not because I asked, but because it’s something she just wanted me to have for piece of mind. On top of it all, she treats me like royalty. Although I try she hardly ever lets me do house work, hardly ever lets me touch the steering wheel, gives me everything I want without question. At first I thought she was trying to love bomb me but she’s been consistent for TEN months. Things are perfect. 


I think very highly of myself and this isn’t something Ive always said I’d never allow. 
I never thought I’d be able to look past cheating but I’m young so this was my attempt to find out if I was capable of doing so. Turns out, I’m not. I’m still just as hurt and angry. I’ve forgiven her but I can’t look past the disrespect. No one that cares about me can put me through something like that- let alone for months on end. I just don’t buy it. I’ve left women for smaller offenses and this is just something I can’t seem to move on from so I’m leaving. 

I recently looked through her phone and found messages of her boasting and laughing about playing me to her friends. She swore it wasn’t as malicious as it seemed but I have evidence to prove otherwise and I feel I’m rightfully angry. 

A small part of me wants to get back at her but I refuse to cheat back. I’m an honest and moral person. It’s not in my nature. I have far too much integrity to allow someone to get to me to the point where I act out of character. 

What can I do to get back at her without cheating or doing something petty? Excepting all advice.

I'm not sure what to do.

In August, I caught this happening for the first time. I found an app that you pay to use to watch live cam girls. You can use video, audio, or text, and talk with them. You also pay more if you want them to specifically do things for you.

I freaked out on him. I personally don't mind regular free porn. Porn is okay to watch if its free and if you cant interact with them. But I was very uncomfortable to read the chat messages and think about my boyfriend paying specific girls to do things on camera for him. It's like live prostitution..?

Anywho, in August, we deleted the app and I said please don't use one again. Just watch free porn. He agreed. I was stressed for days because I was unsure whether or not to call it cheating. He has never and would never physically or emotionally cheat. But I cant categorize what this is..

Well, two nights ago, I caught it again. He's lied to me a few times now. Since the end of October, he's spent about $300 using these apps. I know because his credit card company texted him and said he reached his limit. I scrolled through the automated messages and saw all of the transactions he made to these websites and apps. I was sick to my stomach. He did it every time I worked a night shift.

We've talked it through for 2 days now. He vowed on everything that he would never touch it again. This similar situation happened with vaping, where I caught it for the 2nd or 3rd time and confronted him when he said he doesn't do it anymore. He saw how upset I was and he never touched it again since. I've seen him refuse vapes from friends when at weddings or get-togethers. 

I'm not sure what to do. It makes me literally sick and prevents me from eating. It prevents me from wanting to leave him home alone. He said whenever he's idle and bored, he thinks about doing it. He mentioned maybe it's an addiction.

He said he cares about me so much. He cried for hours and almost puked due to feeling so bad. He said from this day on, he's changed, and he will never do it again. 

Any suggestions? I thought maybe a sex therapist? I considered breaking up with him because of him lying to me a few times. But I want to really try working this out. I do. We work so well together.

Any other suggestions other than leaving?

I (20F) and my Ex (20M) were in a relationship for the past 4 years. It also happened to be my first ever relationship. So I had this big interview (it was a big opportunity and could totally change the course of my career) coming up for which I worked my ass off for nearly 2 months. When I finally got the interview mail. I told him the date of my interview and was giving my absolutely best to not let this chance go. 
Then 3 days before my interview I get a message from his best friend (20F, we have good relations with each other) that she heard about our breakup and wants to make sure if I am fine. Saying I was shocked would be an understatement. I confronted him about what was happening and why was his best friend the one to break me this news instead of him. He just said ""I couldn't find any other way. It had to be this way"". Even my best friend (20F, My Ex also had good relations with my best friend) asked him about the reason and he just said that he is confused and dont know what to do.
Whatever the situation may be I gave myself 8 hours to get over this break up and prepare because now this interview was the only thing I had at this point. And thankfully, I cleared it. 
Days passed by and his "" It had to be this way"" turned to ""I was not even sure if I wanted to break up"" And then to ""I never even wanted a break up"". One day I asked him to atleast tell me why he decided make a move through his best friend even if he didn't want to be together and he said that it wasn't intentional. He was thinking of breaking up with me and just to grab her best friend's attention so that they can discuss on this topic, he messaged her ""OP and I broke up"". He thought she will respond with follow up questions, like she usually does but she left him on read and directly messaged me. 
Now my question is he could have explained this at the time when I confronted him itself or maybe when he was saying that he was confused and he never wanted to end things but he didn't. He now says that he made a big mistake and wants to get back together, I refused because I don't know if I will be able to trust him again when he dumped me at such an important stage when I expected him to be there as my strongest support. And to this concern he replied ""I can't promise that it won't happen again, but I do love you very much"" which actually is not helping at all. He thinks I am refusing because I have changed since the time I have gotten the selection mail after that interview. I don't even know what to do at this point. 
Do you think the relationship will work? Even if we do come back together( inclined towards the unlikely side) , How do I make that trust again? My heart says stay for how he made feel, but my brain says leave for how he made me feel.

We are in our early 30s and in a relationship for about a year now. 

In summer we had an issue: he got angry and shouted at me twice within one month when he was drunk. It was the first time this had happened and the reason for the first time was that he got annoyed at a waiter in a restaurant because he didn't want to take his advice on something. When we got home he let his anger out on me when I mentioned that i felt sorry for that waiter because my partner was making fun of the waiter's incapability. 

The second time was a few days later. He was still drunk in the morning and peed on the toilet seat. I then sat in it and told him afterwards what happened and asked him of he could lift the toilet seat when peeing. I was very calm and not angry at him, I talked to him in a normal respectful way. He totally lost it again and yelled at me for like 10 minutes how I am being unfair to him and bitchy etc. 

A few days after that happened I tied to talk to him about it because my point was that I don't tolerate him yelling at me. He was being very defendent and gaslighted me. He said that it would be normal fighting, that it would be my fault because I should have brought these topics up differently, that it wasn't how I said it was AND that he barely remembers anything. So very contradicting statements. I had to tell him four times that I don't tolerate him yelling at me until he agreed to that. 

A few days after that conversation I broke up with him because I didn't like the way he reacted to me having a problem with shouting and also because of the shouting itself. Three days later we talked about it again and he seemed quite apologetic about all of it (but only AFTER I broke up with him).

This happened four months ago. I am unsure about my decision and I am feeling a bit scared of moving in with him. He has been asking me to move in with him for about 6 months already, which I also find strange in such an early stage of a relationship. At first I agreed to it but now after him being verbally abusive towards me I am not sure anymore. 

What I also find strange is that he never criticizes me. Lately I told him that he should tell me when I do something that bothers him so that it doesn't bottle up and create negative feelings towards me. He said he has nothing to criticize. 

What do you think? Do you think this kind of behaviour will show again in thw future? Should I run or try to work on his insecurities with him?

She left him and though I don’t know her side of the story at all, Mark says it’s because she wasn’t ready to settle down and didn’t want the traditional marriage and kids, and he did. 

When we met he was definitely still not 100% over Amanda and I think deep down imagined they might still get back together. They didn’t maintain a friendship as far as I’m aware until our wedding. She posted congratulations on his Instagram posts of the day and they DMed back and forth about the wedding and general life stuff. Every now and again they catch up on social/text and I don’t think there’s anything inappropriate going on but it makes me a little uncomfortable.

However a couple of months back Amanda got engaged. Mark was pretty upset, he didn’t talk about it much but I wonder if it was because she’s now ready to settle down in a way she wasn’t when she was with him. He was pretty down for a couple of weeks, I didn’t push it but I did try and talk to him about it which he shut down.

Now I just found out that he has an invite to Amanda’s wedding in March. He doesn’t have a plus one, but he still really wants to go. He didn’t ask me if he could, he just told me.

We did spend a lot of time together prior, so we haven't faced any big lifestyle adjustments. Still, the move was somewhat stressful, and his family was pretty judgemental about a place we picked (nothing objectively wrong with it, besides it being on a pricier side, but they are very critical about it, even though it is well within our budget). 

The kissing part feels like a minor detail in the grand scheme of things, but at this point I find myself feeling struggling to stay horny, because his kissing is just extremely wet and sloppy. I tried gentle comments, serious talks, step by step instructions, but nothing sticks. Kissing is a major turn on for me, definitely among my top three. On one hand, my boyfriend is very sweet, playful, and definitely looks after me. On the other he can be quite messy, isn't exactly an outdoorsy type, and definitely doesn't try to act sexy. I know that last part it due to his insecurities, rather than ignoring my needs, but there is only so many times I can put on a sexy show for him, to get a shy compliment back. He wants me to be sexually bolder, and go back to how I was when we started dating, but honestly I just feel tired, and have no reason to feel horny or sexy (about him, or myself). 

I definitely have a pattern of picking a partner that feels ""safe"", and then kind of drifting along. On the other hand, maybe wanting someone who is both compatible, and sane, is too much too ask, haaa. We just signed a lease for a year, and given that I have pretty awful sleep anxiety, I don't want to break things off and get back to feeling lonely and anxious most of the days.

My boyfriend stayed over at my family home on thursday night. I woke up before him on the friday and got my sister (9f) ready because my mum left for work.

My wife gave me clear permission/a free pass. I don't know if ""cheated"" is the right word - but it feels like it to me.

&amp;nbsp;

As background, my wife wanted us to move abroad, even if for just a little bit.  We are in our early thirties. Through a great set of circumstances I managed to land a job with unbelievable pay that would bring us halfway across the world exactly where she wanted. Through unfortunately poor circumstances....she had to delay coming with me, so I had to go off on my own. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been in the new country for a little while now on my own, feeling isolated and alone. Don't know anyone here, work too much to have time to meet people, no friends/family/support network anywhere here. My life has been going to work for 12-15+ hours/day and coming home to an empty apartment on my own, and calling my wife to talk for a bit before bed to do it again the next day. My wife gave me permission while I'm on my own to sleep around, but I'm just not that type(had never even hooked up with anyone before her) so I didn't really intend on taking her up on it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up at one point after a very hard day going for a massage and in the middle of it the lady basically asked if I wanted a happy ending. I had never had one, I was feeling touch starved and loneliness got the better of me so I said yes. She started giving me a bj (without putting on a condom!) and I froze up, started crying, feeling disgusted with myself, and how wrong it felt, and asked if I could just please have a normal massage. 

It didn't make me feel less lonely, now my anxiety is through the roof, and all I could think of when she started was I just wish I was with my wife. 

I'm trying to figure out what to do now. If/when I should tell my wife, and how to handle any std concerns. 

&amp;nbsp;

As far as the STD concerns, I am obviously going to get tested but I can't figure out how long to wait since I know theres an incubation period for a lot. I'm freaking out about the possibility of getting an std (even though I know logically it probably isn't too high a risk-single instance of short &lt;1min contact, but it wasn't protected and I wasn't expecting that!) and one of my biggest fears would be getting something and giving it to my wife. I can't find much online about the specific odds or risk, and would be testing regardless but it's consuming my thoughts and I can't stop worrying. I don't know when/how many times I will need to get tested to make sure I'm 100% safe from giving anything to my wife(when I do eventually see her)

&amp;nbsp;

The second part of my worries is I'm trying to figure out when/or **if** I should tell my wife. For the ""when"" piece,  I am thinking I should tell her in person, it feels wrong to tell her over the phone, and she's going to be finally moving here in the near future, so I don't want to make the move more stressful for her. For the ""if"" piece, I know the reflexive answer is that I should tell her, but I don't know if it actually is right here. It feels like it would be getting it off my chest, which is great for me, but I don't know if its better for her or not. Every time we talked and I mentioned how much I missed her and how lonely/touch starved I felt she kept reminding me I have a free pass and I should ""use it while I have the chance"". It ultimately was my stupid decision and choice, I'm an adult and have free will, but I feel like shit now, I want to puke and cry constantly at the thought, and I don't want her to feel like she should regret giving me the pass. I also know her that if I told her, she'd just tell me to not worry so much, that I'm freaking out over nothing. It almost feels like I'd be just telling her for my own sake, which feels even worse right now. If I tell her, should I maybe just bring up that I did use the pass/am getting tested to be safe but not tell her about my freaking out/how its making me feel?

&amp;nbsp;

I also think I want some sort of couple counseling after the dust settles, and I want to *never* have a free pass again. I never want to feel this way again, I never want to feel pressured(I don't blame her, I blame my own impulsive behavior and FOMO) to be with another person. I don't want the option on the table at all, or to even joke about it, I want to block this experience from my mind, pretend it never happened, because I feel like I'm close to a panic attack thinking about it. I don't know how to reconsile feeling like I cheated and violated her trust while knowing she gave me clear permission, is not the jealous type, and genuinely meant it.

&amp;nbsp;

I know the above is quite a lot, but I am wondering if anyone has advice here. 

Does anyone know how bad my risks are from this event/how long I need to wait/how many tests I should take/anything I need to do asap(to reduce risk of something developing)? This is entirely new territory for me, I never slept around when I was younger,  and this is easily the riskiest thing I've ever done.

I went out for a few drinks with a couple of friends the other night. I don’t drink very often anymore so admittedly I did go overboard and I ended up blacking out. I don’t remember getting home, I just have a vague memory of my bf asking me “what’s wrong with you” and “do you have dementia”.
When I woke up the next day, my bf told me I was “acting weird” and he was worried I had been spiked. He said I was telling random lies to him, although when I asked him what lies he advised the following-

1. I said I had messaged him about getting pizza on the way home, when I had actually called him
2. I said I had only had a few drinks

The first “lie” I think would have been just drunk me being confused. The second I can only imagine would have been me feeling like I need to defend myself, especially if he was saying things like “have you got dementia”. Obviously there is no excuse for lying, but this is the extent of the so called weird behaviour I was exhibiting that he said meant I needed to be recorded. 
Anyway he then told me he had recorded me if I felt like I needed proof for anything he was saying. I don’t understand why he would think I would need proof, this has happened once before two years ago where I blacked out and he told me I had basically a mental breakdown, which I didn’t remember the next day. I immediately believed him the last time, as I did this time, because why would he make something like this up why would I ever ask for proof. 
When I said this to him, he then said he actually recorded me for his own safety. Obviously this makes me feel terrible that my own bf would feel threatened by me, so when I asked him if he felt like I would attack him or anything he said no- so what does that mean for his own safety when he didn’t even feel like he was in danger? 
I was clearly upset after he revealed he’d been recording me, I was in a vulnerable state and I honestly feel like my privacy has been violated. That I can’t trust my bf to be around if I’m incapacitated in the same way I know my friends would absolutely never violate my trust like that. Not to mention my friends have never felt unsafe around me, even when I am black out drunk- I checked. 
I told my bf that as much as I am sorry he felt he needed to record me, I do feel violated that he recorded me while I was in such a vulnerable state. He became very defensive and said they were basically just audio recordings as his phone was inside his pocket, but then later on mentioned he got a funny one of me eating pizza- so they weren’t just recordings of the inside of his pocket and he lied? 
Im very confused and don’t know how to feel. On the one hand, I feel terrible that I made him feel like he needed to record me for his safety. On the other hand, he admitted he did not feel unsafe, so this reason was a lie?
I tried to leave to stay at my mums for a few days to cool off and figure out how I feel about this, but he basically accused me of cheating- he said how does he know if I’m actually going to stay at my mums, it’s a bit weird I tell him lies the previous night then suddenly want to leave for a few days, so how does he know I’m not cheating. I couldn’t be bothered arguing so I stayed. I have no idea where that came from, as he’s never accused me of cheating before.
Basically I’m looking for advice on how to approach this. He doesn’t seem to understand how I could feel like my privacy has been violated. Or I guess I just needed to vent, but it would be helpful to receive other peoples unbiased opinion on the situation.

I am 26 years old entrepreneur, I am doing IT related things. I have around 6500 clients and I am providing my services to them. Recently I have earned a lot of money, as a middle class family boy I am proud of myself that I have achieved a very big financial goal, my parents are also happy that their son is doing well, My monthly earning is more than my engineer father now and I did it in 2 years

About cutting off friends - 
My so called friends were with me in the beginning, but I realized they were using me for money, seeing me earning they always used me to pay their liquor bills, they took advantage of my kindness, they used to distract me from my work due to jealousy because, they were doing nothing and I was going ahead in my life so, I came out of that circle and deleted their numbers, I haven't found any good or a real friend till now so, I have no one to talk to instead of my mother, I have an introverted personality so I don't feel that bad but, still sometimes I feel lonely when I have a time off from my work. 

About title of this post - 
Today accidentally met one of my old friends in a shop in my area, didn't want to talk but I couldn't ignore him, while talking he taunted me about not having a girlfriend, he said that you have everything but don't have a girlfriend and laughed at me, he disrespected and insulted me, my mother is also telling me to get married otherwise it will be too late.

My point - 
The workload has increased now so, even if I make a girlfriend I can't give her time and there is also a danger of problems in relationship and I can't bare that as there is a lot of competition going on at business, everyday I have to give 12-16 hours to my work, otherwise I will lose my place in the market, it is my dream to become a billionaire in a next few years, it's my dream to make my client base across the globe, it's my dream to expand my business on a worldwide level, on a journey of becoming a successful person and a billionaire. 

Question - 
Is 30 Too Late to Start Dating or Get Married? - I am not saying that I don't want a girlfriend or I don't want to get married, I will definitely get married but, after a few years because, I want to focus on my career, I will be around 30 when will have time for dating and to find a girl and getting married

Could it be because she was hanging out and talking to me more? Could something else have happened between the two of them? Please help me. 

We became friends at the start of the year. I also became proper friends with a girl from my uni class. We became pretty good friends this year. After a few months I started to like her. 

My other friend and I would talk about soccer mostly but also occasionally we would talk about the girl. The last few months he started talking about her more and asking when I had last messaged her. I also started talking about her more because I love to talk about her (it makes me feel closer to her). 

Then about a month ago my friend ask me why I talked about the girl so much. I didn’t realise I was speaking about her that much so I said that. And then he said that he speaks about her a lot as well and then said that I must speak about him a lot to her. I answered truthfully and said not much, only stuff that is related to soccer (which all three of us play). 

He seemed a bit distant then thinking about it now but I did not pick up on it. A few weeks pass and we talk more. He said I talk about the girl a lot and asks me to stop mentioning her after I mentioned something related to our conversation happened when we were hanging out. I have a habit of providing all the information possible when talking and messaging people so I was like, okay, I’ll try to stop mentioning her.

A few more weeks pass. While at soccer training I saw he was asking about stuff she did not liked to be asked about. Later I messaged him telling him that she does not liked to be asked about that stuff. Enquiring into how I knew this (because she did not say it to him) I replied saying I had asked her as I saw she got uncomfortable when asked about it and she had told me she did not like to be asked about it. When he asked me if she had told me at training I replied no, she had told me earlier when she and I were hanging out alone.

He replied with something along the lines of oh right, I know, okay, \*thumbs up\* (all were a different message). It was at this time I suspected he actually liked this girl as I did, and I believe he realised I liked her as well. A few days pass and I make a tiny little joke about something that happened to him at a soccer game and he blocks me. 

A week passes and nothing. I then see him in person and ask him about an item the girl left at training that he collected. I was going to get it off him and give it to her when I saw her the next day. He said he does not have it on him.

Half an hour later he messages me and asked how I knew he had the item. I reply saying I was with the girl when she realised she was missing the item. He asked why I wanted it. I reply saying I wanted to give it to her the next day as I was seeing her so I thought why not? He replies saying he doesn’t care. He adds he does not care I am seeing her. He then says hat I have made his life really bad recently and that he never wants me to mention the girls name to him again. He then finishes saying he does not want me to message or speak to him again.

I was a virgin and had never had a girlfriend, despite everyone saying im good looking, I was always shy. 7 months ago I met the most beautiful girl ive ever seen on a dating app who had just moved to my city from Hong Kong 3 weeks prior with her family (9/10 in looks is fair). Immediately on our first date the vibing fireworks were crazy, we matched on so many things, discussed so much, it was like a dream, we connected on Philosophy, music, shared values, we danced into the night and we got extremely intimate very fast. 

I should have seen the warning signs. After dropping her back home, I received 2 calls and 15 messages in the morning about how she was terrified and that she shouldnt have been intimate with me as she doesnt usually do that outside a relationship, and while I was in the gym and the library studying, she accused me of seeing other girls at 11am in the morning. These were all insane red flags, but as I thought she was beautiful and we vibed so much, I assumed it was just a culture difference or something, so I reassured and we went in a second date. The fireworks continue, yet so did the arguments, 2 weeks in we had met 3 times and argued 3 times over text mainly. It was always culture differences so I didnt think much of it. She said shes extremely sensitive but I liked that because it made her deep thinking and from what ive read on here unlike most shes extremely empathetic, I mean genuinely she will feel the pain of others intensely. 

She pressured me 3.5 weeks in saying that she couldnt see me unless we were in a relationship and that she needed that reassurance and asked whether I care about her. For me this was too soon, and again another red flag, but I thought again a culture difference, as asian culture is more conservative in regards to initmacy, and that is partly why, but now ive realised it was mainly because of her emotional insecurities that even 3 weeks into knowing someone she was emotionally unstable if that guy couldnt provide guarantees. 

More red flags to come.

But also not just red flags, I would like to say unlike many, she is the sweetest girl I have ever met, she has never been intentionally abusive, she is always thinking about others, always buying gifts to my family and making an effort even tho she struggles socialising, seeing my friends, writing me love letters expressing her feelings and how ive pushed her through a depressing phase of immigration and having no jobs and no friends at this time in her life.

1 month in she felt insecure and said she needed to know that I loved her. At that time I didnt, but a week later her pressure maybe catalysed it, but it genuinely came when I started to think about love more. Finally after 1.5 months I told her I love her, I wrote her a poem, she cried.

Red flag - She told me that if I hadnt asked her this week she would have blocked me and not talked to me again, she said after 2 weeks she might contact me again but she couldnt handle that insecurity of not knowing as she loved me so much and i didnt love her, I checked her texts and she had told her old friend (she had not friends that ever lasted) that she would block me if I didnt say I love her as she felt insecure and thought I could still be a fuckboy (I told her im a virgin and emotionally soft).

Red flag - She told me she has had 13 past relationships spanning multiple up to 3 years, but some just a month and they all ended because although some of the guys were toxic and some were nice, they all said they couldnt handle her emotions. I thought those guys are horrible, I can save her be there for her. This personality flaw of always wanting to help combined with love blinded me to the bigger picture. That although some of these guys were toxic, at least half, she even admitted left her because of her intense feelings, but I thought she seems so sweet, how dare they do that to her, I didnt see what she really meant. 

As time went on she became more loving, baking me stuff, spending her small wage on me, writing love letters, we vibed talked about life, had great experience together, she spent days painting me pictures dedicated to us, which were incredible.

But over time it was getting me down. I spent hours and hours looking for jobs for her as it made her depressed and I was taking on that depression and those insecurities. She would cry a lot, sometimes talking about how everyone left and she didnt want me to abandon her, I thought shes so sweet and made so many promises to her. She said she was nothing, and that I gave her something. Everytime we would call at night she would talk about her day for 30 mins and then when I get excited to talk about my day she says shes too tired and needs to sleep, which was fair as she worked early in a warehouse, but then why call if its always on sided? I understood as I come from a financially privileged background and she doesnt, but over time I felt emotionally rejected. There were many times where she listened to emotions and helped me be more in touch with them, but it was always mixed. The second I question this and say I feel emotionally rejected she plays victim and talks about how hard it is for in a toxic family household, with a warehouse job and no friends, I understood and always apologised, but this always ground me down and made me feel like I was walking on eggshells, I just didnt realise at the time.

Then came the bigger arguments, twice she created an argument out of something tiny and shouted at me and stormed away in public, disappearing. For example the first argument she stormed away because I didnt take good pictures of her and she made an effort to look good and I couldnt capture that. I went after her and comforted her. The second time it was another small thing. I comforted and went after her. I never raised me voice, I always stayed calm. Deep down I knew this was a huge issue and red flag, how could I be with someone who communicated and acted like this over small issues.

The third time it happened, I felt empty, numb, I felt rejected, abandoned and I didnt have the energy to go after her, I thought this isnt my fault, if she loves me she will come back to me, and she did. She apologised and she brightened up and was also happy and bought me a meal, it was like an emotional release for her, but those emotions were released onto me. I talked to her about it and said its not fair, if we are equal and then I shouldnt be running after you everytime. She thought about it and introspected and said that she agrees because she loves me and believes in equality and doesnt want me to feel rejected and that she does it because she wants to feel comfort and attention from me and know I care. I said that doesnt make sense as you know how much I care about you and love you. I always comfort you, I drive you everywhere, I paid for your stuff when you cant afford it, I spend hours everyday applying for jobs on behalf of you, I introduce to my social circle and even grandparents, I write letters, I support you emotionally and in every way and its still not enough. She said shes knows but in that moment its not logical she just needs to feel it. And she said she knows its wrong and she wont do it again.

Red flag - She tells me that in her past she was so much worse, she smashed up apartment, tried to commit suicide and ended up in a mental hospital, cried in public and begged people to stay screaming, hurt herself. She said that shes improved so much now (which based on the past is 100% true) and that all she does is walk away from me because she needs space and feels depressed because of her situation and is too tired to hear about my day. I know shes right, that improvement is insane. I think she had major BPD in the past which apparently led her to have epilepsy seizures and religious experiences and blackouts (but she doesnt know its bpd even tho im sure it is) and now shes improved so much and so it hurts her when I make a big deal and ask her to try and change her emotions. She says I cant see the change but she tries everyday.

Now onto the straw the broke the camels back. I felt normal, we are 6 months into a relationship, I pick her up and she told me she had a cold and my response was ""Oh you should have told me and we could have gone for a walk another day"". She was surprised and hurt and said that she was looking forward to seeing more all week and now I dont want her. We go to walk and she refuses to get out the car, I say I dont have the emotional energy for this. For me its such a little thing, I was so excited to see her as well, and I was just half joking while driving saying that I should have seen her another as im gonna get sick now, I even laughed and smiled at her cheekily as I said it. She finally gets out the car, and I feel so tired because I know this will be a repeat cycle and I cant deal with the emotional stress anymore, the stepping on eggshells, the overreactions and emotionally charged arguments. We begin walking and she says how it makes her feel, I say I understand but you cant let such small thing affect you, my mums parents are almost dying, shes struggling and I have to support her, in this situation all I said was I dont wanna get sicka and the reaction is like I just cheated on you, she says it doesnt matter, whats important is not how big the perceived issue but the way it makes someone feel, again I said I understand but you cant communicate like that throughout life and it turned into her shouting and she walked away. I felt numb, empty. I think I knew in my heart there and then that it was over, not because I couldnt love her or forgive her. But because my emotions were beyond repair. I had anxiety after 20 mins and I ran after her calling for her, these are busy roads at high speeds and she doesnt know she is, im shaking. I finally find her and we talk it out, but I just feel numb. 

That was 9 days ago, ever since then I know longer think of her in the same way. Even though 90% of the time shes so sweet and caring, the 10% overwhelmed me so much that thinking of her and being round her started to give me anxiety and I felt a knot in my stomach. I was with her and she was being intimate but she felt like a stranger to me. Like it didnt feel natural to hold her hand, she didnt make me happy anymore just feeling weird and anxious, like the first 2 dates when I didnt really know her. 

So I told her I needed space and time to process my emotions and that this argument and more so the repeated overeactions have overwhelmed. At first she didnt understand and text me saying that she would block me and I ruined her life by pushing her away and leaving and abandoning her. 10 Minutes later even though I need my space, I text her and say do you want to call, and she says I feel fine now, just doing some work. The quick emotional flips are insane which is what makes me thinking its BPD.

She can be an angel and flip just like that.

After 3 days we met up and I recieved something so unexpected it broke me into tears. She apologised, she said she was wrong for walking away and making me feel abandoned and hurting me. She said she wants to change and that I have helped through so much (At this time she finally found a job and I had celebrated and cried with her 1 week prior) and that walking away is wrong and she didnt realise it made feel so deep and hurt and that I was that sensitive. 

She said that she realises she doesnt know how to love and she doesnt know why and that all this time shes done so many things for me that shes never done before, that shes always received love but never known how to give it. She said shes never baked before, but she learnt just so she could see a smile on me and my familys face when she brings cookies to my house. She said shes never payed for guys meals, she goes out of her way to spend £5 on a box of sushi when she has £50 in her bank account, just so she can see the smile on my face. She said she knows that she doesnt know how to her love and communicate and regulate her emotions, but shes trying and she wants to try and communicate and support me in the ways I have done to her because she truly loves me.

After this day I felt back to normal again, and she actually seemed changed, when she would call she would ask all about my day and my feelings, I had an interview and she said how much she supports me and how much I deserve it and that if I keep pushing then one day I will achieve it and that she will always have my back no matter what. She started asking about my emotions when we felt likr a disgareement was coming up and it was working. But then 2 days later, the feeling came back and I couldnt control it, like she was a stranger and I was anxious and didnt feel myself around her. I think i realised no matter what she says and makes positive change, I have been emotionally overwhelmed numbed and unitnetionally on her part damaged so much that I dont think I can recover. 

I genuienly think that she is trying and is changing, but its only been a week, but I cant change my feeling of fear, slight resentment and distance. The damage is done, and I dont want that damage but I cant control that regradless of whether she changes or not.

I met her last night after a few days space and planned to go in telling her that I know she needs comfort, love and constant reassurance, but I cant provide her that even though Im still willing to be with her and love her and support her, and she has to accept that the old loving me has been pushed away by her actions, but im willing to make an effort to try and work through it, if shes willing to accept the love isnt the same anymore. 

This led to a full mental breakdown. It was the most terrifying, heart breaking and traumatising thing I have ever seen. She started hitting herself, wailing, saying im leaving her and im like all the others, that she will be lonely again and shes not sure if she can live anymore with this crippling lonliness. She started talking about all the expectations she had, and started crying when thinking about the fact we will never have the baby we dreamed about or the apartment or the life that she craved and hoped for and that she really put every expectation on this, even introducing me to her parents within 2 months, despite her never doing it until at least a year as she finally saw me as the one. She literally fell down to my feet and begged for me not to leave her. It traumatised me but I just kept telling her its okay, your okay, breathe, youre safe and strong, please breathe for me, im always going to be here for you no matter what happens. I then held her down as she started punching her face and helped her breathe with me. 

The one thing that scarred me is that she kept saying stuff in between. She said you are so kind, you couldnt have known this is the real me, its not your fault, im just a terrible person, im stupid and i hate myself, I shouldnt exist, I dissapoint everybody, my parents, every bf ive ever had has left me, some even cut themselves over me. Its a cycle and I cant escape, im only human. I said I want you to get some help because I care about you and her reaction was are you saying im crazy, im mentally ill, im insane is this the way youve always looked at me, i dont need help I tried already, I cant be helped, this is me.

I couldnt break up with her. I was so emotionally traumatized. I couldnt bring myself to break a broken woman. I couldn't break the woman that 95% of the time, I love so intensely for her character, actions, values and personality but the 5% is mentally breaking me.

So I dropped her back, went home and woke my parents up at 3am and broke down. I havent slept or eaten.

I dont know what to do. She has no one in her life, no friends, her family dont speak to her, shes in a foreign country and she refused help. I want to help her but she has to help herself. I cant deal with this. She so sweet.

3. I like making her happy and I can see ourselves travelling the world (that was my plan before meeting her)
4. She's gonna keep working as an escort and that's fine for me
5. She's living in someone's house who wanted to marry her so she could get a visa but she doesn't want since we meet.
6. After everything we did, I proposed her to live at mine. But she refused saying that she feel unsecure, if I don't really love her I'll dump her and she won't have anywhere to go. 
7. I know she want me to marry her to come live with me (in Belgium it's easier to separate what we own) 
8. I'm sure she loves me and I know she does that to protect her unsecure situation 
9. I'm just scared that she only see in me a sexy guy with a house and money that she love enough to spend a few years with then dump.

I’m sure there have been many posts about this. I also cbf making a throwaway so here goes 😅.

I started dating my ex in June 2018, and it ended in August last year. We were living together for the majority of that time. 

Our relationship was somewhat tumultuous, but I still enjoyed every moment and we did everything together. He immediately moved on/cheated with someone who he’s still with. Also I am 25F he is 24M. 

I’m still not over him, like at all. I dreamt that we were back together last night and I frequently have these dreams. I’ve dated since him and even had semi serious relationships, but I haven’t dated in one and a half months now. I just can’t be bothered, and I know I’m still not over him so there’s not much point.

In that aggression, he never hit me, he hit things around him, jumped and screamed, but he never hit me. We broke up about 10 days ago because of the same stupidity, he got annoyed when I asked him what he does during the day and said that he was in a bad relationship. I suggested, as always, that we talk to resolve and change some things, because in my opinion it is quite normal to know who my boyfriend is with, and I tell him everything myself without him asking, he as always, he didn't want to and we broke up. After the breakup, we went out once and he told me that he would like to see me in a month, said that he couldn't do anything with anyone, that he loved me, that he followed all those girls and wrote with them to get over me but he can't do anything with anyone, yesterday after going out he called me, said I missed him, until I went to him and we talked and I asked to see his phone. He got angry and snatched the phone from my hand.

He cursed God, uttered very ugly curses, otherwise I believe in God and go to church and am very pious, while he doesn't.
I called my mom and she called the police, they came, I gave a statement and they went to the door of his apartment. He got a warning and a file, and I woke up the next morning swollen, I cried all night, with bruises on my hips and knuckles around my arm .
It was always a story that we would reconcile sometime later, because we broke up 100 times, but I don't want to see him in my life anymore.

However cliché it is to put up posts like this, I still want some input as its not like any circumstance I have read on here.

TLDR: She (F18) said I (M18) was the one she thought she would be with forever but hasn't put in any effort to try and win me back.

I'll admit it, I fucked up big time, I told nearly all our friends before I broke up with her, 3 of my friends, James, Amelia, and Bridget (Fake names) don't really talk to Clair (Fake name for my GF) and Clair hates Amelia so won't talk to her at all. I talked to these 3 over a month ago and discussed my feelings, James and Amelia said that they agreed with me and that I should end things (I will explain my reasons later) Bridget didn't really care what I did but understood my issues.

Our yr 12 Val is coming up this Wednesday and i sent a message in the ""boys"" group chat asking if anyone would have an extra ticket because i would not be able to use the one Clair had for me.

Saturday Night i took Clair out for dinner (it was also kind of our 1 year dinner as well, our actual 1 years was 5 days before) and when we got home i broke up with her. I explained how we are always arguing about everything from politics, social, and workplace. We also want different travel lives, she wants to see the world but i want to Drive around Australia. And finally i felt like she was never actually listening or giving any interest to mu hobbies or thoughts.

During the crying on the toilet floor (don't ask why we were in the toilet) she told me that she truly did love me and that in her eyes i was the one she was going to marry and i was the only one for her.

I'm kinda just surprised that she hasn't put in any effort to talk to me or try to almost persuade me to get back with her, which if she gave me a good apologie and tried to fix the problems i would very likely reconsider and try it out again and i kinda want her back but i put in all the effort to ask her out first and then i have always been the one going out of my way to get involved in her hobbies and putting my phone down or pausing a movie when she was talking, and i kinda just need her to put the effort in and try to fix the problem.

We were also meant to be going to Bali in December which is now cancelled and i offered to pay the fee for my ticket to be given to someone else to go and we talked about it for a little while and then when i said the price of the fee, around $1000, she stopped talking to me and hasn't replied.

I just miss her.

Does anyone have advice other than, ""Just look after yourself"" or ""what you did was the right thing"" i keep getting given that and would like to hear some that could help fix some of these problems.

I’m very unfriendly to my neighbors. I am 26 and moved at 22. I live in a five-unit apartment in Los Angeles. One of the ladies had a boyfriend or man that would come over to harass me sexually. He would constantly ask me to go and talk to him, and if I didn’t, the next time I saw him, he bugged me about it. He always waited at the bottom of the stairs for me and gave me his number multiple times(even though I never said more than hi). One time he barged into my apartment to use the bathroom, begging, saying he needed to go badly and that my other neighbor wasn’t home yet.

He forced himself in and then tried to get me to smoke with him, and I had to force him to leave. I’ve been assaulted in the past. I’m paranoid and constantly keep blind clothes and wear baggy clothes. The woman neighbor who invited this guy over acted like it was my fault and would glare at me. She also blasts her car radio to where it’s buzzing my apartment, leaves laundry in our only shared machine for more than 24+ hours, complains if you move it, and has a dog pissed on the stairs.

An older Turkish family lives up front, and they talk shit with that lady. They are all 30+ and call me a junkie(cause I smoke weed a lot and have anorexia). Or one time during covid saying, I always leave and go places WHILE I WAS IN CNA SCHOOL. They are also hypocritical because they threw family dinner parties with more than 15 people, but they were outside.

I’m rude to these people and completely ignore them. Say hi sometimes, but I am fake about it. They act very angrily at me and I don’t want to talk to them. New neighbors moved in next door, and they said that I was a junkie. I was screaming and crying on the phone the other day because I found out my dad had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I was calling no, no, no. I know I was in the wrong, but I was in shock

My new neighbors called the police, not even the landlord, and told them it was a domestic dispute when I lived alone. Cops left as soon as they came, but it was embarrassing. Now the neighbor's trash-talk me more about being mentally ill.

I thought we were on the same page when it came to our relationship.

But something happened that has been bugging me non stop since a week.

We like to cook simple meals together, and since i'm not very creative with food he usually is the one deciding what we will eat (and complain about me having no ideas/always eating the same).

So, for once, i had an idea of making something traditional from my home region he'd never had. He agreed, and we went to get the ingredients. So i thought.

Every time i tried to take something he butted in, talked over me, didn't listen to my explanation om how i wanted to cook it (With his main concern being a thing i repeated about 3 times not being a problem because x but he didn't listen apparently.

After him interrupting me for the 5th time i just broke, put the ingredients back and told him we would eat leftovers at home.

Later i confronted him about it and he just told me he has trust issues and would only truly trust his dad.

Well thanks. I would have thought our relationship would at least be on the level of 'I trust you to not poison me' lol.

Wich is especially rich since he kept asking me if i trusted him since i was scared shitless to get intimate with him for months (because of physical abuse in my past, he's the only one who can touch me (holding hands and touch me) as well.).

A few days ago we were visiting his parents and he had a headache. I offered him (very well known) medicine, which he declined in an instant, but when his father asked him barely two seconds later he said yes instantly.

Yes i know he trusts his father more, but i was at least expecting a base level of trust when i came to me. I don't want or need to be his number one. But seeing that he blatantly doesn't trust me AT ALL despite talking about moving together and marriage in the future, it just hurts like hell.

I'm seriously just trying to understand my situation better. I'm  a woman and started dating a man a few weeks ago, we are both in our mid thirties and living in a conservative country but I didn't grow up here. I had a lot of casual (and also non casual as I was married) sex in the past and am into kinky stuff. My boyfriend had two partners before me, and used to have regular sex with one of them (I never asked, he just told me). He is overweight and smokes (quite a bit of) weed daily, I'm mentioning this as it might or might not be relevant to the topic.
First time we had sex, I totally underestimated how conservative he was, started suggesting kinky stuff from the beginning, tried to do way too much too fast etc. He lost his erection quickly and came from a hand job at the end. He started asking how many people I had sex with and saying he thought BDSM was 'not normal' and asking if I was seeing other men too (I'm not) etc. In short, I got the impression I came on too strong so going forward, I stopped talking about kinks and tried to go really slow, never mentioned the fact he lost his erection, was reassuring every time saying how much I loved having sex with him and found him attractive.
In short: while we had penetrative sex a handful of times, he can't really maintain an erection with me and even though I never mentioned that and kept saying I was happy with the sex we were having, he now stopped initiating sex altogether and told me he 'doesn't enjoy having sex with me'. He really enjoys the blow jobs I give him, he said that multiple times and also comes from the handjobs and blow jobs I give him - but he asked 'where did you learn this' in an accusing manner if that makes sense. He also said multiple times that he likes the way I look (not to brag but I'm generally considered conventionally attractive). I'm clean and am pretty sure I smell good everywhere. 
I offered to break up but he says he wants to continue dating and hopes the sex will improve over time. I suggested the situation might have something to do with the amount of weed he is smoking but he said he used to smoke the same amount and had regular sex with his previous partner. I asked if there was anything I could do and he said there was nothing and that I'm already doing everything I can. I don't know what to do. I like this guy as a person and am also attracted to him but obviously he doesn't feel the same way, at the same time he doesn't want to break up.

clearly struggling, wonder what you think - long long text, please read on Tl;Dr if too much.

I am starting to come to terms with my friends group, especially with Juan (32/m) and his girlfriend Dasha (36/f) and the last straw for me was not being invited to Juans Bday get together with Chris, our best friend... (38m) YET AGAIN (last year we were invited).... **would YOU accept all or even any of this behaviour?**  
I feel like I have been through PLENTY of toxic relationships all together... I am working on myself.

# THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR OPINION or ADVICE- and excuse my grammar.

*My reasons why I am fed up all together:*

\-Juan- sometimes, when he is not with Dasha, is pressured to return to her house, when he stays with her during the weekend ***...""by 9 p.m. or the door is locked and I have no key"" -*** maybe he just says it, to prevent her from getting angry, or he wanted to go home, but I thought I could  see it on his face. He gets really pale and seems under super stress &amp; types on his cell phone the whole time. He seemed scared.

\-Hubbys Bday 3 yrs ago, Juan brought Dasha. This woman didn't smile for once. Kind of ruined the mood in a way. She sat there looking angry, and pissed and giving us the ""I am better than you"" attitude. I ignored the behaviour, always stayed friendly. She did this so often, she was angry AF and would show us all ""she, the Queen, is pissy""  
\-Dasha's **passive-aggressiveness towards me** is severe sometimes...I have quite a few examples....and it makes me feel bad, I want respectful conversations that are stimulating.

\- 3 months ago, Chris (part of friendsgroup, 38m) told me, ***he saw Dasha on TINDER.*** She texted Chris ON TINDER and told him his profile pictures were shit and his profile sucks and no wonder he doesn't get a woman. He showed me his profile couple times before and it's perfect. Seriously nothing wrong with it!  
We all do  joke with Chris and how he needs to find a girl but we do try to support him finding a woman, a match.... but this went a little too far for my taste. I asked Chris, if he had told Juan, and he said no. He thinks she's doing it for fun. And I believe she's doing it to piss Juan off or make him jealous. Who in their right mind goes on Tinder just for fun in a relationship?? I didn't like it. It simply didn't sit right. 

\-It was clear **we were excluded from Juan's Bday 2 years ago.**... Chris never spoke openley but he couldn't resist to laugh and agree when I joked about it.  Beforehand, we had bought a present together *with Chris for Juan*............... and when we told Juan Happy Bday via Text, he texted back at 10 pm saying he wasn't celebrating.  Chris was there and of course we found out. We never asked if he was celebrating either..... Chris said ""it was probably because of Corona you guys werent invited"" when Dasha said ""Oh, I don't care about Corona. no.... "" ... Ok. Fine. 

\-Juan and Dasha let Chris pay for a trip to pick up Dashas Son out of another country (was an emergency) ....... pure hell. **Chris paid over 600 EUR for one trip for them -** *not even asking, taking it for granted and letting Chris pull out his cash****.*** He paid for the rental car and **AND GAS!** And Chris never saw his money again. This happened quite often in the past... . I don't even think that they did something nice for Chris .... for doing that, while Chris took 5 days off of work, to drive over 19 hours each way. It's not my business, but I feel like... that is not what you do to a friend. \[Juan is an academic who has a good and well-paid Job, fyi\]. 

\-**We weren't invited to Juan's Birthday this year again -** *and I found out from Chris that he was going, and Chris was confused and upset we weren't invited and picked up Juans present for us and brought it over.*   
*Juan claimed he thought we were busy &amp; invited us when he knew Chris was at our place... and we did say something about being tired and busy, but... Juan made it clear, he had to work all weekend until Thursday..*

I think every person should be able to pick who they invite and have every permit to decide on their own. Last year we were invited- it's ridiculous. 2 yrs prior we weren't Lol. It's been like that ever since he's been with Dasha.

*I had already planned our Friends-Get Together on Christmas at our house and the presents and special things for Dasha's Kid, but I am fed up. I am not going to be hosting Christmas dinner anymore and I am so fed up with this ""friendship""***..**.. I always try to make it right, but I have no power anymore, especially after my father passed away, he was not even 60 years old and I need to make my life better! Not worse.   
And for Juan.... I don't know. Maybe he's like her. I can't trust my own gut here, it feels off, but I can't pin on it. Any advice? ... 

**TL;DR:** *""friends"" probably aren't ""my friends"" and I am wondering if anyone would put up with the same shit as I am. Also am trying to figure out if I might be over-reacting.

I (25f) got slapped in the face for the first time from my bf (25m). So every night, my bf and I basically have different ways of sleeping which is becoming a huge problem in our relationship. He likes to sleep with the TV on and I like to sleep in just darkness no noise no light.

Lately, i’ve been tolerating his sleep schedule by letting him have the TV on with minimal sound,  whenever he falls asleep I grab the remote and put the TV down just so I can get a decent night of sleep.

However my bf’s been accusing me of turning off the TV whenever he sleeps and says i’m disrupting the way he sleeps. I haven’t turned the TV off at all and only put it down, so i’m already upset that he accused me of turning it off and causing conflict over it.

LAST NIGHT, while i’m in the bathroom getting ready for bed, he takes the batteries out of the remote. Later that night, I wake up to try to turn the TV down.. Look inside, there’s no batteries. I wake him up and ask him where they were, he tells me “That’s why I took them out” (Insinuating about me turning off the TV when he sleeps) 

So this really upsets me to the point where I start yelling that i’m not a child and that he can’t just do that like I won’t get upset. I try to get him up by tapping pushing his head, throwing pillow at him, (note: i’m on my period, i know it’s not an excuse but I already know i’m in the wrong for getting this easily upset by touching him) he then gets up by slapping me on the face in the bed while he’s laying down, this caused me to gasp, and slap him back across the face. 

At this point i’m pretty upset. I just wanted to sleep since we both had to get up for work early in the morning.

Idk what to do, or how to react to this, I already tried to ask him if we could sleep separate and his answer is to break up if we don’t sleep together. But it’s causing me my sanity and sleep over it. I really need help on what to do or what other options I have.

I am 26 and moved at 22. I live in a five-unit apartment in Los Angeles. One of the ladies had a boyfriend or man that would come over to harass me sexually. He would constantly ask me to go and talk to him, and if I didn’t, the next time I saw him, he bugged me about it. He always waited at the bottom of the stairs for me and gave me his number multiple times(even though I never said more than hi). One time he barged into my apartment to use the bathroom, begging, saying he needed to go badly and that my other neighbor wasn’t home yet.

He forced himself in and then tried to get me to smoke with him, and I had to force him to leave. I’ve been assaulted in the past. I’m paranoid and constantly keep blind clothes and wear baggy clothes. The woman neighbor who invited this guy over acted like it was my fault and would glare at me. She also blasts her car radio to where it’s buzzing my apartment, leaves laundry in our only shared machine for more than 24+ hours, complains if you move it, and has a dog pissed on the stairs.

An older Turkish family lives up front, and they talk shit with that lady. They are all 30+ and call me a junkie(cause I smoke weed a lot and have anorexia). Or one time during covid saying, I always leave and go places WHILE I WAS IN CNA SCHOOL. They are also hypocritical because they threw family dinner parties with more than 15 people, but they were outside.

I’m rude to these people and completely ignore them. Say hi sometimes, but I am fake about it. They act very angrily at me and I don’t want to talk to them. New neighbors moved in next door, and they said that I was a junkie. I was screaming and crying on the phone the other day because I found out my dad had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I was calling no, no, no. I know I was in the wrong, but I was in shock

My new neighbors called the police, not even the landlord, and told them it was a domestic dispute when I lived alone. Cops left as soon as they came, but it was embarrassing. Now the neighbor's trash-talk me more about being mentally ill.

I think my (36M) wife (39F) is cheating on me, and I would like some advice on what I plan to do next.

Some context: We've been married for more than 10 years, and have children. She has a demanding job that requires quite a bit of travel, especially recently. Before we were married, she had quite an active sexual life (no judgment), but that has always lingered in the back of my mind: ""Is she really OK settling down?""

Recently, I've started to get this really weird feeling in my gut that something is off with her. It seems like our relationship is not important to her anymore, and she has been distant. She also has suddenly gotten more into her looks, which is atypical of her. 

We're outdoorsy people, so we/she usually does things like go for walks, hiking, kayaking, etc, to stay in shape but now it's regularly-scheduled exercise classes. She also has gotten into Botox. Not heavily, but enough to change her appearance a bit. She is naturally beautiful, and I've told her that many times. She absolutely does not need anything like Botox, but she continues to do it.

It got to the point where I was feeling so uneasy recently that I asked her if there had ""been anyone else"", and she said, ""No. When would I have time?"" And it was left at that.

Anyway, she has been taking a lot of work trips recently. After her last trip to another state, the kids and I met her where her next conference was going to be, for the weekend. 

When we were together, the Botox randomly came up, and I reiterated that she didn't need it. She responded by saying that younger men were commenting on her appearance, and telling her she looked 10 years younger than she is. I'm happy she got a complement, but on top of the other things, it felt weird.

She's not very tech-savvy, so I brought with me a new phone for her on this trip, and got it set up. I returned home with her old phone to wipe it and return it for a small discount. Well, curiosity got the better of me, and I went through her messages. I know it's wrong, and a violation of trust.

Among the messages were an introduction from one of her existing clients to a new client (male) while she was at her conference. Later, that new client messaged her saying that it was nice to meet her, and that he would see her in New York, where she was going to be at a conference in two weeks' time. I didn't think much of it until I saw the time: 1:38 a.m. That added to my gut feeling of things being off.

My wife came home last week, and things weren't bad, but it still felt weird. Distant. I haven't been sleeping well as a result, tumbling over the possibilities in my mind. 

Again, I know this is a violation of trust, and I am wrong for doing this, but I added her account to an iPad we have so that I could see her text messages.

This weekend, she headed to that conference in N.Y. Today, she received a series of text messages from this new client, who apparently lives in N.Y. He asked if she wanted to ""hang out"". She said yes, and suggested that he could join her and coworkers for dinner, or that they two of them could meet for a ""night cap"". A few hours later, he suggested a spot they could meet. I guess it didn't work out, with her not responding in time before he left the area.

She apologized to him, and asked if he was still around. This was around 9 pm local time. He said he was on the train, and then said ""Come here"" along with an address. I looked up the address, and it was an apartment building. Guessing it was his apartment. Clearly he felt comfortable inviting her over late at night. She didn't respond, and five minutes later he suggested they try and meet up tomorrow instead. She immediately agreed.

He continued small talk, asking what she did that day. She asked what part of the city he lived in. At this point, she called me and the kids to say goodnight.

After the kids and I hung up with her, the client continued texting: He explained where he lived and said ""I can show you around."" She deflected saying ""another time"" -- but suggested that they could meet up tomorrow night after dinner: ""Do you want to meet up after near the hotel or at it?""

I've been spinning since I read this.

Clearly this guy is interested in sleeping with her. She did try and brush him off, but then suggested they meet at her hotel, at night. Perhaps I'm wrong, but this feels like it's not an OK thing for a married person to do.

She is due to come home on Tuesday, before leaving for another work trip early next month. I'm currently deciding between what to do next:  


* Confront her in a phone call tomorrow, explaining that I've seen the messages, and ask her to explain.
* Wait and see what happens tomorrow, wait for her to come home so that we can talk this through in person.
* Say nothing until after her next business trip to see what happens there.

I gave him a chance but asked to take it slow as I had just come out of a relation. First, he was okay but then the disrespect started. He left me alone sitting and waiting for him, went to sit by his friends, didnt bother inviting me over and when I left slamming the door he said I made it a big deal and none of his friends like me. It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he said sorry and started with the love words. Then, he cancelled a date after promising for a match with guys, last minute and said sorry when I got mad. He then proceeded staying with another girl at work, she was new, and more of his type as Im quite introverted. I felt not enough, he would treat her similar as me, doing same actions, even being there for her at the middle of the night helping her with car issues, while he used to tell me he would be there for me , but words and actions didnt match. 

I asked him for some time away as it wasnt working, so he basically questioned me about my friends, and asked for photos of a guy friend I have. I told him thats possesive and he stopped talking for a whole month until I accepted I made a mistake offending him and I was sorry. Even that , he said he was angry at me and I had to wait for his forgiveness.He made me swear I didnt love anyone but him and I told him my parents presented sb to me whom I rejected. I felt questioned for my fidelity. He was saying he was always used by women and blamed me for withdrawing my love. I was just scared and wanted him to make things right. I told him twice I did love him , but wouldnt mention it often. We then texted in the middle of the night and I told him I had always loved him, but his actions made me back off, he treated me like crap, gave the silent treatment for a month and was punishing me , in order to beg. I cried that night and in the morning he hadnt bothered to send any text of apology , so blocked him , but then after 2 months unblocked to phone him and say I miss him. He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late. 

Lastly, he flirted with another woman in front of me, avoids me, and pretends to be really happy at work as if I dont exist. I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye. He told me I blocked and unblocked him and he never did it to me (I was hurt and broken) and that I would tell him not to text me at work or kiss me at my office (it was because i wanted to be professional and not gossiped) and he would not take no for an answer. He tries to flirt with two other girls in front of me and makes it look like I am inexistent, leaves every office Im at, but checks all my stories, stares at me. I finally reached out and asked to meet to have a talk in person and not text and he said he d be out of town at weekend, so I told him I would only take 30'min but he said ""another day"". What does he want from me? Has he ever loved me? Or is it my fault because I wasted his time? I took him back several times as he would bring gifts, say he couldnt help losing me, now barely looks at me and is avoidant. We only text regarding work and he replies , but doesnt initiate.

Honestly, I feel so betrayed and humiliated that I'm questioning everything I've ever believed in. 

Our story is very long and complicated. We've known each other since high school and were on and off during all those years. Considering the fact that we pretty much grew up together, our relationship has played a big role in shaping our characters. We've always had our differences, but we would still try to make it work, no matter how difficult it sometimes was, because our love for each always remained. We've both made some mistakes, but somehow we always looked past them because we didn't want to let go. 
Even though we've been together for so long, we never lived together because circumstances never allowed it. We are both in college and couldn't afford to get an apartment yet, but we did start planning moving in together sometime next year. 

As it turned out, we were not on the same page. I honestly believed that everything was finally coming together for us, I was happy, I saw our future together and was looking forward to every moment we would spend together. I had no doubt that everything was fine. 
One night, he told me that he no longer feels attracted to me, that he doesn't feel like hugging me or kissing me anymore. He saw me as just a friend.
My heart dropped. I didn't know how to respond or what to feel. I just shut down and it felt like my soul left the room. 

It's true that we've had problems with intimacy and our sex life has been suffering for quite some time. I've had some medical issuses and things just felt very uncomfortable for me most of the time. Whenever it didn't work, I felt horribly guilty for not being able to give him what he needed. With time, I developed some type of aversion to sex because it just never felt comfortable, and I felt so pressured to make it work, because he was often pointing out how our sex life was non existent. I must say that he has never forced me to have sex with him when I said no. But then, he would always feel rejected and whatever I did would never make it up for the lack of intimacy. Apart from my general discomfort during sex, what also made it hard for me to relax was the fact that he often commented on my weight - apparently I was too skinny, my butt was too small and I looked better when I weighed more and was more curvy. He would always say that he was joking, but I knew he meant it. It made things worse for me because I always had body image issues and now that I finally feel happy with how I look, it felt like a negative thing.
In the end, it all came down to that. And whoever and whatever I was as a person did not suffice. After all these years, I saw him as so much more than just a physical person. He was my home. He was my safe place. He was my person. And although intimacy was lacking, I truly believed things would have improved once we started living together. We would have our own space, our peace and quiet, and would wake up together and go to sleep together every day. 


He wanted to stay friends but I just couldn't agree to that.
I'm not even sure I can look him in the eye anymore. I don't even know who that person is. 
The worst part of it all, is that I'm actually wondering if there's anything I can do to make things right because I can't stand the idea of losing him.

Then I feel like I just have to sit there quietly.

We haven’t talked in forever, we do nothing together, I asked him out last week but his reply was no I know his schedule (basketball that he plays x3 a week and would/could be done before). We don’t have conversations even if we talk, he just says crappy jokes and tickle me like I am a baby or retard. Like I know he lost his job more than a month ago but be doesn’t tell me and lies to me, I don’t know what he is doing daytime. We had many different issues before so even a small thing pisses me of way more than it normally would. He used to talk down to me in conflict and devaluate me and the words stick with me even if he doesn’t do it anymore.

He ticks off all boxes but says I'm out of his league. He is extra selfless, does everything for me, prioritises me over everything and asks nothing in return.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm F26, it's about my friend (M28) of almost 4 years. To start, he is a gentleman, over-the-top helpful and has always been there for me. 

We started as friends, he has always been polite, soft-spoken and ""extra appropriate"". He compliments me in the sweetest way, gifts me almost every week, and helps with any errands I ask for. I've not seen him deny any request and completes even impossible tasks (*He once worked on my assignment from 1 to 6 am, as the deadline was in the morning*).

He has been there since two of my beloved person died (separate incidents). He could comfort me when my family members or childhood friends couldn't even talk to me. All he did was scribble a few texts or be on the phone. He did not try to be the saviour, just assured that he is there, and that was enough.

Early this year, I asked him out and he was very surprised. He asked why I want to have lunch with him while there are awesome guys on my dial list. However, he didn't turn me down and we had a great time. He bought me an awesome dress. Heck, when we were walking, *he was extra cautious to keep a distance so that there are no accidental touches*. I truly admire his respect for me, but I wished we at least could have held hands.

I'm very self-dependent and do not ask others for financial assistance or otherwise. However, I feel comfortable asking him. If I ask him for any money, he always tops it up with something extra (10-20%) and then never asks what I did with it. *It is almost as if he forgets after lending me*.

If I ask him to run errands (pick up laundry, buy groceries, etc), he will always bring something extra with it (ice cream, chocolate, etc) and never take payment for the errands.

I started the topic of marriage generically and he said that I am ""*out of the world and too perfect*"". He generally doesn't give physical compliments, but once I said I'm getting fat, he complimented my body in such a way that I literally had to admire myself in the mirror. He keeps mentioning how much I mean to him, that he loves and respects me a lot and that he is extremely lucky to have me in his life.

He does everything perfectly but never does anything to ""date"" me or ""ask for marriage"".

It was a lot of fun at first; he was super loving and sweet and would invite me over and on dates so often. Things kind of slowed down rather quickly - like after 3 months, we had fights, he cheated twice (that i know of) during the first 2 years and i'll be honest, I should have left right there and then, but I didn't because I have no spine. We talked a lot, and from time to time he goes back to his sweet self like he was at the beginning, but most of the time I'm the one taking initiative when it comes to meeting up or going out. Going out is a whole issue as well, he prefers staying home and just chilling there, which I stupidly give in to. 

Last night, I told him I don't feel appreciated. This came up because I saw a friend of his being introduced to his friend group in his instagram stories and I have never met any of his friends, which just feels ridiculous to me. Of all friends I have, I also have met some of their friends at some point, but not his. I thought his friend groups were super tight so I didn't make that big a deal out of it, but now that I saw that other friends of his are getting introduced to each other, I felt super left out. I told him this, and he replied with 'I'm not in the mood for bullshit now', so he didn't even read it. 

My only option is leaving him, I am aware that this is what I should do. I have broken up with him before and blocked him everywhere, but we saw each other again and got back together because he said he missed me and I missed being with him as well, despite everything. How should I get this over with? I really want to end things because I keep hurting and hurting and hurting and feeling so insecure, but I'm also super attached (he's my first partner and a first for a lot of things) and scared and feel like I'm giving up something that could be so wonderful if he put in the effort he used to.

We met a few years ago and got to know each other through dating so we have some romantic history. At some point things went wrong (probably my fault) and it ended. We were definitely very immature at that point and we both have changed, we were and are in our formative years after all. 

She got into another relationship after that which ended recently. The ending was expected and honestly a good thing but she is obviously hurt. And in that time when she was in a relationship I did not intend to remain her friend because I could tell I still had feelings but circumstances made it necessary and it kind of stayed that way.

In that same time I also dated around however I still liked her. I am currently single and have been for a few months and was planning to let her know about my feelings for her sooner or later just to be done with it and get it off my chest but now this complicates things. The plan was to say it and simply put an end to the chapter rather than pursue anything. However, now it seems like that’s possible.

And yes, I get it, in a perfect world if she liked me she would have been with me and not him. But we are all imperfect it’s possible to mess up or get caught up in something and like I said we were really young(and still are). Also, there is no doubt there was always some sexual tension between us even after we stopped dating. So even if we did nothing it was clear we weren’t the definition of “friends”.

Obviously the break up is fresh so I’m not going to put this on her plate right now. But how should I even go about it? I don’t feel jealous but it is weird trying to support her through a break up knowing I intend to date her.
