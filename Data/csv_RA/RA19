When I was 17 I met a 20m and we started dating shortly after I turned 18. The relationship was a disaster. He was manipulative, emotionally &amp; verbally abusive.  I had to follow so many rules he basically controlled every aspect in my life. I had a bad childhood and just wanted to be loved so badly I overlooked it all. We constantly broke up and got back together more than I can count. He finally found another girl and dumped me. I eventually met my current husband who is the kindest, gentlest man I ever met. He knows what I have been through and helped me find my current therapist to help me deal with all I had gone through. Well apparently in all these years my ex became an addict and finally decided to get sober. Apparently in rehab one of the steps is apologizing for past actions. I got an email a few days ago from him apologizing for all the things he put me through and one thing that I didn't know about and why I am writing this. I guess back in the day when we were intimate together he use to take the condom when I wasn't looking and proceed to finish in me without it. In his email which was very graphic he called it his secret that would turn him on more and that's the only way he could finish. But apologized and said he wished he had a time machine to go back and undo what he did. The thing is I believe him because I did fall pregnant at one point in our relationship but I miscarried even though I was on birthcontrol and I thought we were using condoms. I don't know what to do with this information. I didn't reply, I have therapy today and hopefully can discuss things with them. But I feel like a idiot, and i am so embarrassed. How could I not notice something like that. On top of it, was I SA? I consented to the act but not to that. I am so lost, how do I tell this to my husband? I know it was decades ago but I don't know. I know my husband would never judge me or anything and would do anything I wanted to help me with this. But I am so angry and sad at the moment. I feel like my ex took away that choice from me, but did he really? I consented to sleeping with him. But how do I tell my husband? Do I tell him, what if he looks at me differently now?

The past year we have opened our relationship as neither of us believe sex = love and are very open about what we get up to when away in different cities/countries (the only time it’s allowed). This was arranged to satisfy our needs of playing the field while still young.

A little background on our relationship -
we spend a great deal of our time independently from each other. During the week we spend the odd evening together watching TV and eating dinner. 
On the weekends when we are together we usually go out with mutual friends or see family. Or we go off to do our own activities - BF goes to watch sports/play sports with mates and I like to go out with my female friends. We have chores we specifically do around the house and we both love our dog and he is the light of our lives.

Ok onto the issue. 
Are we more like roommates than in a relationship? Is it healthy? Are we together just for convenience or that because it’s been this way for so long? These are the thoughts that go around my head that get me questioning everything.

I love this man and he loves me. We care for each other and support each other through life’s difficulties. We have good sex but it is without subduction or effort, more like “you DTF tonight?”.

Then there’s the issue of having a life built around each other, a house/finances that are fully integrated, almost all our friends are mutual, very close with each others families and our dog is like our child.
Why would I want to jeopardise all of that for thoughts of - what if?

But then what’s next.. engagement? Could I commit to that if I was doubting anything?

We've been together a total of over two years, but we did break up for a few months after dating for approximately a year. We got back together and everything seemed great, better even. 

I had some severe medical issues at the start of this year. I could've died had my boyfriend not been there to force me to go to the hospital. He was there with me through everything, always so supportive and loving. I slowly recovered from my medical issues. Due to the nature of my medical issues, I wasn't really physically prepared to have sex for some time. But he would ask and I would do it for him, even though I didn't really feel into it. 

I haven't really been up for any sex this entire year, if I'm being perfectly honest. He's been frustrated. We've talked a lot about this issue. What changed, what could be causing this? I thought it was a hormonal thing due to the nature of my medical issue. My hormones are normal, though. Physically, I am healthy and doing fine.

I made a relevation about all of this when I found myself catching feelings for a new friend (no, I do not intend on pursuing this friend). I'm demisexual, I've known this for a while now. In my case, I am only attracted to people I feel comfortable around and can have a friendship with. I can find other people aesthetically pleasing, but I have never been attracted to someone based off looks alone. My boyfriend is my best friend. Platonically, we get along fantastically. So I guess I don't feel comfortable around him. I only mention the new friend because I was concerned for a while that I was actually asexual, but I am definitely not.

I've talked to my boyfriend about this, leaving out the part about having feelings for my new friend and trying to phrase things less harshly. He took it pretty well. I told him I wanted to figure this out and get back to normal. We are not having sex for now unless I initiate (I haven't), and our physical contact in general is also much less frequent. That was a few weeks ago, we've had a few more talks since then. For the most part, he's been understanding. He's had a few moments, understandably. Like he takes it not great when I need space, always seems depressed about it, and I feel horrible about myself every time. 

I love him so much. When we broke up in the past, I didn't eat for weeks and it felt like there was a pit in my chest where my heart was supposed to be. Even thinking about breaking up with him makes that same feeling come back. I don't want to break up. I kinda wish he would break up with me, though. What am I supposed to do when I have no attraction to this man I love? He hasn't changed physically, he's improved himself mentally over all this time, and yet I feel so different about everything. He's been doting on me and trying his best to be even more loving and caring, apologizing for past infractions and being extra cautious to keep me from getting overwhelmed. But it hasn't helped. Even worse, he gets on my nerves so much now. Minor things just set me on edge immediately. I feel like my brain wants any excuse to be upset with him. Any slip up makes me want to retreat and be by myself. I'd rather be alone the vast majority of the time now.

It hurts my fucking heart so much to think about the possibility of breaking up. But I don't know how to fix this. I feel like my brain is broken. What can I do?

I (29f) have been dating my boyfriend (27m) for 8 months now. I know it’s still a super fresh relationship. At the beginning, it was great. We got along so well and would just hangout and talk for hours without any distractions. I loved it and it made me fall in love with him really fast and hard. Normally it takes me a year to fall in love with someone, so I thought wow, this could be my person! 

Anyway, at the beginning of our relationship he called me and told me his ex had called him to tell him she has chlamydia. I knew they had slept together before we got together. We got tested and both had it. Tbh, it was nbd to me, it’s something that you take medicine for and it goes away and life moves on so I wasn’t upset over it. Now I’m thinking, this should have been my first red flag. 

So, I knew they were fwb before we got together , which didn’t bother me since we all have pasts. However, what did bother me was how much they would text each other still. He claimed it was a volatile relationship so I didn’t understand why you’d want this person still in your life and also they were fwb up until the point we met, so yeah, I was bothered by this and I made that clear to him and he said he would stop. One day, he passed me his phone to order food and I noticed a text that popped up and it was from her. I was pissed to say the least. I had set boundaries and he crossed it. We had a huge fight and I told him to leave my house but while he was gathering his stuff I just felt sad and told him to stay and we’ll work it out. 

Fast forward a few months, we were better but I still had trust issues. I told him that I’ve been in a relationship before where I was lied to constantly so I have major trust issues and once you break it it’ll take me awhile to gain it back. Anyway, he kept talking about one of his ex’s and even told me that he was sleeping with her even after he found out she had a boyfriend. That bothered me a lot.. who does that?! But again, I thought the past is the past and people can change. 

One day he came to me and told me that this ex was coming into town and he wanted to see her. I told him base on their past and how she obviously doesn’t care about cheating on her bf and how he didn’t seem to care doing it knowing that she had a bf, that I was not comfortable with this. We got into a tiff but he said he wouldn’t. He then went home because I had school. Later that day, he said he was going to go get food with her and I said, I asked him not to and iterated how much that bothers me. We texted about it all day.

He ended up coming to my place later and I asked if he saw her and he said yes. I was obviously pissed and he said “I thought it I went and saw her and told you after then you’d know you could trust me and know that nothing happened.” Lol what an excuse. So I broke up with him, but that lasted a day because he’s a smooth talker and again, I love him. 

Fast forward to a month and I moved in with him because my lease was up and I couldn’t afford my place anymore since I was in school. Now I’m living with him and we are still having issues. I still have a hard time trusting him and he makes me feel shitty sometimes. I’m dealing with my sister being a huge alcoholic and it’s caused a lot of stress and chaos in my life. Instead of him spending time with me , when I need him, he just plays video games and watches YouTube. I’ve told him how I need him right now but nothing changes.

I want to break up with him, but I know his life will implode if I do. His car has been broken down for months , so he uses mine to get to work since I work from home. I have grown attached to his daughter and she has with me too. I’m just so scared to leave because apart of me still loves him and cares for him, but I can’t live this way anymore. We even have an eviction notice because he didn’t take the initiative to pay the rent even after I gave him my half and he suddenly didn’t have the money anymore?? 

There’s so much more, but this has been long enough. I feel like I know what people will say, but I guess I need advice on what to do and how to go about it.

My boyfriend (27m) and I (25f) have been together for almost 5 years. When we first got together he was living at home not working, I was in college studying elementary education and psychology. Due to a personal situation I wasn’t stable with school and ended up dropping out a year after we got together. Since being together I have always worked full time even in college, there was one time I didn’t have a job for a couple months but I had money saved to live off of. My boyfriend on the other hand has never been able to keep a job for more 6 months. He’ll go months without a job and his parents pay for his bills and I pay for all his other living expenses. He maxed out our joint credit card over summer because he didn’t have a job, his mom is suppose to be paying it off but he hasn’t been making any payments for a couple months. He’s calling in sometimes once a week and then complains when he has to make up the work. He is constantly telling me he’s going to make changes to his life and diet to help working, but hasn’t. I’m sick of the false promises. He’s very sensitive and when I bring my frustrations up he cry’s says he’ll try and be better then I end up apologizing for not have more understanding. I have to say he does seem to be upset and feel genuinely sorry for doing it. I have brought up concerns about having a better balance of cleaning around our house, he only seems to actually do it when I’m mad. He’s talking about starting a family, because of how I grew up I’ve always made it very clear I won’t be having a family until we are stable and own a home, I’ve brought up my reservations about having kids if he can’t really keep up chores as it is and again says it’ll get better. We don’t go out or celebrate anything, he has made no effort to make me or our relationship feel special. When I bring this up he always ask to watch a movie at home or play video games which is what we always do.

(tomorrow would’ve been our 9 month anniversary) And we had been talking for even longer.  Our relationship was honestly amazing. We had made each other so happy and spent most of the time together talking about how much we wanted to last and how happy we made each other. I could honestly rant about how much I loved and still love him. Recently, though, things got different. He had been diagnosed with depression and had gone through a major episode to the point where he had to be admitted to a hospital, so it was really bad. During that time before he left, he got a lot colder towards me and ended up breaking up with me. After he got back, he told me that he needed to work on himself before getting into a relationship and that he still loved me, he just needed time to heal. We had agreed that we would enter back into the talking stage so that he could have the time he needed to heal and grow. Things were going pretty well all things considered. We had gone through a particularly emotional conversation and at the end he said something to the effect of “please hold me and never let me go” and we had talked about how much we loved each other and didn’t want to lose each other and i had so much hope for the relationship. Then, things got bad again. He would do things that hurt me and any time i would try to talk to him about it, all i would get was an “ok” in response. Then, he started talking about this girl named Ky. They were one of his school friends and went by they/them pronouns, but i was still uncomfortable. He had told me that he and Ky were very close and had tried to make plans to hang out, but never got around to it, and that really stung because he had told me that he didn’t think he was ready to see me in person (we did long distance and he lives about 2.5 hours away) He ended up giving me reassurance that Ky was nothing more than a friend and that it was a mutual understanding between the two of them, but I still would feel uncomfortable even if i wouldn’t tell him. After he had talked about them, i had asked to have a conversation with him about that and how he was hurting me and when i tried talking to him, he ended up leaving me on read. At this point, i had been sobbing and texted him “why do you keep hurting me” and he read it and didn’t respond. Finally, he ended up texting me “honestly hannah i can’t do this anymore. Im blocking your number and im sorry it had to be this way. I hope you have a good life, dear and if our paths ever cross again I hope it ends well.” Then, he blocked me on everything. One of my friends ended up texting him and asking him what happened, and he told my friend that he just wasn’t in the right mental state to talk to me. My friend asked him if he stopped loving me and he replied with “no, and i doubt ill ever stop loving her” Another one of my friends started texting him pretending to want him and acting like they were better than me and he ended up defending me and saying that he loved me and missed me and wanted me. Plus, on top of that, Im not very spiritual, but my friend is and i was talking about how i had three separate dreams that he came back in one night, i had woken up at 3:33 in the morning, had three different people tell me that he would come back, and was having my youtube and tik tok fyp come up with videos telling me that my ex would come back. I don’t know what to do though, since i see him changing things on snapchat and updating his profile on the friendship app that we had met on. He also made a new snapchat account and it came up on my quick add. He’s not being flirty or anything on them, but i can’t help but wonder if he’s talking to other girls already. I’m sorry if this is long, but i honestly don’t know what to do. Should i hold onto the hope that he’ll come back or should i just move on? I’m sixteen and I know im still young, but this just felt so different and i saw a future with him.

At the start of the relationship he was okay with my mum and family, even often buy snacks and food over for us. He kinda know that my mum is bad tempered and has physical abused me as I've told him before they met. My mum is a loud and obnoxious person but he was still fine interacting with her and still often come over for meals with my family.

However it took a turning point when one day I called him bawling my eyes out and complaining to him after my mum got physical with me. From that day on he wasn't the same around her anymore. He can't stand the sight of her, even though he still come over to stay. He'll now just stay in my room and not even greet her.

I confronted him about this and ask him to at least try pretend to greet her as my mum isn't happy about his behaviour. He then got mad at me telling me how he hated the way my mum treats me and just dislike her character. And how I didn't care about his feelings. She can be quite a self centred person, but I guess since she's my mum, I don't want to sour our relationship.

Recently I spoke to him again regarding this. And he got upset again, telling me it's not only because she is abusive to me. But from the interactions he had over the years, he just got feel more and more disgusted towards her. Like how she would scream at people on the phone at midnight for simple things. And how bias she was towards my siblings. Further more she still have expectations of how he should treat her. She's often salty about how we will often go out for nice meals and never take her along ever.

I know he is really angry for me, but this is causing further strains for my relationship with my mum and family as we barely interact anymore. I just wish that he will not be so obvious with his disdain. We are thinking of getting married, and I don't know how to approach them. How do you think I can navigate this relationship?

Now recently we met in real life, and it was really wonderful, but also a bit awkward. I get panicked when things go quiet and he kind of shuts down when he feels nervous, so we had a lot of silences and i didn't really know how to deal with those. Some people say they can talk for hours with someone, but i just feel like we can't really. I feel like the main cause of that is both of us being kind of nervous and having our walls up

When we met, it was kind of obvious that there are some feelings between the two of us. I really want to get to know him better to see if we could be compatible, and i want him to get to know me better too, but i don't know how we can do that if we're both so closed off.

I've had 3 relationships in my life, the first two were very obsessive, toxic and unhealthy - 7 and 11 months. After that I met this girl who for change was normal. We were together for a year and 8 months. We had an amazing relationship. She was close to my family, me to hers, same with friends.

She recently told me about a pst sexual experience she had. She was an RA her sophomore year of college and in the first two weeks had a brief sexual relationship with a ‘bad boy’ that lived in her dorm. It was cut off when he then proceeded to have sex with the RA who lived directly above my girlfriend. She said she only did it because she was going through a really tough time in life and the guy picked out her insecurities and took advantage of that. She knew it was wrong after the first interaction but couldn’t stop doing it until he moved onto the next girl. It lasted at maximum two weeks before it ended, but they lived across the hall from each other and had “easy access”. She refers to the whole things as a shit show in all aspects, especially that the sex itself was awful.

I love my girlfriend so much and have heavily considered marrying her previously. I have some pretty serious sexual trauma of my own and am having trouble getting over this. My traumas stem from childhood abuse but have left me very sexually sensitive. It’s upsetting she waited so long to tell me as I was very up front about my own personal traumas to help her get to know me. She’s the most understanding girlfriend on the planet and so special to me, but I’m feeling like this is all a lot to process for me and am not sure what to do about it. I want to be supportive for her like she is for me, but am having trouble getting over my own feelings about that situation. The fact that a guy got to live out what was likely a sexual fantasy of his with her is literally keeping me up at night. It’s so far in the past now but feels so real and so present. I know she learned a lot and grew from the experience, which we’ve talked about, but I still can’t help but feel the way I do.

Her and my sex life has been wonderful too, and she says she’s never felt so connected to someone that she has sex with, and neither have I. This whole thing has totally thrown us off though.

I’m going to start saying that my friend made hurtful comments to me in the past. 
She knows I’m unvacc1nated, and one day when she came home she told me “hahaha maybe I’ll come and go visit you to the hospital lol. Have you seen all those memes about the unvacc1nated people?”. I didn’t say anything to that comment. She was implying that I was going to get hospitalized because of cov1d. 
I respect peoples decision and it’s correct wether you want to get vacc1nated or not. I never made any comments to her about vacc1nes. 

I lost two of my grandparents (one to cancer suddenly and the other suddenly too, because he fell). And I only have one grandma left, out of all my grandparents, because I lost them all almost. And when I went to her house one day, I made a comment about how I visited my grandma the other day, and she said “hahaha the only grandma you have left, right? Lol”. I didn’t say anything to that comment. But she was being salty, and I remember giving her a bad look at one moment, because she was teasing me again, but I don’t remember what she said.

I remember one day I was at her house with another friend, and we started talking about how the media exaggerated a little bit about cov1d at one moment, and my friend was like “hey I lost my aunt to cov1d, the media wasn’t exaggerating”. I didn’t mention her aunt, she did it by herself. And I also wasn’t implying that her aunts death was invented, or that it was exaggerated.

And also something else that happened is that I invited her to come to a concert with me. I told her I would pay for her tickets (they are really expensive) and she declined. She said that her dog needed to go to surgery and she was worried about him and also she felt embarrassed about the invitation. That she couldn’t accept such expensive tickets. And I understood and decided to go with another friend of mine, and now she is just ignoring me. She takes long to reply to my messages and is giving me the cold shoulder.

My question is why did he delete and then un delete if he was the one who ended the realtionship. Yes I caught him on a dating app so I prob would have ended it myself.

He made promises saying that he’ll change and stop lying but it just keeps happening and I don’t know what to do. I’ve confronted him about it and he formed the habit of lying when he was together with his ex, due to the fact that she restricted him from doing a lot of things such as watching porn, liking other girls’ photos, talking/hanging out with other girls etc because she was insecure (according to him)

Thing is, we clearly established ground rules and boundaries from the very beginning of our relationship. However, I never really restricted him from doing just about anything he wanted. I told him if he wanted to get off to porn every once in a while, he’s free to do it. We’ve been together for almost 2 years and I didn’t find out until now because I never felt the need to snoop around on his phone out of respect for his privacy. But recently I’ve discovered that he keeps screenshots of half naked/naked celebrities, influencers and even girls that he personally knows and he gets off on them. I confronted him about it and he got really defensive, denying the fact that he does it. 

After many attempts at trying to squeeze the truth out of him he admitted to it saying “I don’t watch porn anymore because it’s fake, these girls are real so it makes me feel better when I look at them.” It’s the fact that he jerks off to girls that he knows irl that makes me uncomfortable. He also said that these girls make him get off easier because they’re way hotter than I am. A low blow from him was when he straight up called me ugly. I was shocked and I told him I felt downright disrespected and disgusted. He does all of this but sometimes when I see a male celebrity on my ig feed I’d say “he looks kinda cute” and he would get angry so I don’t see how that’s fair.

We have a daughter(2yo) and have had a really happy marriage until recently. A few weeks ago he confessed he was using reddit/Instagram pages to help him ""have some fun"" and we have talked in the past how that makes me uncomfortable because how easy it is to reach out to that person and take it further than it needs to go (this has happened to me multiple times in the past with exs). He agreed and I made him an entire folder of picture's and videos of me. I asked him how often he did this and he said only one or two times, so I told him I would like him to stop, and give me a bit of space to fully process/get over it. He agreed. 

A few days later he mentioned how he wanted to bring up that conversation again and he confessed that he has been doing it more than one or two times and felt bad for not being entirely truthful. I was shocked that he lied because he is normally so honest, so I was more upset with him for lying than using the accounts for that long. We talked about how it made me feel and that I would still need time and space to process my feelings. He agreed. 

My husbands love language is physical touch and my love language is acts of service. Whenever we have disagreements I want my space and do not want to cuddle/hold hands so when he asks I say no. Most of this weekend I had to remind him to give me space because I am still not ready for him to be all over me when I am still processing my feelings and that made him spiral. He cried for a bit saying ""are we getting divorced?""/""Do you feel like I cheated"" and other questions like that and of course my answer is NO to all of his questions. I have told him multiple times that I love him so much and that we will work through it, I just need a bit of space and time, but he doesn't listen and continues to make himself spiral. A few nights later (our first night to ourselves in a long time) we decided to order some pizza, snuggle up to a scary movie (not his favorite type of movies but he agreed). We were terrified and giggling, but with 5 minutes left of the movie he has a panic attack because he is so scared of losing me.... like bro we were having a drama free night and you want to bring this out of nowhere? I reassured him again but then I also explained how hard it is for me to make him feel better when he was the one in the wrong. I got him calm after like 30 minutes and then I asked for him to find something to do so I could finish the movie. I could tell he was upset but I am just so frustrated because I am so tired of making him feel better for hurting my feelings. He has therapy this week so I am hoping that will help, but I just don't know what else I can do without ignoring my own feelings that need to be processed.

I haven't really been telling many people because I don't want to get their hopes up for me or something, but I did apply to go to college back in the fall.  Mom and dad is the other way around, they say ""oh he's going to school come fall"" like wtf, I didn't even get accepted yet. But that's besides the point.

The point is I'm honestly scared to talk to my girlfriend about my school plans and what I'll have to do because every time it comes up it's all about what she wants. 

""I'd like a nice apartment for us both"" ""I'd like you to wait until I go to school"" but her mom says she shouldn't go to school until she gets her driver's license...

As I didn't know where to put this and I was told repeatedly in the last subreddit that r/askreddit wasn't a good place to have serious conversations about relationships, here I am. This will be the only update post I'll be making on this.

[Link Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cbm2n/people_who_have_schizophrenia_or_dated_andor/) for the really old post. tl;dr Reddit was right about schizophrenia, but I did it my way anyway.

So it's been about 9 years since that post. At the time I was much younger and trying to figure out my future, so I needed a way to learn more and to understand what the future would hold for my relationship with my schizophrenic girlfriend. Long story short, schizophrenic girlfriend is no longer my girlfriend. She is now schizophrenic wife, and has been for about 6 years.  

It's been a long journey and many of the warnings from redditors were right, there were setbacks, bouts of depression on both sides and financial challenges, and things came to a head during the pandemic. Working in insurance, transiting to a work from home setup went really badly for her, and she became deeply depressed and suicidal as her ability to find clients dwindled. She started to get episodes and would get paranoid halluciations that her client were talking behind her back and that was why she cou;dn't get new clients. 

I was also struggling at the time as my workplace handled the WFH transition poorly, overloading me with increasingly unreasonable demands (e.g. calls at 8pm to complete work for a 9am meeting). It was frankly a dark time for both of us.

I knew we were in a downward spiral and had to break out of the cycle. So after some soul searching, I quit my job, despite having no backup, and went for therapy. I knew that to help us, I had to get some help for myself first. I focused on myself, got fitter both mentally and physically, and managed to find another job 3 months later. 

Once I was in a better place, I had a sit down talk with her and convinced her that she too had to take drastic measures to make a better life for herself. There was a lot of crying, suicidal ideation, pain, but she agreed and quit her job. Things got worse immediately after, and after one scary instance of her considering running in front of a bus, we decided to get her committed into a mental health facility.

The one thing I had to thank reddit for, is that I knew being married to this woman wouldn't result in an easy life, but I walked into this with both eyes wide open and knowing the mountains I would need to climb. So I was just there for her the whole way. I held her tight, when she threatened to run into the road, I rushed from work daily to make the visitation hours at the hospital, I memorised her medication to communicate better with the doctors, and I encouraged her to do all the things she'd never considered before, taking up UI/UX design, learning to drive, learning programming. 

Today, 2 years after I quit my job, we find ourselves in the best place we've ever been in and more in love than ever before. She aced her course in UI/UX design that I paid for, was awarded as the top  student, and is now a UX designer for a bank, and she loves that she gets to indulge in her creative side in her daily work, the stable income is also a great plus in reducing her stress levels and improving her mental health. I ended up working in cybersecurity, and I really enjoy my current workplace, especially as they allow me to set strict boundaries in my work-life balance. We find that we have a deep trust in each other now, as she knows that I am always on her side, and the qualities that attracted me to her like her intelligence, resilience and trust in me are well-founded. She was amazingly able to change to a completely different industry, and totally reinvent herself, despite everything that has happened so far. 

So just hope this encourages others out there who may be dealing with physical or mental health challenges with a partner. Our relationship may be an exception (based on the general experience of most redditors with schizophrenic parents, spouses, relatives) and not the rule, but exceptions do exist. We did it.

At first sorry for my English and the chaotic wording. :-)
I would like to ask for advice.
We (me 39, she 34) are over seven years together and over 1 year engaged.
This summer we moved to another country and changed our job - that was our long term plan for 2019, but then came covid...
So, we moved into our new apartment and talked about having a baby next year.  After moving into the flat she was very positive and whoop but I was a bit depressed and worried about the costs. In August we had a stupid quarrel and broke up for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks she came back from her parents and said that we should repair it, because we just started our new life. It was the end of August. We are working on it and it seems OK, I just need to be patient and tolerant. But last time she told me that she is exhausted, she loves me but doesn't feel attracted to me. It seems to her that we are best friends... Of course I was shocked. She didn't meet anybody or anything like that, but for a couple of weeks she didn't wear the engagement ring. It is so confusing to me, because one day she tells me that she is happy and everything will be ok, and the next day she tells me that it would never ever be good again. I should not kiss her lips, because it is nothing to her, and next day she kisses me. Wtf?! Oh, and she talks about how to decorate the flat in the summer, what we should buy, and what to do. We don't want to leave the flat because we love it really, we just bought furniture for 5000 euro in the last couple of months... We doesn't have sex since August. I told her I'll let her space and I will leave her alone because there are more rooms in the flat. Her problem was that if I was a bit down then she was up, or opposite, but it was rarely when we both were up. But we just started a new life with new opportunities...  She is almost sure that it won't work between us.
Last night I woke up when she put the book down and held my hand and today early she kissed my lips...
I don't want to lost her, we were so happy and we had so many plans. 

Do you have any advice on what happens in her brain? I am totally lost and confused and out of ideas...

She and I get along very well and for fear of ruining our friendship and our group of friends I never risked telling her that I liked her. On the other hand, he had already told her several times and she had rejected it, but this time it was not like that.

They had told me that surely he also liked me because we look like boyfriends: we walk with our hands intertwined; I hug her by her waist and she hugs me by her neck; We kiss a lot, except on the lips because we both reserve it for something already special; and when we are alone we also give each other eskimo kisses.

Confident that the other was not going to ask her for anything since she had already refused several times, I planned to declare myself the following Saturday; because these weeks we have been very busy with school and I did not want her to feel uncomfortable, if she rejected me, studying for exams.

The truth is that at first I did not feel sad but I was surprised by the news. But then I realized that once she even hinted to me that she wanted to be my girlfriend and I didn't understand her until now and on reflection I realized that it wasn't the only time, and now I feel sad, a bit silly and coward for not having declared my feelings to her sooner and for not having taken her hint.

We have some friends in common and we did hang out together a few times. I think he's great and has an awesome personality and I've grown quite attached to him to the point I get sad or upset when we don't talk as we usually talk everyday. Even when we don't have long conversations as we're busy, he always sends good morning or good night texts. 

He gives several mixed signals that he's into me as well and I don't know what to believe truly. I wanted to confess to him earlier, but his friend, who had liked me for a while now was against it and sort ruined things behind my back and I found out about it while scrolling through his phone(we were pretty close and exchanged phones to scroll through social media and all). Well my crush, was annoyed by his reaction and told me that he didn't want to stand in between whatever there was between the other guy and i when there was absolutely nothing.

I explained everything to him and things went smoothly after that and we're now closer to each other since i sort of unfriended the other guy as he was a bit too toxic about the whole thing. My point is that next week i am meeting with my crush and i want to ask him out, but i do not handle rejection really well and it would ruin our friendship if he doesn't feel the same way as i do. I don't know if I'd be a good partner as well as i have never been in a true relationship before and i might be leaving my current country for abroad studies and i don't want to be a barrier in his life and impose long distance relationship. 

So should I ask him out or not? Because if I do, i don't want it to be a non chalant relationship, I am looking for a quite serious one as this guy makes me feel really good about myself and i have never felt this comfortable with anyone before.

I had just gotten out of an extremely toxic relationship and that’s one of the many reasons I moved to Australia. 

We talk and call everyday, overseas he introduced me to his entire family and all his friends. It was his birthday the week after I got back and I sent him a package and a card saying how much I really appreciate and like him. Keep in mind it was only small. 

I think he really is in love with me and I am not sure why but it is scaring me. He’s bought me two pairs of shoes and has ordered me a big package I haven’t received yet. He has also booked tickets to see me in New Zealand at the start of next year. He tells me he wants to marry me one day and that he sees a future with me. I see a bright future with us but it freaks me out because I don’t want to feel like I owe him something. I have never asked him for anything and he’s never asked me for anything.

I don’t know if I love him. I think he is in love with me to do all these things. I don’t know if I can fall in love with someone so far away but i genuinely have very intense feelings for him. 

I get worried that if things don’t work out he will hold it against me because of everything he is doing for me. It’s just very intense and I’m not sure how i should be dealing with it.

So update: I saw Jack the day after I posted on here so on Wednesday the 26th of October. That was an absolute shit show. I got manipulated into going to back to his apartment because he kept telling me he had to tell me something he did while he was angry with me but he wanted to do it in privacy. 

I need to give a timeline for some events that contributed to Wednesday night. So Friday the 21st of October Jack and I went to Karaoke with some of his friends and his friend Michelle and her boyfriend brought along an acquaintance of theirs Dina. 

The whole night Dina was flirting was Jack and I was pretty uncomfortable, however I left it be because I trusted Jack. Moving forward to Wednesday night when I saw him again. After we got back to his apartment so he could tell me what he did. Jack told me he was angry with me on Monday  because I cancelled our plans last minute because my mom was having a horrible asthma attack and I didn’t feel comfortable leaving her. 

So Jack went on to explain that after Friday night Dina got dm’d him on insta and she was being even more flirtly. He told me he didn’t respond. Then on Monday because he was angry with me he decided to respond to Dina.  He told her he’d break things off with me and get with her. 

It just went downhill from there, If I wasn’t in complete shock at that point I would’ve just left right then and there. Then he started to hug me and I started to get up to get some water. He picked me up and I made a small joke about whether I was heavy to which he bluntly stated I was and I needed to do more cardio, he then followed that up with telling me it’s not his place to say that and then adding I should change my diet. I would like to add, I go to the gym 2 - 6 days a week depending on how sore I am. The cherry on top was when I was trying to leave and he blocked the door to his apartment preventing me from leaving, he wanted to kiss me more and I wanted to leave and I couldn’t so the only option I had was to give him what he wanted. 

So I can tick off my body dysmorphic disorder, my trust issues, and my ptsd being trigger. Needless to say I dodged a bullet and I’m glad things didn’t work out with Jack because he’s  nothing  I want to have around.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7605861,public,self,Update on my previous post about whether I ruined my new relationship for bringing up my PTSD,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0zlol/update_on_my_previous_post_about_whether_i_ruined/,all_ads,6,

My love language is quality time. I don’t find myself needing more than that To feel loved. 

A lot of this can probably be traced back to our upbringings, she had an insecure attachment bond where as I had a secure attachment. It’s led to an undiagnosed depression (she is in the process of seeing a doctor for treatment) and general anxiety for her. I’m neurotypical. This is not a brag, just providing context.

I love my wife very much. When we discovered love languages I was overjoyed that there were all these ways I could vary and express my love to her. Now, I find myself overwhelmed and even resentful at times. I struggle mostly with acts of service and words of affirmation. I try to view the acts of service through the lenses of love, but it’s been difficult for me because at times I feel like a butler. She will ask for a glass of water 3-4 times a day, ask me to run upstairs and grab something, etc. tiny fetch requests that compound and make me feel like I never am able to just sit like she does. In my house growing up we got up and got our own water.  If we needed something from another room I couldn’t imagine asking someone else in the house to get up and go get it for me. I’m conflicted because these are easy ways for me to show her she is loved, but it’s at the cost of constantly interrupting what I’m doing. For this I would like to hear some ways I can express to her “I need time to do my own thing and relax without getting up to do anything for the next few hours”. This also feeds into the issue that I am introverted and don’t get to spend a lot of time truly alone. We can go in different rooms for a bit but I’ll inevitably get a text after 20 minutes saying she wants water, headache medicine, let the dog out, etc.

As for the other languages, they vary hour by hour. I never know which one she needs and it can change in an instant. Sometimes she needs physical touch the most and other times she doesn’t want to be touched at all. Sometimes we spend quality time (great for both of us) but when her mood changes, it’s over. The constant switching of needs has me feeling like I’m always on the back foot and thus has her feeling unloved at times.

We’ve brought this up with our marriage counselor and she suggests that she try to treat her depression first to see if that helps. Mainly I need ways to say that I cannot possibly keep up with the requests without building resentment, but I still want her to know she’s loved. 

Do I move my office out of our common area and into a spare room where I can tell her I’m going to relax and play games for a while, please let me have some down time? Knowing how she is, I know this would surely make her start to think I don’t want to be around her. Sometimes It feels like I come home from work and just start a different job. I don’t want to feel like I’m working in order for her to feel loved. I’m very conflicted here.

I didn't even want to go but went anyway because he is also about to switch military duty stations. I had texted my girlfriend that I was bored and didn't want to be there, and she went out with some friends. I stayed about an hour longer than I initially said in the text because I was a little angry that she had just told me that she decided to stay over Thanksgiving weekend with a friend of the family. Which happens to be a guy. This is part of what killed my mood while with my friend, and something I was going to talk with her about after. My friend's girlfriend had to go back to work and then I mentioned to him about what my girlfriend had said, and that I was just going to go home. He was way too drunk though, so I told him I would give him a ride home since I didn't really drink. While driving back we started talking about my relationship with my girlfriend and also about his PCS. He wanted to keep drinking, and wanted to talk about a few other things. So I took him to my house so he could drink a few beers and we could finish talking. When I went to the bathroom my girlfriend had texted and he typed her back a message from my phone that wasn't mean, but the context was definitely like ""you need to make better decisions."" I yelled at him about it because that was uncalled for and he shouldn't have texted her with my phone. Then I drove him back to his house.

Obviously, at this point I wanted to talk to my girlfriend at this point to see how much trouble I was in for his text. And also to talk about this situation about staying overnight at another guy's house (friend of the family or not, it just isn't right). She called as soon as I was getting back but here is where it gets to a point that I can't understand as being reasonable. Even though I told her all of the above, her reaction was the following (paraphrased): You are disgusting, you and him have to be gay, and we can't be together anymore because I don't want to die of AIDS.

That's what she said, but used much stronger language. And she somehow thinks that this is a reasonable response. I did get to ask her about the family friend, and when I asked about if she was sleeping with him (since that's the only reason I can fathom that the out of the blue reaction came from), she said no, but she also said ""I wish.""",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7605836,public,self,Trying to figure out if this is a reasonable reaction,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0zihe/trying_to_figure_out_if_this_is_a_reasonable/,all_ads,6,

Our relationship is very healthy other than this subject. We constantly work on our intimacy and having dates/ fun times to relief stress from other areas of our life such as work and education. However, when we got together I made it clear I didn’t want nicotine to be a part of our relationship, he said it was fine, he only used nicotine at parties. However, I found out from one of his best friends he was heavily using. (Not on purpose, his friend didn’t know my fiancé was pretending to be clean).

There’s been 4 instances where this issue has led to a fight:

1. I caught him with a pack of nicotine, he tried to gaslight me into thinking it was a PC part. I left the apartment and went to a friends place. We had a conversation where I made it clear I know it’s a hard addiction to deal with and that I am here but if he ever lied or gaslighted me again it would be the end. 

2. He went to a party and came home, I found him passed out in the hallway holding his head. Called the an ambulance cuz he was non-responsive. He got aggressive and the medics refused to help him. I had never seen him like that, I called his mom (who is a doctor), told her I found a lot of used nicotine packs in his pockets mixed with a crazy amount of alchohol he had consumed. He got really mad and said I was lying, that he was clean and I was trying to take that from him. 

3. I forgot my jacket and borrowed his, there was a full pack of nicotine in the pocket, I could tell it wasn’t old. He kept trying to convince me it was before he got clean, but the jacket was new so ? 

4. Found nicotine on the bathroom floor. Gave it to him and left the apartment.

I havnt talked to him since no. 4 happend this morning. Idk what to do, it’s such a massive break of trust and yet such a silly small thing to make a massive deal out of?
