I met this girl and she was so different than what I usually go for, she was more librarian then party chick. I wasn’t sure how it would go so I was hesitant but quickly fell in love with how sweet and kind and beautiful she was. We had a good 4 months. Not having sex we really got to connect(her idea that I actually would like to use in the future) when we first did it, it was awkward I’m confident but nervous when it comes to intimacy. Anyways after the deed she seemed to pull away. Going a month without seeing her just texting, when I would ask  if she wanted to hangout or come out with a group she would say her endometriosis was acting up, I understood that it was debilitating but the. She would hangout with other people. 

After awhile I told her we needed to talk, that’s when she broke up with me. I started going to therapy immediately because I thought it was my fault, I fucked up, I was clingy, the sex was bad, anything that came to mind I would beat myself up for it. She moved on and started to see a friend of mine, everyone hid it from me and I found out at a party i through for a mutual friend. I was so disappointed and heart broken I made a fool of myself that night. Shortly after I gave my friend the blessing to date her and for them to both be happy before cutting ties with him. 

They eventually started to fall apart for him being needy and a pervert I guess. Me and her started talking again like old times, I was just doing better, getting more hobbies and planned a big trip for myself. The weekend before my trip we had a big camp out and this girl invited me to stay an extra night with her and her friend from out of town.

I agreed, that night her friend secretly said to me “I like you a lot better then that other guy, it’s nice you make her laugh so hard”. Me, the girl and her friend had a good night, I cuddled with her before going to my own tent to sleep then said goodbye in the morning because I was off on the pre mentioned trip I planned.

On my trip I was driving around the province I live for a month. Every day We’d keep up, she gave me a book saying “I expect a book report when you are back” and wrote a cute note in it. She’d randomly phone me and we’d talk for hours, she drunk texted me I love you and always called me love (love bombing once again) the trip was great and returning home to her was exciting. We hung out a few times when I got back and seemed like we were building back the trust I lost from the first break. 

A few weeks later she was on her own trip out to the city her friend from the camping trip lived in, I tried to keep up with her while she was out there but not too much. When she got home I didn’t get to see her. Pain problems again, this went on for months. I talked to her every day over text but could never see her. She would occasionally go see her friends but not me. I told her it made me feel unwanted and she replied she was to prioritize those her are most important. Should have taken the hint. 

I still tried to keep the love there but texting and at the time it was enough for me. Her birthday came and I planned a get away trip with all her closest friends from our area and the friend from out of town. When I went to meet them for this get away things felt off, she could barely look at me. When we got to the cute cozy farm BnB I booked our mutual friend asked where me and this other dude were sleeping and I laugh and said with the birthday girl, our mutual friend was shocked and said “uhh no, she’s sleeping with her friends”. Things only got worse,  I could feel that everyone knew she didn’t like me anymore and I was the odd man out. 

That last day morning I quietly texted our mutual friend “does she not like me anymore?” Which she responded “she hasn’t liked you since the first break up, she thought you were just friends” which I know is a lie but I can’t convince anyone of that so why try. 

It’s been a month since that day, I tried once to talk to her and she used her pain to avoid it and I haven’t tried since, she’s unfollowed  me on everything but my main accounts, deleted comments and unliked all my pictures since I’ve know her, also unfollowing accounts we both followed, she has blocked or doesn’t check my stories.

Maybe it's because my grandma lives with my parents and myself so she may think there's some witchcraft involved idk. His mom hasn't liked me from the beginning of our relationship (2 years) and I don't really care about that but it's been starting to get to me. We have arguments because of his mother at least once a month over something she does or says. Example, she made me return over 5kg worth of clothing because she didn't like that my boyfriend gifted them to me. She made a huge deal about it not wanting to shut up for months. I returned them, my mother has forbidden me from sleeping over at their house anymore, and all in all my SO and I had a big fight afterwards because of all that sh\*t. So after many uncomfortable situations I decided it was best for me to not come over anymore. My boyfriend has a hard time accepting that and got mad a few times when I rejected coming over. So his mom is not home currently so I have been coming over for the last 4-5 days. The only person there is his dad. I considered that maybe his dad wouldn't appreciate me being there only because his wife isn't there so I tried playing cool and making my boyfriend go out with me so we don't spend the entire day at his house so his dad can have some privacy. His dad and I are okay I guess, he's a good man, the only thing that rubs me the wrong way is that he can be a tad bit too rude when he isn't in the mood. One time I left my hoodie in the dining area on a chair (didn't remember to take it with me to my bf's room) and he got pissed by that that he literally threw it in my face. I wasn't offended but it made me feel bad over an honest mistake. He could've just told me to not leave my stuff around their house. So today was one of those days where my boyfriend wasn't about to budge about leaving his home. Our sex life has suffered greatly by these issues too so today he would not want to go anywhere until we had sex. I wasn't in the mood but I was like okay sure, I wanted to satisfy his needs at least, and then his dad knocked on the door in the middle of the act. My boyfriend yelled out for him not to come in but he did anyway. It was awkward, I just put the first thing I found on his bed over myself. It was so embarrassing. He didn't look or anything, and I noticed he was nervous when he came home but I didn't expect him to violate our privacy like that. I instantly got mad at my boyfriend and he understood why I was mad and finally agreed on going out. After this encounter I feel even more uncomfortable to be in his home and this whole situation got too messy, I never wanted it to come to his where I have to actually consider breaking things off with the man I love over his parents but I don't want the rest of my life for them to invade our privacy and our way of living.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7575959,public,self,Should I (22F) consider leaving my boyfriend (24M) because his parents are becoming unbearable?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yy4g1o/should_i_22f_consider_leaving_my_boyfriend_24m/,all_ads,6,

Me and N have known each other for a while now, we met at a group but according to him we also met once as children, and we’ve hung out a bit. I’ve even been to his a few times and he introduced me to a weekly social group around a month and a half ago.

In mid October, he went from talking to me a lot especially at this group and inviting me around to his to being super distant, mostly ignoring me and only giving short responses. Even on a day where we were at this big event with some other members when I brought up being stressed, he made a small comment saying don’t worry and walked away. Even if I sent N a text (for example, ‘have you watched that new show yet?’ Which we both expressed wanting to watch) he would take days to respond.

I asked him about it a few times and he said he was stressed so I thought that’s understandable, just expressed how it’s upset me. 2 days ago we were at group and he was being distant with me again, but I went out for a bit to help a member of staff pick up some shopping and when I came back he was super talkative with our mutual friend A.

And that’s when we get to the conversation that’s pissed me off. I’m only going to make a quick summary as I can be a bit wordy.

“This is the last time I’m going to say this as I’ve said it before but why do you keep ignoring me? I’ve noticed you still talking to others like normal, and we can’t solve the issue if you don’t tell me what’s up. You have three options. 1. Tell me the issue and we can work it out 2. If you have no issues figure out why you’re ignoring me specifically and solve it or 3. Keep ignoring me and I’ll ignore you back since you’re not bothered”

He said ‘what the fuck are you talking about’, I mentioned again how he’s been distant with me, he said ‘it’s probably tiredness’, so I said ‘get some rest and sort it out, it’s been weeks and you’re making it other peoples problem.’ He then said ‘I don’t see it that way but sorry I haven’t been feeding you enough attention’ which came as passive aggressive to me.

I said ‘I get how it’s hard to notice your own issues sometimes as I do it too, but you have to remember I have rejection sensitive dysphoria so I’m a lot more hurt by things like that’ he doesn’t respond for ages but finally comes back with ‘I don’t have a problem with you but I’ll keep that in mind 😂’  I said ‘good to know but it’s not a laughing matter’

He then says ‘with the long ass messages I’m getting off you it reminds me of a typical jealous anime chick kicking off’ and all I can say is ffs N.

He says I’m hilarious and gives him anime vibes and tries to make the conversation normal, but I feel belittled and mocked for expressing myself, and although he doesn’t know this I have a hard time doing that as I prefer to mask and put on a perfect persona. I’ve left him on read for now.

Now it might sound petty but he’s upset me before:

• when we met he found my facebook instagram and twitter without me mentioning them which upset me and my friends said it was weird but I forgave him

• he invited me to comic-con and I said I will think about it but I’m trying to save money, he talked as if I confirmed yes and also wanted me to go as a specific character from an anime I hadn’t watched which was expensive (we watched a few episodes since) which I said even if I did go and bought a cosplay it would have to be cheap and a character I know

• My friends pointed out that it was weird that he specifically wanted me to go as the maid character (not a sexy maid costume or anything, for those curious it’s the one from black butler) I don’t think there was any intent though because he just says I’m the irl version of her (I literally just have the same glasses) 

• Has accused me of having a bragging/boasting problem twice but the first time was me saying I know a lot about a hyperfixation (it’s an autism group) and second was giving him advice to make getting a vaccination go better

So I’m not sure if I should cut off the friendship or give him another chance at it, I’d have to be civil until December though because it would make the group awkward and I at least want to check out this place we all arranged to go to for my own personal reasons, but in general it’s been lackluster for me now.

TL/DR: friend has been ignoring me for a while but been fine with others. I ask him and he’s apathetic then made weird comments that upset me and felt mocking.

Now I don’t know if I should message her just in case they are still together so that she’s aware and doesn’t waste any more of her time and energy with him, or if they are actually broken up it would just be unnecessary to message her and stir up things with him again. 

I (25F) met this guy (M26), we’ll call him John, back in July while he was visiting my city. We hit it off really well, like out of a romance novel kind of feeling. He was great at communication in the beginning, very thoughtful, affectionate, successful, and we had an amazing connection romantically and as friends. He reciprocated all of my feelings and would be the one to start important conversations or share his feelings with me. He lived in the same state as my family and when I came to visit, he drove down to meet them and stay for the weekend (twice). So things were moving quick between us.

Though after he went back to his state after being here for a month things changed. He would get very distant on the weekends but our regular communication would resume during the week. On the weekends he told me he would stay at his friend’s house and work on his car and whatnot. I believed him but after a few weekends of him acting weird and barely speaking to me I got suspicious. I did my due diligence and dug the best I could but I couldn’t find any dirt on him. Later on I ended up confronting him and asking if there was another woman and he told me there wasn’t and explained why he acted the way he did on the weekends and apologized for his behavior and sympathized with my feelings. 

Shortly after, I still had this bad feeling and did some real digging and ended up finding out who his ex was (I suspected he might’ve gotten back together with her since when we met he said he was pretty fresh out of a relationship) and found her Facebook in which her cover photo was the two of them together (from 2 years ago). I confronted him about it and he said that it was an old picture and he didn’t think she used her Facebook anymore and again explained that they’re broken up and why they broke up. I didn’t trust him and ended up finding out that his “friend’s” house he would go to was her father’s house in which I assumed she probably still lived at. 

I knew I wanted to end things with him because of the lack of trust but I decided to try and get the truth out of him one more time. He said he did go to her dads house because they got really close while he was together with her (which I understood) and said she wanted to get back together with him but he was done with that relationship. He said it was unhealthy and he wasn’t happy, among other things. He also said she had her own place but she would occasionally come over and he would see her but nothing would happen. I chose to believe him, but our relationship felt unsteady after. 

About a month later I discovered John had another Instagram and he would not let me follow it, he lied and said he hasn’t been on that account in a year, when I noticed he had liked his friend’s post from only a month prior. Then a few days later a girl’s profile popped up on my page that was a recommendation for me to follow. His instagram that I did follow was following her and in her bio was John’s last name. Turns out he was seeing her as well so I completely ended things with him and haven’t spoke to him since. Now I’m wondering if he did lie about his ex actually being his ex and if I should message her. 

They had been together for 4 years, and I just know if I were in her shoes I wouldn’t want to waste anymore time or possibly get married and find out later that he was unfaithful. I also don’t know if they actually did break up and it just be a waste to message her and stir up something for no reason.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7575942,public,self,"I was dating this guy for a few months and turns out he had another girl.

I got randomly booted (no one reached out prior to saying I was upsetting anyone or being annoying).

OP: “I can’t tell if you removed me as a joke or not, but if it’s serious I respect that &amp; it was a great time while it lasted”

X: “There was a lot of weird stuff being said and people get to to talking and nobody knows if youre serious or making stuff up. It was difficult to trust a lot of what was being said. Being winter now, it's the end anyways.”

OP: “I don’t understand, I didn’t make any of this stuff up.  If it’s just too weird for everyone to handle it’s fine, but I have no reason to lie about it?”

X: “Not just this, just lots of things. It feels like you're always just saying things that people want to hear or trying to over play situations all the time.”

The thing is, I know I'm a little different. From her, and most girls. I basically want to (and sometimes do) live in my van and just go climbing and mountain biking. And as interested as I am in a relationship with someone, they're not things I feel I can sacrifice. Happily I will fit everything around everything though.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a hard topic or just casually talking. Sometimes there is engagement momentarily, but a flip switches and he just stops responding to me. Most of the time, what I’m saying falls on deaf ears.  I get no response to anything I’m saying. This is even true for phone calls, where I don’t know if we’ve gotten disconnected. Usually it’s just us sitting in silence while I wait for his response until I just say my goodbyes and hang up. 

I’ve explained to him multiple times that this either makes me feel like he’s not listening to me or he doesn’t care about what I’m talking about. It makes me embarrassed and irrationally angry. I’ve tried to accept this about him, but it irritates me to the core. It makes me feel embarrassed that I talk to him and still expect a response when I know there won’t be one. 

When it comes to serious topics, I feel like I’m missing out on someone that can help/be my partner in life.  These instances range from getting a new pet, serious career changes at work, family emergencies and the most I get is a “I don’t know”.

I (M19) have been thinking this over in my head for the last 2 years. When I was 17 and had just started college I had begun to talk to a girl who shared a class with me. She had a bit of a reputation as a badass. I wasn’t exactly a good kid either, however as soon as I was threatened by a call home to my dad, I’d behave instantly. Anyway, we started talking and after a few weeks of light flirting we agreed to meet up. We done this a couple of times, all of the time we kept it completely secret, primarily as a result of me asking for this. I had begun to get feelings for her but I was too afraid to be with her publicly, purely as a result of my own worry to my self image in college. One meet, I was meant to get the bus home. She told me that her house would be free and we could go back there. I agreed and we went back, a few minutes later we were having sex at hers. I lost my virginity that day and she was amazing. I remember walking back to the bus stop with her, she tried to hold my hand and I refused. A lot of thoughts were in my head, worrying she’d get pregnant and if I had to make her my girlfriend now. Like I said, I was just starting to care about her and but again my worry about my self image held me back. We were awkward for a few days. No real contact or communication. A week later randomly on the walk home from college I got a call from a friend telling me that he had no idea that I’d been “shagging her for a while.” I panicked and sent her a long text which consisted mainly of me being angry at her for telling our whole college. We argued and eventually blocked each other. I told the whole college that she was lying and because of her reputation everyone believed me. We never spoke again as our classes were divided mor. I saw one of her friends at a party she was not at and awkwardly asked if she could pass on an apology. (I don’t think she would’ve). One year on I find myself writing this, I’ve matured a lot since then, I’ve let friends go and I’ve tried to get more in touch with both my own emotions and feelings and those of the ones around me.

We had a rocky period of time where we came on and off 3 times in a 1.5 years span.

She's been my first and only gf and the only girl I had sex with (tbh I had sex with a friend during one of those breaks ups but I was too drunk and awkward so I don't count it because of how it went (we almost did nothing)).

Now, after a year of coming back together, I have this problem that bothers me very much. I feel like a have a platonic crush (if that's even a thing) on another girl. I met this girl in one of my classes. We only talked only about math stuff but someone I created this scenario in which she likes me (maybe because one of my friends told me that she thought she was into me).

So now I feel like this and it s very weird for me and I feel very bad. When I see her in the common areas of my uni I feel the need to make up an excuse to approach her and talk a little bit. But I stop myself and go away. I also found her on IG but decided not to follow because I feel like it's cheating (or very disrespectful at least) towards my gf.

I know that people in relationships can (and it's quite usual) fantasize (I even talked about it with my therapist) but I don't know if those fantasies are supposed to be merely sexual. I feel very bad about this, I stop myself of course and I was wondering if its normal/usual.

I was planning to talk about this with my therapist next week but I need to calm my mind and stop feeling guilty.

TL;DR: I am in a relationship but I have a platonic crush on another girl.

I am 25 (F) in a rather awkward situation with 30 (M). Let’s call him, K.

So K and I met when I was 23, just as I was about to leave the country for this exciting new career. I followed them first and we started speaking. At the time,  I was with someone (3 years) and things were rough. K and I just had each other on socials. When I was about to leave the country and I was saying Bye to people, K and I met. Mind you, this was a super turbulent time for me. I had a few things that came up in my family, I was coming of anti-depressants (abruptly), drinking heavily saying bye to people and feeling unsure about leaving my bf who tbf back then, was probably happy to see the back of me as we hadn’t been getting on.

Anyway, I meet K one evening. Magical night. Best sex ever. Passionate, instant connection - I had a bit to drink too but yeah it was great. Didn’t intend on cheating but  just wanted an escape from the stress of moving but did so. I told my bf at the time the following day and me and him opened the relationship up. I see K one final time before leaving the country. We had sex again - I move country, we speak a bit. Suddenly, and I think this two weeks in new country, I decide to unfollow him. He notices it, and I think we have a little back and forth. I then tell him that I have a BF and he expresses he felt lead on. I feel bad but I was super defensive and toxic. He tried to get at me by trying to follow some girls I know, which did not work. He even subtweeted about how grateful he is that he dodged something that wasn’t meant for him.

My bf at the time and I break up a month later. I move on, meet someone new and fall in love. We get pressured by our family when they find out to islamically wed. So we did, and to be honest wrong move. Placed crazy pressure on us from all sides. I was trying to make my career work and they were trying to get back on their feet post losing their job due to covid-19. Anyway, we have a toxic relationship, constantly breaking up and whenever we did break up I’d leave the country - the first time around I was heartbroken and tbh vulnerable. I thought about how this could all be Karma. I was thinking about K especially and apologised. K took the apology well but did express he felt weird for months. I go back to my ex and leave the country again. I believe even the day I was leaving, I let him know I was getting back with him and he was like are you sure?! 

Once I am back, my ex (partner at the time that I went back to) was controlling and sends K a dm asking him to stop speaking to me. My ex used to check my phone. He may have seen a tweet or a dm (not anything from when I had left though and had the interaction apologising). I message K on an old phone as my phone was being monitored. K said that ‘it’s happening again’. I felt so embarrassed and told him to ignore him. He did so but was cross and asked me if I am ok. Tbh, it was an abusive relationship. I just said I am but I know deep down he knew it was not normal especially as he knew from the first time that I left and got back in contact with him that there were some issues (I didn’t go into detail).

Anyway, I go about my life. Eventually broke up with him around March 2022. I come back to my home country in the summer permanently. K
And I spoke a lil when I broke up with my ex. We spoke again when I came back. He wants to meet. I shut it down in the summer as he was suggestive of sex. He apologised That he read things wrong and thought there was some sexual tension. I wasn’t in the place back then but I changed my mind recently and got back in touch with him to let him know. I actually like K, or the idea of him atleast as I haven’t seen him since late 2020. He seems sweet, quirky and is actually very good looking. We are from the same country and have a lot in common other than that. I feel like out of all the people I have been with, he seems like a good fit. I am just scared of our super shitty foundation.

So as the title states, I found this amazing human being on discord of all places and I have met them in person and it was a blast. We clicked so naturally and we became extremely close together in less than a year. Our relationship was a strange phenomenon for both of us, cause it's extremely hard for me to get attached to people honestly but when I do infatuation kicks into over gear. I call her damn near everyday for months straight. Talk to her on the phone for hours. I rarely do this even with close family members. But because I started to just love everything she does, I started question my sexuality. I mean- if I had to wonder whether or not I want to date my new-found best friend I figured that I may be a little fruity to begin with. Although I was apprehensive about making a move because I don't know what romantic attratiction feels like. I could confuse it with friendship, I have done it before. But after flirting ( I did the flirting) and such she asked me out - I said yes.

After that, my feelings seemed to have plateau. I have become less comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with her even though I would lose sleep over liking her? It could be fear. I am fearful that it may end up in diaster. Don't want to hurt her by being wish-washy. Even though she understands that we can take it slow, go on dates, see how I feel, I still feel.. bad? Also, I noticed that small things that didn't bother me before- bothers me now. I get annoyed. And when we argue and my feelings are hurt (small ass arguement over a TV show no less lol.) every part of me is telling me to run. I withdraw, abd my emotions disappear.

We are in a friend group where we play D&amp;D and hang out, doing other miscellaneous activities in person. We are also always doing things online in discord calls where we play video games and chill. For the both of us this is our main ""friend group"" that we do mostly all social hangouts with. We both have some separate friends from the group but for the most part this is it. This group initially formed about 4 years ago with a BF/GF couple combining their friend groups they each had from high school. So my buddies and I combined with one of their girlfriend's friend group.

For just over two years ago now I have developed stronger feelings for this friend. I couldn't really talk to any friends about this since it involved myself and another person in the group. So in an attempt to try to ""talk"" to someone about this I decided to write a diary of sorts to myself. Whenever I wanted to talk to someone about this and get my feelings out there, I would just write how I felt and keep it to myself. As if not to bother my friends with my problems. I never brought this up with anyone since I **do not** want to ruin this friend group and friendships built. I have always felt that once this situation gets prevalent in a group that it can potentially fracture and divide it. My feelings have been kind of on-again, off-again for a while now. Over the last couple months I have gotten back, in a now stronger than ever, on-again feelings for her; getting worse of the last couple weeks. I think these feelings became more real to me when a buddy from the group and I got really drunk a couple weeks ago. I drunkenly spilled these things that I've kept to myself over the past two years and since then, the only thing I can really think about is her. Hence the reason for my post here on Reddit.

When it comes to romantic relationships, I am very poor at understanding if the other person has similar feelings to myself. I genuinely love every moment spent with her. She is the only person to truly bring a smile to my face and make me want to be a better person. I am currently in-between jobs and there are some days, like today, where the only reason I am pulling myself out of bed in the morning is the possibility to chat with her online later in the day. Over the last two years we are constantly the two in the discord calls that stay up super late till 3am+ chatting and hanging out. We like consuming plenty of different media together like watching YouTube/Netflix/anime, listening to music, and playing video games. I also try to do things in person like go to the movies, food, or outside activities like frisbee golf. These are mainly with a small group from the friend group or in rarer cases, just the two of us. I think she enjoys hanging out with me but I don't have a good understanding of her feelings. Especially since she is Asexual which makes it harder to get a grasp on, but has had a boyfriend in the past while still being ace.

Basically I am asking for advice on what to do in my situation. The more I think about her/want to be with her and to express my feelings; the more I get a sinking feeling in my chest. I want to open up to remove that weight on myself but feel it will potentially harm the friend group as a whole, and like I said before **do not** want to ruin this group and especially the friendship I have with her.

TL;DR: I (23M) have had a crush on a friend (22F) for a couple of years now. We are both in a friend group that involves the majority of any shared friends. I don't want to ruin the friendship or group, but also want to feel better.

Together for 5 years. Engaged for 2 months. We were happy currently, no dramas. 

I was driving to a sports game in London starting 6:30pm, the game usually takes 1h 30mins but multiple breaks in between. When i got there I saw a text saying she forgot the key to the house. I texted back 10mins later saying go to this particular station (ok area), wait in a cafe, or go to my mum as she is close. I noticed the message did not ‘deliver’ thus assuming she is underground I put my phone down to begin the game.

After i finished the first game 45mins later I looked at my phone to realise she tried to contact me multiple times.  

She replied 8 minutes after my text suggesting solutions saying she is almost at the station and asking if she should go to that station or not. She also said she does not want to go cafe, nor my mum and wants to go home. She then says she got of at a station 3 stops before that station to call me.

She then continued to text saying things like:

 ‘know I’m in trouble and decide not to look at phone’
‘Guess I’ll just be sitting and wait for you to reply all night’
‘Its so cold outside as well’
‘Can you be sensible’
‘You know that I’m stuck outside but do not care to pick up your freaking phone???????’
‘Your sport is so important isn’t it’
‘And you don’t have a single decency to keep and yet on it knowing I’ll try to contact’
‘Been sitting here trying to contact you for the last 20 minutes now in the cold’
‘Really show how much you care isnt it’

Fast forward 20mins after her last text above I replied:

‘Omg sorry i started playing i said go mum and i saw your message did not send. Said go mum and i can pick you up. Sorry i should have texted the location. Where are you?’

*tried calling, she declined*

I texted:

‘Omg can you pick and talk where are you’

She ten finally texted back saying she doesnt not want to talk and want to go home, saying:

‘I waited for you to tell me where I can pick up the key. But you rather play your game’

*tried calling, she declined again*

She then sends:
‘And let me stranded on the middle of the cold. Can’t wait till i text back’

‘I don’t want to hear from you. Do whatever. I’ll sit in the cold as long as i have to’

I then apologised again and asked where she is, can she pick up the phone.

Came back with:

‘Ignored me for an hour knowing im in trouble. But you cannot care less. In your head there’s no single thought that i might try to contact you. Yes for being completely ignorant and thoughtless’

‘You’re cruel’

At this point I am already annoyed and tried to explain that I assumed she is going to wait somewhere - not in the cold outside! And worst she can sit somewhere in a cafe, best go visit my mum. I then said she is blaming me for leaving her in ‘the dark and cold alone’ whilst she could have waited somewhere.

She replies: ‘I simply could not think that you’ll be that heartless’ (7:46pm)

At this point I started getting ready to go back. I noticed she just came near to the house at 7:48pm.

I was shocked that she literally decided to go wait outside the house. We then continued back and forth, she accusing me of not caring, sports being more important and I saying back why the hell she decided to go sit by the door. And I said:
‘Im sorry but you are stupid to be waiting outside’

Our home station has a massive local pub right next to it as a very last option.

Anyhow I put the phone down and I get back at 8:41 pm.

I greeted her with a funny thing we usually do when we call each other ‘stuuuuupid’ when the other makes something silly. She did not respond and when i tried to touch her she turned away.

I kept asking why the hell she would do this, does not make sense.

She quickly ran upstairs to the changing room i followed her to talk, she took the ring off and gave it to me. At this point she started crying hysterically. 

Again was in shock. What followed was loads of back and forth shouting from her  ‘how I could have done something like this’ and from me ‘how on earth are you that stupid to sit outside for an hour’.

She shouted its over. I shouted its over. 

She went to another room to cry. I went downstairs. We are in diff parts of the house. She isn’t talking. I am not talking. 

I totally get it was a bad judgement call on my part, I realise I could have just shared the exact location, or waited 10mins to see if she replies. However I did not think it was an ‘emergency’. She has phone, she has money, theres my mum and theres a number of places you can ‘crash’ for 30mins with a drink until i reply.

I want to go and hug her and say lets forget this stupid thing but I know she would not talk as she needs time to cool off. Maybe I will try tomorrow.

I am thinking of saying sorry (again) and buying flowers tomorrow and see if she talks.

Deep down I want for her to take responsibility and admit what she did was not smart but I do not know if this will cause us to break up if i bring it up again. 

Would appreciate your thoughts!

We all grew up together and we’re all 31 now. I have two friends. Stacy and Amanda. Stacy lost her high school sweetheart/husband about 5 years ago to cancer. At the time Stacy has one son who is 7. She takes him everywhere and they are inseparable and it’s adorable. Stacy has never taken her wedding ring off. Stacy Appearently promised her late husband she will remain faithful to him until they meet again. Stacy has said she has never regretted that promise, and she is very proud of her loyalty. When she talks about it she always smiles and looks at her ring. It’s something that truly makes her happy. 
The only thing about Stacy is she can be a little rude when a man shows her attention.
Amanda is a little different. She has no interest in getting married right now, which is ok. What is not ok is that she constantly scolds Stacy for still being faithful to her husband.

Yesterday we were at lunch while Stacy’s son was at school. Amanda asked Stacy if she’s ever going to move on. Stacy said she met her soulmate and she has moved in to her next chapter. Amanda asked if she’s ever even went on a date with anyone. Stacy said no. Amanda asked if she’s really stayed 100% faithful all these years. Stacy nodded and gave a genuine smile. Not a smart ass smile, she was genuinely happy to be reminded of her loyalty. She’s very proud of it. Amanda rolled her eyes and stacy said “do you have a problem with that?” and I quickly changed the subject.

Amanda went up to use the ladies room and stacy was telling me that her and her son are going to go to Hawaii for her 10 year anniversary. I said “that’s very sweet I’m sure he’ll love that” and she was showing me all the water slides at the resort because her son loves water slides.

This guy walked over to our table and asked to sit with us. Stacy said “oh sorry this seat is taken” and he asked stacy for her number. Stacy said no and was starting to be really mean to the guy. The guy said “I just think you’re really nice looking” and stacy said “I’m married, can’t you see? Now go away” the dude called her a bitch and said “I know you want to leave with me” and she said “I know I DONT now get the fuck away from me” 

The dude didn’t budge and I said I’ll literally call the police if he doesn’t leave and he did. Amanda came back laughing. Stacy asked what’s so funny and she said she got off the phone with her mom and she told her a funny story.

Anyway, we all went home. Amanda texted me and said she told the dude at the restaurant that Stacy said he was hot but was too shy to approach him. Stacy, is still a faithful wife, and she would never say anything like that. She’s not that type of lady. Even if she did, I was there the whole time and she didn’t even look at him.

However, sometimes I get a strong sense of him pulling back because he feels like he is not good enough. I have a pretty good-paid job, he doesn't. Due to an injury, he had to leave his old job (Bodyguard), which he loved above everything, he still talks about it. Now he found a new passion and is currently in a traineeship for it working his aff off for a really bad salary. He tells me how shit he feels about that salary. Because of that, he started to work part-time in my brother's company (that's how I met him, however, we don't want to make it public until I move back, besides the fact it is really at the beginning). I also feel like this power dynamic kind of bothers him, aka he is working for my family. He has fun doing so, but you know what I mean? He is a great employee, and my brother always calls him when he is needed. He also started to do some favours for my dad, and in general, he is always around helping. So from the start on, he kind off saw me as the ""Big Boss Daughter"" or ""Junior Boss Sister"", and he could not restrain from that when introducing me to his brother. I also realise every time something comes up (like a tax fine or so), he pulls back communication-wise excessively. He is a very masculine man who always wants to pay for everything, and feels like he needs to provide, so I feel like these financial issues bother him. He told me he hates the fact that he has debt to pay off because he wants to build a house and all that. My family owns several houses, and he knows that, so again, I feel like this feels a bit shit for him. Sometimes he expresses things like ""you don't know nothing about that, you always get everything you want and your dad would buy you the world"".

 Me and my family are very humble and lovely because my parents started with 0. He always says how he admires my dad and how he hates that his dad never did so much and that he had to grow up shitty.  I almost feel like he always seeks my dad's approval, so I guess coming out to him that he wants his beloved daughter (my dad always says how much he loves me) can intimidate him. 

I feel kind of bad, but I don't know how to address it without making him feel like ""I know I have and earn way more than you, but really don't worry about it"". I try to cheer him up that the traineeship is soon over and he gets a higher salary. And that its not a bad thing to wait with a house a couple of years. But yeah, I don't know what else to do or if I should even do something. Especially from a distance. I realized I was pushy on him coming over or to meet in the middle and stay in a hotel, because he needs his weekends part time jobs + gas prizes are crazy right now, so I at least stopped that.

She always had a habit of being on the phone and she still does, she says she is having trouble with her classes and while I understand I am too but I don't let it influence my idea of being in a relationship. She still talks on the phone everytime I see, she avoids me to say the least, she doesn't even see my texts that I send her just to ask if she needs help with her classes.

I’ll get straight into it. This is a two-part question, apologies for length.

One of my (33F) best friends (35M) had a massive heart attack a week and a half ago and has been in a coma and on a respirator ever since. He was taken off sedation a few days ago, and today had a feeding tube inserted, and a tracheotomy performed, to help him breathe and get good nutrition. The MRIs they recently performed showed some damage to the right hemisphere of his brain, due to lack of oxygen during the attack. 

Obviously, this is super serious, and the doctors have been cautious with telling us what his prognosis may be long-term. I can’t blame them, of course, but it’s been pretty scary not to have definite information and just know what’s up definitively, y’know?

All that being said! Today he showed signs of attempting to open his eyes and move his hands. His father, his girlfriend, and all of our friends are all totally overjoyed! He’s definitely a fighter, and I’ve gone from feeling totally hopeless to somewhat actually hopeful that he might make a good recovery, given time. Forgive me, I’m a bit of a pessimist, so it’s been hard for me. But there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel, for lack of a better metaphor!

So this might be a silly question, but when I visit him, what can I/we do? I have planned to bring the book he had recently asked to borrow from me, and read him a few chapters. My friends have been bringing portable music players and playing him his favorite music, telling him about their days, just chilling and holding his hand, etc. Those are all great ideas, but I’m just wondering if there is something really obvious that any of us missing? I will obviously ask his doctors and nurses, but if any of you have any personal experience with visiting a loved one in a situation like this, I would absolutely love to hear from you.

I would also like advice from any of you who have had someone close go through a similar event. As he recovers, how can we help him thrive? I can’t imagine how traumatic this will be for him, but we all want to be there to ensure that he gets the help he needs. Does anyone have any good books or article recommendations, or just anecdotal personal experiences to share? What might recovery look like? How can we, his friends and family, be there to help him as he adjusts and heals? And, on a more personal level, how can we all best support one another as friends and family right now?

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!

She is the love of my life and I love her dearly. We have had our battles and worked through them just like any relationship. 

I’m fairly busy as I manage a company with 21+ people and 24+ trucks and have a lot of information that runs through my head day to day….not an excuse but something I deal with. 

There’s always this sore spot when it comes to me remembering certain details about things she tells me about her. I’ve never claimed to have a great memory and I’m rather forgetful in all parts of my life. I do understand this and I admit my forgetfulness whenever it comes up. I apologize for it and do whatever I can to make it up to her. 

What gets me….is she’s better then me when it comes to remembering but also doesn’t have the greatest memory and she has admitted this to me…. I feel there would  be a little more understanding….

It’s to the point now when I forget certain things, she gets annoyed and becomes distant. She feels that if I’m not remembering these things, I don’t give a shit about her….this is so not true and I’ve tried to explain this…but I totally understand how it looks and makes her feel. I love her so so much and would do anything for her…

I’m the type of boyfriend to write love notes and leave them where she can find them, plan special candle lit dinners, make her a personalized advent calendar, show her my affection often etc. I’m pretty soft when it comes to love and I guess this is my way of showing my love her. She seems to appreciates these things…

But remembering things is where I struggle and is one of the things I often fail to give her. I feel I’m just hurting her at this point and that’s the last thing I ever wanted to do. I try so hard to remember these certain things but I always manage to forget something that cause tension. I’m concerned I’m just a shitty BF and I just can’t love her how she needs to be loved….it’s tearing me apart.

She is a good girlfriend, but she has toxic tendencies like gaslighting me (distorting motives behind my actions, blaming me for her feeling upset from external circumstances, saying I’m dragging arguments when she’s the aggressive one) and raising her voice at me during arguments when I’m gentle and only try to understand her. Well, I called her out recently on it, had clear evidence for it this time, and had the courage to tell her. She felt really bad, cried and apologized and said she would start therapy (she was in a very toxic, abusive relationship before me, has depression and anxiety). And she has, her first appointment is in a couple of days. 

Well the next day, she was upset, and it was because she felt terrible about herself and insecure about whether I still liked her. I tried to reassure her over facetime, and met her in person the next day, and she tried gaslighting me again by saying I was “villainizing” her and that she can’t believe I said she emotionally abuses me when she knows very well what abuse is. After much patience, I explained to her that she was invalidating my feelings and eventually she realized and apologized again.

Despite it being resolved, the incident has weighed on me all week. I can’t believe she did all that, apologized, only to gaslight me again and invalidate me.

He's good and kind and has been amazing at looking after me while I'm pregnant with our baby. There's just one thing that drives me crazy: he lies when he's been drinking, about how much he's been drinking, and will get defensive and rude when I call him out on it.

I don't have any issues with him going out as it's not a super frequent occurance and I strongly advocate for us both maintaining our social lives with our own friends etc. But when he gets drunk he will always lie about how much he's had, and that's what pisses me off. Tonight for example, I met him at the station after we'd both been out separately and I could smell beer on him (I have a super sensitive nose especially at the moment). I jokingly asked him how much he'd had when he tried to hug me and he said two glasses of wine. I knew this was a lie, so I said I could definitely smell beer on him, at which point he remembered he'd also had a beer and a whiskey. He was later showing me photos on his phone and there was one of him at the pub that evening with three whiskeys in front of him. 

Again, I don't care that he had a beer, two wines and three whiskeys. I care that he always lies to me about it. If I try to call him out on this he gets really defensive, says my obsession with counting his drinks is ""boring"", and always tries to argue with me about it, saying he told me what he had from the start (I'm pregnant and completely sober so I know exactly what I/he said). I can't stand it or him when he does this. It's like he becomes a different person.

I’m a senior in college, he’s a junior. I liked him but wasn’t super attracted to him at first; I took a leap of faith and asked him if he wanted to grab coffee sometime just to feel it out. 

Since then we’ve hung out multiple times, and we just went on a first date last week and another on my birthday yesterday. I like him as a person, he’s very sweet and we can talk about a lot but he’s probably the most awkward guy I’ve ever met (around me) when there’s times when things could get physical, even just hand holding or kissing. 

For instance, he won’t make any moves unless I do, even just to hold my hand for the first time. I get he’s trying to not overstep but I’m also a bit awkward and find it hard to always initiate so it makes things difficult. He gets very nervous around me; when I was dropping him off the other day after the second date, he was overthinking how he should say goodbye to me (kiss me or hug me) and it was like we were both stalling to avoid it. 

He’s had a pretty troubled past and some major self esteem/anxiety/depression and mental health issues growing up, which I completely understand as I was very similar. But I feel like I’m not as nervous around him and he’s more nervous around me. We both haven’t dated in a pretty long time, since high school. 

I want to make him more comfortable and willing to be bolder with me but he told me he always thinks he’s overstepping and also I’m not sure he has the confidence for that yet. I’m completely fine going at whatever pace he would like, I just don’t want to be the one to always initiate. He thinks he’s being judged (because of the anxiety), and I don’t know how to assure him that he’s fine and I’m not thinking about how good of a kisser he his or how he acts from a judgement standpoint. 

How do I approach interacting with/dating a guy like this? He really wants to make things official and I agreed at first but now I’m starting to think we shouldn’t put a label on things or rush into anything serious until we’re both completely comfortable with each other. I feel bad because I had agreed before and I don’t want to make him feel bad about himself so how should I bring this up to him? I think he’s a great person and like I said he’s very sweet but I also want to be comfortable with him as much as he should with me.

(i’m 5’7, 95 pounds and i have no butt or boobs or any sort of curves.) he’s fine with my boobs he says they’re perfect cause he doesn’t like big boobs. but he really likes bigger butts and thighs, which i don’t have. he feeds me greasy foods so i can get a bigger butt. i told him i’d work out more to get curvier. before we started dating tho he told me my butt was just enough. he said it was small, but it had a nice shape. it really made me fee good about myself, but now i don’t feel that way. he’s not a cheater though. i told him if he wanted to cheat or he liked someone else, to just break up with me, and he said the same goes for me. i love him so much, i just don’t know how to tell him. the other day before he left to go do some aaron’s, he told me he loved me. i was too happy to say anything back, i kinda regret this. i’m waiting for the right time to tell him i love him, cause i know i really do. me and him don’t fight at all. if we have a problem we talk to eachother nicely and try to fix things. one time while he was sleeping over at a friends with me , he was Laying next to this girl and in his sleep he started cuddling with her. i was mad and jealous and overall just sad. but we talked about it and i really do believe he didn’t mean to cause he was sleeping. he’s never done anything like that since. he does compliment other girls tho, mostly ones online, saying they have a nice body or they’re hot. it doesn’t really bother me though, i find it okay to think other people are attractive in a relationship. he also doesn’t mind if i find other guy’s attractive. sometimes i get jealous, but he has told me, his friends, and his mother that i’m the only one he wants and likes. he says that i’m just different. this is honestly the best relationship i’ve been in. i just get jealous easily and overthink a lot. i just need some advice. we both have a hard time talking to eachother about our feelings and our problems. which is okay because i really don’t like talking to people and neither does he i think. i just wanna know what’s wrong with our relationship and what i can do to fix things. i really do love him",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7575727,public,self,does my boyfriend actually like me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yy3lm4/does_my_boyfriend_actually_like_me/,all_ads,6,

She came into my life and it seemed as though we've always known each other. I had two kids from a previous relationship and she had two of her own. We all got along well and blended our family together. We were together for about 4 years. For reasons I wont' get into here, she ended up breaking up with me (no, I did not cheat on her). She had every reason to feel the way she did and I take ownership of it. So we went our separate ways. She moved on with her life and I tried to do the same as best as I could.

Fast forward about 7 years now, and she reaches out to me via email asking how my kids are. I tell her they're fine and ask about hers. Then we exchanged a few emails catching up. Turns out she is engaged and has another son with this man. Not going to lie, it hurt hearing this, but I was happy for her. She found someone that was going to give her the world that I didn't. So we trade numbers and begin talking more. It started off about the kids, what they've been up to, how school was going. We caught up on our professional lives and what we've been doing for work and so fourth. As we continue to talk, I realize that I never truly dealt with the feelings I had for her. I would tell myself and others that I was over her and moved on, but that was just a cover. I only buried the feelings, I never fully addressed them. I kept them in check though, as I did not want to offend her or cause an issue between us. We talked as friends. Vented to each other. This was a time when both of us were missing that in our lives and needed it. The ongoing conversations felt like they did before. Almost like we picked up where we left off. After talking for a while, we discovered that our feelings were mutual. The issue is, we can't be together. She has her reasons for not leaving him and I can respect it. I'm no longer married so that is not an issue for me at least. Still, too little too late. 

She has helped me a lot in the short time we've been talking. I feel as though I've been beneficial as well to her and help her with issues she's dealing with. Before I thought we were soulmates, and now I feel even stronger about that since we are back in each other's life. There's so many issues though. Her family is already set against me. Her kids don't know me anymore and that hurts so much. They used to call me dad as they never had a father figure like that before. Now someone else is their dad. I'm just lost on what I should do. I really don't want to tell her goodbye. I would rather just be able to deal with my feelings and still have her as a friend if possible. I don't think dating someone else is the answer, as how would it be fair to them that I still feel this way about my ex. Before, I just told myself she was better off without me so I pretended I didn't feel anything. I never got serious with another person since her. Even if I decided to move on, I wouldn't know how to do it the right way. I know I deserve whatever I get from this. I cared deeply for her but this is where we are. What advice can be offered to me?

My question is, how do I get over my feelings for her? I'm trying to accept that I'll never be able to be with her again but it's hard to. Do I need to completely stop talking to her again? If I do that, then I lose a good friendship.

He cut off my brother and if I contact him he’s not going to pay for my school, but I’ve been speaking with him for 2 years. I feel conflicted about my family relationships and also my sexual orientation… just a lost 20 year old needing advice.

Ok so I’m a college student and I currently live at home with my parents and I commute to school, which is one of the conditions my dad made to pay for my educational expenses. I’m also the youngest by a lot because of a complicated situation. I have a brother who died before I was born and then I have a living older brother and sister with a 25 and 32 year age gap each. So it’s kind of complicated, my older brother is actually technically my biological father so I live with my biological grandparents. I’ve always called them mom and dad. They’re in their 70’s and retired. For the purposes of this post my dad is my bio grandfather who raised me and my brother is my bio father.

Alright so everything is complicated so I’ll try and keep the explanation brief. My bio mom was really sick and died when I was a baby and my brother (bio father) was deployed and so I lived with his parents. For reasons I was raised by them and to consider my bio dad as my brother, but I’ve always known he’s technically my bio dad. Until I was 11 years old I used to see him fairly regularly on and off, he was active duty so it was complicated by that. My dad and him always had a tense relationship for reasons I’m still not completely aware of, and I stopped seeing him at all in 2013 and I wasn’t given an explanation at the time. 

When I started college my sister told me the reason for that was he came out as being in a same sex relationship and so our parents cut off contact with him and threatened him not to try and get custody of me. She was told not to tell me, our parents still don’t know that I know about it. I got in contact with him through our sister and we’ve been talking for two years. We live on different coasts, but I’m considering doing a graduate program where he lives to build more of a relationship with him. He’s still active duty though but he said he shouldn’t be moving and will be more than likely retiring within a few years.

But I feel conflicted about lying to my father. He’s only paying for my school under certain conditions. My brother offered to pay for my school if dad cuts me off. He’s a good guy but I just don’t know him that well, but I do want to get to know him. I don’t think I want him to try and act like a father figure for me though, but I’m really confused how I feel about it. I feel like that could get messed up if I started accepting significant financial help from him. For grad school I don’t need parental income info for FAFSA so if my dad learns about the arrangement I can always get a student loan.

I just feel really frustrated by this situation and like no one else in the world is dealing with something like this. My friends all think it’s really weird when they learn my parents are in their 70’s, so I sometimes explain that my brother is my bio dad, and they always want to know why he didn’t raise me and just assume he abandoned me. I’m also confused about myself, I think I’m bisexual, but I’m afraid to explore that because I don’t want my dad to know. I went to a couple of meetings of a queer undergrad club, but idk why I’m just so paranoid about being there. I disagree with my dad a lot but I love him and don’t want him to disown me. I feel a lot safer when I’m talking with my brother and I’ve even come out to him and obviously he’s accepting of me.

I (26f) have been with my loving bf (29m) for a year and 2 months. We live together and I truly feel loved, cherished and treasured. We have our differences of course, I have many flaws and he has his but we try to have patience with each other. 

I have been feeling in a very big rut for the last couple of months (ñike 6-7 montha) and this has been taking a toll on me. I feel very empty and just feel like I am going through life on autopilot. I was in therapy but took a break since even that became overwhelming. 

I have talked about this with my bf and he is very understanding and loving. I on the other hand feel like I am not giving him my all and this brings on a lot of guilt. I even think often about being by myself because it would be ""easier"" and then hate myself for having those thoughts.

I feel extremely lucky to love and be loved by him. I have looked up cases that are similar to mine and read comments that ""if you think like that, break up with you partner because they deserve better."" I already think my bf deserves better. I know the problem is me, the issue is me and I can work on myself while still being in a relationship and its a beautiful thing to heal and grow in a environment that is filled with love.

However, I am finding it very hard. He is a beautiful and creative soul. I just want him to be happy, safe, successful, loved, cherished and fulfilled. My own head tells me I don't provide this. I have talked about these things in therapy and I know its wrong to have stopped going but nothing makes sense right now.

 I am almost done with University, I have a good job and a core group that isn't close but love me and would be there if I needed to chat. My job pays great but after 6 years I feel empty there and now that I am finishing my University I can look elsewhere by the end of the year (couldn't leave my job before because my University final project was based on my company). The last year of University was brutal but I just have too hang in there for two more months. I mean, things should look SO much better and the things I want to change I finally can in a few more months...but tell me why I FEEL NOTHING. 

I just can't get out of this space I am in and I am truly disturbed since I can't give my partner everything I want from me including emotionally and everything else. I feel terrible about considering telling him calling it quits. I don't fear being along but what I am truly scared of is letting go of an amazing man because I couldn't get my shit together. I don't want him to stay with me because he loves me while I simply go day by day like in a daze. That isn't life and I don't want him to waste time.

Recently, he has stopped meeting with his group of friends to stay with me, and during my girls' night, I was texting with him all throughout. I didn't want to be that friend who just wants to be with her boyfriend, but it felt weird being without him. 

Our friends know each other, so when we all meet together, we kind of stick to each other. Recently, our friend group called us for an intervention and said that they thought we were in a cult because we have been so isolating. I didn't really notice anything until they mentioned it. They expressed concern for us, and my girlfriends pulled me aside and told me that I was exhibiting the telltale signs of an abusive relationship, and that my husband was isolating me. That is not true; my husband has never stopped me from going out; I just don't like going out anymore; lately, going out with my friends feels exhausting.

However in the beginning of our relationship, he told me the first day he met me he loved me, he also told me he thought it was pointless to just get to know eachother like why not just date. At first I was going to leave but him and I are long distance which meant it’s not like we could go on dates to get to know eachother anyway so I ended up actually agreeing with him. However the whole time until that point he kept canceling on meeting me or saying he was not ready for a relationship. Then about two months into the relationship I can’t remember exactly what happened but either way I found out he still had the two other girls he liked and was talking to still in his contacts I didn’t think it was a huge deal I mean it hurt because I got rid of everybody the day we got together but I said he’s a guy, he’s not gonna go out clearing contacts all the time. However he wouldn’t let me see his phone. So Yesterday an entire year after that it was brought up because I had also found a page from his journal dated 7 months ago about how he still was in love with his ex (so while him and I were together, he wrote that) and he admitted to also have been texting those girls when him and I first got together. He says it was only for a month but he treated me like crap for three months and then completely changed out of knowhere and became the sweetest, most patient guy I’ve been with. I do truly believe that he has not cheated on me since then, however he did cheat on me by texting those two girls for the first few months of our relationship. I am at the point where I feel used and betrayed and confused on why he’d just be with me this entire time while still feeling love for his ex and even texting other girls. He claims he loves me and he’ll do anything to fix this, he doesn’t care what it takes, how mean I am to him, he wants to fix it, is what he says. He claimed he wanted to put it all out there because I deserve honesty and told me that I was right he did not love me in the beginning of our relationship, but he loves me now. He knows thats not fair for me and he will respect my decision to leave him. However idk what to do, I need your guys help! is it possible for someone to grow to love you? It’s not like he didn’t want to be just didn’t love me at first, is it possible he could have fallen in love with me? And is it worth throwing this relationship away?

She got really mad at that and we argued that night about that and we just argued. I wanted to talk it out but she said we will talk about it in the morning.

I’ve met my current girlfriend when I was around 15 (she was my teacher in school) and she was around 30. She wasn’t inappropriate towards me or anything, this was just the first time I met her. So I’ve known her for 10 years actually now.

3 months before I have graduated (was 19 and 3 months before being 20 years old) we started talking a bit after lessons. It was mainly about to series and stuff and also texted a bit using cellphones. We exchanged numbers so I could help her with some computer stuff I think but it was a long time ago so not sure.

After I finished school and graduated we met for the first time (I was 20 already and she 34). Notice that our relation had no impact on grades or anything and we dated for the first time after I graduated.

Anyway here I am at 26 and she 41. We have also been living together for more than 6 years.

I think I am not in love with her anymore, I still love her as a friend and great person but not really intimate way. We still have sex and she has a nice body and everything but her face looks older and not so attractive to me. She takes a good care of her so it’s not like she is ugly but still, the age difference.

The biggest problem is that I am ashamed of our age difference. She could almost be my mom and when I am with her in the public (holidays for example) I have a hard time expressing feelings to her like hugging, kissing or holding hands. It makes me uncomfortable, why? I am not sure. Most likely because there is plenty of other people in love being similar age and I feel isolated. I have no problem kissing her at home when we are lonely. Another big problem is that I know I will be less and less attracted to her each year. I cannot imagine being 45 and sleeping with 60 years old woman. These 2 things make me think all the time about this relationship and a bit stressed. When I said to her that I cannot imagine life when she is 60 and I am 45 she said that why should I worry about the future if each day may be our last and that we should live day by day. 
I believe she is afraid of being alone but not sure.

For example, she never met my friends because I didn’t want to and she is fine with it. I have never met her friends either. My best friend is getting married soon and I don’t want to take her with me because I will feel uncomfortable (she doesn’t know that he is getting married and we are invited)

Why haven’t I left her?
Great question. Actually I love a lot about our life together. We are very similar, we like to watch tv series, play games together and discuss various things. She is a great person and we always support each other. We have built a great life together and enjoy spending time together but the feeling of shame and being uncomfortable kills me each day.
I am also afraid to leave her. First of all she was alone since she was 24. I know that if I leave her she will most likely be alone for many years maybe forever. She doesn’t have many friends and almost never goes out, she only goes out with female friends. 

She met my family and I met her family so I feel rather good during these family meetings, everyone accepted the situation and I feel mainly comfortable.

I have also cheated on her a few months ago (I wanted to feel comfortable with someone in the public). Guilt was very strong for me so I finally took my things after a few months and left ending the relationship. After a few days I messaged her asking about one thing I left in the house and asked was she was doing.

She responded that things are hard because her close family member died (someone I knew too) So I came over to her as she was alone. After a few days I am still here and we are kinda back together which is toxic a bit I think. She also forgave me for cheating as I have confessed. Why I came over to her? She is very lonely as I mentioned and doesn’t have almost any friends. Albo the thought that she was alone during tough time made me feel depressed.

I'm a 28f and he is a 27m. We have been married 2 years, together for 3. Lately our arguments have been getting worse and sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. And I'm not sure who to talk to (besides a therapist, which I should get), because I don't trust people to be objective and I don't want family and friends involved in our marriage.

This morning was a bad argument. It started with last night, when he came home from work in an awful mood. He was yelling and swearing about trivial things, like a piece of mail, and even yelled at me. At that point, I said nothing and removed myself from the situation. I decided to go shopping by myself for the rest of the evening and give him some space to calm down. I wasn't mean, didn't yell, didn't even speak in an angry tone. I just said calmly, ""I'm going shopping, I'll be back later"".

This morning we wake up and he apologizes for the way he acted. He said he was stressed from work and other unrelated things. He mentioned that he was upset with himself because he was gaining weight and didn't feel good. It was at this point that he said ""I wish you would support me more."" I told him I do, but physical health is a very personal thing, I couldn't force him to do anything. He said I should be ""more affirming and more enthusiastic and tell him he's doing a great job."" I reiterated that I already told him I supported him and his ideas to get healthier were good. I even reminded him to pack a lunch so he wouldn't have to buy fast food. 

At this point, it got worse. He said I'm not supportive and I don't communicate well with him. He brought up an argument from over a month ago and said that I got really offended. What actually happened was that he randomly (in the middle of work) decided to text me and tell me all the things I do that annoy him. I was upset, at the time, because it felt like an attack out of no where. On top of that, we were supposed to leave for an anniversary trip the next day. Why pick a fight right before a celebration trip??

I told him that fight didn't have anything to do with last night. I was trying to focus on the original argument and not get caught up on past issues. He at that point went back to the original argument and said ""well why didn't you ask me what was wrong before leaving last night?! You should have came and talked to me instead of leaving!"" I told him it wasn't my job to regulate his emotions. I did the best I could and removed myself from the situation so he could calm down and we could calmly discuss things later. 

He just gets more upset and starts yelling and swearing at me. I eventually told him to get out of the house and go to work because I just couldn't handle it anymore. It felt like he was attacking me, but I wasn't the one who was being mean and nasty in the first place! He was. But he always tries to turn things around on me and blame me. And when I call him out on it, he gets even more angry. 

It's really upsetting to me. I have adhd and my memory is crap, so it hurts when he brings up past arguments because I can't remember what exactly was said. So its hard to defend myself. I feel gaslit and I just don't know how to handle someone like this. 

Side note, he has outbursts of rage occassionally. I never engage with him, I just try to remove myself or de-escalate. About a month ago he rage screamed at our puppy, for doing something that annoyed him (getting excited and distracted outside instead of going potty).",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7575642,public,self,How do I deal with this?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yy3a0m/how_do_i_deal_with_this/,all_ads,6,

You could read this and say that maybe you’re just not attracted to him specifically but there’s more too it. I do find myself looking at girls much more than guys. Masculinity just isn’t attractive to me…I feel like I was only attracted to my previous boyfriend because he was more feminine. I almost lost my first kiss to my high school best friend and after it happened I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks. 

I feel terrible because I know my boyfriend is head over heels for me but I just don’t feel the same at all.

i wasn’t allowed to watch a lot of shows or movies growing up, and it had to be educational or something we could discuss as a family after watching. i haven’t even seen spongebob. i’ve never used tiktok or snapchat. i used to beg my teachers in elementary during recess or lunch to let me go to the library. at age 6 i enjoyed talking with our librarian and reading books more than playing with my peers. 

honestly since i’ve become an adult i’ve realized how damaging this part of my upbringing was, i can’t enjoy a lot of comedies or ‘dumb’ media. i don’t watch a lot of the new action or superhero movies, i don’t get a lot of the new sayings and memes from my generation and feel like an old lady talking to some people my age. 

my boyfriend (22m) and i love showing each other our favourite movies/podcasts/shows etc. but it hit me recently that he usually always loves what i show him, and even has some new favourites because of this. well, i have a really hard time watching what he shows me, it’s all fun action or adventure. my idea of a ‘fun’ show would be a satirical/political/dark comedy at most that still has a message about the world. and honestly, i need to be pretty stoned to get into it what he wants to show me and i hate that about myself. 

recently i was talking about my favourite podcast which was a true crime comedy podcast and he listened and now loves it. since it was comedic he wants me to listen to his all time favourite comedy podcast and i started it but… i really really don’t like it. it’s about dungeons and dragons which i was never allowed to play and know zero about. i’ve really tried (i’ve listened to probably 8 hours worth) but it’s not my cup of tea. he asked me about it the other day and i told him i was having a hard time getting into it, boy did his face fall. 

i honestly hate this about myself and feel like i come off pretty self-righteous to others because of the things i do/don’t enjoy. i feel out of place with my peers, i’ve been told i’m weird and get asked why i just love constantly depressing myself with sad books and dramatic usually non fiction media. my boyfriend is also hardcore into raves and partying and i’ve gone out a couple times with him but my experience was always meh and i’d want to go home as soon as we got there.

i’ve really been trying to get out of my shell more and i guess i’m looking for advice to loosen up a bit more, because i don’t have many friends anymore and i’m scared my goofy and loving boyfriend will dump me eventually.

We've been together ever since I was 16, and I truly knew from the beginning that he was the one - a genuinely good person whom I have a lot of chemistry with, who shares the same views and beliefs as I do, who I love spending time with, etc. He also loves and treats me like every person in the world deserve to be loved and treated, and objectively I couldn't ask for more.

However, I'm only human... and I was never particularly physically attracted to him. Obviously that did not prevent me from falling madly in love, but I know that ""in a room full of guys"", he's not the one I would pick to have sex with. Therefore, our sex life is only ""ok"". We're not very compatible, but I guess love just has a way of making things work.

But idk... I am a very sexual person and I feel like I cannot fully be that self with him. And the idea of living the rest of my life with some degree of sexual dissatisfaction scares me. We've worked through everything he could possibly change, and although the changes have been minor it's better than nothing. But sexual attraction (or lack thereof) is not something that can just magically be fixed.

I have asked him multiple times during the years how he would feel about me exploring outside the relationship. He is very opposed to it and keeps telling me that he is scared of the version of himself he would become if I started being intimate with other men (doesn't bother him if they are women).

I know that the sex is the only thing in our relationship that annoys me and I know that I'm very lucky to have him, but this situation just makes me resentful and although I try my best to not let it affect me, it's impossible. What do I do?

I (20F) have this one friend (20M) who I’ll call N. Me and N have known each other for a while now, we met at a group but according to him we also met once as children, and we’ve hung out a bit. I’ve even been to his a few times and he introduced me to a weekly social group around a month and a half ago.

In mid October, he went from talking to me a lot especially at this group and inviting me around to his to being super distant, mostly ignoring me and only giving short responses. Even on a day where we were at this big event with some other members when I brought up being stressed, he made a small comment saying don’t worry and walked away. Even if I sent N a text (for example, ‘have you watched that new show yet?’ Which we both expressed wanting to watch) he would take days to respond.

I asked him about it a few times and he said he was stressed so I thought that’s understandable, just expressed how it’s upset me. 2 days ago we were at group and he was being distant with me again, but I went out for a bit to help a member of staff pick up some shopping and when I came back he was super talkative with our mutual friend A.

And that’s when we get to the conversation that’s pissed me off. I’m only going to make a quick summary as I can be a bit wordy.

“This is the last time I’m going to say this as I’ve said it before but why do you keep ignoring me? I’ve noticed you still talking to others like normal, and we can’t solve the issue if you don’t tell me what’s up. You have three options. 1. Tell me the issue and we can work it out 2. If you have no issues figure out why you’re ignoring me specifically and solve it or 3. Keep ignoring me and I’ll ignore you back since you’re not bothered”

He said ‘what the fuck are you talking about’, I mentioned again how he’s been distant with me, he said ‘it’s probably tiredness’, so I said ‘get some rest and sort it out, it’s been weeks and you’re making it other peoples problem.’ He then said ‘I don’t see it that way but sorry I haven’t been feeding you enough attention’ which came as passive aggressive to me.

I said ‘I get how it’s hard to notice your own issues sometimes as I do it too, but you have to remember I have rejection sensitive dysphoria so I’m a lot more hurt by things like that’ he doesn’t respond for ages but finally comes back with ‘I don’t have a problem with you but I’ll keep that in mind 😂’  I said ‘good to know but it’s not a laughing matter’

He then says ‘with the long ass messages I’m getting off you it reminds me of a typical jealous anime chick kicking off’ and all I can say is ffs N.

He says I’m hilarious and gives him anime vibes and tries to make the conversation normal, but I feel belittled and mocked for expressing myself, and although he doesn’t know this I have a hard time doing that as I prefer to mask and put on a perfect persona. I’ve left him on read for now.

Now it might sound petty but he’s upset me before:

• when we met he found my facebook instagram and twitter without me mentioning them which upset me and my friends said it was weird but I forgave him

• he invited me to comic-con and I said I will think about it but I’m trying to save money, he talked as if I confirmed yes and also wanted me to go as a specific character from an anime I hadn’t watched which was expensive (we watched a few episodes since) which I said even if I did go and bought a cosplay it would have to be cheap and a character I know

• My friends pointed out that it was weird that he specifically wanted me to go as the maid character (not a sexy maid costume or anything, for those curious it’s the one from black butler) I don’t think there was any intent though because he just says I’m the irl version of her (I literally just have the same glasses) 

• Has accused me of having a bragging/boasting problem twice but the first time was me saying I know a lot about a hyperfixation (it’s an autism group) and second was giving him advice to make getting a vaccination go better

So I’m not sure if I should cut off the friendship or give him another chance at it, I’d have to be civil until December though because it would make the group awkward and I at least want to check out this place we all arranged to go to for my own personal reasons, but in general it’s been lackluster for me now.

Since the very beginning we both tried the most to be clear about what we are looking for. He’s a rigid person by nature, a bit more introverted than me. He’s in the French army, still training, so at the moment he has a fixed schedule, which gives him a lot of freedom. In my case, I am a visual artist and administrator, I’m playful and creative. My schedule is more uncertain because of my appointments with clients. 
Our relationship has been in the distance since the very beginning (we live not too far though, and next year we’ll live in neighbouring cities), and everytime we meet I see his will to make the best of our time together. I am on the same page, and I keep my playful side with him so we keep making lovely memories together.

I tend to be respectful and when I bring a vulnerable feeling and my needs aren’t met, I tend to worry about the relationship. It’s been counted times I have brought up 2 topics I’ve felt worried about: 

-During the weekends he disappears throughout the day without any notice, I’ve let him know how that can make me feel unrequited (even more at the early stages of our relationship) and if it’s possible to find a solution in the matter, his immediate response gets defensive. He tells me he doesn’t have to tell me everything he does, and I agree at some extent, but I also let him know that if he cares about me he might make an effort to at least tell me he’ll disappear, otherwise the distance won’t be just physical, but also emotional. 

-The second matter is that I’m already afraid of bringing a worry of mine to the table, his defensive reactions can make me feel so so afraid of loosing the quality of our relationship. His response was that I’m starting to meet who he is, and he cannot avoid getting defensive. 

I truly love this man, we have such a similar humor, qualities, and many things in common despite having different careers. I truly think my needs are very basic and I feel they aren’t being covered. I know by default that I won’t be the top priority in his life (army guy) but from all the free time he has at this stage of his life, I feel left at last. 

Maybe I’m not communicating my needs in a proper way? Or maybe things are what they are and as we can see, a superficial rigid/fun time is what he has to offer?

We officially together in August). In Sept I got a text from my partner asking whether I would be okay to pay for my half of the six months rental in advance because the rental agent stated that landlord has requested this so they would agree to renew the lease for six months instead of their desired one year contract. When I got the text I was thinking it was odd as this is illegal for agents or landlords to request this much rent in advance. Anyhow I thought, well we would be living here for a while anyway and plus I could fork out my part of the 6 months rent no issues. So I transferred the money to my partner. 

One month later in Oct, I was watching YouTube on their Ipad and an message popped up. They were obviously having a conversation so the notifications kept popping up, and I know this is wrong but I was curious to know what they were conversing about that was so funny because notifications are only half sentences that pop up and I saw alot of hahahahaha. So nothing intriguing there just something happened at work. 

What caught my eye was familiar text message that I received in Sept about the rent. I clicked in and found out that they had made the text message up about the agent asking for six months rent! So they sent the text to themselves so it seemed like a conversation that was from the agent and sent me that screenshot that the agent had asked for that money. Then that got me thinking the money I transferred them, did they even pay it to the agent? even though my name is on the renewed lease agreement (added on during August) but I had not received any receipts nor contract. So I emailed the agent that I would like a copy of the contract. The agent didn't send it to me but text messaged my partner informing them that I asked them to send the contract and ask my partner to inform me that my name is on there and also they can send me the lease contract. Which is really odd. 

Anyhow, I thought about it in my head like why would they do this. Then I decided to talk to my partner and ask about the six month rental situation mentioning that it was illegal for the agent to ask for this much money in advance. They were shocked and said really? How come you didn't say anything in the first place? I explained that I didn't think about it that much because we were going to live here for a while anyway. So I asked did the agent provide you with a receipt after you made the payment? They said yes but the receipt file won't open in their email for some reason. So then sent me a screenshot of the transaction record. 

My guts telling me this whole thing does not make sense. First off the made up text message, second the agent is contacting them after I directly contacted the agent asking for a contract that my name is legally on there, which I didn't even sign. My partner signed it without even letting me know the contract was due for renewal in August. They only raised the renewal situation in Sept when asking for the 6 months rental money but the renewal of contract happened in August. I asked my partner exactly what is happening and they said don't worry if I don't feel comfortable they'll just ask for the money back immediately. I told them I was not feeling comfortable with the situation so then my partner suggested they could ask for the money back and we can continue paying monthly. I thought what? they is possible? anyhow I said yeah, that would be great I feel better if we just continue to pay monthly and if anything happens it would be much easier to resolve with our money in our hands. So the next day my partner told me that they had spoken to the agent and they agreed to refund this money, it would be easier to refund it after our next rental deduction in Nov so the money is easier to calculate. 

Curiosity got the better of me as I was thinking the whole situation is just so dodgy because how the whole story just still does not add up and I'm not getting any direct answers from my partner. So I had a friend that happens to work in that real estate company and they checked the records for me stating that there was no request for six months rental and the rent for Oct that's due today hasn't been paid yet. I was surprised. So after that I received an email from the agent with a gentle reminder to pay for rent and then the next day it was paid for by my partner and received a email receipt. That means, they not only made up the text message but also possibly the screenshot of the transaction record! 

Anyhow, I confronted them about all of this and said they had paid and is unsure what is happening. The reason they didn't tell me is because they didn't want me to know about the rise in rent and they can pay more. So they asked the agent not to tell me about the rise in rent so that's why I didn't get the contract. You can ask the agent about this and we can call up together tomorrow etc. So then they tell me there's a new property manager now. When I go get the backup keys to the balcony on Tuesday you can ask her. 

Here's some more dodgy shit - so on Tuesday when I went to collect the keys I asked about the six months rental - the agent said to me oh um, I did hear about the six months rental situation and afterwards it was refunded etc but I don't know too much about it as it was handled by the previous property manager but I have to go to a meeting now and if there's anything just give me a call. So on Wednesday morning I called her and she said she can't find any records and can't check it because its with the previous property manager. So I asked so your accountant team can't check this info? She said no they can't. Then they asked me what my concern was and said are you worried your partner is scamming you? Then I flipped it I knew my partner must have called the agent on Monday and said something to them. So I instinctively went to their ipad and saw a text message on Tuesday morning that my partner sent to them saying Good morning, she is on her way to collect the keys, remember what we talked about yesterday and once everything is over towards the end of the year we will both come and thank you. I was like wtf. So I sent a message to my partner saying I am so furious, I called the agent and this is what happened. 

When they got home seeing how furious I was and they kept insisting the six month rental is true and the agent had asked them about it so now there's a new property manager so they maybe don't know. I said did you call them before I went they said no, I asked are you sure then they said yes they called to let me know how to collect the keys and we spoke. Then I kept insisting the new property manager and the old property manager both said there was no six month rental in advance. Then they said they did need the money at the time as they need to return money to their mum overseas they didn't want her to worry etc. I was like you lied the whole way through, and even gone to the extent to talk to the agent to lie together? Anyhow they said they didn't think I would find out anyway and there's no intention to harm me and I'm not losing anything out of it anyway. 

I was like my god, this is a scary person and I feel that what they are telling me is also a lie about they are needing to return the money to their mum, they're probably needing the money but for something else they're not telling me and excuse they made up to get them out of the situation they are in. And if I do leave, they said they would be hurt but wouldn't let me know and wouldn't come to find me and that's the end of it. They said they are glad that I was able to talk to them about it.

I'm contemplating after speaking with them that night - trust is definitely broken. I'm thinking whether I should stay to work together on this as they asked to give them another chance and this would not happen again. I thought well, they didn't think its a big deal and how come I can't get over it and was coming back to this all the time and making them tell me what was happening. Then I thought, if they didn't think it was a big deal, maybe that's our values on this area is not matching up and they didn't intentionally try to hurt me and was finding their own way of dealing with whatever debt they had, perhaps if I decide to stay, we can try to work things out. But then I thought what they did, the extent they would go to, to lie there way out and made it sound like if I can't get over it, they respect me and said its their fault to hide it from me in the first place (the hide part wasn't even about the six month payment in advance, it was about the part of signing the contract without me knowing) made me feel like I was the one making a huge fuss out of everything and being suspicious for no reason. 

So yeah, I'm discerning between whether my partner's action is something that is a red flag to be concerned with or its really just a difference between certain perspectives and its something perhaps that can be worked on together...I'm in two minds about this. By the way, I haven't told them that I found their made up text message. I asked them later because the six month rental didn't take place, did you fake the text message they said they didn't, they would not go to that extent. Anyhow, I'm like I should leave this relationship, then I'm like ok, maybe I should give them another chance. 

TDLR: Found out partner made up a text message about the rental agent requesting for six months payment in advance in order to get the six month renewal on our lease. I paid my partner the six months and later discovered the money hadn't gone to the agent, they lied their way insisting they did pay and then finally admitted that they needed the money at the time. I'm thinking whether I should leave the relationships as the extent of lying involved I should be seeing as a red flag or its just different perspectives and their way of managing things I should give them another chance.

Me and my partner have been together 9 years, he went on a night out on Saturday with friends and was staying at his friend's house. He came back on Sunday had really bad anxiety since, told me he was really worried about work related things etc and I've been helping him and supporting him. 

Then tonight as we walked our dog he said ""I really have been worried about work but there's something else too. Me and [friend] made friends with two girls on Saturday and we ended up snogging them."" To me this isn't a MASSIVE deal, I personally wouldn't do it but it isn't a deal breaker. I told him not to worry just a one time thing that meant nothing.

Then he said, well me and [friend] then we ended up getting in a taxi with them back to their house as we wanted to see their dog, I didn't want to have sex with her but I just snogged her one more time, she groped me but I left. 

Now, this to me is something else entirely. [Friend] also did similar apparently and also has a fiance. My partner said he wanted to tell me but he promised his [friend] he wouldn't as he didn't want their fiance finding out which is why he waited a few days until it ate away at him. However I completely trust that my fiance didn't have sex with her.

Now, obviously this is told from my point of view. My partner has cried, apologised profusely and said he really didnt want any of it. She came onto him and he didnt respond to it. However, of course I'm really hurt, I don't want the knee jerk reactions of leave him as that's really over the top. But I'm struggling, I always thought of him as my best friend, my person who will always be there for me but now I just feel lonely and betrayed. 

He insists he wishes he never went out and that he'd do anything to make it better but I don't know how he can ever make this better, I don't want to be near him. Every time I see him just reminds me of how much I hurt and imagine him and this girl together.

I’m giving him one last chance to get help and change for us and our son. 

But, I’ve recently been missing someone from my past (Ill call him Matt). Matt wasn’t someone I was in a serious relationship with but he’s someone my boyfriend does still get pretty jealous of. I think because we’ve been fighting and the way he gets so mean during the fights is making me miss Matt. It’s probably because Matt is the most kindest loving person I’ve ever been with. I would never tell my boyfriend this. But when I was with him I felt so different. We weren’t together long but I was just always happy with him. We didn’t work out because he still had issues with an ex, which I respected and he was very honest with me about it. I still would love to have him as a friend but my boyfriend would lose it. 

It’s been making me wonder if I’m subconsciously wanting to leave my boyfriend or what. Because I have thought about it. I’m just not sure what to do and I feel guilty for feeling this way.

We got together just after our final exams at school. We supported each other through A-Levels, job hunts, and for her, the first year and a half of university, and every single moment of uncertainty or trouble ever since i first asked her out. 

We really do love each other. We never stop texting or calling, our sex life is constantly active and amazing, we have our minor problems here and there but what can you really do about it other than work them out and try to improve. 

I love her family, she loves mine, everyone gets on great despite class, education, and political differences. 

We’ve been there for each other constantly, we love each other insanely, you get the gist.

Onto the problem.

I’ve struggled with my gender identity for years. I mean i’ve had dysphoric thoughts since i was a child really, but i never realised what it really was until i was probably just about fourteen? I thought i could just repress it for the foreseeable future, and that it would would just disappear eventually. Big mistake. 

I told her a few months in how i felt, and that i would try and work on it, maybe see a therapist or see if there’s any advice i could follow to ignore my feelings, and she said it should be fine. Not quite. 

My feelings have gotten way stronger over the last few years. With an errant infrequent thought turning into a daily concern. We have constantly communicated about this, despite her hating the discussion every time. She would not continue to date me if i transition. I guess i can understand it, she’s used to me how i am. But really it’s quite sad. I really do desperately love her, and i could never imagine my future life without her, but at this point i also can’t imagine a future where i’m still a man. 

She is bisexual, as am i, but she wouldn’t want to watch me turn into a woman. She says she couldn’t bear it, and it would hurt her too much to stay together. 

I am looking to deal with this asap. Go to a gender clinic nearby, get a therapist, the works. If my GP and the therapist say i should transition, i’ll have to end things with the love of my life. Purely to save us both the pain of loving for even longer with no certainty about what could happen. 

It’s likely i will transition. My dysphoria at this point is severe, and has been present in my mind for the past 3 months.

I don’t want to break up with her. I really don’t. She is my love, she is my happiness, and she means more to me than anything else in this world. And i just don’t know how to break up with her either. I think she would understand, but we’d both be heartbroken, and i don’t know how to go about it. 

I don’t want to turn up at her door, watch her be all excited and bounce into my arms, knowing i’m about to say possibly the worst thing she’ll hear in the last decade. I don’t want to do it over the phone and hear her break down into tears but not be able to comfort her. I don’t want to do it over text and just get a reply half an hour later telling me to come and pick up my stuff.

I don’t want to do it at the end of a weekend with each other, with love and cuddles and movie nights and popcorn and massages and all of that. I don’t want to drive down just to talk to her and grab my things and never see her again.

I (29 F) have a lovely boyfriend (30 M) who is intelligent and considerate. We met on tinder and have been together for 2 years. We rent together and have very different jobs. I am a gardener with social anxiety so I can be shy but on the whole am easy enough to get on with. He is a software engineer who has a handful of very good friends. He enjoys dark humour, sarcasm and devilish banter. I've always laughed at reactions of others, observational humour etc. My previous partner of 7 years made me laugh all the time (I was in stitches with him just because of the way he was rather than the things he said).

Me and K (current boyfriend) care for eachother a lot and talk about children and the future. I sometimes feel lonely in this relationship regardless of him being a good man. I get home and we ask how our days have been and play with the cat. But we don't have any shared interests and sometimes i really have to force myself to make conversation with him. If there is little laughing and strained chat, can two people be happy with eachother due to mutual respect and comfort. 

There is also one extra difficulty which I am reluctant to share. On some occasions in the past I have found him being overly flirtatious with women on Instagram. His old girlfriends or friends who are girls. He is a very complimentary man (he was with me when we started dating) but can be inappropriate sometimes just to get a reaction. We've talked about it and he reassures me he lovees me and would never cheat. So I suppose I find it hard sometimes to trust what he says to me if he says it to about anyone.

What am I asking here? Does a relationship have much footing when the two parties have differing senses of humour and little conversation between them, even if their life goals align and they appreciate and like eachother's personalities a lot.
