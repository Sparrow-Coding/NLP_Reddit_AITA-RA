I have clarity now but still want to ask reddit for advice/guidance. TIA!

At the start of our relationship (4 months ago), we were so lovely dovey. He always texted me calling me beautiful and that I was his everything. I met his 2 kids within 3 weeks of dating and they love me and I love them. We have had a wonderful relationship and I'm so in love with him. He works hard, makes me feel like a princess, and never goes a day without texting and calling me. We hung out 3-4 days out of the week, always sleeping over Friday and Saturday nights.

Things seemed to changed after I left his house last Sunday night. It's been since then I've seen him, which is out of the norm. He had booked a very difficult work project this week and I know he was very busy with it. He also had to schedule a project over the weekend and told me he didn't have time this week to see me. 

I was a bit concerned since we NEVER went a week without seeing each other. I confronted him about this over the phone yesterday and told him I felt I was suffocating him and smothering. He told me that wasn't the case but he needed time this week to decompress after very tough work days. During our relationship, he's booked tough projects before but always made time to see me, which wasn't the case this week. I proceeded to ask him what changed. (back story: he's 4 years out of a divorce and never dated anyone since his marriage.) He said that the relationship hit him all at once. He wasn't used to not having time to decompress by himself each day and it was culminating into stress and fatigue all at once. I told him I understood and respected that and told him I'd give him space to do what he needs to do. He reassured me that it wasn't anything I did and he still wants a romantic relationship with me and wants to spend life with me.

I'm coming to reddit to see if this behavior is normal, if any of you have experienced it, on either side (i.e. the one needing space or like me, the one being avoided), and what you did to make sure the relationship isn't moving in a negative direction or if this is a sign it will be over.

In the beginning we had a lot of sex, and I enjoyed it. She's always been more passive and that has been ""okay."" Our relationship has been more than just sex, and I was willing to explore it for what it is. In past relationships the more proactive and (hyper)sexual the partner is, the more I enjoyed it. But in this relationship we started when I was feeling heartbroken, which may not have been fair. Later I learned she wanted to please me in the beginning, but is actually not that sexual of a person. She had some trauma that confused her when she was young, and basically concluded that most sex is some kind of perverted thing, (which is a shame). Even after deepening our trust and bond, and having great adventures, and building a life (and small business) together, she has never let go of this stuff, never healed, never fully embraced her sexuality, and most often acts like an anti-sex feminist (I embrace her opinions, beliefs, and listen to her perspective, but the anti-sex part is annoying as hell). She acts like oral is a disgusting chore, and hates giving me hand jobs. I have had to ask her if she really likes me better than women, and she insists she likes me/men... So I chalk it up to lower libido, past trauma, individual differences, etc. Whatever...

So most recently, about 12 weeks ago, she had a health scare. Turned out it was all a false alarm, but took many weeks of follow up to rule out cancer. She is perfectly health and has been the whole time. But we quite literally didn't have sex for 12 weeks, and she knows I am a horny sexual guy, and she offers me nothing, and gives nothing if I ask. On top of that, she has been mostly unemployed and I have been supporting her during this time. One time she gave me a hand job when I was having trouble falling asleep, and one time she (barely) let me titty fuck her (which ruins the fun if she clearly can't enjoy the intimacy). That sums up the last 12 weeks of our sex life.

Meanwhile, this downtime between us has been overwhelming for me. It's made me feel like I am single and on the prowl again. I would never cheat on her. It would destroy her. But I have always been an almost-daily sex kind of guy. With really sexual partners, 14+ rounds per week was common. I just don't get it. I never expected to find myself feeling trapped like this. Perhaps it's my own fault? It really sucks because she has become super close with my entire family, and we make a great team in general. Sometimes I feel weak with her though... We don't feel like the power couple I wish we were... She loves me unconditionally, and what more could I ask of her?

I have tried to explain to her my sexual frustrations but she always turns it around making me feel like there is something wrong with waking up with a hardon every morning, or having a healthy pulse in my body, and being moved by sexuality in general. She makes me feel like I am perverted if my drive is higher than hers, and I should really check myself and humble down. She brings it back to her needs, and her comforts, and always states things like sex once per week is healthy.... I know like isn't all about sex, but if it leaves me feeling unsatisfied and desiring a lot more.... Then perhaps the chemistry just isn't there? Perhaps I am compromising too much?

I have a coworker that is super flirty with me. ...Never ever going anywhere near that woman, for the record. But it makes me WANT to live a singles life again. I miss being single and/or available!!!!! I want to feel vibrant and alive again. I feel kind of dead inside right now.


I am left wondering, should I?
1) Ask for an open relationship?

Or

2) Tell her I want a break, and she should go be with her family for Christmas and perhaps we reunite in a month or two?

Or

3) End it because I am simply not 100% into this, and have struggled since her true self began to reveal itself?

Or

4) Embrace a path of healing with her, accept her limitations (and my frustrations), humble down, and hope maybe our sex life gets better in the fantasy future?

We went on many dates over the summer, but we have been in long distance since September (I’ll be seeing her irl again next month) because of university. The long distance has been going pretty well and we communicate with each other a lot.

We’ve only had a few problems like most couples, but we always work through them together.

My relationship isn’t at a risk for a break up or anything, but I just want to reassure my gf that I like her for her and not just as someone to show off.

I compliment her a lot because she is beautiful on the inside and out, and every person who asks me about her ends up saying how lucky I got after I talk about her.

I’m not bad looking at all, in fact, she thinks I’m out of her league (I think we are in the same league) and she thinks I’m a genius, she considers me the nicest person she’s ever met, and overall she really likes me. I really like her too because she’s also really smart, kind, and she’s really mature.

Yesterday, I was facetiming with my mom, and she said how she wants to meet her by next summer at the latest, so I was telling my gf about this. I was also talking about my parent’s expectations, etc. and I was reassuring her that my parents are gonna like her because of who she is. Yet, this isn’t the first time she thought I was treating her like a “trophy wife” just to show her off. Everyone genuinely thinks she’s an amazing person, so when I talk about her (I always talk about her respectfully) she thinks I’m showing her off.

Part of this might be that I have very high standards for the people I would date (I’ve only ever liked 3 people in my lifetime including her and she is my second relationship) so she thinks that I want to show her off to others rather than just want to be with her. Which is weird because I already spend time with her the most and I don’t talk about her to others all the time. I’m also not the type of guy to make her be someone presentable because I don’t want to force her to do anything and she’s already amazing the way she is.

I am a male (25) and I have issue with my gf (25) . She is very often feeling  hopeless because she has no job  although she finished her law university like 2 years ago. She has been working some low tier jobs, like in a store or sale department etc... There are also her weird parents who are not very supportive to her and not listening to her, so she usually  take her problems out on  me and it is getting stressful for me. 

On the other hand I just finished my  university in electrical  engineering and i already got hired by good company  in my profession, also having good salary. So we are in kind of contrast in terms of job. I am from Europe and i will go to work on Cruise ship in Brazil as an engineer.

However she is my first gf, we meet when i was 19 she was 20. I had some issues with my uni at the time and had to postpone study for some time and she was there for me supporting me even tho i was on the  bottom at the time. When i had no money she was paying for me and always cheered me when i was sad.

Reasons to break up:

First gf (  obviously  you can't stay on 1 woman for the rest of ur life)  
She is bit older than me ( 10 months)  
**Her negative mood is affecting my stress level - biggest downside**  
Difference about jobs (even tho she find a job in her profession, i will still have greatly larger salary)

Reasons to stay:

I do want good for her  
She was with me when i was nothing while she has already graduated  
She payed for me when i had no money  
Supported me when i had my own issues

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is not an easy decision, leaving her now when she has problem and i do not, does feel selfish AF, but on the other hand we are not married or anything.  I dont know what the future will be if i stay with her and she stays unemployed with weird parents, will it get better or worse for my sanity.

Mabey someone was in similar situation as i am  right now, so feel free to give your oppinion.

Thanks in advance.

We've both deleted the app from out phone (or so he claims). Two months from now I'm gonna leave for a 6 month internship in another country, and we are planning on doing a long distance relationship for that time and visit each other regularly (its only a 3h flight). 

Yesterday morning my best friend (she is single) texts me that the previous night she was scrolling through Tinder and she saw my boyfriend's profile pop-up on Tinder. She was swiping fast so she only got a glimpse of him and didn't manage to take a screen-shot before she realized, but she says she is 99% sure it was him because she then looked him up on Instagram and had the exact same profile pic.

I was sick to my stomach the whole day, but I was at work and I couldn't call him. Last night, I texted him ""we need to talk. Can I call you?"". I called him up to confront him and the conversation went like this (almost exact transcription):

Me: - (very serious) You probably know why I called you.

Him: - (sarcastic, detecting my serious voice) You wanna dump.

Me: - Yes

Him: - Ok

Me: - Please put all the stuff I have at your apartment in a bag and send them by Uber

Him: (completely confused) Wait... you're serious? What? Why? Huh? I mean.. I was joking... You know the whole ""when someone says &lt;we need to talk&gt; in the movies it's because they want to break up"". I didn't think you really meant it. I thought you were gonna bail on the trip (we are supposed to go on a weekend trip to Venice). Again... huh?

Me: Someone (I didn't tell him who) saw you on Tinder last night at 1am, after we talked and I fell asleep at 11pm (we don't live together). I feel like you waited for me to go to bed and then went behind my back on Tinder.

Him: (not at all shocked or anything) Ooooo that... nah it was at 8pm. Idk.. I was bored at the PC. Logged into Tinder on browser, out of curiosity. Not like ""want to see if I can cheat on my girlfriend curiosity"" more like general curiosity ""what's new on the app?"" , ""what kind of people are on Tinder lately?"" , stuff like that. It was either that or Wikipedia, the sentiment was the same. But anyway... they ruined the app on browser, you can't fast swipe anymore. Before, when you hit the left key, it swiped left, now you have to hold the key down for like 3 seconds, really bad design. Anyway... I logged on at 8:24pm, swiped left on 3 profiles, mostly looking at the mechanics, got bored, logged out at 8:25pm. Literally 1minute (he laughs).

He then sends me a screenshot of his browsing history, and Tinder was at 8:24PM, and at 8:25PM he was on Youtube (""R&amp;M-squirrels control the world""), and then almost every 3-5 min was another totally random thing (news articels, GoT lore, weird youtube videos, random Wikipedia articles)

Him: - What did you think? That I went ""Oh my girlfriend which I love deeply is going away for 6 months.. time to start cheating""? And that, not only did I plan to cheat on you while you were away, but I also wanted to get a 2 month head start (I'm leaving in 2 months), so I can cheat the second her plane takes off..... Seriously, do you think that low of me? 

Him: - Look I'm sorry about what happened, and that you feel this way. I didn't want to hurt, and I wasn't going behind your back.. I literally thought nothing of it.. when you initially called and said you wanted to break up, my mind was making a list of all the things that could've trigger this.. and there was a lot (he was laughing when he said this, and probably meant it sarcastically), but the fact I was on Tinder last night was not part of the list.. I even forgot about the fact that I logged in last night. 

Him: - And I'm really sorry that someone saw me and told you, I can understand how that can feel really insulting and embarrassing, someone coming up to you and saying ""hey you know your loving boyfriend.. yeah he was on tinder last night"". And I'm sorry I put you in this embarrassing situation.

Me: - what were you doing last night at 1 am after I went to bed?

Him: - I wasn't.. it was at 8pm.. you went to bed at 11pm, we even talked before bed (not about this).

Me: - my friend said she saw you at 1am

Him: - did she see the little ""active now"" thingy? Did she talk to me? (sarcastic voice) you do know that your profile shows up even after you close the app, right? You aren't only visible while literally swiping. come on.. you've used the app before.

Me: - she said she only saw you for a second but then looked you up on instagram and it was the same picture, and I know that picture and you do have it in both places. But why were you still visible to other? Why didn't you use the ""discoverable"" setting

Him: - huh? 

Me: -  the button in settings that you click so others cant see you profile

Him: - I literally did not know about this... but again.. i didn't really care.. until this point it wasn't really that big of deal

Me: - But why do you still have Tinder? You said you deleted it.

Him: - I did delete the app from my phone. Last night I logged in on my PC. I didn't delete the account.

Me: - why not?

Him: - as I said... I didnt really think of it as such a big deal. Also I only deleted the app because you asked me too. Otherwise I'd probably just leave it there.. I still have apps that have been discontinued for years. 

Him: - Also, you do know I can see that you still have YOUR Tinder account. I mean, you do know we met on Tinder, and I still have the conversation, and your profile is still there (sends me print screen). So why didn't YOU delete YOUR account?

Me: - I deleted the app from my phone

Him: (screaming) SO DID I !!!

Me: I also made my profile undiscoverable

Him: I did not know about that feature. I just let it die out on it's own, and the algorithm stops suggesting me. Also here (sends me screenshot of his last conversations) see, you're the last conversation I had 2 years ago... ignore the other chick to whom I was talking to on the same day as you (he laughs).

&amp;#x200B;

Then we argued some more, and he gradually became more combative. At the start of our phone call he was really sarcastic and joyful, sometimes laughing when saying things. But gradually became more combative and angrier and shouting. 

He says that it was because I was starting to piss him off, because I just called him and first thing I said was I want to break up, not ""hey why were you on Tinder. Explain yourself"", and that I didn't trust him after more than one year together. And that I thought so low of him as to start looking 2 months before my departure. And also that I thought him that stupid that if he wanted to cheat on me he would get caught so easily (this remark really bothered me, but he said he blurted that out after 2h of me being unreasonable and uncommunicative). In total we talked for like 3h.

And now, we haven't talked since last night and we're in that grey zone where I don't know if we are broken up or not. Or if I want to be or not. All I know is that I feel really betrayed and cheated.. and don't know how to proceed from here.

&amp;#x200B;

I (F23) am having issues with my brother (M21) girlfriend (F23) and I just don’t know how to confront her about it.

Now i actually don’t know where to start this has been a mess for the past 2 years, but it started back in 2019, when my husband(M30) daughter and I moved to our state from a different country to start a new life. I barely knew his girlfriend as they just started dating that year, we met on the phone but she didn’t talk much, my brother ironically was in jail when I met her and she was about 6 months pregnant with my neice. She seemed rude and didn’t care to meet me, I put that aside considering she was pregnant, working and her boyfriend was in jail. 

But considering her attitude I tried my best to keep my distance, but she’d always find a way back. (Remember I’m just giving a scratch of the surface, it was way more complicated then this but I’m trying to summarize and keep short) 

So much happened, where my husband and I lived in my moms basment and she kicked us out, we ended up getting a very cheap small apartment and we’re very proud of it. 
It was the first time we had an actual space to ourselves and we were damn proud. 

Fast forward to after Andy has my niece, my brother was out of jail this time and she needed a baby sitter, my brother demanded/suggested I would do it and that they’d pay me, they never actually did, and it was a lot of hard work, and I was never really thanked or felt appreciated for that, especially because when I needed a babysitter for my daughter, Andy wouldn’t help out. 

During evenings when Andy didn’t have work, (this was during Covid so not much to do) she would simply invite her self to my house so that I can cook for her and a friend. 
Would she help pay? No. 
Would she help cook? Nope.
Clean?! Nah.
And maybe it’s my inner housewife talking, but that pissed me off. I didn’t say much tho, because growing up I was taught to accommodate towards your guests and their needs. 

Ontop of inviting herself over, and suggesting what I should cook for them (especially knowing that I try my best to keep my house clean and that I have severe depression and anxiety so it was hard for me to keep up, and also hard to say no, I was super desperate for company/friends) her nephew would come over, and simply destroy my house. 

I’m talking knocking things over/ ripping them up and by the time they left my house was a huge huge mess. 
But Andy wouldn’t say anything, she didn’t care, she’s just ask “when will the food be ready?” Eat, leave her plate and mess (sometimes my neices dirty diapers too) and leave. 

She’d leave pretty late so by the time my husband got home from a 16hr shift, that’s what he’d see, a tired wife messy house and food all gone, I don’t blame him for being angry. 

This went on for a while and I used the excuse that she just had a baby and I just felt bad, my brother was treating her terribly and her life was just awful. 

But I was going through my own things and finally had the guts to cut things off.  It was nice without her. 

But ofc she missed her free meals and free child care, and decided to shimmy her way back. I simply let her know how I felt and she agreed and apologized. 

But it doesn’t end there. 

When we we’re friends she’s only come to me to dump all her problems, I knew when she texted me “hey” something was up, she needed something, my brother did something, or it was a friend she wanted to rant about. 

(I know I was so so dumb I’m more mad at myself trust me.) 

So with shimmying her way back in, my niece was walking by this point, and she’d just given birth to my nephew and I just got pregnant with my son. 
My husband and I moved out of our shoe box apartment and we’re proud to live in a bigger one. Not the best neighborhood but it has everything we need and is right next to his job. 

The same thing that she did with her nephew she’s doing with my neice let’s her make a huge mess destroy everything, eats what she wants and leaves. I used the she’s pregnant/just given birth as an excuse. 

She’s come just to eat, leave her mess, Childs mess and fucking leave. 

I stopped cooking and ironically my husband works at a restaurant so we get free food all the time. 

Best belive Andy doesn’t hesitate to ask for free stuff and complain if something took too long to get to us or if the cheese was wired or fries too cold. Once she got a huge order took like two bites of everything and complained about how the food took too long and it was cold (their store was super busy and we’re lucky he was even able to make anything that day with all the costumers.)

Anyways,  it’s been like 2 years now and my nephew is a toddler walking now, he joins his sister with the mess. there is so much more to this story, so much shit to unfold, this is just the current issue that bugs me the most, how do I tell her to fuck off in a nice way? (Btw she also owes me money but that’s a diffrent story also why I don’t want to be harsh)

We married young, I know, but the heart wants what the heart wants. The last 8-9 years have been pretty dang good too. Lately though, we just don’t connect. She works an insane amount and so do I. But it feels like when she’s home she’s just angry and irritated. I do the vast majority of the cooking and pretty much all the cleaning and errands , etc.
Which I don’t mind but it’d be a lot nicer if she was somewhat more pleasant to be around when she’s home. 

When she’s home she’s either watching YouTuber videos on her computer or playing Sim-City buildit on her phone. As our emotional connection has grown strained so has our sexual one. We have sex 1-2 times a month. I do not want to be 31 and having sex 12 times a year. We’ve discussed this. She says shes depressed. So I look up local clinics and give her the information to sign up. She doesn’t follow through. She doesn’t do anything which would help her mental or physical health. She says her sex drive will go up when she’s in her later 30´s like all women? 

It’s been a year of this. I feel neglected emotionally and physically. I would never cheat but I’m starting to crave physical affection and attention and I’m looking at other women in a way I haven’t done in 10 years. 

I don’t know what to do anymore.

I addressed the problem. I communicated openly and honestly. I laid out how I feel about our relationship. She just doesn’t do anything. She says things will get better but then nothing changes. I’ve started journaling because she denies things are as bad as I say and tries to gaslight me. So when I’ve journaled it, at least I know I’m not exaggerating or being crazy.

Oh boy, where do I start this one?I'll break it up into 6 sections to make it easier to follow. Apologies if it's all over the place, my thoughts aren't exactly clear just yet.

**Part 1: Changing schools**  
6 years ago I changed schools to better my education. I live in a small town and there aren't many opportunities around here. You have to take every chance you get if you want to climb up the ladder. I had big dreams and the right opportunity so I took it.

Luckily I got into a really good class and I don't just mean this academically. We all bonded in the first few weeks, no cliques, no drama. Me and 3 other guys became especially good friends. Not only did we always hang out but we could also count on each other. I would trust these guys with my life.

One of the guys from the group, Mark, was also good friends with one of the girls, Lily. We always teased them by saying that they're going to fall in love and get married one day. Of course, they always deflected it, except one day Lily confessed to Mark that she had a crush on him. It turned out that Mark did too, he just kept his feelings a secret. Their relationship lasted for more than a year, until Mark dumped her. You know what they say about dating your classmates? Well, he decided to solve the issue of having to see her every day for 5 more years by simply ignoring her. She was open to still being friends with him but he decided that treating her as if she was invisible was for the better.

**Part 2: Becoming friends**  
Back in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, my school decided to go completely online. No in-person classes, only online meetings. Me and Lily were always among the first ones to join the meetings so to pass time we would chat a bit before every class. Nothing crazy, just some casual small takes, a few jokes here and there. One day, completely out of the blue, she asked me to meet up with her. I declined her invitation, saying that I was busy. I told Mark about the situation and we had a good laugh. Me and Lily remained in contact however and would chat every day.

When school was finally over and our summer break began, she decided to ask me again. I was really hesitant because I felt guilty about meeting up with my best friend's ex. I caved in however and we went for a small walk at night. My friends knew that I was out, just didn't know where or with who so when they asked I lied and said that I was just taking a walk by myself. It felt like I was backstabbing them. We would continue to meet up every now and then throughout the summer.

When September came around and school started we sat next to one another in a few classes. She told me that she was really thankful for all the time we spent together during the break.

**Part 3: Getting close**  
One day, we made a bet that she could make me switch over to sending voice messages instead of texts in less than a month. Voice messages were her preferred way of communication. Every day, she would tell me about her day, what she was up to, and anything interesting or funny that happened to her. I would always reply to her by text.

Then one day she sent me a voice message crying. She went into great detail about her family problems. Her manipulative mom, how she treats her, how no one knows about it (she didn't even tell Mark about her relationship with her mom when they were dating), and how she is on the point of breakdown. I replied by sending her a really long voice message (the first that I sent) trying to console her. Reassuring her that she isn't crazy, her mom is truly awful. Explaining my childhood trauma and how I deal/dealt with it. And last but not least told her how much she means to me in great detail.

From then onward, we would always talk about our problems with each other. I would tell my problems to her first instead of my 3 best friends, in some cases not even telling them at all. She did the same.

I started spending more and more time with her at the expense of spending time with my other friends. If I was talking to someone, 99% of the time it was her. I felt extreme guilt for abandoning my friends but couldn't help it. I wanted to help her with all that she has to go through. She was also really helpful for all my effort and told me that I help her a lot. She was also just really fun to talk to. Spending an hour or two sending voice messages back and forth turned into staying up till 2 AM just to talk.

This felt especially good for me. I'm a night owl and I never had a proper relationship, other than a few short-term flings here and there. I always wished to stay up till dawn with someone just to talk to each other in secret. She told me that she really missed having someone she could love in a romantic way.

**Part 4: Falling in love**  
Fast forward to around a month ago. Our chats have turned much more straightforward. We regularly remind one another how much they mean to us, how much we love them and how thankful we are for knowing each other.

Things have turned really flirty in real life too. She would always sit next to me and put her head on my shoulder. We would eye up each other from afar. It got to the point that several people asked her if we were dating and several people warned me to not be so straightforward about us being together, which mind you we weren't.

We also broke a pretty big boundary and started talking about sex. Everything from previous experience (which I desperately lack), kinks and preferences, and all that, and we found out we're really compatible sexually. We talked about how attractive we found each other. We would send really suggestive memes and joke about actually following up on them. She told me she had a wet dream where we had sex.

Now, I know what you're thinking. But at this point, it was too late. It also didn't help that even during my previous 'relationships' I never really felt an emotional connection to anyone (which is an important part of why nothing ever came of those). She was the first person who I could say was my soul mate.

We also organized a few 'dates', although I don't think either of us took that name too literally. We joked that we'll have to start calling them something else because by the third one we'd have to hook up.

**Part 5: The current situation**  
Even as this was going on she kept meeting other guys. She is pretty attractive and really approachable so this wasn't something I felt really bad about. I also met a few girls here and there although never with the intention of pursuing them instead of her. She always told me that she didn't feel as strong of a connection with any other guy as she did with me so she always stopped seeing them.

This was the case with the last one. She told me she found him really irritating over text even though she had a good time with the guy when they met the first time. She decided to meet up with him a second time and I had bad feelings about it. I remember my stomach clenching when she told me she texted me that she was getting on the bus. I spend the next 3 hours trying to distract myself before a friend of mine called me to meet up at his place. I went over, we talked, had a good time and I got a little drunk.

When I came back home I saw that she sent me two 15-minute voice messages. She goes into detail about how over the moon she is. They spent 6 hours talking. They had an amazing time. They held hands and even had their first kiss. She told me she was really in love. She then ended the voice message because she said she got incredibly horny just talking about him.

Now, if I just sit down and think logically. I know that it wouldn't have been good if I dated my best friend's ex. Someone who is still a classmate of mine, mind you. I also know that she doesn't owe me anything. She is free to have feelings for anyone and that I shouldn't expect anything from her. But at the same time, I feel incredibly broken. I can feel my heart pounding as I'm writing this. Maybe not even because of what happened between them but because of the image I built up of us in my head finally tumbling down with me still standing underneath it. Maybe because I realized I've been an awful person and an awful friend for a year now.

And the worst part is that I cannot tell anyone. I can't tell her how I feel right now with that other guy in the picture. I can't tell my friends either because I'm afraid they would turn on me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what I expect from this post but at least it felt good to write all of this down. Apologies for making it this long.

How do you guys deal with moving on? Do you think I should tell her or my friends how I feel? Maybe I should just keep quiet and hope this blows over, this is my last year here anyway.

He came home, i was in bed, i didn’t say anything to him, and he was in the living room. He started throwing things, including glass cups. I told him to stop, that i felt unsafe and he was scaring me. He kept going so i got up to get dressed and leave. He would not let me out of the room. He stood in front of the door and physically would not let me out. I started yelling at him at the top of my lungs, I was scared, I felt so out of control and upset because he would not let me leave. I try again and he won’t let me. I smacked his forearm, not hard, but I admit was wrong. A few minutes later he grabs my keys out of my hand, squeezes my hand really hard and almost twists my arms. It was kind of a blur but all i know is that it hurt. He didn’t hit me or anything but definitely manhandled me and was calling me crazy and psycho when i was yelling at him. I ended up getting out and calling an Uber which he chased down the street. He has called me over 100 times, saying he’s sorry, and his anger was at his ring and not me.

Hey Reddit,

I cannot believe I'm posting here, but this is such intimate topic that I don't feel like it's fair to share the details of the situation to any of my friends, since it would brake trust between me and a girl I've been going out with. In these kinds of things, I’m usually very capable of making choices myself, but I just need to hear what others would do in my situation. I will probably end up just listening to my gut feeling, but I can’t quite tell what it is telling me yet.

To the story… Me \[28M\] and a girl \[27F\] have been going out for a month, and things are going great. She is very emphatic, kind, caring, and truly interested in things I'm saying. She shares my worldview and is truly beautiful. We have been moving pretty fast, seeing 4 to 5 times a week. We are both looking for a serious relationship, and have been talking very openly about everything, such as kids, past relationships, sex and future goals.

In my younger years, I had some FWBs, did some sleeping around, and had some short relationships. However, ever since turning 21, I have matured a lot. I feel like short flings are just masturbation with extra steps. I have become intimate, and I only consider having sex, if I feel connected to the girl I’m seeing. Considering my past, I don’t judge other people who sleep around, or have a different viewpoint on sex or life as a whole.

Now to her. She has has things in her past, but who doesn't? Nothing too crazy that she has told me, but things that my gut feeling just for some reason sees as a bit of a red flags, when you combine them all.

1. The longest relationship she has been in, is one year, and other relationships have fallen shorter. Nothing wrong with that, maybe she has gotten unlucky. Maybe things just hasn’t worked out. That’s completely fine for me

2. She explained that during COVID times, she was in a bit of a dry spell, and didn’t even want to have sex that much because of her bad previous experiences. However, once she met her ex, she got comfortable with her sexuality. Once the relationship ended (7 months ago), she went into a bit of a hypersexual phase, and did some heavy sleeping around (not sure about the numbers, but they don’t matter that much to me whether it was 3 or 10). She explained it as her being heartbroken, finally comfortable with her sexuality, which led her to sleep around actively, with “not much care for herself”. This was only 3 months ago, and but she said that that phase is completely over now.

3. We were talking about how we are drunk. She explained that she becomes much more extrovert, and becomes much more impulsive, both which sound pretty normal to me. When I asked if that has led her to any trouble, she said “Have done some stupid things and made awful decisions, but mostly been there when other people do stupid things”. Nothing crazy here either, who wouldn’t have? 

4. Overall, she is very trusting, and I feel like I can trust her. She does seem a bit careless in the sense of her own safety, explaining that she sometimes crosses the road, without “looking too closely whether cars are coming” and things like that. 

5. She said after sex that she enjoys the intimacy with me a lot, and the sex too. I think we have very great sex, and we both are passionate lovers. She says, however, that because I’m not just a hookup, she feels not fully ccomfortable with herself, and comfortable being herself since she knows that she will see me again

The positives in this girl really outshine the negatives (if there truly are any), and she truly seems one of the most caring people I’ve met. The emotional connection with her is deeper than in some of my longer (3 year+) relationships. I very much feel very connected to her, and we both seem to care about each other very much. However, her past about sexuality, and carelessness for herself, and how recent her “hypersexual” phase just troubles me quite a bit. Not because she has slept with other people, that would be completely fine for me, even if it was 30 guys spread along 8 years. But when you add all of these things together, and how recent they are, the feeling I get by reading the things I wrote out makes her seem a bit instable in some sense. However, she seems completely comfortable with herself, seems to be over her previous phases, and says that she wants a long-time relationship, and she was willing to talk about these things to me, which I respect a lot. I’m just very worried for some reason, and I cannot fully pinpoint why. I think I’m feeling somewhat insecure, and scared that if we have a hard time somewhere in our future, as will everyone, how will she react? If your once hypersexual, will you carry that always with you? I don’t quite know. What does the carelessness tell about her? I’ve never been the insecure type, and I just can’t tell why I’m feeling this way now. My brain tells me she is perfect, but something in my gut just doesn’t feel right, and it really troubles me. Why can't I just forget these things, and fully enjoy being with her? Can you knock some sense in to me.

I don’t know what I’m asking from you Reddit. Maybe some perspective, maybe some advice, maybe some similar experiences. Anything and everything. Thanks a lot!

*Other relevant things: we did not kiss or have sex in our first or second date, I think we did both on 3rd or 4th.*

TL:DR; Amazing girl, one month of dating, closest connection I’ve felt to anyone, similar worldviews, and goals. Feeling insecure, even though I’ve never been the insecure type. This is because of her sexual past and tendency to be careless combined. One without the other would be fine. Together? Just makes me a bit scared.

We fell in love and have passionate interactions be it physical and/or emotional. There are no problems when we're together til it wasn't lol. We almost broke up one time because she didn't tell me her husband still lives with her. I assumed they were tied only by paper but never under the same household. She was scared to tell me in fear of losing me. I know she loves me very much. She's in a dead marriage defined only by legality and her attachment issues. If she could leave him and still keep the house(which she bought w/ blood sweat and tears) she would. She hates the idea that he takes half if she divorced him. He doesn't deserve any of it and is a shitty husband but a really good father according to her. She's determined to take any bs just for her son. Even if it means a shitty abusive  marriage. Her son comes first. They managed to keep their war near-perfect discreet. But she's sure her son knows something. The kid isn't his own blood but from a previous abusive relationship. She doesn't rely on him for money, both of them make really good money. She believes the husband only stays just to piss her off, knowing he has something to tie her down to the marriage. They don't sleep in the same room anymore. she pretends that everything is okay because any issue she'd bring up will cause a fight and ultimately her getting beaten. She admits that once in a while, she goes to him because of attachment issues. But she doesn't love him anymore and he knows it as well. She can't leave the house freely due to her PTSD from past relationships. And because of this she has a fear of men in general. She'd ask her friends to come w/ her and cover for her everytime she wants to go out, so the husband won't beat her.

Luckily I got into a really good class and I don't just mean this academically. We all bonded in the first few weeks, no cliques, no drama. Me and 3 other guys became especially good friends. Not only did we always hang out but we could also count on each other. I would trust these guys with my life.

One of the guys from the group, Csaba, was also good friends with one of the girls, Nora. We always teased them by saying that they're going to fall in love and get married one day. Of course, they always deflected it, except one day Nora confessed to Csaba that she's had a crush on him. It turned out that Csaba did too, he just kept his feelings a secret. Their relationship lasted for more than a year, until Csaba dumped her. You know what they say about dating your classmates? Well, he decided to solve the issue of having to see her every day for 5 more years by simply ignoring her. She was open to still being friends with him but he decided that treating her as if she was invisible was for the better.

**Part 2: Becoming friends**  
Back in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, my school decided to go completely online. No in-person classes, only online meetings. Me and Nora were always among the first ones to join the meetings so to pass the time we would chat a bit before every class. Nothing crazy, just some casual small takes, a few jokes here and there. One day, completely out of the blue, she asked me to meet up with her. I declined her invitation, saying that I was busy. I told Csaba about the situation and we had a good laugh. Me and Nora remained in contact however and would chat every day.

When school was finally over and our summer break began, she decided to ask me again. I was really hesitant because I felt guilty about meeting up with my best friend's ex. I caved in however and we went for a small walk at night. My friends knew that I was out, just didn't know where or with who so when they asked I lied and said that I was just taking a walk by myself. It felt like I was backstabbing them. We would continue to meet up every now and then throughout the summer.

When September came around and school started we sat next to one another in a few classes. She told me that she was really thankful for all the time we spent together during the break.

**Part 3: Getting close**  
One day, we made a bet that she could make me switch over to sending voice messages instead of texts in less than a month. Voice messages were her preferred way of communication. Every day, she would tell me about her day, what she was up to, and anything interesting or funny that happened to her. I would always reply to her by text.

Then one day she sent me a voice message crying. She went into great detail about her family problems. Her manipulative mom, how she treats her, how no one knows about it (she didn't even tell Csaba about her relationship with her mom when they were dating), and how she is on the point of breakdown. I replied by sending her a really long voice message (the first that I sent) trying to console her. Reassuring her that she isn't crazy, her mom is truly awful. Explaining my childhood trauma and how I deal/dealt with it. And last but not least told her how much she means to me in great detail.

From then onward, we would always talk about our problems with each other. I would tell my problems to her first instead of my 3 best friends, in some cases not even telling them at all. She did the same.

I started spending more and more time with her at the expense of spending time with my other friends. If I was talking to someone, 99% of the time it was her. I felt extreme guilt by abandoning my friends but couldn't help it. I wanted to help her with all that she has to go through. She was also really helpful for all my effort and told me that I help her a lot. She was also just really fun to talk to. Spending an hour or two sending voice messages back and forth turned into staying up till 2 AM just to talk.

This felt especially good for me. I'm a night owl and I never had a proper relationship, other than a few short-term flings here and there. I always wished to stay up till dawn with someone just to talk to each other in secret. She told me that she really missed having someone she could love in a romantic way.

**Part 4: Falling in love with her**
Fast forward to around a month ago. Our chats have turned much more straightforward. We regularly remind one another how much they mean to us, how much we love them and how thankful we are for knowing each other.

Things have turned really flirty in real life too. She would always sit next to me and put her head on my shoulder. We would eye up each other from afar. It got to the point that several people asked her if we were dating and several people warned me to not be so straightforward about us being together, which mind you we weren't.

We also broke a pretty big boundary and started talking about sex. Everything from previous experience (which I desperately lack), kinks and preferences, and all that, and we found out we're really compatible sexually. We talked about how attractive we found each other. We would send really suggestive memes and joke about actually following up on them. She told me she had a wet dream where we had sex.

Now, I know what you're thinking. But at this point, it was too late. It also didn't help that even during my previous 'relationships' I never really felt an emotional connection to anyone (which is an important part of why nothing ever came of those). She was the first person who I could say was my soul mate.

We also organized a few 'dates', although I don't think either of us took that name too literally. We joked that we'll have to start calling them something else because by the third one we'd have to hook up.

**Part 5: The current situation**  
Even as this was going on she kept meeting other guys. She is pretty attractive and really approachable so this wasn't something I felt really bad about. I also met a few girls here and there although never with the intention of pursuing them instead of her. She always told me that she didn't feel as strong of a connection with any other guy as she did with me so she always stopped seeing them.

This was the case with the last one. She told me she found him really irritating over text even though she had a good time with the guy when they met the first time. She decided to meet up with him a second time and I had bad feelings about it. I remember my stomach clenching when she told me she texted me that she was getting on the bus. I spend the next 3 hours trying to distract myself before a friend of mine called me to meet up at his place. I went over, we talked, had a good time and I got a little drunk.

When I came back home I saw that she sent me two 15 minute voice messages. She goes into detail about how over the moon she is. They spent 6 hours talking. They had an amazing time. They held hands and even had their first kiss. She told me she was really in love. She then ended the voice message because she said she got incredibly horny just talking about him.15-minute

Now, if I just sit down and think logically. I know that it wouldn't have been good if I dated my best friend's ex. Someone who is still a classmate of mine, mind you. I also know that she doesn't owe me anything. She is free to have feelings for anyone and I shouldn't expect anything from her. But at the same time, I feel incredibly broken. Maybe not even because of what happened between them but because of the image I built up of us in my head finally tumbling down with me still standing underneath it. Maybe because I realized I've been an awful person and an awful friend for a year now. I can feel my heart pounding as I'm writing this.

And the worst part is that I cannot tell anyone. I can't tell her how I feel right now with that other guy in the picture. I can't tell my friends either because I'm afraid they would turn on me.

I'm not really sure what I expect from this post but at least it felt good to write all of this down. Apologies for making it this long. Also, apologies if this subreddit isn't the best place for this.

How do you guys deal with moving on? Do you think I should, tell her or my friends how I feel? Maybe I should just keep quiet and hope this blows over, this is my last year here anyway.

I’ve had a crush on one of these friends (let’s call him John) whom I also work with and we’ve developed really great banter / possible slight flirting (?) whenever we talk alone or with a small group. 

So we all meet up at the cafe and John suddenly says he has to take a call, goes outside for a couple of minutes, and then comes back in with his girlfriend. None of us were given any indication that she would show up. To make matters weirder, our hangout was a study session that involved all of us having read a part of a book that his girlfriend had clearly not read.

After the initial shock, her being there just threw off the whole vibe of the outing until she left before John to go home and meet a friend of hers that was coming over to their house. After she left, it seemed like John was more comfortable and our banter continued until we, as a group, decided to head out. 

The GF seemed friendly to me and everyone else, but you could feel this weird tension between her and John. There wasn’t an easily explained reason why she was there because 1) She doesn’t work nearby, 2) She and John weren’t immediately after the hangout going to go somewhere else nearby, and 3) We were discussing something she didn’t know about.

Since we’ve moved in together (6 months ago), he’s  often times woken me up by grinding on me. It depends on the way that I’m sleeping or facing, but he’ll start dry humping any part of my body to rub himself on me. This morning it was my knee, but previously it’s been my butt, thigh, and hip as well. I’ve told him I don’t like being woken up by being humped and that I don’t want to be humped as soon as I wake up in the morning anyways. He’s done this about a dozen times now and just doesn’t seem to care that I don’t like it. This morning he cuddled me closely and nuzzled his head on my chest and our legs were kind of tangled together and I thought he was just being sweet… until I feel him against my knee and he just starts grinding himself on my knee. When he did it I asked him “why does it always have to be sexual with you?” And he scoffs and responds “this again?” and just rolls over and puts space between us so he’s  not touching me at all. This is his usual response when I’ve asked him to stop. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve told him multiple times that I don’t like it, I’ve explained why I don’t like it (he talks about sex a lot and is very sex focused in general - we probably have sex about 4-5 times a week but it would be like 10-12 if we had it every time he wanted). I’ve talked to him about all of this. About randomly humping me in the mornings when I’m trying to sleep, about not liking the sex-focused mindset he always seems to be in, and about how he reacts when I ask him to stop humping me. Idk maybe I’m being silly and it’s not that big of a deal since we do have sex and are in a relationship, I just don’t like feeling like a piece of meat. I think I’d feel differently if he reacted different when I asked him to stop. I don’t know how else to tell him this hurts me.

It's various things, seeing a pimple or worrying her butt isn't big enough or thinking she's gaining weight. 

I need to absolutely stress that she is beautiful, positively absolutely a pretty woman by any objective standard. She is healthy, good skin, nice figure, and in my subjective opinion damn near perfect. 

Here's the issue, I tell her she's pretty and attractive all the time, I show her affection physically or otherwise in ways she likes. But if I ever try to say she's pretty when she's feeling bad, my opinion doesn't matter because I'm ""biased"" because I'm dating her. 

But! If a stranger compliments her, it makes her day, she's happy and believes she's pretty at least for a while and it means so much to her that some random person thinks she's pretty. Well she *is* pretty so of course other people think so too, but my comments never seem to matter. I don't understand.

It's not just beauty issues, but also if she's feeling useless or stuck in life or whatever else, if I try to console her it doesn't do as much as if it comes from someone else, because ""you're my boyfriend, of course you think highly of me"". So it feels like because I'm her boyfriend my words mean nothing.

I asked her if she expected the guy to pay and she ghosted me. So I found her on IG, watched her story, and then asked if she would let me take her out for dinner. She agreed.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing.

Please don't post on other platforms.

Me (25F) and my fiance of 2 years, Tim (25M) have known each other since we were freshmen in college. He's almost perfect in every way. He's very kind, considerate, thoughtful, open minded, remembers the little things about me, comforts me even when I'm upset over little things, we share common interests, We can talk about literally anything, and we want the same things in life. We rarely argue. Every green flag you can imagine. Why would I want to leave him? 

While Tim is an almost perfect partner, he was a toxic friend. Before we dated, he was always cold and made snide jokes and insults at me and my appearance. He never asked how I was doing or cared to get into any of my interests even tho I got into his. I usually didn't mind his dark humor as I called it. Sometimes he would tell me how he found some women attractive. That's fine, but then there were some women he practically objectified. As a straight woman, I can acknowledge beauty but I don't care to hear any details. A few instances were:

-Oggling over an actress because she wore some tight clothes in a movie he watched. He even made me look up her Instagram to show me how attractive she is. It baffled me on why he was so insistent on talking about her when she wasn't even his favorite actress (he actually likes the main actor and for the movie's plot). Her being hot was irrelevant. Idk why he had to talk about the least important part of a movie, let alone to a straight woman like myself. 
What sucked is that I also like this movie and I can't even watch it anymore because it's triggering. 

- telling me he likes light eyes. This hurt deeply because of my complex of being mixed race and having colorist parents. (He also had a fetish for my ethnicity which is a whole other issue I have with him and myself).He has a right to his tastes but I was hurt he'd say it to a brown eyed woman. I've actually educated him on colorism and he deeply regrets not being more aware of it and hurting me in the process. 

-insulting my hobbies. He said he was jealous that I was good at what I did. It infuriated me because what friend would get jealous over a hobby? He has never expressed interest in this particular hobby so I was baffled when I found out. Unfortunately I can no longer enjoy this hobby or talk about it with him without feeling that resentment. 

There's plenty more instances but my post would be too long if I listed them all. This all happened before we dated. He obviously stopped saying all this which is great. I wish it was easy to forgive him. His words and actions sent me into a spiral of extreme insecurities and self hatred. My biggest regret and fault in all this was not telling him off while we were friends. I should've called him out and said his comments hurt. Our friendship was so bad that I didn't say anything cuz I didn't think he'd care about my feelings at all. I realized now I fell for him cuz I wanted to ""change"" him. 

Before anyone asks yes I spoke to my fiance about this and yes I'm in therapy (so is he). We even tried couples counseling. The whole reason I'm reconsidering this relationship is something our counselor said. 
She said that there's nothing she can do. Our issues stem from our past insecurities and mistakes. It's something we need to work on in our individual therapy. It's been years and nothing has changed. The only difference is that we argue less about it, but the feelings of guilt regret and self hatred are still there. 

Some of my friends think I should break it off because of how unhappy I am. One of them said that I should feel like he's lucky to have me  (because I'm attractive to him). I don't feel that way all here. He tries to tell me constantly that I'm attractive, beautiful, and he doesn't care about those celebrities he ogled over before. However I feel nothing. I feel more butterflies when my friends or strangers compliment me. I know that I'm supposed to feel attractive on my own terms, but having a partner who I know thinks so would help. 

I'm still conflicted because it's mostly about my own insecurities and being unforgiving rather than him being a bad partner. I'm afraid to leave this relationship and friend I've known for so long. If we break up I do not plan to date for awhile. I acknowledge I have a lot of deep rooted issues within myself and my Is plan to work on myself, make some changes about my appearance, and find new interests/hobbies, regardless if I leave him or not. I plan to give this a few more months before I finally decide. I do not think it's fair for either of us to keep going through this while my feelings of resentment towards him don't change. 

TL:DR my fiance is a great bf but was a toxic friend. I became extremely insecure because of that. I can't let go of the things he's said and done.  Couples counseling didn't work. I'm debating on leaving him because I can't let go of our past but I also love how our relationship is now.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7589351,public,self,I resent my fiance despite being an amazing partner,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzdqbw/i_resent_my_fiance_despite_being_an_amazing/,all_ads,6

Last year he met a girl (21F) on a dating app and they matched, she seemed nice and they dated for 2-3 months and during that time they had protected intercourse. John doesn’t know if she protected herself but at least he did. At the end of that period, they even got to meet each other’s parents and all, but not in a serious way as both stated they were just dating.

Anyway, he thought it was creepy that her parents seemed relieved to see her with him, because they stated he looked like someone “she could get serious with” and the dad blurted out  “not like the guys she run away with before” and he told me after they said that, they mentioned him she had serious mental issues, manic phases, hallucinations and even that she had been interned on mental health facilities, only that he met her “during a good phase”.

Obviously, after talking with the parents he didn’t get intimate again with her but he visited her twice after. One, when he saw a crisis which was terrifying and a second one, when she broke up with him because she said she didn’t want to be in an exclusive relationship as they agreed before start dating and that during that time she was hooking up with other guys, which she apologized for. John was more than relieved and he left.

A few months later she started calling him to say she was pregnant, that the kid was his and she didn’t want to have it. He told her he didn’t trust her word and she asked for money to do the procedure because her parents were pentecostal and wouldn’t help her or finance her. He agreed to help her because he knew his parents were quite fanatic, but he said it was just to help her and not because he thought the kid was his. Well, the parents found out and she was forced to have the child. After that they called him saying he had to be responsible and my friend told them she had multiple partners at the time and said that he would, but only after a DNA test and they agreed after apologizing. The next call was them yelling at John because their daughter said he was the “only one” and they believed her, so they considered and insult from him to even ask for a DNA test. 

She started sending messages to John’s mom after she found her social media profile and started bombarding him with pics of the baby, saying he deserved a grandma and trying to make her say if he looked like John as a baby. Her mom didn’t take the bait and offered her to pay for the tests but she never replied to this, just kept sending pics with cringy emotional captions.

John is in crisis because she doesn’t stop, and because he had a rough childhood with his dad out of the picture and he feels bad for the child. He also thinks it’s suspicious that she denies the test, so he doesn’t know if he should take matters legally or just block her and let the issue die out.

I’m not talking, a slap on the cheek, I mean severe beatings with a belt, and other instances where he once almost drowned me at a family event for splashing him with water and also when at five years old he made me eat food from the garbage mixed with waste, because I was left alone and too scared to eat in the dark by myself in an old house, so I threw out the remaining food I had and went to bed.

They were both also extremely emotionally abusive – making comments about my weight, being very negative in general, and speaking down at me and belittling me, often in front of others. There are many, many more examples, but you get the story.

I would beg my mum to leave him from as young as six years old, but she would say things like “I don’t want to be a divorced woman” (they are Latin American, so in her culture and being middle-upper class, it’s frowned upon), or just shrug it off. He never touched her, so she didn’t really care.

As soon as I could I left and had minimal contact with them. I now have an adoring fiancé, have moved away to the other part of the world, and have a great life, career and friendships. I have also had a few therapy sessions where my psychologist has confirmed that I was physically and emotionally abused – to the point that his behaviour would have ended him in jail in a developed country. He is also racist, sexist and a homophobe, so as a whole I really despise him as a person. My mum is a narcissist who was very un-mothering and not nurturing, and spent her whole life worrying about what people think of her and her career instead of me, or putting me down about my weight.

As my partner and I are planning our wedding, this is something that has started being an issue again, mainly as they started to get involved and put pressure on our planning.

My dad offered to pay for a large part of the wedding if we agreed to his demands – mostly about inviting a large majority of his family (which I barely know as I grew up in a different country to his), and getting to choose music/dancefloor and other things. We sort of lost sight of what we originally wanted, which was a small and intimate wedding, but acknowledged that the financial contribution was very significant.

Now, he’s turned around and refuses to help with his contribution upfront, saying he prefers to provide it after the wedding because he has “no guarantee that we will actually get married”.

We have been together for several years and both are very responsible, hard working and honest people. We of course assured him that if we cancelled the wedding in our own accord, we would return the money, but that we are more in love than ever and have already booked everything. It hurts that me that he is playing games with us, instead of supporting us on the most important day of our lives, like my partner’s family have done – they have been so thoughtful, normal and generous.

He already threatened not to come over something insignificant, and we think his erratic behaviour means that if he doesn’t contribute upfront, we don’t trust that he will actually go through with it, and then we would be left with the bill and he would get away with it. It’s also the principle of him treating us like a business negotiation/contract, and manipulating us, instead of being caring and supportive like my partner’s family have been.

Recently, I have gathered up the courage to confront him about the abuse and request an apology. Both my father and mother are completely in denial, and although they said they were “tough parents”, they don’t see their behaviour as abuse. I disagree, and give them a ton of factual examples, and mention that it was the 90’s and it was widely known this was unacceptable behaviour then. They both say they were also hit and that’s just how it was and to suck it up, basically.

I’m at the point where I know that I need to reduce or perhaps eliminate contact with them, as they don’t really have anything positive to contribute in my life, but I struggle to get past the point where they can both look me in the eye and be in denial. It hurts so deeply that they disregard all the pain they caused me – especially my mum, who states that she wants to have a good relationship with me nowadays.

My mum ended up leaving him around 10 years ago, as an affair he had for many years came out and she finally decided it was enough, but they still see each other occasionally, and she still always find a way to make excuses for him.

I feel like I have to defend the little girl that no one else could defend and protect myself. Thankfully I have a very incredible partner who listens and supports me, but I still feel hurt that they are unable to recognise what they did and give me a proper apology – instead they hide behind excuses. Especially my mother, as she has made excuses all my life for his awful behaviour. I don’t know if it’s harsh, but I think going very limited contact with them is the best way forward, but I also feel guilty and I think I desperately long for them to change their ways and finally be the parents I had always longed for.

I also feel deep shame about going no contact and having to explain to those around me why this is the case, as most people around me have healthy and loving family relationships and wouldn’t understand at a surface level.

We met in university, when both of us were students. We started seeing eachother almost every day. She has told me since day 1 that her goal in life was to have children and a family. I remember telling her that I too want kids some day. Over the years things changed, she started exposing a childish side (can't cope with her own emotions, sense of entitlement). 

It sort of feels like I'm the responsible adult in the relationship all the time. I also feel like I'm always the bad cop in the relationship (we have a dog). On top of that, after finishing her degree she went to work a minimum wage job,  which she constantly complained about and she never agreed to leave. Recently she left the job and wants to pursue a career in a different field which requires studying twice a week for 2 years. We talked about her getting a job during that time. its been 3 months and she's not taking any jobs because she ""wants a job in her field, that pays well and has no prerequisites"" since she's new to the field.

She comes from a wealthy family, but does not talk to her parents because she has been angry at her father since childhood and feels like her mom picked his side.

I work in tech, and we live in a pretty expensive city (1800$ rent for 1 bedroom) and she's not taking any of the burden.

Recently we went on vacation to Thailand for 3.5 weeks (I paid), I told her we should sublet our apartment and asked if she had any friends who may be interested, she ended up telling them they can stay for free if they watch our dog... I didn't confront her about this, because at this point I'm just tired. In routine I feel like she's taking it for granted. She keeps saying she'll pay me back, and she sort of keeps a tab, inaccurately, and even in that tab she owes me about 10k usd. I told her I don't want the money, I'm OK with have an arrangement where each one contributes what he can, but it seems like I might have made her feel too comfortable... am I too supportive? I feel like I lose patience with her sometimes, and when I confront her about things she keeps talking about ""her truth"" and ""how can you invalidate my feelings"".

Sometimes however, I see how hard she tries to do things for me (like being a bridesmaid at my sisters wedding, even when she didn't want to, or come to family dinners, birthday surprises, puts small notes in my bad when I leave for mandatory military duty, etc) 

2 weeks ago, she brought up the fact she wants to go to the gyno to check her fertility in order to start trying in about a year. I told her that I wasn't sure if I was ready to have kids yet because we are not there in the relationship and we should *both* improve parts of ourselves before planning. She got very upset and hurt because she thought I was at the same phase with her, and to her it seems like she is more sure of me than I am of her, which may be true.
She gave me an ultimatum to decide if this is it because she's not wasting any more time, and packed a bag and left the house, only to return the next day. There was a bitter feeling in the air, and we barely spoke.  I told her we should take a break, for a couple of weeks and it'll help me think clearer if this was it or not. So we booked a place somewhere far, for a week, and we talked about me leaving for a week as well when she comes back. But she ended up coming back after a day because it was too scary, and was mad at me for not being there for her when she was scared.

We have built something really good over the years, and it's hard to give that up, for both of us, but I don't want it to be the reason I'm staying. I don't know if she'll ever change though. She's seeing a therapist, but she's currently mostly dealing with her baggage with her family..

Not sure whether to take the leap of faith and stay, knowing that even if she works on everything, it may not be fixed, and I will be wasting more of her time. Considering her dream is to have kiss, and her biological clock is ticking, it feels easier to just leave and not potentially hurt her even more..

Out of frustration, I deleted my story and account. However new stuff has come up. My therapist thinks its a good idea to share my story since it's cathartic and it feels secure for me.  My parents came out to me as polyamorous and as swingers when I was 16. They told me they started swinging when I was little, which doesn't surprise me given how frequently gone they were as I was growing up. I used to think they used to prefer doing other stuff aside from spending time as a family or with just me. They didn't outright neglect me as we did have dinner, family vacations and I could come from them for advice. However it was painfully obvious majority of their happiness came from their marriage and adult lifestyle.  When they came out to me. They started bringing the couple they had a relationship with more frequently. It's like they dropped all pretenses of being a normal family. The couple was every 3-4 days or my parents were gone there every other week. It felt like I was pushed aside for this couple.  I unfortunately had to go to community college to save up money so I could transfer for my engineering degree. My parents were nice enough to let me stay while I went to community. In hindsight it was a bad idea. I remember when I was 19, my mom had my my former classmate over and I found out the worst way possible. I started avoiding my parents and spent more time in the library. My grades were good enough for me to transfer out of state. My parents visited multiple times but I kept my distance,  Two year now, and I get a call from my mother begging me to visit her on her birthday. I gave her the usual bs that I was too busy. My dad then revealed everybody left them and it hurts that I'm pushing them away. I went to the nonmonogamous forums. They said I was too harsh. My girlfriend's parents who I value alot said I was being too harsh also. So I decided to go.  My parents tried to be physically affectionate with me but I initially pushed them till my mom started crying about it. My mom suggested I spend time with just her by going to the mall together. This was the first time in a while she has ever done that. She told me she was sorry about Josh. I told her how I felt throughout these years. She started bursting in tears and apologized profusely. People were looking at us so I calmed her down by saying it was okay. My father got defensive when I went fishing with him. So I left the next morning and told them to not call me until I was ready to talk to them.  My mom said okay. Then my dad called me drunk at night saying I was the best thing that ever happened to him besides meeting my mom. I cried after that call.

I miss my ex. We broke up 3 months ago and all I do is cry. We broke up due to life circumstances and changes and it got too hard but we agreed that it might be temporary. I broke up with him, despite it killing me. But I only did it because our relationship was starting to affect his mental health (along with other things) and he couldn’t balance it. Keep in mind, I am 17 and he is 26… so that should explain things.

This is his response to me saying I wanted to break up. (Copied and Pasted.)

*The last thing I ever want to do is fuck with your headspace or your life. I think you’re amazing and I’m still really glad we met and I don’t regret anything.*

But if we’re both in tricky spots( me probably more so than you right now considering I’m trying to cram years into months to some degree) maybe it’s best we take a break and let this breath so we can focus on what’s ahead of us?

It’s going to take me some time to get over this mountain I’ve started climbing but once I’ve gotten on top of it things will loosen up and I might actually start to be less of a nightmare to try to talk to? 

Although I’m not sure that I have many certainties to give you, I thought we were both aware that certainties were in very short supply in our situation. 

It depends what you mean by ‘wait,’ I certainly don’t want you to shut yourself off to possibilities or experiences but I can’t help but feel that giving things some breathing room would improve the situation. 

My first thought was to reconnect in 6 months or so. That gives us both time to focus on all that stuff we’ve got going on for the rest of the year and see how things are early in the new year. 

Maybe you’ll feel completely differently about me and not want to catch up, and if that’s the case then hopefully that’s for the best. Maybe we’ll still get on like a house on fire and we can figure something out that works for both of us. Who’s to say? But I feel like it’s the smart move.

 L is mixed she can be nice but can be 90% or the time really moody and snobby and ignores me which confused me about her noticing this

Anyways this appointment L  was using the mouse of her computer looking at the screen checking something and I was to her left facing her.

 Then out of nothing L giggled under her breath and said smiling quietly  ‘you looking at her there?’ Quietly  In a smiley/giggly way Whilst looking at her computer screen the whole time not turning her head towards me at all still Quietly but I juts heard her enough to made out what she said. I didn’t say anything and kept my head down

💡I’m always very quiet anyway with her. And she seems to hate me/short with me and It makes me nervous.

She said she wanted to give me an opportunity to have a relationship again since I was her first healthy relationship, but she needed me to get my shit together.

She told me she didn't want to say no to possibly of relationship in  future but she didn't want to say maybe either because she didnt want me to fixate on that. She elaborated couple days later saying she doesn't know the future holds for us and she's going to let time do its thing.
