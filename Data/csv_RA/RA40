&amp;#x200B;

So there is this girl I've been friends with for close to two years now, we met on facebook and have always remained strictly friends, until recently. She started to be flirty towards me more progressively over the last few weeks and I also flirted back a little bit. Then one day she hit me with a question on the phone asking ""Can you see us working towards dating eachother"" and sorta confessed her feelings for me that she had for a while which honestly blindsided me a little bit and I had a few drinks that night so I didn't really have a clear answer for her. I did say something like that could be something we can work towards, but I don't know if a serious relationship is what I want at the moment, that's something I'll need to consider. And she seemed to understand completely and everything was fine, she just asked that I don't lead her on for months and to let her know if I'm not feeling it, and that if that ends up being the case she will respect it completely, so I agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week after that after some thought, I decided it was best to address that, and let her know that I don't want a relationship with anyone right now, I'm just not ready for it and honestly don't have the time to devote to a partner, and that I would rather continue to be her friend because it's something I genuinely value with her and would prefer not to complicate that. So I did that, and she basically had a complete meltdown and started saying things like ""I'm always going to be alone"" and started saying a bunch of stuff about how she's going to have nobody now to vent to about the negative things she's dealing with in her life, and how ""I've never had an attachment to someone like you"" and then proceeded to post a million things on SM about the whole thing, saying things like ""the only reason he's not interested in me is because I'm too clingy and he can't handle it"" etc. Which is NOT the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to reassure her that look nothing has changed other than we are not going to be romantic with eachother, I'm still just as much here for you as I always have been as your friend. I didn't mean this to be a negative thing, I only addressed it out of respect for her feelings, I didn't want to drag things on to a point where I would be leading her on.



I'd also like to mention we have only hung out in person once, never had sex, kissed, or anything like that. Everything was platonic until very recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question with all of this is, did I do something wrong here? Or is this a case of a girl that isn't used to being rejected like that? She's a very attractive girl so  I doubt it's something that happens often to her. I feel sad about the whole thing because like I said I genuinely care for this person as a friend. And don't get me wrong she has every right to be upset, I get that it hurts being told by the person you like that they don't like you in that way back, but I also feel it's a little unfair to me that she didn't address those feelings earlier on and now I'm potentially losing a close friend just because I don't share her same level of feelings.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7582942,public,self,"My [26F] friend wanted to date, I [28M] wanted to stay friends, need advice.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yysohh/my_26f_friend_wanted_to_date_i_28m_wanted_to_stay/,all_ads,6,,

I’m the bad guy. I’m the problem. It feels so ugly to say that, but it is a fact.

My girlfriend Anna has a friend named Jay, Jay used to have feelings for my girlfriend. Jay and Anna are very close friends. I’ve noticed that Jay is always very touchy with Anna in pictures and it’s made me uncomfortable, I have mentioned it to her, but she just said that he’s affectionate to his friends. Well three weeks ago we were both at separate parties. Anna got black out drunk, and apparently Jay was taking care of Anna. Anna was losing consciousness so he picked up Anna on his shoulder and carried her inside so she can sleep it off. Well 2 am comes and I notice that she had posted on social media and it was a video of him holding her close asking how she was feeling, and if she wants to tell the camera anything. I was upset. I personally would never hold a drunk girl close. I especially would not hold a girl close if I wasn’t interested in her.

So I had got it in my head that Jay and Anna were hooking up while I was intoxicated. So I messaged another girl who she works with Jade in my drunken anger inviting her to coffee, I lied and said Anna and I were on a break. Jade declined.

When I woke up I apologized to Jade and told her I was out of line inviting her out, and that Anna and I were giving it another try, I also asked if we could keep it to ourselves, which she responded of course.

The restaurant Anna and Jade work together at has reopened after being closed for three months. Yesterday I reached out to Jade asking if we were still able to keep it between ourselves, which she agreed stating she would never want Anna to feel embarrassed or hurt at work, also stating that she wouldn’t feel weird being around Anna or myself. Well today is Anna’s first day back since the reopening of the restaurant. I’m hoping me inviting Jade to coffee and lying that we were on a break stays between us. This has all become a very convoluted mess. Jade and I never met up for coffee, never did anything, but I do feel horrible about the situation.

We’ll be finishing Uni soon. I have a job lined up where I’ll be earning 2.600 € net /mo. He needs an additional qualification for his dream job, a one-year-traineeship that only starts in October. Until then, he’ll probably “only” receive 750 € /mo from his parents, and even then, the traineeship won’t pay much either. Long story short, we’re nearing a time span of at least 1 1/2 years where I’ll be earning considerably more than him. 

What’s the healthiest way to share our finances? 

Equality: We both transfer an equal amount from our own accounts to our shared account. This is how we’ve handled it so far, but in this new situation it would cause obvious problems (depending on the amount, either I could be disappointed from not being able to afford expensive shared things like nice dinners, big vacations; or he could be bummed about not being able to afford nice things for himself)

Equity: We both contribute an equal percentage of our incomes to the shared account. This seems much more fair to me and I wouldn’t mind putting more money in, but we’ve also realized that it’s not just more money I’d be contributing but more work as well.

He definitely deserves and needs this time off. He has a ton of hobbies and I’m hoping that a few stress free months will help him recover mentally from the shit he’s been through the last couple of years. Still, I have a history of comparing “effort” in our and really all my relationships. I know this is something I need to work on but that change won’t happen over night and I do see resentment waiting to build in the “equity” approach. “Μy 1.040 € input cost me 72 hours of work, your 300 € came for free.” 

We agree that the origin of the money does determine its value within the relationship. 

But I realize this argument could apply even if we ended up earning the same, “My input cost me 72 hours of work that I hate, yours cost 72 hours of work that you love.”, at wich point the equality-approach is starting to sound good again.

We are clearly overthinking this and hoping for some outside opinions to make this make sense again.

Background: I lived with a P (F21) until a few weeks ago. I met her through friends and I was looking for another roommate in my apartment. When we interviewed her for the apartment, she brought her boyfriend (J, M22) along and we asked him to not be around for part of the conversation as we tried to work out if she was a suitable roommate and we had a few questions about how often he would be around. J seemed ok with it at the time and P was happy to answer some questions and move on. 

Through her and J, I met my boyfriend L. After our third roommate moved out, J and L essentially moved into our apartment and we all got really close. 


When the lease was up, I was moving to the next town over and P, J, and L we’re going to move in together. I put in a lot of work to help set up their apartment. I was there for furniture delivery, I helped find the apartment, etc. I did this because J and P said “you should help because you will basically be part of the apartment”

Things started to get weird with P. She was being mean, asking me for a ton of favors and then being unkind about it, avoiding me. I did not know what was going on. 

Now time for the story- 

I was hanging around their apartment one day in the living room and P and J kept saying to L “Let’s do the apartment meeting soon” or to me “we are going to be having the apartment meeting soon”. I figured that since they had asked for all of the favors in exchange for me ‘basically being part of the apartment’ that I should be ‘part of the apartment meeting’. I could tell though that they were trying to push me out so I pulled L aside and I said “they are going to try to push me out of this meeting and I would just like you to stand up for me”. He totally agreed. 

Come time for the meeting and J tells me to leave because it’s only for members of the apartment. In that moment I looked over to L and he just shrugged. I gathered my things and left the whole apartment. L has been texting me and apologizing for not sticking up for me even though he promised to less than an hour before.

I (19f) have been with my now ex bf(20m) for 2 year.  In the first year of the relationship he did some hurtful things to me, for example:2 years ago I almost died in the hospital and while I was in there he asked my mom how I was, once I got out the followers week he looked at another’s girl’s ass and thought that it looked good. He told me out of guilt but it affected me deeply as I already had problems with how I see my body. The last mistake was that he pushed me out of anger in a fight. 
Fast forward to the present, we were in a long distance relationship and we both started uni, I for a while felt trapped in the relationship, like I couldn’t leave him because that would hurt him and he’d be alone in a new country. Sometimes I did feel love for him too, but I felt like I needed to explore more even if he wanted me to be the one he married in the future, mind you, both of us are at the second relationship, too soon imo. I went to a party recently with a group of colleagues and I got along with a guy from the group, we ended up going outside, he asked me if I had a bf, I said yes and we ended up talking about relationships how he got cheated and my problems with my bf. When we went inside he invited me to dance, we did, maybe a little too close.
The next day we hung around again, the same group, late at night, I did joke a lot with the guy and probably flirted with him accidentally, he said I was cute or something, mind you I’m not used to guys complimenting me, and generally was sweet to me. He later went with my to my dorm as he was staying in one across the street, we talked some more and we almost kissed, then I told him how I can’t cheat on my bf, he said he respected me for that. Next day I decided to tell my boyfriend that I need a break because I had the feeling that I needed to be free, maybe it also because I wanted to see how this new guy was. That same day we hung around as a group again, watched a movie at the guy’s dorm, the other people saw how great we got along and wanted to help him meet someone so they later went and I was the last one to stay with him. We talked, told him that I was on a break with my bf, talked some more and then he asked me if he can kiss me, we did, a lot, I also let him touch me. Next day I broke up with my bf because I didn’t see us continuing to be together. Hung out with the group again, kissed the guy again, mind you these days he was sweet, held my hands to warm them up, texted me first, called me beautiful etc. Told him I don’t want anything serious, he agreed. A few days later he responds rly slow at messages, and only visits me a few minutes to talk a bit and kiss, probably lost interest. Yesterday we hanged out as a group again at the gym, he seemed cold, later asked him if he was fine, he said he is like that sometimes, left me on seen after I told him that I just want someone to have fun with and that he can talk to me. I felt again lonely and like I needed to tell my ex what I did, he wasn’t angry, and said we could get back together when he come for holiday break but I have to not get involved with anyone again, I don’t think we should get back together because what I did and I can’t see myself staying with him forever, maybe I miss the stability. I also ended up texting the other dude that despite only wanting to hang out and have fun I don’t want to be the only one that shows interest and that it’s clear that he isn’t interested anymore, he simply said, after hours “ok”

I will refer to the girl as Red.

So basically not too long ago my bf moved to a new city to start uni, this was really exciting for the both of us since he got to start a major he really liked.
Everything was great and he was making loads of cool friends, one of these was Red.
He told me I would like her since in his opinion we “have a similar vibe”, so I was excited to meet her.
Flash forward to when I first visit him we go to a party, I meet Red and the rest of his friends. I also met Red’s long term bf who was also really chill.
When we get home and we ar kind of drunk he tells me about how he wants to get close to her ‘not in a weird way’ and how shes super nice and stuff. I thought nothing of it and we went to sleep.
After that night I feel like I just kept hearing about her: “oh I used to listen to this song and when Red played it it reminded me of how much I like it” or “ oh she has these sweaters that I want”.
I was honestly not bothered at this point, and kinda like yeah cool.
A week or 2 after the party I mentioned she breaks up with her bf for whatever reason.

One day him and his friends go watch her favorite movie at hers. The movie was from my favorite movie genre, I previously watched that movie and didnt really like it because it was too much of a shock value movie. It can be very odd for people who are not deeply interested in that movie genre. Him and I never watch this genre of movies because when I recommend something, he was not keen on watching it so we stuck to other movie genres and I was okay with that. Back to the story, I ask him how the movie was and he said it was actually okay, we talked about it a little bit and he told me we should watch more movies of that genre because he likes the genre. He continues by saying we should watch a movie (another of her favorites) which she recommended. See the thing is, I am very passionate of movies, specifically this genre and the fact that he turned my recommendations down and was not into, and suddenly its a genre hes very into kinda hurt.
He doesn’t take my music recs seriously, or my movie ones.

After that its just things like seeing her react to his bereals in a quirky way, mimicking his bereal. Or him asking her to come with him when he was gonna visit me so they could both see me (and stay at my house). Also felt like he wanted  me to get along with her so bad. Overall just hearing about her a whole lot, while he talked nothing about his other female friend.

See I am here because we talked about it and he said hell take some distance from her. But the thing is, they are in the same friends group and tbh idk what his interpretation of distance was but they talk the same amount. Seeing her face makes my stomach turn every time.

He told me him, Red and a couple who they are friends with are going to a party. For some reason just her presence really triggers my gut and makes me feel like sh!t. Idk what to do because technically nothing is happening but my gut feeling tells me her intentions are different or that theres weird vibes between them.

I get supper bothered by her existence and idk how to make myself feel better.

A few fights here and there but nothing that we haven't talked about and overcame. 

When we first became sexually active, we had the talk. I'm on a very effective form of birth control and had recently been tested as I was having issues with said birth control and they wanted to rule out all possiblities. My tests came back negative for everything. I have not had any sexual partners other than my current boyfriend. He said he appreciated how forthcoming I was, and said that he was clean as well. 

I had an annual gyno appointment and mammogram last week (I'm high risk for breast cancer). I received a call today stating that they found some tissue they want to take a closer look at, and that my std swab came back positive for Chlamydia. So he either fabricated his confidence in being clean, or has contracted it from someone else since we've been together.

I'm absolutely distraught. I know it's super common and easily treated. But I can't help but be a little upset with my partner. He put both my reproductive and overall physical health in jeopardy. What if it had been something worse? Life altering? I just feel disrespected by him. At the same time, I should've suggested he be tested, and I should've pushed for  practicing safe sex. 

I'm absolutely crazy about my partner, and I know he loves me too. I have no idea how I'm going to tell him tonight. I have no idea how to even feel about the situation. Any advice on how to approach this conversation, Ill be off work in two hours. It's our 4 month anniversary and I don't want the day to end up a shit show.

We are high school sweethearts. We started dating our junior year of high school and have been together ever since (about 5 1/2 years) Recently there's been a decline in our relationship. I've been dealing with my own personal traumas for years, many of which my bf was involved in so he knows me inside and out. Clinical depression has been following me for most of my life.

I'll try to make this as short as possible, but I've been more distant. We haven't been as intimate as we used to be. I've noticed sometimes now when he touches me (sexually and non-sexually) that it's kind of annoying? Like I don't want to be touched anymore. I traveled to see my best friend who lives in a different state that I've only ever known online. It was a good trip and I was very happy to finally meet him in person (and before anyone starts, no I'm not interested in cheating on my bf,, he's done so much for me and I love him with all my heart. I just don't have friends who are girls,) My bf expressed to me that it made him feel insecure. Granted, we originally planned the trip to go see a concert, and my friend lives about 40min from the venue. I ended up spending the majority of my time with my friend and didn't attend the concert. My bf said it felt like I stood him up (he didn't go alone,, his group of friends were there with him) which I understand. I just wanted to spend as much in-person time with my best friend as I possibly could, knowing I don't normally have that when I'm home, and he and I live together so we see each other on a daily basis. Although I also understand the idea of attending an exciting event with your loved ones. But it makes me feel bad because after showing me some videos of the concert, I concluded I probably wouldn't have had that good of a time there than with my best friend. It just wasn't a scene for me. 

But then I feel better when I'm on my own. His libido is high, much higher than mine, and it makes me feel like I have to partake in sex to satisfy him. I realized my mistake when I consented to sex I didn't want. But I did it so he wouldn't feel hurt by another rejection from me, which has been expressed time and time again. My bf doesn't see sex as just something to pleasure himself,, he feels like it's symbolic of our love for each other, and that it helps to feel close to your partner. But recently I've been kind of,, out of it? I could go without sex for weeks and be alright. I don't even remember the last time I masturbated. But I want to be able to make him feel like he's wanted,, he deserves that at the very least from me.

Part of me feels like I was only interested in this relationship because it helped me escape from my trauma in my high school years, and that the idea of someone actually wanting me was so intoxicating that I mistook it for genuine love. I feel absolutely horrible writing all of this out, but I need straight answers from people outside of this situation. Granted, this isn't all the context, but I'd have to write an entire book for that. I hear and understand his wants, concerns and feelings, but I have no idea how to rectify it without sacrificing my own comfort. I don't want to think I'm falling out of love, because I do still love him and I want to try and work it out. I don't see this relationship ending but I'm losing hope.

I went over and she said she was sorry for being weird she was just overwhelmed and I spent the weekend with her and it was so nice like really good. The only thing is I feel like she only invited me over coz we talked about not being able to see each other.

She’s busy again this weekend, I haven’t asked to see her yet but I get the feeling she might be to busy for it and part of my me is like yeh she is busy but also part of mes like she could make the time

We met off of tinder and immediately clicked on our first date. We didn't hu or even kiss or anything, we just hung out and it was great. We spent a LOT of time together, like the entire day every day minus work and classes, and after 3 weeks of dating we decided to make it official.

In the beginning of us getting to know each other, he prefaced that he had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship around 2 months ago. I was always a little weary of it but I wanted to trust him and told him to just communicate to me if he needs more time to process the breakup. I know we were going a little fast, but I myself had just gotten out of a 6 month relationship around the same time as him and had heard relationship success stories with people who had less time between relationships. We are also good communicators so I felt like I shouldn't be too concerned.

But then, around a week after we were official, we were in a situation where he bumped into her ex and spent like a day with her. I was also there, so I still wasn't worried-- I wasn't worried until he started acting off for the next couple days. That's when I asked him what was wrong and he told me something along the lines of: ""I really love you and I don't want this to change our relationship but ever since the day when I was with my ex I've been missing her.""

I immediately felt hurt, like I wasn't good enough etc, but I understood where he was coming from. I told him that I thought we should probably reconsider our relationship and give him time to actually process the breakup he had with his ex. So essentially, I broke up with him. And he didn't get mad at me or freak out or anything. We both cried a little and he told me he respected my decision.

Not only do I not know if I made the right decision, but now we still hang out almost like how we did when we were dating. It's a little different cuz it feels like I'm still putting space between us, but I'm extremely attached because we both get along so well and being with him gives my life a sense of stability (which I'm craving a little bit since it's my first semester as a freshman in college.) It's also hard to let go because he looks at me with ""that"" look in his eye. I want to get back together but not if he isn't over his ex-- but is it worth it?

I assured her I no longer planned on doing it, but just needed a shoulder to cry on and someone to talk to.

She reacted by staying quiet, I apologised and she told me I was being like her abusive ex. (He would suicidebait a lot)

I graduated this summer and have started a full time job whilst he still has two years of college and only works occasionally. I want to start this post off by saying I feel I am mentally checking out of my relationship. The first 9 months of our relationship were amazing. We were both free all day most days due to university and similar schedules and could call and text for hours. We briefly spoke about how things will be different once I start a full time job and we both knew I am very busy generally as I also teach swimming classes. 

Two weeks ago I started my full time job and we have been arguing almost every single day and were on the verge of a breakup many times. I wish we had broken up instead of convincing ourselves we can fix this. My boyfriend is the most needy person ever. He does nothing to keep himself occupied besides waiting for me to finish work so we can call/text. He tells me how difficult the day is and he feels like shit because he thinks work has ""stolen"" me from him. I understand it is a huge adjustment and maybe I don't get it because I'm occupied with work rather than having too much time to overthink like him. Right now it feels like a chore to be with him. After 5pm when we message, all I want to hear is something like ""how was your day"" but we either go straight into a sad talk about how hard it is for him or an argument of some sort.

After our worst argument we came to a ""solution"" which involved me telling him in advance when he should expect a message from me rather than random messages when I take a break. The next day everything seemed like it was actually going to be okay. He wasn't being clingy whilst I worked and we had some nice conversations during my breaks. As soon as 5pm hit I got the long barrage of emotional texts saying how hard it was and how I could have done this better or told him I miss him as soon as I finish work. Then he told me how he wanted me to give him my entire lunch break rather than 50 mins ( I need time to go to the bathroom and generally for myself).

Never really post on here but I need some advice because sometimes my relationship makes me feel crazy and just confused. Would like some opinions on one of the topics making me feel crazy lol

So in august this year me (23f) and my boyfriend (23m) (let’s call him h) had a talk ending with the rules of I wouldn’t reply to dms I get from guys and I would simply delete the message. The only response they get from me is when I double tap their quick reactions they give on my Instagram story posts (I double tap everyone’s quick reactions both girls and guys)

So when I posted a pic of myself on my ig story this week, a mutual (let’s call him T) we both know, gave a quick “😍” reaction I double tapped and that was all I did. 2-3 hours later T hits me again “how you been?” and I deleted it. The next day when me and H hung out, I told H how T slid in my dms, how I double tapped T’s quick reaction, and deleted his dm when he asked me how I was doing. H got mad and said I should’ve told T I was dating him since we both know T. We haven’t seen or talked to T in years and don’t hang or talk with any mutuals on either side. I’ve had probably 3 short convos with T since middle school (he was a grade lower). H has personally hung with T couple times before in high school (T did not go to our high school, but him and H had mutual friends since some of T’s friends went to our HS) so I would say they’re closer.

I told H I’m following our talk back in august of just deleting the dms I get and now H said it’s different because it’s a guy we both know. 

[This next event I’m about to explain down below happened right before our August talk] 

Last time I answered a dm of a guy (let’s call him P) I went to elementary and middle school with, me and P were close for a few months in 8th grade (we both were kind of hated on and didn’t have anyone at one point so we understood why we were hanging out more often, our middle school was filled with unnecessary drama lol) we were STRICTLY FRIENDS! If this matters, me and H met in high school and he’s the only boyfriend I’ve ever had. He’s had more experience than me with relationships and body counts.

Anyways, H got mad that I replied to him even though after P asked me if he could be my plus one to the next wedding I attend, I told him “my plus one is my boyfriend 😂.” H told me I should’ve never responded to P even though we were cool before. I even showed him the whole dms total of 4 exchanges combined!! 

P: “what’s the occasion?”
Me: “a wedding lmao i said it in my story”
P: “lmao i ain’t peep. next time lemme be your plus one”
Me: “my plus one my boyfriend 😂”

Before this dm he has sent me 2 quick “😍” reactions that I double tapped in the past which I showed H too as well. There was never any conversations with P until the one I just mentioned. Was I really in the wrong here? 

Back to T. T has tried to get at me before, I responded to it, and told H. It happened back in 2019 the month me and H started talking again (broke up in 2017, another long story)

T: “I know this is really weird especially since it’s on Fb messenger, but ever since middle school I’ve always thought you were really cute”
Me: “you know we both follow each other on ig right? 😂😂 but thank you!”
T: “oh we do? I didn’t notice, but can I get your number tho?”

Then I left him on read! and told H. He got mad and asked me why I replied and my response was giving the indication to T that I want him to hit me up on ig. I told him I said that because I thought it was funny and dumb that he would hit me up on Facebook messenger and that he didn’t even realize we already follow each other on ig

A few weeks ago, my ex (48M) broke up with me. He had stated multiple times he didn’t want to marry me or have kids with me (and thus we didn’t move in together, I didn’t meet his mom abroad, etc.). He brought CONDOMS and CIALIS on his family vacation (and said he brought them just in case), said I’m acting single because I’m going on a work trip in Spain this January, and held a messenger conversation I had with a guy over my head for a year, etc. We had good moments and he was a GOOD partner (very caring, loving, and willing to do anything to make me feel good) but gosh was he insecure and had commitment issues…...

Well - since he broke up with me  he has been BEGGING ME for a second chance. He explained he lost himself, that he didn’t believe he deserved to be loved by someone so good as me, and that he was afraid of getting hurt again (past relationship trauma), so he pushed me away and was subconsciously trying to sabotage the relationship. He said he WILL marry and have kids with me and offered for me to move in with him FULL TIME before I leave for my work trip. He stated he didn’t want those things  (marriage and kids) before because he was afraid of going through another divorce again and being left a single dad again, and that he had also lost trust in me after that messenger conversation with that guy. However when he begged for a 2nd chance, he said “what’s more beautiful than having a woman who loves me at home and a kid, and that putting restrictions on our relationship was the biggest mistake he ever made.

He even booked a therapist for himself !!

However for some reason I kept saying no, even though he was truly remorseful and offering me EVERYTHING I ever wanted during the relationship. And it was JUST a week after the breakup. The other day I told him I didn’t have the strength to go back to him and we ended things for good. However, I’ve been having doubts. What if I’m losing a chance to truly be happy here? With someone who is truly sorry and willing to learn? I already started talking to someone a few days after the breakup who is in my social circle and even though I told that guy I’m not going to be in a relationship right now I felt weird to go “back to my ex”. 

Do you think I made the right decision by saying no? Should I give my ex a second chance just to see? I’m so afraid I messed up, but in the beginning when he first begged I felt sad at the idea of going back with him, I remembered the emotional labour that I endured to be in a relationship with him.

Excuse any typos.

My ex broke up with me a year ago just after Thanksgiving. It wasn't good. I was hurting badly. At that time I was paired with a classmate R, on a project. I knew R was into me but he'd never done anything about it. He was not my type and I had no feelings for him. Then we were at best low key friends. After my breakup R helped me stay up on my assignments, covered my work load for the project, did little things here and there to cheer me up. We hung out outside of school work and I enjoyed spending time with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before winter break he asked me out, told me he liked me and did not want to be a friend if we couldn't be more. I told him I was not up for anything and just wanted to work on myself till I was ready. He said he understood that he'd keep his distance, not bother me and wished me luck.

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed back for winter break, I wasn't in the holiday mood. My friends were also not there. R was. He was a foreign student with nowhere to go. I asked him to hang out and he agreed. We went hiking, drinking and to the movies. It was all platonic. He made all our meet ups fun and interesting. Initially I was the one asking him to come hang, after a few times he started asking. He did try to flirt with me but I gently stopped it.

&amp;#x200B;

After winter break, with my friends back, I didn't spend as much time with R but we still met up 2-3 times a week, either of us initiating the meet ups. I shared friends with my ex so would avoid interactions where he'd be there, choosing to spend that time with R. Spring break was similar. Since my ex was part of the larger friend group I didn't join them. R was again there. R and I had become really good friends by summer break. I did go home this time but returned after two weeks. Spent summer hanging out with R, we even did a road trip and went to a concert. Still like friends, still platonic. 

&amp;#x200B;

After summer break my ex got together with another girl and moved away from our mutual friend group. My time with R went to 1-2 meetups a week with me pushing for it. I enjoyed my time with him and he was really helpful with my studies. Two months ago a new guy K joined our friend group along with a new boyfriend of one of my close friends. He was completely my type, tall, handsome, sharp looks, sharp wits. We hit it off at that party. In two weeks we were flirting. He wanted to take me out on a date but I was on the fence about it. In October our flirting became sexting. No nudes or topless but I did send sexy pics. My friends were pushing me to go scratch my itch. I finally gave in, cancelling my halloween plans with R to go with K to a party. In all this my hang outs with R had reduced to 1 in 1-2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

The halloween party date with K was great. I had a great time, got drunk and got closer with K. I kept my friends updated and they encouraged me on. K had been posting our time on socials and tagging me. I was aware and didn't mind it since it made him so happy. As the party was winding down K asked me to go to his room and I agreed. In between R had tried to call me a few times but I'd ignored his calls. As we got to K's room I got two messages from R. One was a screenshot of the discussions we had regarding him and me. The other was a pic of me and K kissing.  I froze right at the door to K's room. I excused myself and rushed out. I immediately tried to reach out to R but he let the call ring out. He didn't even read any messages I sent. I was getting frantic, as I realised I was blocked on all his socials. He had not blocked me on call or text. I returned to my room, trying to reach out to R asking him to just talk to me. All I got was silence. I couldn't sleep that night.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried talking to him after class. He refused. He only said that I should only call or text him regarding the project we were in. We were together in a larger group project, but in all those interactions he was all professional. I camped outside his dorm to make him speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the conversation we had, verbatim, -

R - ""Why are you here?""

Me - ""I can explain.""

R - ""What for? You don't owe me anything. What I feel is on me. I am sorry for going off on you yesterday.""

Me - ""I ...""

R - ""Stop. Just answer my questions. How long have we been hanging out?""

Me - ""11 months.""

R - ""When did I ask you out?""

Me - ""About 9 months ago.""

R - ""What did you say?""

Me - ""I wasn't ready and wanted to work on myself.""

Me - ""Had I made it clear I didn't want to be anything but romantic?""

Me - ""Yes.""

R - ""Who asked to hang out after that?""

Me - ""I did.""

R - ""Was I ever disrespectful? Did I ever push your boundaries?""

Me - ""Never, you were always...""

R - ""Let's keep it short to finish this quickly. Did you think I was doing anything wrong when I tried to feel you out, when I tried to flirt with you?""

Me - ""No.""

R - ""How many times did I try in the last 10 months and what did you do?""

Me - ""4 times. I shut you down.""

R - ""When did you meet K?""

Me - ""Two months ago.""

R - ""When did you start flirting with K?""

Me - ""He started it... six weeks ago.""

R - ""Did you sext?""

I kept silent, I couldn't answer.

R - ""When did that start?""

Me - ""Please...""

R - ""Just answer.""

Me - ""A little over 3 weeks ago. But there were no nudes...""

He waved his hand to cut me off.

R - ""When was the last time I tried to feel you out?""

This was difficult to answer, ""A little over 3 weeks ago and I shut you down.""

I could see him hold back tears, ""K didn't mean anything it was just a casual hook up...""

R - ""What are you saying? You were going to have casual hook ups and when you were done you would settle for me.""

Me - ""No that's not...""

R - ""I feel so worthless. I want to be desired. I want someone to want me. I don't want someone who wants a relationship but not me.""

Me - ""Please. Just give me a chance. Let me make it up to you.""

He gave me a disgusted look, ""I don't want a consolation prize. I didn't want to sit on the sidelines with hope. I had made this clear from the start. You don't find me attractive romantically. You definitely don't find me attractive sexually. You have made that clear. Actions over words. I was clear I didn't want to be a friend. You don't owe me a relationship and I don't owe you a friendship. So, what are you doing here?""

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't spoken since then. I did go on another date with K as an apology but I was not feeling it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been broken up since my talk with R, breaking out crying when I am by myself. My time with R was the best I have spent with anyone. He understood me completely and we connected well. I've never felt as comfortable with anyone as I did with him. I could just be myself. These days the best time I have is when working on the project with him, even if its as part of the group and even if he is business-like. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends keep take me out for drinks and partying to get me out of this funk. I am able to have a good time with them, for the most part. I no longer enjoy guys hitting on me or even feel like chatting any of them up. I wasn't like this even after my break up and that was a three year intense relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help figuring this out. I just don't understand it. R was right. I don't find R attractive. Even now I don't want him like I did K. But it hurts bad and I miss him so much. Why do I feel like this? What can I do to get him back? Can I get him back?

&amp;#x200B;

If I move on I will keep looking for someone like him, for a connection like I had with him. Then, why not him? Why don't I desire him?  Can I do to anything to make that happen?

I know how to navigate conflict with him and not anger him more or see his side of things when he’s upset and he has learned how to talk to me and not feel like everything I say isn’t an attack on him and me merely addressing the issues with him.

For a bit more context, we dated off and on since January of this year and we broke apart in early September. But after a few weeks of break, we both realized we fucked up and being self centered with our needs and stuff and ever since then have been doing great. I never in a million years thought that I’d experience such fluid communication and we just know how to push through, remembering that we both love each other so much and will do what we can to work with each other.

The only remaining issue that lingers with me and I think about constantly and out of nowhere (they haven’t hung out in a long while alone ever since we got back together) is something that happened in our first go around together.

I just notice that when he hangs with his best friend, they’re a bit too “affectionate with each other”. Like the best friend sometimes puts his hands on him from areas like his arms and even rubs his chest. He even sometimes grabs his hand. 

Then whenever they hang out and if they go drinking, he’ll crash at his place but that’s whatever honestly… I get it. But I’ve seen their house and there’s a huge ass couch to sleep on but for some reason they always sleep in the same bed. This bed isn’t even a king or anything it’s a full. I remember when I first addressed it with him, he blew up a good amount and had defended it stating that he’s just his really close and dear friend who has been through a lot with him. He fought me before stating that I shouldn’t have to call the shots on how he interacts with his best friend but I feel anxious towards it because I just don’t feel that level of interaction is appropriate under normal circumstances in a relationship. I have one or two best friends I would do that with but when I’m in a commitment I adhere automatically.

I’m not asking him to stop talking to him and hang out etc but I would like that type of intimacy to be something I hold with him only and no one else. The topic hasn’t come up yet but I dread if we’re at the point where I can talk to him about it and he’ll understand.

I always knew he was a bit unorganized and messy, and there would be communication that would need to take place, but I basically told him he needs to keep the common areas clean and we'll be fine.

He also asked to cover $600 of his portion of the security deposit, but ensured me he would have it to me soon, which I agreed to.

A couple months down the road, there's a miscommunication with our land lord and we apparently missed a payment, kind of setting us behind, but we made a deal with our land lord to delay payment so we could still live there.

Payment time comes, and my friend can only give me a portion of rent. Then the next payment comes and he only gives me another portion.

Up until a week ago, my friend owed me $1200.

THEN his brakes fail on him, and he just makes the assumption I'm going to give him rides from the bus station to home, because it's essentially.

During all of this, he leaves our apartment a mess and smokes weed and lays in his room, not helping with maintenance of our home at all.

During my last relationship, I stonewalled a bit, especially when I would ask things over and over and not feel heard and stepped over. (Such as asking him to clean and make payments on time.)

I finally decided I had enough and confronted him a few days ago. I told him I'm done repeating myself over and over about cleaning while he asks me for favors, and he proceeded to snap at me and yell at me saying I have savings and he doesn't, and that his car situation is essential while the apartment being clean isn't.

Mind you, he makes $4 more than me an hour and doesn't have a car payment, so he's essentially spending all his extra money on weed.

He apologized and said he would get his act together, and even cleaned the apartment last night while I was asleep, but the sheer sense of entitlement of yelling at me when he owed ME $1200 just around a week ago and asking ME for rides is laughable and insulting.

Although he said he'd get his act together, I've lost so much respect for him and resent him more and more.

I've been wanting a cat but taking on extra finances, while also cleaning up after someone else, leads me from deciding against it.

I (26, M) cut contact with an extremely close person a year ago. She (26) and me met at uni during corona and talked and chatted a lot. We got to know each other very well and did basically every project together, talked until 2 am in the night etc. When me met nearly a year after with other friends for dinner it was legit one of the best times of my life. We laughed she mimicked my gestures and it was just a blast. 

Last November however I just had to cut contact. The reason was that I had developed a huuuuge crush on her and while I enjoyed the time and interactions with her it was legitimately eating me alive. 

(just for clarification: we met September 2020 and she only told me that she had a BF half a year later. She categorically only Dates guys 5-7 years older than her.) 

As I didn’t want to ghost her (dick move imo) I called her and told her what I am doing and why I am doing that. She took that opportunity to… well be rather cruel and cold towards me. After that we had 0 contact. Half a year after that last call, she blocked me on instagram out of the blue. 

However, up until this day she takes a look at all my whatsappstories and she checks my LinkedIn literally every week. 

I am kinda confused why she still does that and maybe some of you guys have an objective opinion about this behaviour. I would be glad to hear from maybe other girls which did sth similar.

Thank you all in advance :)

i (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (20m) for almost a year. i have had relationships before him, even fallen in love before him, which is why i find myself to be extremely hypocritical in this situation. i was his first (almost) everything, kiss, sex, date, girlfriend. he was none of mine. however, i was not his first love.

i knew he was in love before me and it messed him up a lot. he is not one to talk about the past much and he is not one to want to hear much about my past either. he said that it messed him up to the point where he stopped talking to friends afterwards for awhile, he cried a lot (which is unlike him), he barely ate. i understood that it fucked him up. however, he never told me who she was, just that she was in high school. we met in college so i knew she would not be relevant but it still bothered me not knowing much, especially since i told him everything about my past. my roommate reached out half way through our relationship telling me that her friend knew this girl he had talked to before, where they went on a date or two. i told him and he told me he had mentioned her before, that she was not ready for a relationship so she stopped talking to him and he was like ""okay"". it seemed very minor. however, when he would talk about her, it seemed more intense than he was making it seem.

eventually, i wanted to know. i wanted to know who this past love was because i was extremely insecure and i didn't know how to handle my anxiety with not knowing. he kept saying he would not tell me, that it was the past and she meant nothing now. the lack of knowledge and explaining made me feel what if he still loved her. all i knew is she left suddenly and he didn't understand why.

long story short, he told me that it was the original girl last night. he said that nobody knew that he used to love her, not even her. he said he lied about when it happened because he didn't want me to find out because it was not important. he said it really messed him up afterwards. he said he doesn't love her, he only loves me. he says that the only feelings he has towards her are not positive. 

i feel like it's not fair to him, but this has messed me up a lot. i would compare myself to her before just knowing she was a crush, but now knowing her loved her? i don't know what to do anymore. i don't know how to get over this. i know she's not relevant, especially since we both graduated college. i just feel so sad, so sick, so anxious, so insecure. i feel like this is so hypocritical, especially given my past. but i don't know what to do or how to get over this.

i(20f) has been in a healthy relationship with my bf(21m) for almost a year now. To cut to the chase,
i’ll be graduating college next year. As soon as i graduate i’ll be moving abroad for work. i’ve made it clear since the beginning of the relationship and he has always been very supportive. He has reassured me that we’ll find a way to be together, but every-time when i try to talk him about how we’ll gonna move out soon or any other details he just shuts it down by saying “it’ll probably be fine”.
Recently anxiety got the better of me and i pressed onto him to talk about it further. 
He basically said he can’t give up his career, and i respect that.He has been always passionate about his career. After this conversation we both cried our eyes out.But after all the “ oh we’ll be just fine”s why just NOW is he saying it. It hurt to know that i was the only one who’s having hopes high to be together in the future. And he was very pessimistic about idea of having a long term relationship. 
i agree on that, given the circumstance that both of work will probably take most of our time of the day, also due to the time difference.
From here , for the sake of after math , it seems like it’s only right if we break up before we got even more attached. 
but i just can’t bring myself to do it even though i know it’s for the best.He doesn’t want to end the relationship either.I do love him so much, and he has never failed to make me feel loved. He’s my first on Everything. 
So i’m choosing to stay and keep on loving as if we’re not gonna be beaten bad after i go. 
i just can’t end this relationship. i don’t want to be away from him . i’m choosing to sink with the ship as long as i’m with him.

We got to talking and we instantly hit it off. From texting and snapping everyday, having 4 hour video calls and studying together, we grew very close. 

Just a week after talking I just knew she was the one I wanted. So I put together a gift box and sent it to her, something I was always afraid to do. She loved everything bit of it. From then on we were inseparable, we told each other everything and we were always open and honest with each other. 

However she has trust issues which didn’t let her give me her heart. I accidentally pushed too much and we had a fight (due to a misunderstanding, I thought she said she couldn’t trust me at all) we fixed the problem and we were good again. We always flirted and honestly it felt like we were a couple. Like when she got her job she called me to tell me first instead of her mother who was literally downstairs. How she felt safe with the stuffed animal I gave her. She still wears the necklace I got her ( it wasn’t expensive or worth anything). We found each other attractive, we were sexually compatible. We sent each other relationship posts. I’d even told her to take her time because I’d wait for her to be ready because I knew she was the one I wanted to be with. We even planned on meeting on December.

Then one day a friend of hers visited from Mexico for a week. During that she became more distant and less affectionate. Just 3 days after he left she friend-zoned me. She said that she felt stuck with me and she thought that I was doing/saying things just to get her to be with me. She said she appreciated that I cared for her but it was too much and it felt predictable and it means that it would be meaningless. I didn’t take it well, and I reluctantly agreed to be her friend. Yet we have only spoken 4 times after this and it’s all been cold and short or it felt fake. 

The truth is yes, I wanted her to be mine more than anything. However, I just wanted to be there for her when she needed me. To catch her before she fell. I wanted to connect with her in more ways so I thought of ideas that we would both enjoy, she loved that. I did things that I’ve always wanted to do and enjoy with her. She pushed me to be a better person and I’ve always tried to do the same. So my intentions weren’t to make her mine but just to grow with her. She said that she’d like that too.

This is not our hometown, and frankly, we've never even been to this city before. When my father retired, my parents followed their dreams of a small beach town and moved here. I was 18 at the time and went to college. After 4 years, I returned to my family's home. (This is very normal in the society we live in, children who leave their families before marriage is a no no.)

I met my husband after I got back from college. Dated for a while. When I first brought my husband to meet my family, my mother never wanted him. She kept talking about our differences and saying that this marriage would not work, but we didn't listen to her and got married. Yes, we have/we have had some differences of opinion, but we are solving them somehow. We have been married for 3 and a half years and we have a 1 and a half year old son. Our financial situation is troubled, but we are trying to get by somehow. During the summer I work seasonally, my husband has a regular job. I am not a person who avoids working, but it is very difficult to find a job in the conditions of the country we live in, so we have to make do with only summer months.

My mom took care of my son while I was working last summer and she has no complaints about it. She loves her grandson very much.

My grandfather had a serious surgery last week and he needs care. My uncle is with him, but he has to go back to work and he asks my mother for help to take care of my grandfather for 2 months. They live in our hometown and are 14 hours away. My mother wants to go and take care of her father, but at the same time she doesn't want to leave me and my son.

I told her many times that she could go, that there was nothing for her to worry about, but she still won't listen to me. They had a fight with my father last night and my father came to my house for coffee today.

Looks like my mom said in the first place it was a mistake for us to move here because now that I'm married, we have to stay here. My father had said that he did not want to go back to hometown anyway and they had an argument. So I said to my father, what I told my mother before. I said that if She wanted to go, she could go, and even my son and I could go with them if she wanted, but then I had to go back to my husband. What I was thinking was a vacation of 1 week or 2 weeks. When I said that, my father seemed a little uncomfortable. When I asked what had happened, he told me that my mother said ""I wish our daughter would divorce her husband and we could take our grandchild and go to hometown"". I was shocked. I said she wasn't serious, but my father said that my mother was very serious and was afraid she would do something about it.

I am 30 years old and my mother has been a manipulative person all my life. I have seen many times what she has done to me, my father and the people around us, but she is still not a bad person. (I know, cliché) I'm used to my mother's ways, I confronted her many times about it when she tried to manipulate me, but my husband doesn't know this side of my mother. I'm afraid that somehow my mother will get inside his head and try to separate us. How should I approach this issue?
