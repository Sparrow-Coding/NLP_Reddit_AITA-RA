I (early 20sF) and my boyfriend (mid 20sM) have been together over a year now. We had talked about engagement soon since we want to move out of state together and agreed we didn’t want to wait to get married after then. We were planning to get married around 2 years together. I thought I had found the person I was to spend the rest of my life with, especially after overcoming many issues together. I felt very confident in this life decision, but now I need advice on how to move past a couple issues holding me back. 
We had looked at rings together and picked out the kind that I wanted and agreed around Halloween for engagement. The ring didn’t come in time for then which is just as well because I found out he had told his ex of 5 years B that they could never talk again because he was going to propose to me, and they talked about their respective lives for a bit before he asked if she had any last words before they never talked again. I work 24 and 48 hour shifts so this happened during one of those, and the conversation went on via messenger for 2 days.
Him and I have had disagreements over his exes before including this one and he had promised he’d never talk to her again. (The last time was right as we were getting together in the first place and the conversation was something mundane- nothing crazy suspicious.) 
I felt shaken and considered calling things off altogether after this. He swore it was nothing suspicious. He did not mean to tell me about the conversation at all, I found out by accident. He did show me all the messages and I read through it all because I said I’d leave if I didn’t get to read them. It consisted of her wanting to continue talking although she is also in another relationship. Most of it was them talking about their lives and their past somewhat affectionately but nothing super overboard. He asked her a couple times for last words before they cut contact forever. He told me he thought it was the polite and right thing to do to get closure and say goodbye to someone you spent half a decade with. He said it was also to move forward with me because they ended up talking every once in a while and he didn’t want it to happen while we were married. He says he didn’t tell me because he knew it would upset me and he wanted to quietly take care of it. I don’t know if I believe his reasoning. 
He has a ring. I accidentally saw it in his camera roll. It’s perfect for us. Exactly what we both wanted. It suddenly feels real. And I want to feel excited but I can’t help but feel this pending engagement was tarnished by him telling his ex and talking to her. 
So I had decided I was going to abandon my fears and move forward. I love this man. I care about him more than anything else in the world. I want to move forward with my life. We both went out with our respective friends last Saturday night and I went back to his apartment early because I wanted to tell him I was ready to move forward and was going to get over my worries. He was out drinking with his friend still. (A friend I do not particularly like or trust.) His (gay) male friend brought a single female friend who my boyfriend did not know and it was the three of them for the second half of the night because the rest of their group went home around midnight. I decided I didn’t want to stay up all night waiting since I had stuff the next day, so went to sleep. Around 2am I hear a loud crashing sound in the room. I ran out of bed to investigate (he has a big guard dog so I was worried he got into something maybe) and tripped over something on the floor. Turned on the lights and it’s my boyfriends unconscious body. I started shaking him awake and yelling at him and even started crying because I had no idea what happened. I considered calling an ambulance but I work in an ambulance myself so I decided to hold off for the time being to see how things went. It was really startling and freaked me out. I investigated the outside and the kitchen to find clues of what happened and found vomit everywhere. I went back to where he was in the room and he started vomiting and choking on it because he was unconscious. I flipped him over so he’d stop choking. I dragged him into the bed and placed his head hanging off slightly with a trash under it. I spent the next hour or so cleaning up vomit. I did not sleep at all until mid afternoon the next morning when he finally woke up. I monitored him all night because I was very concerned he had alcohol poisoning and I didn’t want him to aspirate or anything. I’ll admit I looked through his phone while he was passed out because I was highly suspicious of the whole night and I also used it to message the friend he was with because I needed to know what in the holy hell happened. Anyway, he didn’t remember a single thing about this whole ordeal. He knows I looked through his phone.
And now I’m back to square 1 of questioning things all over again. I love him. I want to build my life with him. He knew I was already anxious and questioning things but he still went out and behaved like this. I understand gong out and drinking with friends but not to this extent. We’ve had slight arguments in the past about him going out and drinking too much before. So this felt like a slap on the face on top of everything. It also messed up my schoolwork for the next day because I fell asleep on my computer when I was trying to slave away until the due date at midnight, because I was so tired from taking care of him and cleaning. My grade got lowered a whole letter in one class because I submitted a very big assignment a few hours late. 
It’s just so irresponsible. It feels like a slap on the face after already what felt like a slap on the face. It seems so immature. I mean, he could’ve died. He could’ve not made it home. Anyway.
I know he has the ring. He’s apologized profusely for the whole drinking ordeal. Promised to never get to that level again. Promised to make me dinner each night so I can work extra hard on my homework to bring my grade up (although it’s now impossible to end with an A..). He says he is going to be more mature and responsible and I’ve made him change more than any other person ever.
He has the ring and is ready to make the next step. I want to move forward. We have had so many great times but then incidents like these creep in. Obviously he is biased. And I am stuck in my own head.  I can’t get out of my head and I need outside advice and perspectives. How should I move forward?

I brought it up to him last night after he went to my friendsgiving and didn't make an effort to talk or engage with the games we were doing. We have been dating for 2 years and this is his second time being around them. He also was supposed to take me to a class bc I was in a car accident and didnt want to take the rental on the interstate, but instead decided to pick his cousin up from the airport (the cousin is a whole nother issue) even though his mom could have picked her up. Then he left friendsgiving without saying bye or thank you to my friends because he had to deal with his dogs at home. This is a constant issue with having to go watch the dogs and not being able to do things with me and my family. I brought it up to him and he barely responded, and now when I suggested taking a break to think about what I said he apologized and hasnt spoken to me at all, so I have 0 insight on whats going on but I dont want to always be the one fighting for communication etc. This isnt a great description of what is going on, but what advice do you guys have on this situation?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7617221,public,self,My (F21) BF (M20) doesn't prioritize me and ignores me when I try to communicate,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z27aow/my_f21_bf_m20_doesnt_prioritize_me_and_ignores_me/,all_ads,6,,,

Here's the story;

We met 11 years or so years back, moved in and been together up until this year. The first year into our relationship, she cheated on me with an ex boyfriend, I forgave her at the time because I loved her and being that she was in her early 20's, I chalked it up as she made a mistake. However, throughout our relationship I always held onto that resentment, I never brought it back up, but it definitely changed our relationship.

I supported her while she went to the local college for 4 years and things were never great. I mean, we never argued really or had big blow ups, but we never seemed to have fun together when going out, at least that's what I felt. Our sexlife wasn't great, part of that I blame on myself and the resentment from that 1 time she cheated, and the other part I felt her choice of job made it harder. She became an OF model 4 years into our relationship and I felt the amount of videos and cam shows she did really made her lose her desire to be wanted by me, I don't, maybe it was just me she never really desired.

In any case, We got married last year in August, and by January she asked for a divorce. She wanted no money or support, only my dog. I agreed if she gave us another 6 months, I would agree with the divorce and let her keep my dog. July the year came around and she brought it up again and said if I didn't agree things would get messy. I agreed. We sold our car and the deal was I didn't have to leave right away but I would have to start looking for a new place to live. I told her If I were to move as quickly as she wanted, I wouldn't be able to pay the rent there as I would need to start saving a few thousand to move. A few weeks after, I was dying for love, and intimacy I had lacked, sure If I ever wanted sex or oral she would do it, but it was like she was performing a job rather than because she wanted to. I started dating while we lived together, and at best it was a distraction that helped me along. I never saw her get angry or jealous while I was dating and she even wanted to hear about the woman.

I moved out last month and within a day or so she wanted all of my stuff gone that I forgot, it took me 2 weeks when I could to take the last few things. Up until I moved she still cooked for me and did my laundry, which I found a little surprising. In any case, I last saw her about 2 weeks ago when she helped me move my last few things, she was friendly and even organized my shoes in my closet at my new place, but she didn't stay long and we hugged and she left.

Ever since, I reached out by phone the first time to see how she was, about 4 days after last seeing her and she sounded annoyed I was calling, specifically me asking where she was and who she was with. I reached out again 4 days later, but this time, my call went to voicemail, I texted her and she said she didn't want anyone to bother her and she was unavailable that night to talk. We spoke 2 days later when I texted her and I asked her to call me and she did, I asked her if she was dating and she said she did go on a date with someone, I dunno if that was true or not.

3-4 days go by and I ask her if she wants to grab lunch sometime, only got a quick no reply and that was it. I followed up with asking if she ever wants to see me or speak to me again. She replied with it may be best that we do not. I was very hurt by that, someone I spent 11-12 years with.. gone..

Anyways I reach out a few days later to return her cell phone that I once used, left it in her mailbox. She said to just drop it off, so I did, didn't check to see if she was home.

I sent her text later that same day saying I accept the divorce, but still miss and love her very much, and would be open to working it out, no reply to that text.

Following day, I text her to call me, she does within 2 minutes and we speak for almost 30 minutes on the phone. I asked if she was dating and she said she didn't feel comfortable talking about that (even though last week she mentioned she went on a date). She did say she was over me and I asked when did that happen, she said January when she first asked for a divorce. She never wanted to speak about our relationship or how she felt on the phone or even in the past when she brought up the divorce word. I never knew what I truly did wrong and she definitely doesn't want to talk about it. The communication in our relationship was always bad, she used to shut down like a wall. Last night I was watching her live feed on instagram and I texted her saying I was going to give her money for an uber so she could see her family on thanksgiving, she said she never asked for my help, and I replied to her saying I wanted to do it just because. When she read that message on her live feed, she immediatey told everyone she had to go and logged off quickly as if what I said upset her... I'm not sure why!!!

Today I texted her and asked if I could come visit my dog, she said she was out, but if she got back early, no problem, otherwise I could tomorrow.

A big part of me thinks she is very much over me. That is ok, I can accept that, even though I love her. But than there are the other things that make me 2nd guess if she would be open to giving it another shot.

I'm not sure how she feels or what I should do. I would love to show up at her place, but I could never ever go there uninvited even if I lived there only a few weeks ago!!!! If she was dating someone why not just tell me! I really would like to know if she met someone in Dec or January that she kept on the backburner all these months, not cheating on me, but someone in the wing waiting to get with!

I am a part of a friend group that has been together since the high school/early college days. Jay is a part of this group so is everyone else in the post aside from Sophia, his girlfriend. I include this because I have known these people for what feels like forever and I really trusted and thought better of him.

One of my close friends, Jay, and I had a friends with benefits sort of relationship that was going on for the past few months. He was looking for a relationship, I was not, and we compromised. Around mid-October he started to talk to and pursue a girl, Sophia, in one of his classes so I told him that if they started dating, I'd appreciate the heads up so I don't accidentally do or say anything that would make anyone uncomfortable. He agreed to this and we continued what we were doing. I would ask every so often how Sophia was and if they were serious yet and he would always get annoyed so I stopped asking him after a while, figuring that he would just tell me when they were official. About two weeks ago we went out on a day trip around the area, running errands and grabbing lunch, and we decided we'd go out for a more official dinner later in the week. So when he checked in with me the next Wednesday and asked if I'd be around to go out for dinner and go back to his house, I assumed that meant he was still single. We had a nice dinner and a nice time back at his house where we did have sex. Friday, two days after this, I found out he had made things official with Sophia from Harry, another one of our close friends. I cut back on contact with him over the phone aside from texting in our group chat because I didn't want to overstep bounds, although he didn't seem to notice and continued texting me just as frequently as before. Saturday night, he asked me if I wanted to go out to dinner and back to his house again. I said no for obvious reasons. A few days after this, Harry  told me they had been dating officially since before we first went out to dinner.

 I don't know what to do with myself, I feel terrible. I'm upset that someone I'd known for so long proved me to be a terrible judge of character and broke my trust. I'm also worried about the social consequences of this as the entire friend group knew we had gone out that night because Jay had sent a selfie to the group chat of us. I didn't know and absolutely would not have allowed what happened had he not left out that crucial piece of information.

Moreover, I have yet to hear personally from Jay about Sophia although he keeps texting me as if everything is normal, asking about my day and what I'm doing and what not. Its been nearly two weeks now. I don't know if I should confront him about it, after all I really have no desire in continuing to be friends, or if I should just leave it be and completely cut all interactions outside of group hang outs.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7617204,public,self,My (22F) friend (22M) cheated on his girlfriend with me and I don't know what to do.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z277z1/my_22f_friend_22m_cheated_on_his_girlfriend_with/,all_ads,6,,,

It's an exciting next step in our almost two-year relationship, and we have also been eager to be independent from our families' houses. 

*However.*. this entire month, he has been having explosive fits of anger. I'm never worried that he will hurt me, but now I'm not as thrilled as I once was. He freaked out, punching his car when we hit inevitable traffic on the way to dinner. He doesn't have the best relationship with his mom, and after she accidentally opened his mail, he went to his room and started punching his bed. Those are just a few examples. I knew he used to punch holes in his wall, but during our time together, it had stopped.

I've suggested that he try therapy or simply just consider it and that this uncontrolled anger is not good for his health, but every time he disregards it. He spins it around on me, saying something about my behavior when my anxiety flares up. I counter him every time saying that I've improved since I started therapy, and he still ignores my attempt at advice.

I knew they were close but didn’t realize just how close they were. I was supportive of their friendship and then slowly started to realize what was beyond the surface. I didn’t know about a lot of the behaviors they were engaging in and they were only gradually revealed to me. I knew they spent a LOT of time together but thought he’d make more room for me as we got closer. I knew he stayed at her apartment with her for days at a time but not that they slept in the same bed and cuddled and showered/got changed in front of each other. She knew every detail of our relationship and from what he’s told me, it seems like she was making a lot of his decisions for him about our relationship. He knew the gory details of her sex life. When he would reveal these things to me, I’d tell him I was uncomfortable with it and he’d say he’d stop and then he’d come back and fight me on it, try to convince me to let him continue. He would drop everything for her, including me, and regularly chose her over me. 

Whenever I’d go to leave he’d stop me and say that he knew it was unhealthy, he just wanted me, etc. But then nothing would actually change. She even treated me poorly and openly tried to bully me after getting upset about him having a close relationship with me and he just sort of reprimanded her and made her send a text apology that she admitted to him that she didn’t mean. They’d promised each other when they broke up that they’d always be each others priority and their relationship wouldn’t change. I get the feeling that he really wanted to stick to that but also wanted something lesser with me. I didn’t know about the promise until 9 months into our relationship. 

We’ve tried for almost a year now to make it work with her in the picture. They stopped talking for 2 months after he told her he’d cheated on her while they dated. For those 2 months I really felt him in our relationship. She recently reached back out and wanted to reconnect and he wants that too, desperately. I feel uncomfortable but not completely opposed. If they could have a typical friendship it’d be totally fine with me, but when we talk about boundaries he says that a boundaried relationship would be meaningless to him and says it’d be “like holding a dead puppy.” He knows that their friendship needs to change if he wants to have the partnership with me that (I think) we both want, but he’s hesitant to actually do anything. It took him months to just tell her that he needs a little more time before jumping back into a friendship with her. Actually, he still hasn’t told her that yet. 

I don’t really know what to do. I feel really lost in all the back and forth. He’s lashing out at me because he’s started to get paranoid that I’m trying to cut him off from everyone but me. But this is the only issue we’ve had with anyone in his life. I treat his other friends and family as my own, and I would with this woman too if they could just have a boundaried friendship together.

I stayed with some family while I got sober, went to therapy, got a new job with family friendly hours, made some major changes. She asked me to return home 6-7 weeks later and I did.  

Things have been good at times and bad at times.  She’s been distancing herself, barely communicating, doing things she never used to (going to bars, social media, up late at night on her phone).  My gut tells me there’s something going on.

I have mostly been letting her initiate conversations and doing things together. I try to give her space/let her be when she’s occupied.  I had been a little more proactive the last few days.

Recently she started therapy.

I voiced a concern last night, and like every time I voice a concern she suggests we separate. She feels she hasn’t had time to be ok. Usually I say I’m not leaving again without a divorce or agreement in place(kids, house, property etc). I try to give her space. I knew this wouldn’t be easy.

Last night I learned she has put more effort into this than I hoped. Talked to a lawyer, making arrangements.  She has again suggested separating. Mentioned “starting over” may be easier than forgiving me.  Wants to take the week/weekend to think about it. I feel it’s more likely that she’s letting me down softly.

I do want to save this marriage.  I’m a much better person sober. I’m mentally and physically in the best shape of my adult life.  I’m not sure how to act over this week and going forward.  I want to continue living together, and fix this marriage.

He is very handsome, introverted and he says that he enjoyed knowing people through the sexual interaction until searching for the one to commit to. 

He was living in a city with a lot of young people, where it was easy to find people for short-term-friends-with-benefits kind of “relationships”. I on the other hand was never able to have anything physical with someone I actually wouldn’t want to commit to and I grew up in a country where sharing a bed with random people is not that common (but of course can be found). I am also very introverted and I always stayed away from casanovas (haha!), due to being afraid of ending up as something short-term (which I was never interested about).

We met online and he traveled to meet me in person. We both very quickly fell in love, he prolonged his stay, flew back home, sold everything and flew back to me. It was truly magical and it still is. We are now living together for almost 5 months. 

He told me about having a lot of sexual partners after a week of two of his first trip. He was not hiding it, but I also didn’t ask - due to his “nerdiness” and introvertness I would have never thought. Soon after knowing that, I sometimes mentioned that randomly as teasing him in a judgemental way - I obviously didn’t and still don’t know how to process that and be okay with it. I do see how crazy this seems, but I was staying away from men like that my whole life. I do know that he did a huge thing for me/us (moving so far away, just to be with me).

I got a feeling through these months, that he doesn’t form non-sexual friendships with women, but at the same time talks with some women that he had something in the past and call them friends now. Whatever I’ve ever seen from the conversation with them or he showed me was always normal conversation and I don’t have any doubts about him not being loyal.

I am turning and looking inside of me; why this bothers me so much? How can I accept this? How to approach my feelings about it, so that I don’t destroy this beautiful life we are creating together? He definitely feels judged and he doesn’t deserve that. He is a good man with good intentions.

She is from a latin country while I am from Germany. We met while she was doing an internship at my university and had the most amazing time for 4 of the 8 months she was living and working here.

I had a few relationships before, but I can
honestly say that the time with her felt like something i never experienced before. She told me the same.

We both fell in love hard and basically had a full relationship for the whole duration (took trips together, basically lived together and behaved like in a relationship), but didn't formally started dating each other because neither of us wants to live in the country of the other person.

After she left, we kept in touch via text and called from time to time. The feelings never really left both of us.

After one year, she is now back in Germany to do her Master's and maybe a PhD aswell. We met a few times and it's still as great as ever.

We are debating if we should just try to start a relationship or if we should keep seeing each other in general, because neither of us can move on. She hasn't changed her mind about living in Germany and i haven't changed mine.
The only thing that we are both thinking about is MAYBE living in Spain in the future.

Me (20 M) have been togheter with my girlfriend (20F) for 2 years now. I really need some advise and I'll give you a little back story. This is my first real girlfriend so i have nothing to compare to so it's very hard for me to know what the right thing to do is.

I've been with quite a few girls before but i never really liked any of them. They were okey, but i didnt really care that much for them. I was 18 when i met my girlfriend and from the first night i met her i was in love. We couldn't stop talking to each other and felt like we had known each other for 50 years. We pretty much hanged out every day and after 3 months she moved in with me hehe. She is the prettiest girl I've ever seen and i love her above everything. She is like my best friend. Even going to the store with her i a looot of fun, even after 2 years. Our sex life was great and we did it pretty much every day.

To this day we cant go more than 2 minutes without talking to each other. We kiss and hug a lot. I truly believe she is the love of my life.

So the problem is around 1,5 years ago she started having some problems with sex. It went from every day, to once a week, to once a month to once every 2-3 months. The reason why it started came from some sexual trauma she had from the past. I was completly fine with this and helped her through it over 1 year. For 1 year we only had sex once every 2-3 months beacuse i wanted to help her. Around half a year ago she told me she felt better and had come to peace. It didnt bother her anymore. So i thought great, now we can have a healthy sex life again. But after all this to this day we only have sex every 2-3 months. We are both pretty good looking, fit, healhty and we have great sex togheter! But she still dosent want to do it. I cant count how many times I have told her how much it bothers me. Probaly 100 times. It affects me in a lot of ways. But it dosen't really seem like she cares. She dosen't work on herself to become better, even though she knows it hurts me and puts our relationship in danger. I told her some time ago i was afraid over time i was going to become resentfull towards her. That has begun building up, a lot. Before i was never never tired of her. Now i wake up and i just want to be alone. I become grumpy and mad at her for no reason. I hate myself for this but i cant really control it. I've read a lot about it and sex is essential for a relationship beacuse of some biological psychology. It's the same every month. She does it once, i get all my hope up, she tells me that she is going to work on it and boom, we dont do it for another 2-3 months. This has happend 1000 times and it's killing my feeling for her.

I'm not sure if she is ever going to become better and i dont want to be with a person that i dont have a healthy sex life with for 40 years. I dont know if i should break up beacuse it would break my heart, or if i should wait more. I just really really want to be in a relationship that is free and where we can have sex often. It's really really frustrating beacuse she knows i cant take it much longer, but still she dosent seem to care enough and work on herself. I know for a fact that she loves me extremely much so i just dont understand why she dosent care more.

Quite often i only do things to her, vibrator etc. And i make her orgasm, but she neeever does the same for me, i mean not once.

Please give me some advice!

I started researching on good selfcare products to use. I started eating healthy. I started going outside after staying inside the house for 7 months. I started socializing with my family. I went back to school after skipping it for a full year. I started having a positive outlook on things and working on fixing my severe social anxiety. I would make a list of every good thing I did everyday

It slowly started going downhill 4 weeks in, then it gradually got worse and worse. By august, I gave up on that shit because nothing worked. My skin still looked like shit even after using popular skincare products everyday for a few months. I don’t socialize with my family anymore, I don’t even say 15 words to them per day. I’m back to hating them, being spiteful to them, and wishing them dead when they piss me off. Same thing I’ve been doing for the past few years. I suppose you can say the only “good” thing I’m doing is going to school again. My parents bought a new house and spent alot of money just for me to be in the school I picked. I would’ve actually been trying in school if I was still on my improvement path, but now that I don’t give a fuck about it, I don’t care about school and I’m sailing 5/7 of my classes. It’s even more embarassing when u realize I’m 2 years older than my classmates and I shouldn’t even be in school anymore, but I’m fucking stupid so I’m still here. I don’t have intentions of fixing my anxiety. It’s still extremely bad. 

The worst part is that my hair is also fucking extremely unhealthy and is balding. It definitely depresses me even more and is gonna play a big part in why I’ll kill myself. I don’t have any intentions of going back on my improvement path, because it’s too fucking hard. Life is too fucking hard and it’s too much work so all I do nowadays is whatever I want. I just game, be on my phone, eat a ton of snacks, ignore my hygiene and health even tho I can literally see and feel myself getting worse. A month ago I developed a bump on one of my eyelids. Nearly everyday my hair hurts when it moves and I can see it looking worse and worse. I get new acne everyday. My grades drop more and more overtime. So nowadays I just do whatever I want, knowing it’ll all make me worse but the good news is that it’ll push me more to kill myself. When I lose all my fucking hair in the future, or when I get diabetes for my snack addiction, or when I’m broke and dropped out of school, it’ll be easier to kill myself.

I went to Kansas City with a friend and he had told me he was going to bed. I then get a call at 2 am telling me got arrested for a DWI. I ended up tracking his location and seen that he was at the casino, at bars, etc. he said that he felt he couldn’t tell me because I wouldn’t want him to go. MIND YOU, this trip was us agreeing to trust each other again and becoming more like the relationship we want to be so this would have been the time to be honest, only to have him do this. He says he was by himself and I find that very hard to believe. That was about 5 years ago.
 Topping on the cake was three years ago when his cousins wife called me after my bf decided to go to their house and continue drinking instead of coming home with me (should’ve been clue #1). She calls me the next day and proceeds to tell me that my bf tried to basically rip her clothes off and she was drunk but remembers him trying to touch her. She said that her, her husband(my bfs cousin), and my bf all knew it had happened but my bf begged her not to tell me, which she did anyway. To this day he says he remembers nothing from that night and therefor thinks I should shut up about it. He said she’s a liar yet he still goes to their house. If someone accused me of something I didn’t do, I would not be doing that!  It would have been easier had I gotten some closure and if I was not forced to still see and hang out with these people since they are part of his family. I also found him on a couple dating websites but the ones that are obviously fake with pics of naked girls. Still though. Who knows if he’s on legitimate ones. 

So, now we are up to speed you might not think I am crazy. In the past three months, he has stopped texting me every morning like he normally does. He is not as sexual with me as he normally is, although he is getting older and we’ve been together a long time so I’m not sure if that is it. When he goes to sleep, he moans and moans and I know this is a little creepy, but he has a full fledge you know what. He’s never done that before and it’s every night. I joked with him and said something and he pretty much said I was a liar but if it keeps me up to just wake him up. So I did. And he proceeded to say He didnt have a boner when he obviously did. Idk why he would feel the need to lie. I know he watches porn and stuff like that so it’s not like I would be mad. It made me feel like he is hiding something. He’s been looking at wayyy different porn than he normally does too. It used to be a lot of thick girls (I am pretty thin soooo? Lol ) and now it’s a bunch of step sister shit. My younger sisters are now women, but he seen them grow up and I don’t want to think he would be a fucking sicko like that but then the other day, I brought up my gynecologist app and how I hadn’t shaved. My sisters asked me if I normally shave, and I said not really, Beard trimmers work great! Lol and my sister goes to my bf “oh you don’t mind it?” He’s been asked this question quite a few times before and he always says it doesn’t bother him. This time he said no I don’t like hair I like it smooth which is weird since my sister just said she always keeps hers smooth and he knows I don’t. He keeps asking me what my sister is doing and he is overly sexual to me in front of them. Like telling me he’s gonna spank my butt and calling himself daddy which he does not do in front of any other people.  Then today, he starts calling me by my name which he has also never done in the ten years we’ve been together. I’ve ALWAYS been babe.

Im not sure where to go from here. I don’t want to make any accusations because I do feel like I have a hard time trusting my emotions because I am sensitive. I need some advice on if I am over reacting or how to possibly get to the bottom of what is going on. Then there’s a part of me that is so tired of worrying about what he is doing that I’m not sure if I even care.

I feel awful and i know that i am a pice of shit.

I had no reason for doing it we have just bought a house and we have a dog together. 

So we went out for drinks and there were no seats available so i offered the girl to sit on my lap so she didnt have to stand. We started talking and i could kinda tell that she was into me. I started feeling bad and knew what i was doing was wrong so i took her outside and told her that i have a gf and that i didnt want to give her any hopes that anything was going to happen. I give her a hug and we go back inside, i can se that she was starting to tear up when we were inside again so i felt bad and hugged her again. 

Next thing you know we are making out and cant let go of etcother. The bar closes we walk out and keep making out everywhere in the city center for about 1hr. She lives 30 min outside of town and didnt have a ride home and i couldnt just leave her there so i bought her a hotel room. I got he key gave it to her and was going to say godnight but my lust got the better of me and i ended up going up together with her. 

We have sex and cuddle afterwards like a cupple would. I didnt just want to have sex then leave so i stayed 2 houers and just cuddled her and enjoyed it. 

I got home in the morning went to bed next to my gf and i told her straight away. Its now been 3 days she has forgiven me and is trying to get back to normal. But i keep having images in my head of the girl i slept with and i know i will see her every week because she orgenises things for my fotball team and she is also the sister of one of my team mates.

I'll put it simple: I overthink badly. My girlfriend can be affectionate, caring, say she loves me and misses me, but the moment she isn't, I panic mentally. I never bring these things up with her but still.

While apart, we tend to mention or send each other Instagram posts with cute relationship quotes every so often.

Yesterday I mentioned her in a post that said ""I love my girl exactly how she is"". Normally, she'd acknowledge this and reply with a heart, a kiss emoji or whatever. This time she didn't acknowledge it and it made me flat that she isn't as isn't me anymore. We've still texted in the meantime, she said she loved me two days ago, but is her not acknowledging this a bad thing or am I just being my typical, overthinking self?

My boyfriend (m20) and i (f20) have been dating on and off for 2 years. I am not the most attractive person he’s been with sexually just putting it out on record. He rarely compliments me but i don’t let that bother me because he’s never been big on compliments at least when it comes to me, which is still fine. but recently things are starting to get to me. Apologies in advance i know it’s long but i like to give details. 

i make instagram reels for a brand and im physically in those videos doing hair tutorials, usually dressed up with slight makeup on etc. When i first started making those videos i used to send them to my boyfriend as well. he never gave a ‘oh wow amazing’ reaction but whatever. After a point, instead of sending the videos to him, i just used to tell him that i made one and wait for him to ask me to show it to him. He barely asked so i stopped bothering to even update him. 

Now i get it, the videos i make are not something he would be interested in but all my friends have been so supportive by liking all of my content, following the brand to see my content etc. My boyfriend, never once liked a video or followed the page. i never said anything for about 5 months. 

but yesterday i randomly asked him if he saw my new video that has been posted. he said ‘no how would i you didn’t send it to me’. to which i replied ‘i shouldn’t have to send it you, you know they post my videos so you should be following the page and showing support.’ Then he told me that he’ll follow the page now and that he didn’t realise or know if he should have done that beforehand. I sarcastically replied saying ‘no need to follow it now after i’ve asked you to’ in a joking manner. 

He didn’t end up following the page, neither did he say anything about the video ( i don’t even think he saw it lol). But yeah i just feel like one should be at least a little more supportive and appreciative. 

This is making me upset but i dont know how to bring it up with him without seeming like i’m forcing him to follow and like my content.

Me (24f) and my husband A (28m) have been together for almost 3 years. Previously he was with H(30f) for 5-6 years. They had a complicated break up, A understood he had feelings for me (he did not know it was mutual) and asked H to break up and leave his flat because he couldn't be with her anymore. He gave her 1,5 months to do this, even took her to a vacation to cheer her up. When the day to move out came, she backed out, threw a fit and he practically had to kick her out, which he still regrets (that he became angry and yelled at her).
A and I got together and it's has been the best time of our lives. 

However during  our relationship there have been some things that H did that I find strange and disturbing.

-- H was calling A every day, even when she found out he was in a relationship and later when A and I moved together, several months later I told A I don't like it and he told her to stop. She did.
-- during one of the calls H informed A that she'll be coming in town for winter holidays and stay either at A's mom's place or at his cousin's (probably she did stay at his cousin's or didn't come at all)
-- she came to our town to visit him and their dog several times, which A was very anxious about, without asking, just informing
-- last summer she came and stayed and his cousin's and came to see A's mother and brother, and the dog (without informing A personally) she also didn't inform my SIL (A's brother's wife) despite them being colleagues and friends earlier, because SIL told her 'abiens abi' so H knew SIL wound not approve of it. Later that day A's mother happily showed SIL photos they took together. Later I told A that it hurt me very much that he and his family walked with her and that his mother and brother and H went to a restaurant later. He also said that he felt bad about this. Later both mother and brother said it was awkward and that they didn't want to go. A asked H to not do this again and limit contact with his family and him.
-- H is still friends with A's cousin and his wife, recently his cousin asked A to give them the dog for an hour so that H could walk with her. He obliged.

A is still very anxious and worried every time H is mentioned. He blames himself that he kicked her out. Even when we discussed and agreed that H was not respecting boundaries he hesitated about talking to her (to ask her to stop). He said he didn't want to hurt her feelings, he didn't want her to cry. It seemed very strange to me, as if he cared about her feelings more than about his own and mine.

SIL told me that H was really controlling with A and dismissive about other's wishes. She has done things I would never personally do. I don't stalk my ex's girlfriend, don't send her IG stories to my friends to discuss like H did with A's cousin and his wife. I don't keep in touch with my ex's family. I just want to feel that there is a place for me in A's family. But apparently A and H's break up was a shock for everybody, because they seemed like a perfect couple despite it being a burden for A for years. 

A wants me to be close friends with his cousin and his wife, like it was with H. I just can't. It hurts. It hurts to know that they are ok with the stuff H is doing, that is so disrespectful towards A and me. I don't want my every word and step to be discussed with H afterwards. 

How do I ensure boundaries within A's family?

Ive  (32M) been with my girlfriend (27F) for 6 almost 7 years, beautiful, caring girl. We share a lot of hobbies together. Love her. 
For the pandemic we went from a big city to a small town, I got a job there and it was our chance at living together, further from family and friends. She was always quite jelause, but for me it wasnt an issue since i dont ""look"" at other girls, so i didnt give her reasons to be. 

On this small town things started to change, she stayed home and id go to work, she would want to know every detail of my day, trying to get me to say the exact phrases people said. This new job has more female collegues than male so I guessed it was jealussy, trying to find flirty intentions, which she didnt. I included her at everything after office wise, birthdays occasional beers until she stopped worrying much about the girls but more about my time.

After 1 year there she started stating that work an collegues were my priority and that i had to give more to our house and relationship, I tried, coming home from work, clean more, help more cooking, but still it wasnt enough, I offered to hire help but still not enough. 

When I asked her what was the issue she'd say that i was giving to much time to the people at work. And not enough to her.

For me it wasnt that way, I would grab a beer after work once or twice a week (always invting her to join) and on weekends we would get an invitation to a bbq. Again, small rural town. And i felt all this invitations were good news. But she felt i was being absobrbed by this people. And that i wasnt appreciative enough towards her and everything she was doing for me. Which i felt i did.

Long story short, she gave me an ultimatum, leaving back to the city. I have to choose, to go out a maximum of 2 times a week or else we need to break up. That im inmature going out that much, and that a house and relationship need that sort of commitment.

I said i had to think about it, i dont want to lose her cos i dont know if ill find someone like her again. But i feel very manipulated and controlled. And im not sure if im beeing blind and irresponsable, im very insecure. Tomorrow I need to bring her my answer, im scared to say yes, and feel bad of rejecting my friends for this. Im nervous to think theres going to be a new thing she wants me to change. Friends and family say that she was always very jealous and it will continue.

I've made some period kits a few months ago, so i can be ready to give to them once this time came. It's pretty much a small cute bag (like a small pouch) with a collection of everything my girls will need once their menstrual cycle starts. In the pouch there's pads, Ibuprofen (I read bad cramps can happen), baby wipes, extra pair of underwear (just in case an accident happens) and hand sanitizer. I also got them a period tracking journal which just by looking at it, it's incredibly helpful. I also bought some Ginger and chamomile tea, I read these 2 teas are known for their menstrual health qualities (helps with crampy stomachs). It may seem that I went overboard with this stuff, but I want my girls to have minimal discomfort &amp; have everything they need ready by their side. 

I'm also trying to have a super fun &amp; positive attitude near my daughter who just had her period. It was pretty obvious she was quite scared, even already knowing about periods. I was sitting on the sofa watching TV, that's when my daughter came and just wrapped her arms around me &amp; hugged/cuddled with me. Didn't think much of it at first, but she was super quiet (she's very goofy and out going) so I immediately figured something was wrong. I asked her if everything was okay and she whispered to me that she had her period. My first instinct was to comfort her, I understand this moment for a girl her age can be challenging. I told her there was nothing to be afraid, and she just stayed quiet. I know she was prepared for this moment, but with it finally happening, I can tell she was a bit worried. We stayed in the sofa for quite a while, because any movement I did she would tighten the hug she was giving me. I just wrapped my arms around her and gave her all the love &amp; support she needed.

I'm expecting my other daughter to get her period as well, if not sooner than later. I did give my daughter her period kit, which she loved cause of the cute little bag I gave her. I also gave her some dark chocolate, I read dark chocolate can relieve period cramps and that it's loaded with magnesium that is known to relax muscles. Even with the research I've done and trying to prepare myself for this, I still would love some tips and advice that can not only help me but also my girls. My daughters trust me  so much and while I may not have all the answers for them, I want to help them as much as I can. 

As a single father, what would be the best advice/tips you can share so that I can make this experience for my daughters better? I'll love to read your advice, tips, stories - anything you'll be willing to share, I'll greatly appreciate it so much!

I have been on and off with a guy for a few years. When we are good we are very good. He will show up for me in the ways that I need, but on his time and when he feels like it. He’d ask me on a date, but again it would be on his time. He may cancel and take weeks to reschedule. But reassured me that the connection is real to him and that he is interested in building the connection. The problem is that there is no effort on his part to build the connection. If we decide to be Fwb, weeks later he may change his mind because she “sees me as more than that”. When we pursue the relationship, he isn’t ready for that type of commitment. I find myself moving on his time. He’d tell me he wants to pursue things, and when I’m open to it and putting in effort, he withdraws. I’m also an emotional person, so I do communicate my feelings, which seems to trigger the flight in him. His reasoning would be that he isn’t used to communicating his feelings the way I’d like to.

I moved from Latin America for my studies and for a better future. I have always been on the introverted side and never really struggled with missing my family. I adjusted very easily to living alone, but my parents didn't as much. From the beginning my mom (60F) particularly wanted to have more contact with me, and I refused. She wanted to talk at first every day, and to her credit she has toned it down a LOT over the years, right now we're down to her trying to contact me once a week and even then I can't move my ass to reply to her calls and messages. I can see logically why her request is reasonable, I just find her caring to be suffocating.

I fear that by talking to her once I am making the commitment to follow up on whatever we talked and that makes me incredibly anxious. I don't feel I can tell her if something bad happens to me because I not only have to deal with my distress but also with her distress about mine. I find communication with her often highly stressful.

I'm the kind of person who rarely talks everyday with ANYONE, much less reply to texts messages every time. I understand how she being my mom and us living so far apart makes it different, but I can't find it in me to fight the anxiety about talking to her.

She's a very loving mother. Yes, she has issues. I also think she's looking for a friend in me, and I've never wanted to be her friend, I want to be her daughter. This gets worse when she and my father (58M) aren't doing well. When I have tried stablishing boundaries she doesn't repond too well, saying I'm ""blocking"" her. 

I have changed a lot since living in Germany, she abd I have very different opinions on how we see many things, but that should be no reason why we shouldn't be able to have a relationship.

I want help. I want to make her happier. I want to be a more loving daughter without putting my mental health in danger. How do I deal with my anxiety about talking to her?

Ps. Yes, I'm looking for a therapist. 
Ps.ps. She's visiting now for some months and even now I find it hard spending alone time with her because it is always so intense. I want time on my own alone. She'd like me to visit every day since we don't get to see each other often at all (it had been 4 years since we last saw each other)

**CG** 

Hi, 

I'm here to just vent about what I currently feel in my situationshipu. So there is this guy I meet at work, let's call him CG. So CG and I started talking around 5 months ago when I got hired at my job, but we only ever STRICLY talked at work(he didn't have my socials and I didn't have his). After two months of be being at my job, he added me on Snapchat.. to THIS DAY.. im still not sure how he found me, but hey he did! Anyways he added me and we became friends insrtead of just 'co-workers' Then from then on we became more than friends... you know. So to keep in track, we have been doing this situation ship thing deal for around 3 months. Okay anyways, the first 2 months of us doing our thing was great, we always hung out, we on dates, kissed, hugged and basically did things a couple did( not just physically, but also emotionally) To where we would sit and talk and communicate on things that brought us or my concerns. We showed each other that we both care ALOT, I sat there when we would cry, and CG is a closed person and im the only other girl that has ever seen him cry, and then I sat there and cried to him, we both have been there. Though 4 months of doing stuff seem so little, I feel like it is a good amount of time to know someone and to figure out if u want to continue or not. So the reason I feel so confused is because I get a feeling that CG likes me one day, then the next he doesn't, then the NEXT he does. And it is a cycle, to where he shows me he cares and reassurces me, then the next it's like nothing, You feel...? Now, here. CG recently got out of a relatioship (of 4 years) around 5 months ago... which is the same time i got hired and we started talking as co- workers. And here is where I give him the benifit of the doubt, because I know how hard it is to lose someone who you thought would be forvere( i broke up with a guy i was with for 3 years, around 3 years ago) So I have explained this whole thing to my firneds, and they sometimes feel taht I am being used, as a rebound so that he can get over R(his ex). AND I brought that up to hi... ""hey, i hope you arent using me as a rebound"" and we had a 3 hour talk about it, and he reassured me that he isnt. And his actions allign with his words for this topic. Want to know what else... I let this guy cry to be about his ex... which most girls would probally not want, since the ex is the past and you are the new coming person. But i dont feel uncomftorable since he still OFC has feelings there for taht past relationship. I have also explained to him that he needs to seperate the feelings from that girl and the 'feelings' he has for me, since I am a completely new person and not her, I am a new canvas, and i want to creat a new poicture with me. But sometimes he tries to re create the painting he had with his ex...which sucks. This guy sometimes makes me feel like the world, and then doesnt. WHen I am sad, he tells me to 'suck it up and move on'. Which i can understand is something i do need to hear, but i know I wanna be held and comforted. And i even told him, how i wanted to be treated when I am crying to him. And he sometiems does it, but is not consistent. This guy makes me chagne the way I see things, to where I am changing myself as a person FOR A GUY, who doesnt put effort to change himself the slightes. The onyl chagne I have seen is where he opens up and crys to me. But to where I want him to understand the things I see its a "" my a closed person"" ""my mindset has been this way since I was young""... In the beginning he would but the effort to chagne, and now i feel like it has gotten down the more and more I cry to him about what I feel and shit. CG recently has been acting like he wants to do something with me, and as for me I feel like Im losing the feelings I ahve for him, which isnt what I wanted to happen. I wanted him to feel something for me when I felt something for him, and now my fear of me losing my feelings and him gainin them is starting to happen. When we hang out, I feel the butterfiles in my stomach still, he still kames me smile and blush, but the nervous feeling I get is as if i am emmbarresed. Not nervous to be next to them inn a cute way.... if that makes sense. When he text, I have started to become more dry, and use less emojis and less words in sentences. And then when we hang out, i try to to put in so much energy like he does. Cause I want him to see how it is to be treated the way he treated me(liiterally a week ago) And he has noticed this, to where he asks me ""are you okay? your acting different"" ""are you sad"" ""whats wrong, why wont you hug and kiss me?"" Like aww, look who feels like me now. Where your not sure if I am okay or not. I feel like I like like this guy, but then I feel like i jsut LIKE him and then I feel like i dont. This situationship makes me feel like the world, and then makes me feel like dirt. 

This is a message i reicived from a close friend:

me:

""I’m confused in what i wanna do with this guy. As he treats me like i am the world sometimes, then other days he acts like he doesn’t care. Then there are times where he flutters me with affection and then the next he can barely hug me or even hold my hand. With car guy(who is my situation ship) I feel that he is using me to get over is his ex. Who he broke up with 6 months ago(it was a 4year relationship)And here is the thing, i know how long it takes for someone to get over a long relationship like that. So why still have me along if you want “time for yourself” “and doesn’t know if i like you or not” Like i don’t want a relationship either, but i also don’t want to feel like i’m throwing myself out there for a “nonchalant “ guy and someone who “is a closed person”, i feel like he was a different person the first 2 months we started talking, ya know. And now it’s like kinda dry between us, as sometimes when we hang out; he is on his phone, and we are sitting there in silence, or if not that; we are both just sitting there. And was sucks more is am always the one coversating, in the one making the moves, if i don’t reply, he won’t, if i don’t show any affection he won’t. And his mind set is “oh if you aren’t going to do it, imma think you JUST don’t want to” girl wtf. I honestly think this guy is hot and cold, cause once i start to question the awkwardness and dryness between us. That is when he will start to show he cares both via messages and physically plus emotionally. And this “act” can last for 3 days until i feel “reassured” but within my own mind. Not him telling me.And you want to know what is funnier. Sometimes i feel like he does like me, then the next is i feel like he doesnt, and then again he does. Sometimes i feel like this guy does care and then doesnt. Why is he so confusing, i even had a talk about this confusing stuff with him. To where he cried TO ME saying “i want to be with you” “ i want to be with you in the long run” FOR HIM TO TELL ME (as we are talking about why i feel confused) “ i’m still on about my ex. I’m not sure if i like you. I don’t want to rush into any other relationship “ But i told him that i don’t want to be in one either, that i was never EVER implying i wanted a relationship with him. All i wanted to know is if he felt any way about me, but he kinda dodged it with the reply he gave me there\^ Not only that, i asked him if he wants me tk “not have feelings for him” And he said “i would prefer if you didnt” Cause before we became a “situation ship” we were sneaky links and were supposed to have no feeling. But look at the dumb one that caught feelings, asked him if he does. What’s crazier is that i wanna wait for him, cause i sometimes feel that he likes and cares. Where he shows me he does really care. I would give a whole list if i can, but rather not. Then again, why wait for someone who doesn’t even know what they want. Like do i genuinely like the guy, or do i like the presence of him being there""

Her:

""hmm okay so to me it i think that you know what your decision should be if you have that many concerns with him and if he’s leaving you confused more than reassured then he’s not serious about you, and although you guys both don’t want relationships there seems to be feelings and that’s why you care so much and maybe him too, but him crying to you saying that he wants you for the long run is a red flag because if he’s not willing to put in the work right now and let it keep getting to the point where in order for you to get a reaction out of him you have to keep confronting him about the same issue then he’s not the one my love. a 4 year relationship is an extremely long time and im sure he’s told you why the relationship ended but at the end of the day no matter what he tells you there’s has to still be a lot of emotions for him when it comes to that relationship, so like you said at the end and your absolutely right why wait for someone who doesn’t even know what they want, as hard as it is to walk away you don’t deserve all this confusion in your life, you deserve someone to be 100% sure about you just. i know your holding on to what he could potentially be but ur going to keep disappointing yourself time and time again. actions will always speak louder than words and if his actions are not aligning with his words then there’s a hug disconnect and that means that he’s not as serious has he says.""

I want to fix said friendship but at the same time realize I need to prioritize myself and not my feelings for my friend but don't know what to do without either making my friend uncomfortable or worst-case-scenario cutting ties entirely. 

WARNING: VERY LONG TEXT SORRY. So with giving as much detail and context as I can, for the past three or so years, my mind set has completely changed and my ""toxic trait"" in life has transformed into the idea that I'm not happy personally unless I make other people happy. I don't know how I got this way, or how I started to become more emotional, it just kind of happened. It's not even just the aspect of I start to develop feelings for someone, I just want to do whatever I can to make people happy because everyone deserves to feel that way no matter what. Because of this, I have never ever really done anything for myself or know what to do with myself.

I bring up that ""toxic trait"" because it carried over with me into a new job but really only started showing about a month and a half ago. I got a new job at Target, and I was starting to meet new people and friends who I absolutely adored. One of my friends (we'll call her Sadie) seemed very personable to me and was always more than kind at work and patient and all sorts of wonderful things that you can fill in. We had a handful of similar interests and she got me addicted to a new video game that I've never played before and I loved the idea of starting to play it more with her to help not only give me something to do and be ""passionate"" about, but also help fill a void of loneliness since I live in the middle of nowhere and all of my college and high school friends are long gone. This time with her, even though it was only over a video game or at work, meant/means a lot to me as I consider any sort of time with someone as quality time and had been going on for around 7 months. It was helping me get over a breakup with my now ex-girlfriend very quickly. As bad as this sounds, I was not too sad about breaking up because I could kind of tell a few months ahead that the relationship with my ex was going south and I was mentally prepared for it. What I could not prepare for however, was the feeling of how much I love helping others and supporting them. Of course I was sad about breaking up, but the void I felt wasn't necessarily for love but from the aspect of now I no longer had someone to lean on my shoulder if they need help, or I had nobody else to help. And basically around three weeks-a month ago I started developing feelings for Sadie. Of course me being the semi-awkward guy I am haven't had to talk about new relationship based stuff with a woman for four-and-a-half years and didn't want to risk tarnishing the friendship that we had built up. I asked for advice from another work friend (we'll call him Jared) and I did eventually let her know how I felt and of course got the exact response I expected and she wasn't interested in any relationship stuff for a long time but I just wanted to get it off my chest and let her know how I truly felt about her.

I won't get too deep into this because it is none of my business, but Sadie had also been going through/is going through some of the toughest shit I've heard of in my life up to this point. Again, not all details are included here because I cannot speak for her, but she was trying to get out of a very toxic relationship with her current boyfriend, was trying to move out, as well as trying to get away from Target. She had moved here from another state and really had nobody here except for a few friends and no family at all. In my head, I was in the mentality of ""I want to help her out as much as I can"" however in light of telling her how I felt, I did not know where the line was between support as a good friend and support without coming of as wanting to be a significant other. So this is where my emotions come more into play. Because for maybe a good two week span, I was very concerned about her wellbeing and how she was doing not only mentally but also with the situation she was/is in. I didn't tell her about any of my emotions at this point because I didn't want her to think I was speaking from how I felt about her instead of the idea of ""you deserve better."" Especially with her not having anybody out here, I wanted her to at least have the inclination that there are people here who truly care about her wellbeing. There was a night where I wanted to take her out just for a chill and easy night before she had a shift. Even though I wouldn't say I'm the best at planning out what exactly to do to help someone's mental state get better, especially in the middle of nowhere, I still wanted to at least help her relax. Even if it was just (AS FRIENDS) going out for sushi, running around a mall for a little bit, and crashing at a friend's house for a few hours, I just wanted to show some sort of effort at the time that people do care and that the world isn't cruel. Plus she had been working a lot recently and was stressed out and in my eyes she deserved it. 

One plan to help her out that was also getting set into motion was the idea of moving in together (obviously as friends and nothing more). She approached me about it and said even though she knew I recently told her I developed feelings for her, she would still love to be good friends and I thought it would be a perfect opportunity for me to become a way better person to be around, get to know her more, as well as be the best, best friend I could be. We both saw the mutual benefits in it, as we were both trying to move out and it was way closer to work for both of us, etc. We had ended up setting up an apartment tour for a few days later that night as well. Fast forward about a week after taking her out, I was at work and out of the blue I got absolutely swamped in my own emotions. I was starting to get sort of lonely at work as most of my friends including Sadie had switched to an overnight shift and I couldn't at the time because of Uni. I had to run to the employee bathroom in the back where I was bawling my eyes out for twenty minutes because all I could think about was a) the stress I put on myself for caring so much, b) missing working with my friends, c) not knowing how much support is too much or too little, and d) just overall hoping Sadie is okay. She had told me before that she doesn't need a lot of support and is able to do things on her own which I completely understand and respect but part of me thinks that if I don't show any support or care, it's not like I'm there at all. So sometimes I wouldn't even know what to say and would just stay quiet as to not say the wrong thing. Jared and Sadie had found me and he asked what was wrong, and all I could simply say was emotion stuff because I didn't want to talk about my feelings for Sadie right in front of her. That same day at work, all I felt was a consumption of the thought that I wasn't doing enough to be supportive but didn't want to push people away for being too supportive and helpful; I couldn't find and still can't find a way out of that gray-area. After work, I went over to Jared's house and Sadie was already there as she had been staying at Jared's house for a few nights to avoid her boyfriend. At Jared's, I'll be honest, I smoked weed for the first time in my life because I figured it would help me mentally for the day. In reality, all it ended up doing was bringing out all of my emotions to their fullest. I was absolutely bawling my eyes out because not only was it the stress of caring so much, but I felt like a burden to my friends. I apologized profusely to Sadie as to if I was being too supportive and I didn't want to push her away or be a burden. I did the same to Jared and apologized for being a burden with asking for advice.

From that afternoon, which at this point was 4 days ago, I learned a lot about myself as to what I have to do to think more for myself. I thought it would be more difficult than I thought because I am essentially trying to change my whole personality that I've had the past 3 years thinking it was the true me and good for me. I didn't want to come off as selfish however and still wanted to show care for people, just obviously now prioritizing myself. Even if it was just simple advice of ""think less"" and ""try to relax"" I could truly do it now after forcing myself to not think about others for once, and it felt great. The past few days have been amazing with the self-work I've done and my head has been the most clear it's been in years. Well, as of the morning this post went out, I wanted to talk with Sadie about the tour and moving in and she had told me that she had second thoughts about moving in. Her reasoning was that she is trying to improve her own mental health and focus on her feelings and that rooming with someone who is as ""emotionally unstable"" as me would be a detriment to her. Of course I agreed with her, and part of that was the caring for her and what she thinks is best for her, and part of that I feel was just the honest truth of the situation. I still can't really pinpoint why I started getting so emotional in the first place, but also it was so disheartening to hear that because it meant my thoughts about being a burden and pushing people away were true. I would love to have an honest and transparent talk with Sadie about all of this but she absolutely hates any sort of confrontation and it frightens her and I don't want any sort of the conversation to come off that way, as well as I don't want to force her into talking about it if she is uncomfortable. She would say a few times, ""we can just talk about this later"" for several conversations but I know it truly seems like she is trying to avoid a confrontation for sure. Even when I tried to talk to her that same morning, it seemed as if she was trying to avoid me and even what seemed like faking a phone call to get away from me when I did start talking to her.

I focus in quality over quantity too in friends, and even though I have only known Sadie for a few months, it would hurt my heart so much to lose someone like her as one of the greatest friends I've had but also as one of the nicest people I've gotten to meet. Basically this comes back to the title, of how exactly can I try and help recover the friendship that seems lost while also thinking for myself? I brought up the aspect of if we can fix both of ourselves personally maybe we can revisit the idea of moving in/being closer again in the future, but with her not coming to even just a tour of the apartment today and not responding to my texts from the morning this went down, I feel as if this is long gone but I still want to do anything I can to find our true friendship again. I want to take baby steps to fix things but of course not make her uncomfortable or get in the way of her life. At the same time, I now have to prioritize myself because I promised myself that, and that I would find things that I truly need to do to fulfill my self-love and self-care goals. I know you cannot save everybody, and that you need to save yourself first, but I just can't seem to shake the idea of helping her even if it's just a little bit of support.

The outcome I would love out of this is that I simply want to be good and close friends with Sadie again without being an awkward little shit and be able to focus on myself at the same time, while still showing some care as to not leave her in the dark but not too much care to push her away again. An unrealistic outcome would be what was just mentioned, but moving in together still as well.

When there’s an issue it leads to swearing and vicious cycles of arguments where her grandmother says really hurtful or nasty things. Her grandma recently threatened to slap her over directions during a car ride, only because my woman politely told her grandma she took the wrong turn. Just imagine how bad this is if they argue over the literal smallest of shit… She has tried to excuse this before with the heat of the moment BS, but that’s… BS. Her grandmother moves like she wants everyone to be yes men to her and she has a problem whenever someone disagrees with her. I’m tired. I don’t say much since her attitude already sucks on the daily and I don’t want me opening up to lead to her disagreeing with letting me come and stay for a few days with my woman. We wanna get a place together, but we’re about a year away from that. I’ve tried thinking of multiple ways of how I can intervene and let her grandmother know that she is wrong about several things … but it just seems literally impossible.

The thing is my boyfriend is kind of opinionated and he has pretty strong feelings against cheating (not that I don’t I’m just biased obvs and I’m not really focusing on that rn she’s my priority not her boyfriend and I’m trying to help and advice as best as I can) but it would really be a shame if he starts seeing her differently because I will be spending time with her still and just don’t want to make it weird. 

On the other hand it’s not really his business but I do feel the need to tell him because 1. He knows smth did happen I just told him idk what yet, 2.

So my BF went on a trip for 2 weeks and we of course we’re both horny so we thought to sext. The first night we tried sexting it was just me telling him what I wanted to do to him or what I wanted him to do to me and him responding “yummy so hot” like for 3 hours straight. I finally asked if he was close to cumming and he said he was too tired. Ok? I said you know what this is fine but id prefer you not let me babble on for 3 hours straight if you aren’t in to it. 
Anyways, next night we try again. I get dressed in lingerie and send suggestive videos and pictures and try to really get him in the mood. He keeps responding “mmm” and “so hot” “so sexy” and so I continue. I keep asking (in a sexy way) if he’s still hard and horny for me and he responds “always”. So I assume he’s still in to it. Another 2 hours pass of this and I’m getting tired with no end in site and no other communication from his side besides the short responses. 
I finally ask if he’s getting close or we are headed in the right direction and he bluntly says he hasn’t been hard for a split second tonight. I ask him why he didn’t say something 3 hours ago and he said he was trying to just enjoy himself. He tells me he atleast wished I came because otherwise this would’ve been a waste. So I tell him “sure I’ll still cum”. So I do cum and then I tell him I’m sorry I couldn’t make him cum. 
I don’t get a response for 5 minutes and then all of a sudden I get “Gn” 
I ask him what’s wrong and he says he’s pissed at me for cumming and making the night all about myself instead of focusing on him. He calls me selfish. I apologized to him and didn’t get a response. 
What is this about? Im not a selfish lover in the bedroom at all so I’m not sure what this is about. Actually it’s opposite because he refuses to give me head.
