Last night was when my boyfriend actually found out about it and he did not find out sooner because I am currently on a business trip and he is not physically with me.

Basically yesterday I was giving very short responses that just didn’t seem like me and he asked if I was OK or if I was upset with him. I said I wasn’t upset with him and he asked what was wrong and I just said that I’ve been feeling depressed lately.

Now comes the irrational part. He did not say I love you until about an hour ago and I decided to take that very personally that he did not say I love you sooner or try to reassure things sooner even though I know that’s irrational.

There’s a part of me that just wants to ask him why he didn’t say it sooner but I feel like I know what his answer will be. I feel that his answer will likely be because I didn’t ask him to. 

I usually don’t get good reassurance from him I usually have to walk him through how to reassure me. A example that I typically use is when I was anxious that he would leave me because I have a medical condition that prevents me from having penetrative intercourse. And his response was that he did not know if he was going to leave me. this was about eight months ago but things are generally along the lines of that whenever I get hurt by something. He just isn’t really good at reassurance and I try not to hold it against him but sometimes it does hurt when I genuinely need reassurance and I don’t really get what I need and have to walk someone through how to reassure me while I am already struggling and then none of the reassurance feels genuine.

Me: [22m algerian]
We’ve been together for over a year and other than some small issues we’ve been doing really good except for this one big “fight” we had about our future kids she’s scared that they will take more from me and my religion and I told her that the religion stuff is non negociable and that I’ll teach them all about it. 
We fought for like a day and then we’ve been good (3 weeks ago).
She’s been doing a semester long project with 3 other guys and a couple days ago she told me that one guy in their team is really flirty with her and that she hated it and made her inconfortable, I told her to just ignore him until their oral is done and then she will never see him ever again.
2 days ago I was at her place and literally everything was good, she was begging me to sleep at her place that night but I had to go back to my parents house. when I was about to leave to go back to my place, i went to check the guy that was flirty with her instagram’s account and found out they follow each other I confronted her about it and told her that was weird and disrespectful, and that she didn’t have to follow him back. I’ve been cold with her for like a day and then we fixed the issue later and both apologized. That same night she went to eat with our common friend (girl) and she came to pick me up from work. I felt something was weird and she stated telling me that she loves me so much but is soooo scared of the future together and our differences that she wanted to stop the relationship. 
We talked and cried all night ( I slept with her) and I for the first time in a year I told her how much she meant to me and how much I love her and that I can do anything to keep this going.
The morning after she told me that it’s fine and we can try again. She dropped me at school and when I was done I went to her place and she was crying and telling me how much she loved me but want to be alone for now.
I cried and pleaded my case to her for several hours and she eneded up telling me that she will take a couple days alone without talking too much and we will try to fix this in a couple days.
I am so lost right now and I’ve been crying my whole body out in a parking for 3 hours (since i left her place)

Currently in a relationship with a woman who has an ex-bf died just last August,2021. We became a couple July of this year. We're colleagues.

I know, it's crazy. I'm the one who's always thinking negatively. I know, she loves me so much. I'd never had someone like her before. She's very out of my league. Beautiful, kind-hearted, loving daughter and sister, outgoing and clever. While me, looks like a potato, too much of being introvert and workaholic. Most of my exes cheated on me (they said the reason is that, I'm too kind lol) and I'm an overthinker. But she always assuring me that she loves me and the only one in her life.

Started to overthink like a month after we became official. I still see her and her ex-bf's photo in her wallet but it's really hidden like under the pic of us. She's not yet deleting their featured photos in fb.

Tbh, I'm not legal yet on her side 'cause this is the first time that she's into a same sex relationship. She don't have the guts yet to tell it to her mom.

One other thing, we talked about miscarriage and abt women's period. She asked me if it's okay if she'll say something abt her. Then I said, ""Yea, yea, ofc. Anything."" Then she told me, ""I think, before *name of ex-bf* got sick and died, I got pregnant. 'Cause I'm delayed for 2 weeks and then I got morning sickness. But I never did a PT. Then after he died, like a week, I got a clump of blood on my undies. Possible that I'm pregnant and since I'm stressed bcs of losing him, I lost someone too inside me."" I'm just listening to her. Don't know what to feel.

But, the thing I felt when I heard that, sadness. Imagine, being madly inlove with each other, almost there to create a family and then boom, Lord took him away from her. It's really unfair huh.

After that, every time I go to bed, I can't stop thinking about it. There are so many what ifs in my mind. I almost wish to travel back time and stop him from dying. So that, she'll have a family that she wanted.

I love her. I really do. I opened this up with my few friends and they just got mad at me. They said, I'm the only one who's putting that negative thought in my head. I'm the one who's causing myself to overthink the situation. My friends told me that my gf loves me and theg can see it. No need for me to think about her past.

Right now, I'm actually crying and think about them. What our life would be if he didn't die. One thing I'm sure of, she already has a family and very happy. Me? Ofc, working my as* off as usual hahahaha. No loving partner and keep on being cold to mf btchs around me.

My (31) now ex (35) only interacted twice since the incident that happened when she tried to fight my niece.

Yesterday she messaged me accusing me of breaking her dresser we put in storage. I took the drawers out but i guess she couldn't figure out how to put it together. I'm assuming she broke it. 

But she messaged me cussing me out about how it costs her 1500 and thatI'mm mad about what happened with my family but she'smadderd about this. Which ticked me off. I told her I'm busy right now butIi would go check her dresser out and fix it 🙄

We stopped talking right after. Then on Faceboo,k she's cussing people out and saying she's going to block all her fake friends. I'm with my friend at the time and I tell them that I think my girlfriend was drunk again and going off on everyone. 

At2 amm Igott comfortable in bed and she messaged me saying ""Idon'tt want to see you anymore"" and blocks me. I try calling cause she has my stuff. No answer.

So I message her onTikTokk and I'm like ""Hey, if this is what you want then do you. But I need my 1k laptop back, my bose headphones and all the other stuff I left at your place""

She sends me laughing emojis saying why am i still messaging her. I tell her I just need my stuff back and I'd call the police if I have to. This led us to argue back and forth and finally her father says he'll meet me in the morning to give me my stuff.

I got only half my stuff back (just the laptop and a gaming console). They still got my clothes, my headphones and a bunch of games i left there. 

The father said she's been drunk all week going off everyone and that he's leaving in February and she has until then to figure out where she's going to go.

Makes me feel bad cause she's got two whole kids. But fuck, she wants to continue the cycle of self-destruction , thats on her. I can't save everyone.

My friend thinks she did this because i told her I need her to work on herself and maybe give up alcohol. 

I still need to go back to get the rest of my stuff and drop off her stuff. But I dont want to see her.

Long story short, leading up to the breakup, the last few months were just bad in terms of our communication and that led to us giving each other the silent treatment and making each other feel shitty. Im the one who ended up breaking up with her and because she felt similar ways as I did, the breakup felt a little mutual. We live together but have a 2 bedroom 2 bath so we’re able to split up our space quite well. Plus there was still like 9 months left on the lease with it costing us 4K to break the lease so we just said we’d be fine continuing to live together until the lease is up. Now the first 2 weeks we like didn’t talk to each other at all. Then we slowly started sleeping together again here and there. We’d still go days without talking to each other but still sleep together here and there. 
I mainly broke up with her because I wanted to work on myself (the communication, etc) and to have some independence (we were together 3 and a half years). I was independent and living my life for the first 2-3 months there and I really got to thinking about how I want to fix the relationship and get back together. And how the independent life wasn’t what I really wanted after all. Unfortunately during this time, she has started to move on. Now I tried in forms of letter, and deep emotional conversations to win her back and try hard to get back together. But she’s made it clear that right now in life she’s just trying to figure herself out. And I can’t be mad at her, im so incredibly happy for her to be figuring out what I know she’s been wanting to figure out for sometime. But im left heartbroken, knowing I fumbled the bag on the woman I love with all of my heart still. But continuing to root for her as she finds herself. But living together has been making the ‘moving on part’ pretty hard for me. I try to distract myself with a new job (I got laid off a couple weeks ago and that definitely made everything harder but I’ve got a new job and am eager to begin that new chapter). I try to distract myself with friends and the new COD and my favorite hobby of football. But nothing has helped. I don’t want to move on. I love her so much and to know that every Friday night she goes out and does her thing kills me so bad inside. I haven’t had the motivation to go out in weeks or even go on tinder or anything like that. But even though I’ve come close to giving up, I know I can’t. I need to survive until May until this lease is up. So I ask you people of Reddit, as someone in my shitty position, what are the best ways to move on? I need genuine advice because I know I have no other choice but to move on at this point. For her and for myself.

All good. Incredible time. Every day together.
 Three weeks before the ends I started getting a bit mental over her past (not my business) but did my best to quit that mood. In the meantime due to general stress I got genital herpes symptoms (it took 2 weeks before getting it diagnosed). During the last week my stress went places (sick, no sleep, medication) and we had a bad convo about different opinions about our future (kids related)- I thought I was wasting time as the only plan she had was ""I like to be with you"" (considering she already had grown up kids, that also don't like me). I managed, in a couple of days, to made up my mind and choose her but was too late.
She exploded and started throwing up all in a sudden all the things she didn't like.about me, things that happened in the past and for which I never had any suspect. She  dumped me with few words and no proper explanation.
Different  explanations came in the week after breakup when I was trying to figure out what happened: 1) it was my body language; 2) she didn't want the stress (she had already bad relationships in life) of our relationship among the other things and wants to stay alone to do her stuff.
I tried to understand better to fix the issue and told her that ""I was expecting at least a chat to fix things instead of exploding"".
She blames me and think it was my fault to not give her space, when in reality she is the one that gave up her time and hobby to stay all the time with me in a unhealthy way and then got stressed and exploded. I tried to highlight this, saying she could have talked and we could have sorted it together but she said she doesn't feel anything anymore and she doesn't seem to be able to see my point.
She told me she won't speak or see me again, but she keeps sending me videos about the fact that what she did was right and the horoscope supports her.

Why she keeps sending me stuff despite saying she won't speak to me anymore? What is the benefit? Not sure if she wants to go back but she is scared to take the risk?

She said that she doesn’t accept them from guys who are making advances, but accepts them from men who are only being friendly, even after she says she has a boyfriend. 

I pointed out how it’s giving men a glimmer of hope of something happening by accepting the drink and that I’d rather her not do it as it makes me uncomfortable thinking that a guy believes he has a chance with my girlfriend. She said it was purely a financial thing to save money and she never seeks it out, only if someone is non flirty and friendly buys her a drink, to which I replied that if £10/£20 saving is worth it over making me feel uncomfortable then it’s not a good saving.

She said that she feels like I don’t trust her to turn down men’s advances but I don’t have a problem with her friendly talking to people, I just feel that them buying her a drink crosses a threshold that she’s enabling and it makes me feel rubbish.

We still disagree but to save further arguing, I said that I understand it’s part of a night out for her and her friends and asked if she’d just tell me if it happens in the future.

I have been friends with someone who I will call G. G and I are in our late 20’s to early 30’s. I would say that G is a slightly toxic friend, but we’ve had enough good times that I’ve been able to ignore it. However, it’s getting to the point where I am not sure how to handle him anymore. To further explain, he was a good friend to me in a lot of ways, someone who has been there during my lowest lows and also we had lots of good times together in the past. We used to play D&amp;D together and I used to come over to his house a lot to watch movies together. However, I have noticed that he doesn’t have the healthiest views on life. He came from a past where he spent years homeless, lived in a crack house where all of his friends died from overdose. His mom died from an early age. He has been friends with the same people for more than 10 years, and I know all of these people very closely and personally. I had to cut out most of them because I found their behavior to be unacceptable. A father who does drugs, gets drunk, and gets on his motorcycle at 4 am, also while leaving his young daughter at home with his parents so that he could recover from the 24 hour hangover that resulted. A girl who cheats on her girlfriend by using one of the friends from the group. These were typical occurrences that you could expect from these people and while they were fun party people, they were shit people and I didn’t need it. Again, not everyone was terrible but most of them were.

In total, G lost about 15 people to random accidents, suicide, and OD. He has lots of pain and trauma that he has never truly dealt with, so he comes off in an insensitive manner a lot of times. He deals with his own emotions by stuffing them down, it is what he has always done, so he forgets that other people have feelings and sensitivity. At times, he can be judgmental and condescending, which hurts my self esteem. He can be downright manipulative to get free food or hangout. He has a low opinion of other people and believes that his own rationale is better than everyone else based on dealing with crappy people for most of his life.  Because he is the least toxic person in his life, and being surrounded by a lot of bad apples, he is the best person for his friends to come to for emotional support. He has a lot of friends that talk to him about their emotional lives but I’m not totally confident that his advice is healthy. 

It’s the equivalent of a bad therapist to me. I often wonder what can make someone manipulative and judgmental, and I think it’s entitlement/ego. He feels “entitled” to getting his way a lot and ignores boundaries. He doesn’t understand why boundaries exist because his emotional side is suppressed. He wants to push people’s boundaries to see if they will abandon him, so part of it is on purpose. 

I have a couple of close healthy friendships that I am happy with. I just cut out one of my friends for being too toxic, there were red flags all over the place; and I’d rather not cut him out too. I was hoping someone could offer me advice on how to communicate with him when he is being judgmental and condescending, and get him to drop the attitude and be kinder. It’s so hard to get through to him sometimes because he is so damaged and hardened. We have had so many heated arguments about the way he speaks to me, I would say every 5th time I talk to him, I have to remind him not to talk down to me.  I don’t want to be his friend that he looks down on. I’ve specifically verbalized this to him, and sometimes I get through to him so it gives me hope. It just sucks having to explain why negatively judging me is hurtful and wrong.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7593957,public,self,help with a condescending friend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yztllw/help_with_a_condescending_friend/,all_ads,6,,

It doesn’t have to be overtly sexual. But I do like intimate contact day to day, outside of sex. And intimate exchanges, like flirting or sweet nothings. 


I get more looks when I’m out clothed than I do from my boyfriend when I’m in lingerie or something sexy. Showering and getting ready I understand, on the weekends we stay together (we’ve have dating for a little over year, in august he moved 2.5 hours away for school), we shower and have our little routines and there’s nothing really exciting about each other’s naked bodies in those moments. 


But while he’s driving he doesn’t hold my hand (he’s used to driving a stick and even though he’s been driving an automatic for over 6 months now, he prefers to keep his hand on the center console or his lap than with mine). He doesn’t hold my hand when we’re out. He doesn’t place his hand on my thighs, waist, butt even when we’re cuddling or sitting down next to each other watching a movie or lying down in bed. He doesn’t touch my hair or face. He only kissed me hello and goodbye or as a precursor to sex. He only makes out with me as a precursor to sex. 


He rarely compliments me and it’s always something kind of fake sounding and cutesy, like about my hair or outfit or something “oh you look so nice! i like your outfit/hair” in like a little cutesy voice. Yes, it is cute when he says that and it doesn’t bother me, I do the same to him. But I also tell him that he looks hot or how a certain part of his body looks nice. I’m specific. I’m flirty, and I’m sincere, and I’m not afraid to say it sexually casually. 


I’ve talked to him about how important intimacy and touch and flirtation is to me. I can’t complain about how he’s tried. He does try to kiss me more but it’s just… missing something. I can feel it in his lips and ruthenium and movement he’s just not into it. I’ve never ever ever seen him look at me other than from the neck up. Even at the beach. 


He’s recently admitted a pretty intense porn habit and has wanted me to ask him every day if he’s watched it, to support him in trying to break it, because after about five times of telling him I felt he was overtly ignoring my needs, it finally clicked for him. I am really proud of him. But honestly I don’t think this is the answer to everything.  


He never flirted with me before we started dating, after we started going on dates or after we became a couple. He knows how to flirt and he’s had flings with other girls before me. I asked him out. He said he didn’t make any moves (other than asking if I wanted to hang out and inviting me over to his place, but according to him that was just as friends and he didn’t know if he liked me at that point) because he was afraid of rejection. After talking to him about only saying compelled platonic things to each other unless we were explicitly talking about sec, he said he thought flirting was only to get each other’s attention pre-relationship. He said he understands now, but nothing. 


I feel guilty because I’ve been trying to focus on the progress and not the negatives, but I’ve been dating him for over a year now and he has never once called me beautiful or sexy or anything attractive or sensual without me saying something about it, only “assure” me. It’s embarrassing (and humbling) when I mention it but i feel like I have to communicate to him how I feel. 


But now I feel like maybe I should change my approach, maybe I shouldn’t basically get on my hands and needs and practically bed g for attention, but maybe I should try to get some sort of spark elicited within him from my actions?

Despite the way I've described that, I'm 100% certain it's a joke and that she's not crazy because we hang out just fine, she doesn't hate me, she always laughs after saying the thing, and I think it's kind of nice. Now, I recognize it's kind of an unfunny joke, so, if you're going to tell me that she's very unfunny, that's fine, I guess. But I enjoy it.

But onto the actual point of this: Is this flirting?

I haven't flirted with anyone before, but when I described this to a different friend, she told me I was being flirted with. I'm not really sure this is the case, I've hung out with this person a couple of times and I'm not sure I've received any other signals that this was the case. But, then again, maybe I don't know what I'm looking for. I also feel like I've had friendly versions of dynamics like this before, where me and a friend will behave jokingly antagonistic towards each other, so maybe she just thinks of me as a good friend. I've just recently realized that this dynamic is maybe not as typical as I'd initially thought, and I'm kinda re-evaluating this friendship a little bit, and I want to know if I am, in fact, being flirted with.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7593945,public,self,I (20M) and a friend (19F) have a jokey antagonistic dynamic and I'm not sure if it's flirting or not?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yztjo0/i_20m_and_a_friend_19f_have_a_jokey_antagonistic/,all_ads,6,,

For context we have been together six years and my fiancé has never cheated on anyone, to my knowledge. And everyone knows him as the loyal to a fault guy but this situation is so messed up. 
Our relationship was a secret for the first two years and he said that entire time that he would leave me for his ex, the mother of his child if she wanted him. When he was alone in her bedroom, he read her diary and found out she was sleeping with afew different guys and he got so angry, more angry than I have ever seen him. After that incident we werent a secret anymore. 
I also caught him watching porn afew times (I dont allow that in my relationships and I told him as much and that I would understand if he wanted to break up because everyone has different opinions) he promised he wouldnt but I caught him afew more times after that but he kept on lying saying he didnt watch it or he was looking at ads or other BS like that.

Okay context over, I was cleaning our room when I moved a bag, full of other bags and tied up tight, out from behind our TV cabinet. Well underneath the bag was a pair of dirty womens navy blue underwear size 2XL. 

I wear a medium and literally only own black or floral underwear. I also dont allow people in my room for more than five minutes and only with the door open because of privacy etc and I dont know anyone (aside from two of his exs) that fit 2XL

So I calmly sat him down understanding that this may be some weird thing happening that these somehow ended up stashed behind the TV somehow and asked him if he knew why they were in our room. He immediately flipped out and started repeatedly saying that maybe I did it for all he knew and I slept with someone and hid them, also that he shouldnt have to defend himself or get in trouble for something he didnt do, he got really angry. He actually yelled at me to fuck off which he has never ever done. He also said ""now look what youve done, weve gone back three steps because of this"" meaning about the lost trust the porn and lying caused. He also kept saying im just being paranoid. He tried to take the underwear saying he wanted to throw them away and I said no (I dont know why I dont want to throw them away) he said, basically yelling, why are you holding onto this??? Just drop it I didnt do anything. 

When I said his behaviour was really strange and I feel like he might be lying he said because hes autistic his body language is wrong. He said he wouldnt pass a lie detector test even if he was telling the truth because hes autistic. It kind of sounds like an excuse to me? 

I dont know what to do or think. This all happened yesterday and Ive just been acting like nothing happened. I cried myself to sleep last night and had nightmares about it. 

What am I supposed to think or do? This is so hard for me. I cant act upset or he will get angry and I cant talk to him about it for the same reason.

And I cant be angry because what if this is all coincidence and they ended up their for some weird reason and he was acting weird for no reason.

Help me please? Thank you if you read this all

I think we have quite an unique relationship with lots of ups and down, lately this has transformed into this weird loop. We go from never talking to each other, to hugging and taking random pictures together while drunk. 

The thing that has motivated me to write this post is the way she has treated me recently around other men. I always play dumb but I know she has used me to make other men jealous or even to avoid other men who in one situation was a really close friend of mine, which caused a bad moment.

 If im being honest when I was younger I used to have a huge crush on her so looking back on it, it made the relationship really unbalanced as I  was constantly doing everything she wanted of me. This thing is something that happens even to this day, tho im not into her that way anymore. I always cave into whatever she wants which also makes me recent her a little bit.

I am really fond of her but if im being honest, she makes me feel really emasculated sometimes.

My son and I were sick early in the week so we came home and had a fairly lazy afternoon but had wanted to get some things ready for the holidays and do some more basketball practice.  

At 3pm, my husband was not home for the college football game we had planned on watching. I called him and he said he was still with his cousin.  I asked when he was coming back and he said he needed to go see his friend to help him set up his website then he'd be home.  7pm comes along and he's not even answering his phone.  I figured he'd be home for dinner?

At 8pm, I call him and he's finally going to his friend's house to help with the website.  I tell him that I thought it was late and that I had no idea he was going to be gone all day.  He starts yelling at me about how he doesn't need to check in and he's trying to make money for his friend and for us and that I need to stop assuming he's cheating.

Cheating? I was planning family time because our daughter was home from college and he hadn't communicated at all about today. I asked him if his cousin's girlfriend's best friend was at the brunch, we'll call her Jen, and he said she was (continuing to yell) and I told him this was the 4th time he's hung out with her,  drank too much then treated me like crap by yelling at me, telling me he doesn't need to check in and suddenly not being the person I recognize from our decades long relationship.  Very polarizing treatment almost every time he's hung out with her and I don't know why. 
I don't try to jump to cheating or attraction but he definitely did and now I feel like my instinct is telling me there is more that he's not telling me about.  I really don't understand why he gets so defensive (and drunk) over this one person?
Maybe it's not her but I don't think I'm unreasonable to expect better communication as to what he's doing all day.  I told him what I needed help with - and I've not been well this week. I also just started a 9 month long tech program 2 weeks ago and this week he decided he's going to finally start his own Ad agency which I have been supportive of him doing for years. So instead of me studying I have been doing all the cooking, cleaning and kid stuff so he can work late in the home office.  I don't mind helping out but I do have a ton of work I've put off from being sick and no l now he's treating me more like the maid.

It was a pretty intense relationship from the start and we moved in together a few months after dating, but we had known each other for about a year as friends. 

As soon as she moved in, it was like a switch flipped and she was a completely different person. It seemed as though everything I did was wrong in some way, and I found myself slowly retreating into myself. One time I left an encouraging note in her pack that she took to work, just saying ""Have a great day! I love you!"", And she came home to let me know it stressed her out because it was too overbearing.  If I would pull back a bit, she would complain that I didn't seem to care about her. One time she just flat out told me that I bored her. Eventually it got to the point where I felt like I was having waves of anxiety when I would hear the door opening as she came home from work. I just knew that I was going to greet her wrong or do something to upset her. Nothing was ever physical, but I just felt slowly like my personality was being slowly erased. A lot of times I would lay next to her quietly crying and trying not to wake her. 

The crazy thing is that I'm a pretty strong willed person. I'm usually the one in my friend group that speaks up or people come to for advice. My friends were pretty surprised when they heard how things were between us. I don't know why I didn't leave. Eventually, she came home one day and told me she was moving out. And she did that weekend. I felt so relieved but at the same time I felt so overwhelmingly empty, I had a panic attack.  And yet I still got back together with her when she apologized a month later. It finally ended for good 7 months ago.

I guess a workplace romance is normal right? It almost seems mutual at times.  She used to ask me to stay after my shift to talk to her and we'd talk in the parking lot if the conversation went over our shift. 
This included her texting me outside of work, paragraphs of stuff from her at times. SOmetimes to vent about work and shed open up about personal issues. We even one day started talking about if we agreed on the subjects of religion and politics and we talked about hobbies. She invited me over one time, although she invited me privately in person at work, but abrubtly cancelled as i was headed to her.

My friends said her behavior around me changed after that. She'd get upset if I didn't come around her desk to see her or if I didn't come talk to her when she called me. More so my other female friends started making comments about how she seemed jealous and upset if she saw me talking to said friends. She then became sort of childish and would text me assuming i was mad and then being like ""so i guess youre mad"". Even getting in my way at work and saying my full name in a strange way and she'd smirk like she was proud of herself.

She went out of her way to come up to me to tell me shes having a hard time and was struggling with her life at the moment. We texted briefly when I was on vacation. Nothing serious. But then when I came back, I saw her looking for me and when she saw me, she literally ran to get ahead of me. She was very excited to see me. She asked me if I was at work earlier, cause she heard me calling her name. I said I wasn't at work, but I was gone for two weeks and now she's hearing my voice, she clearly missed me, and she just laughed it off, and said I must have been in and just messing with her.

She's gone out of her way to be around me whenever she could since then. My friends said that she clearly has some kind thing for me. They said she's waiting for me to make a move.

Here's the thing. She's married. With 2 kids.

Part of what she would complain about was her husband and her relationship with her inlaws and her own parents. When she invited me over, it was when her husband would be at work, and her kids in school. She always talks positivly about her marriage and kids, although she mentioned tension caused by her husband's ex and a daugher he had with her.. But everything in how she acted has really confused me. My friends say it was obvious she wanted to cheat, but got cold feet.

They are an angry person naturally- it’s kinda their baseline- which means if anything pisses them off instead of gradually getting angry and being able to control it they snap all at once. It can and has been verbally abusive. And nothing I can do can quell their anger( I’ve tried EVERYTHING) and it’s resulted in me getting resentful and snapping back, and I think I’ve become abusive in the process. It all came to a head today when they tried to share how they were feeling and I had a panic attack due to the nature of the conversation. They felt like I was punishing them for having feelings, and they went OFF on me. I didn’t fight this time. I just sat there and sobbed and begged for them to stop and when they wouldn’t I begged for them to leave. They told me if I wanted them to leave, I should break up with them, so I said “okay, then we’re done, because I can’t do this.” And all at once they stopped. We had a long conversation, and they’ve already set up an appointment with their therapist to get help with their anger. I have always admired the person that they are because when they see a personal flaw they put in the work to fix it. But they hurt me, and I can’t be around while they try to fix this. I can’t handle being treated like this anymore, and even if they’re working on it progress isn’t linear and I can’t be the victim when they slip up.
So, what we’re doing is taking space for a couple days, they’re going to have therapy so they can talk about what the process of working on this will be and what the time frame could potentially look at to have a healthy relationship again, and then we’re going to decide from there if we should just call it and move on in a “whatever happens happens” way, or just take a break where we can both back up, work on ourselves, and probably be no contact for a couple months before trying again. 
That’s what we both want, but I guess my question for you guys is is that even a good idea or am I just trying to fool my emotions? I love them when they aren’t like this. They’re an incredible partner besides this. And I do believe they’re going to do the work because it’s truly for them- they set the therapy appointment up believing they’d never talk to me again.
I love them in a way I’ve never loved anyone.

On a throwaway account, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

A little while ago I matched with this person on Bumble, who I was instantly attracted to. We talked and clicked immediately. We connected on a lot of levels, such as life experiences, goals, sense of humour, causes we find important, etc. 

Naturally we met up, and it became very clear that her pictures were several years old, and in person she looked significantly different in a way I did not find physically attractive.

I don't consider myself superficial and we still had a lot of great connections so I wanted to give it a try since this is still someone who ticked almost every other box I was looking for. However, it's become apparent to me that I just don't have any real physical attraction to her and from our conversations about exercise and attitudes to such, she has no intention or desire to try.

For reference I used to be significantly overweight in my early to mid 20's, weighing around 110kg at my heaviest. In the last few years I've gotten to enjoy exercise, and am currently at 75-ish and am in otherwise good shape. I now consider my exercise to be a pretty important cornerstone of my self-care, as I have noticed many benefits to my quality of life since taking control of things in this way.

I unfortunately feel I can't stay in a relationship where I don't have a physical desire for my partner, as the physical side is very important to me and how I express feelings; however asking her to change something like this would be unfair in the extreme and likely just make things worse down the line anyway.

So naturally that means I have to end it, but I know that the first thing will be asked is why, and I don't know how to phrase it in a way that won't be hurtful to some degree. I don't plan on being hurtful obviously, but just the nature of the issue is likely to cause hurt regardless.

In depth conversations and everything over phone calls and texting, she was talking about wanting to steal an animal and other kind of serious stuff. She was always very happy to talk to me but it changed yesterday. 

I’ll give a bit of background. She lives in the same small town (3000 people) as me, and I added her on SnapChat said hello, all the normal stuff. Anyway, about 2 weeks ago she went to New Zealand with her family for a visit to some relatives. That’s all good, but yesterday she started acting really strange. Basically around 8pm my time (10pm for her) she called me, I didn’t answer because I was eating dinner, then she sent me a message saying she’s “divorcing me”. I called her back 10 mins later and we spoke for about 25 mins, she was fine during the call, a little quiet, and she was with a family friend. Anyway, she then hung up on me really abruptly and after the call my conversations with her completely back flipped. She used to talk to me and give in depth answers but after the call she couldn’t muster up more than 1 word sentences. I was worried I made her uncomfortable so I sent her a message in the morning that said “I’m sorry if you thought I was a bit rude during the call yesterday, I was paying attention to you but I was playing a game too.” She then replied “I didn’t, it’s fine.” Then she blocked me?

She is really special to me. We have been talking every day for the last year and we enjoy each other's presence a lot. We can text and call each other for hours at a time. For the last year, it has been routine for us to share our day with each other. Even when she went on vacation, we still talked to each other. There have been a lot of ups and downs but we have managed to make it work for the last year. She is a little bit shy and more on the introverted side just like me and we are very similar.

She moved to college last month it has been quite difficult for her to make close friends there. Last month, she became friends with this girl (let's call her Sophia). They have been good friends for the last 2 months and everything has been going well. It is a big deal because it is hard for her to make friends. I would ask about things in her life in detail like what she had for dinner, what she did with her friends, etc. Sometimes, I would ask questions about her friends in detail as well.

The problem started last week when her friend (Sophia) went through my online friend's phone and went through her messages. She looked up her name and found that her name (Sophia) was mentioned in our convos a lot. For instance, I asked how many guys did (Sophia) make out with at the party last night. Stuff like that. We both agreed that we didn't say anything offensive. When she found out that her name was mentioned in our convos many times, she felt disgusted.

It has been a week since it happened. Sophia thought about it for a week and decided today that she didn't want to be friends anymore because of it. I feel really bad because this happened. My online friend has been crying and feeling sad recently. She said she needed some space and want to isolate herself for a while. I don't know what to do. I offered to help her apologize but she said it was too late and Sophia clearly stated that she doesn't want to be friends. I am really worried about her.

Have known each other since way back though about a decade back. So far she's been (to my knowledge) loyal and faithful and I have no reason to question that. It's more about my own feelings of jealousy and insecurity about her having a new guy friend. 

A little bit of backstory though to explain why I think I feel the way I do. This is like a super abridged version going over the important bits. 

The way we got into our relationship was rocky, in the sense that she had been seeing someone else and in a relationship when her and I (re)met two years ago during the height of Covid. Her current relationship at that time had been failing pretty hard and the guy left her literally to go to another country. So she's had a lot of trauma and issues with that part of her life in that relationship. I was nothing but supportive and listening. 

We talked a lot. Every day for hours. Just catching up and getting to know each other again after so many years. During this she actually had gone to the country to where her (pseudo-ex) went, to get a medical procedure done that had already been in the works, although she got extremely sick there and didn't get back for months later than her original return time. During all this again I was supportive and attentive to her, and we began to develop emotional connections and that became something more romantic as time went on. 

Eventually she came back to the states and we were physically intimate and things progressed further from there as far as our relationship. Regarding her now ex, she never officially cut it off with him but he had a very toxic dynamic toward her in terms of lack of communication and such so it was pretty settled that he was out of the picture and not coming back into her life romantically. She was done with him. 

Enter this year. Earlier this year we were engaged and things seemed to be ok, however after her coming back she entered into a management position at a job that was/is absolutely terrible for her mental and physical health. She's already been someone that deals with a lot of medical health issues I cannot go into here, but suffice it to say that extreme stress and anxiety and chronic lack of sleep (I'm talking sometimes 4 hours max for months on end) have been common for her for the past year or so. It's been extremely rough for both of us because I want to be there and helpful but there's only so much that can be done. The job she had made her health 100x worse and just this month she was able to leave it. 

Because of this we barely have had time for dates or just to feel ""normal"" together. Earlier this month we also were impacted by severe weather events and I lost the home I was in, resulting in her and I sharing her apartment space while I look for a new place. More stress added overall. During all this, she connected with this guy friend whom I believe was a friend of her sister. They talked a lot online to my knowledge and she's hung out with him twice. She swears up and down she's not attracted to him at all and doesn't see him that way, only as a friend and that she's been sorely lacking a friendship connection for a while. 

Now comes up the current timeframe. her previous medical trip out of the country wasn't completely finished and she has to go back again, where she will once again be staying in the same house as her ex, this time for two months. She leaves in a few days, and thus far it's been hectic last minute stress getting work taken care of so she can leave her management position completely. According to her she really has no time / is short on time to get everything done. 

Except... suddenly yesterday she drops the info that she's made plans to hang out with this guy friend tonight, even though there's apparently ""no time"", because she feels bad that she's skipped out on so many other times she's told him Before that they'd hang out and never did (it's been months since they last hung out). 

This combined with the fact she's going to be in another country with her ex for two months, making memories with other guys, while our relationship has suffered a lot of stress due to work and basically a year without any dates for ourselves or just getting to progress our relationship together past the ""were just trying to survive life right now"", has me severely irritated and upset.

Let me start this off by describing my relationship with them. I'm their friend. They are both really nice, and I have never had any problems with either of them. We met a few months ago and we regularly hang out together.

  
They've been together for 2 years, and seem like a very happy couple, but there was something slightly off about it. 23F never paid much attention to me, so I mostly interacted with 26M. Eventually, 23F sends me a text. As it turns out, 26M is insanely paranoid of her cheating on him. Of course.

  
She breaks down to me about how she never gets to have any friends, or is able to interact with anyone besides him ever (or without his supervision). He doesn't let her. He always knows where she is, which I suppose could be standard for some relationships, but in this particular case it feels toxic. He uses his past as a shield if she ever gets angry about it, and threatens to break up with her. (He has been cheated on in the past) When she hugged me one time, she told me how upset he was with her after I had left, and made her feel guilty about it.

  
 I feel really conflicted here, as I enjoy both of their company and respect them both as a person. However, this information really angered me. She is one of the sweetest people you'd ever meet, and knowing how unhappy she was about this really ticked me off. Everything started to make sense. The fact that he would almost never leave the area if me and her were in it, and if he did it was extremely briefly and we were never allowed to be separated from him. She was able to be on her own just fine if it was me and him though.

  
She told me she wanted to hold my hand the next time we all hung out, which shocked me a bit because of how distant she has always been with me. Despite this, I said yes to cheer her up, because of how sad she was telling me. It should be noted, that 26M never showed any sign of this behavior except a few odd glances here and there when she would rarely talk to me.

We had little moments like this in secret, we'd catch each others eyes in a glance and both smile at each other, etc. We barely get any time to ourselves, as there is always an excuse for me not to show up if he is busy while she is not (He would tell me one thing and her another). Just little moments. A few more weeks pass and she starts telling me how much she likes me and how she wishes things weren't so complicated so we could be together.   


Maybe my title is misleading. I don't know how to tell her that her relationship isn't healthy, and it can't be sustainable or good for her health. First of all, I can't say this because its a conflict of interest. It sounds fake coming from me because obviously I want to be with her instead. Yet, on the other hand, everything that I want to say is completely true. Unless maybe it isn't. You guys tell me (In terms of am I just stupid?). What should be done here? I can't do anything, I can't just enact my will upon their relationship, it isn't right.  


Maybe this is more suited to r/AmItheAsshole, but I am not looking for my own validation. I just want her to be happy.

There is one thing that scares me though and that's the fact that my boyfriend seems to have no idea what it means to clean. I realized this when I got the feeling that maybe I was putting more effort into the upkeep of the house than he was, and so I decided to stop cleaning for a few days and see if he would pick up the slack. well, what I noticed is that he does next to no cleaning at all as the house quickly fell into chaos. what's worse is that he seemed to be completely fine with how messy the house was (dirty clothes everywhere, trash all over the place, ect.). I tried to have a conversation about it with him and asked him to please be more mindful with helping around the house/ taking care of his own mess and he agreed he would. however, I didn't notice any change at all in the next few weeks. it started to feel like I was a mom picking up after her adult kid, and it's hard for me to have the motivation to clean knowing I'm picking up all my boyfriends mess. I've had this conversation with him three times now and this morning I expressed how stressed I was that the house was a mess and there were a lot of chores to get done. he offered to clean the house during the day while I went to my mom's to do laundry. I was so relieved that he would offer and i came home tonight excited that I wouldn't have to worry about having a messy house, but when I walked in the door it looked almost the same as when I left. there was still trash and dirty dishes and stuff on the floor. i asked him if he had forgotten to clean and he said that he HAD cleaned.

Last saturday I showed him one example of the video. And told him I got more information to add for the project. But it wasn't in the language required. He told me he would translate it and send me the audios for the vídeo. 

This Monday I told him I was starting to feel sick but not that much. Tuesday finally he told me the he got confused with the information I gave him so he restarted big part of the project without telling me until that day (last day to present the video). I told him what we could do to gain more time before we ended up having 0. 

Sadly I was already overworked. So my body wasn't able to handle the illness. That same morning I ended up going home because how bad I felt. Unfortunately my internet stopped working. So I wasn't able to communicate with him. Plus I went to the doctor and he told me I could have COVID so I should isolate myself. I couldn't go to Starbucks and have some internet just for a grade. Knowing I could be infecting everyone else. It would be a selfish decision.

I don't remember when. But one friend we have in common called me. Because she saw the message she was sending weren't delivering. She is his best friend. And I know they communicate everything with each other. 

Until Thursday my internet started working again. So quickly I communicated with him. And he told me he already presented the video that day. I felt like shit. He told me the teacher doesn't know how he would grade me because I don't appear in the video. He told me he was ""sorry..."".. I just told him I wouldn't punished him like a child if he expected that. (I know is a weird response I was in shock at the moment)

My grades are now low because of the terrible grade I got. And I won't be able to recover because it was the final of this trimester. I don't know how to approche him anymore. He acts like he just did something silly. Nothing important.

I have a part-time delivery job 3 or 4 days aweek 5 or 7 hours a shift i try do a weekend shift because it makes more money and 2 shift  during the week and I'm doing a farming course which  is 6 hours Monday  to Friday and sometimes  I do extra hours because sometimes they are short stuffed and need milkers and I have to pick my boyfriend up after work so I'm up from 5am to 10pm every day it's non stop it's always job after job. I try to help mum with her air bnb and clean the house and her work place if she needs help and we both do the grounds. I don't to drugs and I have cut down on the alcohol since I turned 19 and I don't go out to night clubs or parties I don't smoke I feel like I do my part around  the place and what she has asked of me 

So the plan is when my boyfriend moves out apply to milking jobs with accommodation that with allow me to bring my dog which  I know there will be dramas over but I can't leave him he's my whole world and he is 12yr old so he's old
And move away even if it's the next town over I need the change I need new people I am so anti social like I can't stand people like I have lost lots of friends  over the last 4 years which I think there is something mental wrong with me but I just think about what point in life I was at for them to end it like me getting a big job opportunity or a car stuff like  that or they do drugs and drink all the time anyway please pray for me I'm gonna need it",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7593830,public,self,I'm so unattractive to my boyfriend and ready to move out of my mother's,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzt6sf/im_so_unattractive_to_my_boyfriend_and_ready_to/,all_ads,6,,

Until few weeks ago, she pushed me into the pool. My phone broke because of that. Of course at the time I was mad. It's also my fault I didn't back up a lot of important contacts especially wedding related. She gave me money to get new phone which few days later I returned it back to her. Right after the incident, even when I'm wet, I still drove her back home. No, I wasn't talking much during the ride and most of thing running in my head is about how I'm gonna recover those contacts and basically just feeling miserable thinking about my wedding. 

The wedding is in three weeks, I have tried calling and texting, even ask some our mutual friends to contact her but no respond from her side. I know she's doing well with all the usual posts on her socmed. I just think it's unfair she acted this way that I got to deal with all the headaches and she chose to abandon our circle too. 

I can't help to think, this is all my fault on how I reacted that day as her word was ""like looking my best friend lost her only child"".

Very few women in their late 20s or early 30s are looking for this. So I found out I have more in common and a greater connection with younger women ages 18-21 who have more time and are more patient with someone who has no independence or experience.

I've made an observation from interacting with my classmates in college. I've made great friends, but I stop myself from taking any of them on dates knowing my age difference.
