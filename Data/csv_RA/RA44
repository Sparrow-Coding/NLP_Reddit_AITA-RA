I’ve caught feelings for this girl that I have been hanging out with. I will call her Jess. Jess and I usually text on Snapchat by sending pics with text on it.

And basically I found out that jess only snaps me still. So, I took this as a sign that she is interested in me and started to snap her more. We hung out a few times which usually ended in us hooking up. And at parties I always find myself ending up with her and hooking up. I think she is beautiful and we also share some interests like fashion books and self improvement. 

So, I told her how I felt towards her and she said that she used to have feelings for me but she got over them because she thinks I was just trying to fuck and then leave. 

So a few weeks went by of us talking and it was going no where so I told her that I think we are better off just hooking up. She said she’s cool with that and that’s where I’m at.

Me (28F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for 4 years. Recently my boyfriend contracted Covid and posted a social media story with a picture of a positive rapid test and caption about being stuck at home for 10 days. 

A few hours after he posted this story, the girlfriend of his close buddy sent him a dm and wrote ""I want covid"". For context, my boyfriend's buddy has been with this girl for 1.5 years and she and my partner do not talk, nor do they have any sort of interactions outside of the occasional group hangout. 

For months, my boyfriend had told me he felt a really weird vibe from her and that he's caught her staring at him on multiple occasions. He believed she was trying to give him the ""eyes"". I used to pass it off as funny, because I'd never witnessed it myself and she had only ever been nice to me in the brief times we had hung out as a group. He also wasn't sure if he was just being paranoid, so we'd oftentimes laugh it off...

Immediately after she sent my boyfriend this message, he screenshot it and called me. He feel his suspicions were confirmed. The message seemed to have been sent with the intention to be forward and to imply that she wanted to hook up. My boyfriend and I were shocked, especially because of how our boyfriends have been friends since childhood and how she had hung out with us as a couple and was pretty persistent in trying to build a friendship with me. I told my boyfriend that I don't feel comfortable with him being around her and we talked about whether he should tell his buddy. He agreed and gladly said he would unfollow her and that he has no problems with it. I'm unsure of what to do because I'm second guessing the intentions of her message and I don't know why! It's almost like I can't believe she would do something so hurtful and try and destroy a friendship and relationship (mine and hers). The boldness just seemed so risky to me,  that I'm having a hard time with unfollowing because I don't want there to be any confrontation or fallout between my boyfriend and his close friend?

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I'm not acting accordingly by ubfollowing her. I have a history of being too nice and avoiding conflict, which I'm trying to work on. I'm really not certain  what to do here.

SO yesterday i was hugging him in school and a teacher saw me and called me over so we can talk keep in mind him and the teacher are close and he told me basically that i should watch out so he doesnt play me and then everything went downhill.

To preface we have been together 8 months, there’s new things having happened since. Sorry I’m in mobile it’s the easiest way to get this up. I couldn’t process what I was seeing and watched he was just looking at regular selfies of her nothing with nudity etc. sending the girl likes on her story. To add to this he did this in MY BED at my apartment while I SLEPT. Anyhow back to the regularly scheduled trauma. I simply say “what are you doing?” to which he turns and let’s out a big sigh like he’s the one being disrespected. So I put my robe on and walk out of the room trying to process how I feel how I’m supposed to feel what he even did til I walk back in and sit on my bed. He says nothing to which I say “are you kidding why are you acting all silent?” Him “ because I knew how you would react, do you want me to leave?” Me “no? Just pretend everything is normal”. He goes to do his work and I just try to distract myself with everything I can do crying through all of it while he seems to not notice. Finally my mind snaps after asking him if he wants water and all he’ll breaks loose. I end up yelling and sobbing asking “why he would do this to me” for the most part to which his response is to the tune of: I just get these urges sometimes and I feel ashamed I did that and it’s disgusting. He tells me he wants to fix it and wants us to work so I agree to I guess work on things. I felt like I’d been sexually harassed or something to be honest. So yayyyyyy here we are to a fat second later I noticed after that talk he’s hellbent on hiding his phone, going to the bathroom a lot, and I wake to him on his phone in the middle of the night. 
I realized that I needed to know if he was doing it again. I made myself a promise to avoid going through my S/O’s phone at all costs after discovering I was being cheated on that way a few years back. Yet here I was I open his phone and discover he had bookmarked a promiscuous photo less than a workweek prior. I knew there was more and eventually I found a google photos app that I never saw on his screen. In it I find screenshots of tons of girls in bikinis, screen recordings of girls at I guess clubs dancing and twerking, as a cherry on top I realized these weren’t explore page or random girls there is a stack going back to when he was in high school and went to school with these girls. I felt so sick for them, for me. He was saving all of this without their consent or knowledge later I asked about a few just like out of the blue to which he admitted they were good friends. Gross. He isn’t sure if I went through his phone if he tried to confirm it he would expose himself seeing as the latest screenshot and record was less than a week after I caught him jerking off. Thanks for making it to the end of the story I haven’t been able to tell anyone because we agreed to keep our relationship issues private, unfortunately this is eating me alive and making me question if the person I thought he was existed.

English is not my first language please forgive any errors. I am currently a 21-year-old female married to my 31-year-old husband we will call him h we have five children together. Twin boys three years old, a two year old daughter, a one year old son and a newborn son just two weeks old. 

I am currently a stay at home mother If you check my profile you will see comments on a post explaining the situation. The trouble is that my husband is deeply insecure due to his divorce was first wife v. They have as far as I know one child together a 6-year-old girl. I adore her beyond measure I wish she was my child In fact if I could take her from her mother I would but legally I have no grounds. The child is well cared for and well loved by her mother. My husband good man that he is only gets to see her on holidays when we have family gatherings because his ex-wife married his older brother L when she left him because L makes more money.

 She comes over every holiday and every holiday tears me down. My cooking is pedestrian I hang out with junkies I'm a bad parent because I gave my children ethnically cuban Dominican names whereas her children are the Americanized for lack of other term names. And every year my husband just allows this because he has to see his daughter.

For the most part I take it on the chin. I never say a word and let her do whatever she's going to do as long as she doesn't cross boundaries with my children. When I do see my stepdaughter I kiss her I hold her I sing to her and I rock her  and last night when I was beginning Thanksgiving preparations she started on me again and again he allowed it.

I finally pulled him aside and asked him to please put her in her place. It's not the name calling I can't take it's the degrading. He told me that I had to be civil with his ex so he could see his daughter. I  agreed as it was in the best interest of the children but I'm ashamed to admit it didn't last long 

It was when she told my daughter m that she was going to grow up to be a baby factory just like me but I lost my temper and told her to get out of my house. He scolded me for losing my temper and told me that I'm an adult and I need to act like one. I broke down held him and told him that I would get his daughter back for him but if I had to my godfather is a lawyer and he would be willing more than willing even to help us file for a more suitable custody arrangement.

My husband became angry and said that all women were the same that I was only being kind to him to keep him providing for me. I lost my temper and told him I didn't want to hear about or care for his ex anymore and that unless it had something to do with his daughter I didn't want to hear her name in my house. He left and we haven't talked in 2 days.

I (M 22) entered my first proper relationship and we have been going strong for 9 months. I have found myself in a bad situation in life right now. I have no job and have been unemployed for a few months (no luck with applications), my physique has gone to shit along with my confidence and self esteem. I have basically become broke which does not help and am nowhere near the man i want to be right now. 

I cannot bring my full self to the relationship and I can see myself damaging the relationship even though I do not want to. Even small things like not wanting to meet with my partners friends because I struggle to meet people when I have become basically a bum and lost my confidence.

Me and my partner love each other unbelievably and my partner has been so patient with every time I have acted negatively in the relationship. Currently we are on a break (even though I don’t believe breaks to be good) but my partner did not want to lose me.

I have come to the realisation that I need a good few months to get my house in order, if it was a few small issues then I could do it while in a relationship, but I believe in giving a relationship my all and only want to do it if I'm present 100%. 

I know I can correct my life, I am very hard working but my mental health has dragged me down plus some bad luck, this is no longer the case now and I know I can turn things around fast.

Can anyone advise me on how I can approach this without hurting my partner too much and having them get hurt a lot.

Besides the going behind my back thing though, he starts treating me like actual complete ass. Like no good mornjng, no good night and nothing in between. 

He invited me snowboarding this weekend and I was so excited and said yes! I’m getting a breast reduction Tuesday and thought it’d be such a fun experience. 

But yesterday I got paid, he saw my check and got very mad (almost jealous? It was a good check) which makes no sense, my money is his! And he said he’s not spending money at all and things are changing. I said ok are we still going boarding? He said no. I hear him on the phone tonight with his friend and I guess they are going boarding. And his friend mentioned a women going. And I said oh are we going and getting said I am you are not. I was obviously pissed.

Earlier today I got approved for a new car (mines been broken down and no one to fix it for MONTHS) he keeps saying he will fix it but here we are so I went and got a new car. No more expensive than what I’m paying now but a ton more reliable and now he won’t even look at me.

He has told me he thinks we should split up because I have no drive. (I don’t have my license or GED) I understand that but I’ve been mighty busy working full time, and taking care of our babies. Yes I got a car without my license. Those are goals of mine absolutely and I even have an appointment at the dld Monday. But he said because I don’t have those things he doesn’t want me….. This was after the conversation about snowboarding with his friend. Makes me wonder what’s really going on.

I spent my entire time with him pregnant, working full time, paying half of everything and sacrificing everything. He moved out and got his own apartment when our newborn was 4 weeks old and started barber school where he most definitely cheated on me.

Idk. 

I guess my question is where do I go from here…. Will anyone ever even love me again? He’s made me feel unworthy because of the GED situation. Like no one would like me. I’m not good enough.

She saved me from drinking. I saved her from her past traumas like her toxic relationship from laat year. She was really happy with me and she said things like i mean everything to her she wants to give everything to me she said she loves me so much. 1 day after being gone from work for a week she misses me. We had a little argument because i thought she was giving me attitude at the end of the call after having a nice conversation about dating plans. I asked her the same night ""this relationship means alot to you right?"" She said yes and i told her im going to bed. I had to clear my mind just to find out the next day after work she didnt wanna go anywhere and we argued again she tried to break up with me and i wanted to leave after saying ""you decided this all under a night i guess this means nothing to you"" she takes me back and said i love you.. you mean alot to me and tries to offer everything in return. Next day she calls for 30 minutes to breakup again. Saying like ""im confused i just dont wanna be in a toxic relationship"" bla bla bla. After arguing for 20 more mins i asked "" is this a toxic relationship?"" She said no and i told her why the F we breaking up then? She told me alot of things like. You have proven your actions with words and she loves that. She still tells me on that day she broke up that she cares and i mean alot to her. She is saying things she is suffocating and everything. Maybe because of the whole situation thats going on like arguments. I understand that. So she broke up with me and left i gave it 5 days and talked again . We video called. Now she is saying she regrets everything she says. Her depression is hitting her hard . She said i tend to push people away when my depression hits and she said things like youre a very positive person not toxic. I said sorry on my end too. I told her i understand. I told her a whole sorry letter but at the end i told her i dont want you to answer now but whenever youre ready tell me i told her ill wait . That night i knew that was her that was her soft side and truest side. She said also "" i just dont wanna push you away"" i told her i understand and im always here whenever youre ready to talk again. Next day she sends me a tiktok that reminded her of me. Next day i sent her a goodmorning text telling everything is gonna be fine. Now we called today she was getting moody again and didnt wanna go anywhere we basically held a 1 hour 30  minute call and yes that whole time she is feeling like that shitty bit*chy person. I tried reminded her all the happy moments and she said she remembers. I even asked if she remembered monday. She said she somewhat remembers. I asked if she still has photos and videos of me at her phone but she doesnt wanna look at it at the moment. I even indirectly ask if she still has my stuff and she said yes she still has my stuff. I told her i know she doesnt mean to push me away i told her i know i mean to you and i know you cant answer now cause of how she feels but at the end i told her i still love her and im here for her not going anywhere even at text i told her i chose her. We said goodnight and sleep well and she changed her tone too when she said it like a soft nice way. She told me legit at monday she regretted pushing me away. I understand she is a different person atm but right now our relationship is complicated and i feel like a walking clown everyday. As much as i understand what she is going through and the depression of hers is really hitting her hard but damn its been 2 days since i talked to her sweet side at monday. Damn and this patient game is fucking me up and i got a new hobby lately boxing and thats the only hobby that has been cheering me up. Everything reminds me of her my room my clothes my work everything. She didnt even go out on her days off too. She keeps saying im so glad i didnt ruin your life. Im glad youre doing well or happy but at the end of the day i feel like a walking clown. But as much as i hate it she means alot to me and i know that i mean alot to her.

We have been dating about 4 months and have grown extremely close in a short period of time. He tells me he loves me everyday. We talk daily for hours, and he's met all my friends and family.  He's help me set up my condo I bought and contributes to groceries, anything I ask of him to help with around the condo. He's a sweet guy who  carries me to bed when I fall asleep on the couch.


The situation:

Bf is extremely attractive and friendly. The best friend is also  goddamn attractive.  (But so am I, and he's commented on how we would make good looking babies) He studied abroad in Australia for 6 months and met this female friend in a bar. Said he was drunk and didn't know her... ended up kissing her, but nothing else happened.  His other friends in Australia who are males joked he was gay because they never did anything together. They're strictly travel buddies since it saves money. 

This trip was planned way back in january/Feb but flight was canceled and the trip was pushed out. It was planned before we became bf and gf. 

He knows I'm uncomfortable with this since the whole situation is weird and awkward. He invited me to Australia but said we couldn't stay at her parents house because there wasn't enough room. Obviously I can't go becus Australia is expensive and I just bought a condo. I said where are you sleeping? He said he knows he's getting his own room but not sure. She has a brother whose away at college so he'd get his room. Today he said the brother will be home and there's another room with a pull out couch and desk.

I find it hard to believe that he's not attracted to her and he said nothing to my response other than shower me with words of love and admiration.  I even asked what they talk about. 2 weeks is a long time with a female ""friend."" He said I don't know. I said come on, when my guy friends talk to me we talk about design, their wives, babies, hobbies and things happening in our lives. He finally said she talks about guys she's dating, drawing, her job and places she wants to visit. 

Apparently there's other guy friends there he wants to visit, but he isn't as close with the guys so that's why he's staying with her family. He knows how I feel and has mentioned looking into staying with the guys, but who knows if that will happen. 

One of my friends says he's  innocent until proven guilty. Another has told me the kiss has already established a connection and they must have fucked. Everyone has a different definition of best friend though. 


 He will be joining my family on a ski vacation this winter, literally 2 weeks after the Australia trip. I don't even feel like his girlfriend currently.  I need advice, as I am clearly the jealous girlfriend over here. However, what gf wouldn't be jealous their bf is visiting another beautiful woman across the world that isn't her.

So.... Is he fucking her? Should I un-invite him from the ski trip? How can I tell if he's cheating on me? Or should I dump him?  Someone tell me what's up becus I'm going mad over here.

not too long ago, my best friend who turned me down years before started making obvious advances. sitting closer to me than usual, being a little touchier, giving longer hugs, buying me things, etc. now he’s flat out told me that he wants to pursue a relationship with me. i never stopped liking him over the years but thinking about being in a relationship with him now makes me feel a bit conflicted. i’m not upset about him turning me down, but i feel like my ego would take a hit if i let myself go with him now after having been rejected. don’t know if that’s reasonable or not. 

i expressed to him that idk how i feel about his change of heart only after my drastic change of appearance and how it made me feel like he was more interested in my body than me. he said that isn’t true at all. he said he’s always liked me but that he wasn’t sexually attracted to me and so he didn’t want to get into a relationship with me knowing that fact would rear its ugly head somewhere along the line. he said physical attraction isn’t all that is important to him, and that it isn’t even the most important thing to him but that we couldn’t write it off completely. he also pointed out that we’ve been friends for years so obviously he loves who i am as a person and knows we get along well and enjoy each others company. he also pointed out that he hasn’t even entertained the idea of a relationship with anyone else since i told him i liked him years ago… which is true, just something i hadn’t realized until he mentioned it.

I am a female (29) currently dating a man who we will call Wyatt who is a few years older than me. We have been dating long distance (3 hours apart).for almost 2 months but are not official. We enjoy spending time together, he shows me he cares with small and big acts of kindness, we share the same values, and he has already introduced me to some of his closest friends and told his family about me. It's been great so far. Before I met him, I had been on dating apps, and at times dating a few guys at a time casually. I historically have not dated as aggressively as I am this year, however after the arrival of my niece a few years ago, I realized I really wanted kids and my window to have them was closing. Since I met Wyatt, I have not used dating apps and have not dated anyone else but I'm starting to wonder if I should and am contemplating on how to have the conversation with him. I would like to date him exclusively, however he has been through a lot and has not been coping with it in a healthy way. Several years ago, his parents divorced which hit him hard, fast forward a few years and his longtime ex-girlfriend breaks up with him and they both moved out of the apartment they shared together that he loved. For a majority of the time they were together, he was also working crazy hours at a very demanding job that involved solo travel pretty much every week  which left him to feeling very isolated. He has since quit that job and has been working a job that although I'm glad he has it, is not paying all of the bills. In addition, he has struggled with his relationship with alcohol the past couple of years which worries me. I believe his alcohol struggles stems from a coping mechanism for stress, and his hurt and emotions which has accumulated into becoming a habit at this point. He is a genuine, extremely caring and gentle person who has been through a lot. I want to continue to be there for him and support him even though we've known each other for a short time. Lately, I have been feeling torn between wanting to date other people in case we don't work out or he doesn't begin addressing his struggles. if I start dating other people, how do I let him know? Do I tell him about my fear of not being able to have kids? It might be important to a dd for context that in the past, when dating my ex I worked so hard to make sure he was ok and happy even if I was hurting or not happy, at times to my own detriment which led me to occasionally feeling resentful towards him. Even though I don't feel that Wyatt would maliciously take advantage of me, I don't want to wake up months from now regretting my decision to solely date him without exclusivity discussed and without him actively working to become a healthier person mentally and physically.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7578340,public,self,29(f) dating a man I recently met who has gone through a lot in his life recently while contemplating beginning to date others out of fear of not being able to have kids one day.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yybv73/29f_dating_a_man_i_recently_met_who_has_gone/,all_ads,6,,,

I (m18)recently got into a (relation-)ship with someone (f18)we haven’t talked about what we are yet, but went on one date and she hang around at my place for 5 days in a row after we kissed. We kissed in public too and stuff like that. I know we are just teenagers, but to make it worse I am just gonna be in her country for 2.5 more months, before leaving back to Europe. 
Yesterday I asked her if she could imagine herself in a long distance relationship with anybody and she said she may try but doesn’t really believe that that could work. 
Since I am young and don’t really have much experience I don’t really know at what pace I should be going. 
I brought her coffee to school and show that I really care about her a lot. At first she was flattered, but now I feel like she gets annoyed when I show that I care and she doesn’t give the same energy of caring back. 
She told me that she doesn’t know if she’s ready for a relationship, because she feels like she is meant to be passed around by guys, who don’t care about her, she told me that, after she wondered why I am not „grabby“ while making out, so I told her that I was raised to respect boundaries and be respectful in general, but also may be connected to past experiences where I whitnessed nonconsensual touch, not on me or from me, but at parties where one person was close to cross boundaries to sexual assault. I told her that I’ll try to be more „grabby“ even tho I feel slightly uncomfortable. 
Maybe she’s just tired and stressed out and I’m just interpreting stuff that doesn’t really exist, but I feel like now that she got me she lost interest.

He is in school and works part time, I work full time to allow him to finish his program. Since moving in he has had some changes in the way he acts. For background, he previously used to help cook and clean around his parents, plan date nights, and honestly had a high drive to be intimate
(3-4 times a week if possible). It has been 3 months now and he's slowly been doing less cleaning, less cooking (none at this point), and we are being intimate much less (once a week if I'm lucky) and he doesn't seem to care. I am worried that 1- he's getting way too comfortable with our setup and relationship, and doesn't care to do things for me anymore. 2- he has no drive or ambition to be productive about these things.
Or 3- he's interested in someone else and that's why he's been so careless and distant and less intimate.

Recently I brought up to her my interest in possibly getting into cigars when I am of age, as it seemed like an interesting hobby that I could share with friends. However, she immediately told me how she had made it clear that she does not want to be with anyone who smokes, and that if I were to start smoking she would lose attraction to me, and essentially implied she would find me disgusting. 

I told her I would limit it to a few times a month, and I honestly believe I would be able to keep it that way. I know most people are gonna say ""simple solution, leave her"" or ""simply don't smoke"" but obviously I love her a lot and see a future with her. I've been just casually bringing it up to see if there was any way she could compromise, but she is firm.

I understand dealbreakers, and preferences and all, and at this point I would not even get into it because I obviously value our relationship more than a possible hobby.

My boyfriend (mid 20s M) and I (mid 20s F) have been together 5 years. I don't want to give away too much info since he's always on reddit.

 In 2021 he made this friend at work, a younger girl we'll call G (approx 18 or 19) I snooped on his phone due to past problems, weird texts at odd hours, and general jumpiness. He was flirting, meeting up outside of work late at night, etc. When I caught him, he tried to lie and say it was a male coworker (I had proof to the contrary and showed him) he promised then it would end. I told him it wasn't the friendship I was mad about, but the secrecy and lying like it was something more than friendship. I asked for transparency and a more professional work relationship. He also blamed me and said it was my fault he felt the need to lie about her.

Months later it happens again, or never stopped really. I told him it was his last chance, completely block her or lose me (and our baby, had just found out I was pregnant recently.) He didn't do it in front of me, should've been my first clue.

I just found out he last called her, for 2 hours, in January.  He kept contacting her months after he said he blocked her. The calls stop (or were deleted) right around the time we moved in together. 

Has anyone had similar experiences so they can shed some light on where I should go from here?

He is absolutely amazing so me. Very kind, caring, supportive. Everything I’ve been searching for. I’ll try to make this story as short as possible, but I really need a different perspective on things. 

So my boyfriend is very social, has many friends both men and women. That stuff doesn’t bother me. Im not a clingy or jealous person. 

I had suspicions of one of his friends I met. Let’s call her Ana. 

I didn’t realize my boyfriend and Ana had history. But I quickly put 2 and 2 together. 

Two months into our relationship, We were at this concert my boyfriend’s buddy was throwing. My bf writes music and his friend performs it. So his friend performed a song he wrote about Ana previously to me…. And I mean really previous. 
It was a very deep love song, and Ana was there with her boyfriend and heard all of it. I felt very uncomfortable and upset. Mainly because my boyfriend told me the same stuff that he wrote about her in the song. My boyfriend explained how he didn’t know his friend was going to perform that song, and apologized to me. I’m a human with emotions. So it hurt me. Even though it wasn’t his fault. 

So I asked my boyfriend the next day what that was about, and he explained the whole story. 

Apparently he’s been in love with her and wanted her for years.  But she never felt the same for him. They never hooked up or anything. 
About a year ago one night, she confessed that she was in love with him and then fucked a random guy the next day. And that broke him. 

For the past year , he told me that they never talked about that night again and it’s all in the past, and they’re just friends. 

She got a boyfriend in April. He said he was hurt by that at the time.  But he matched with me on tinder in April and fell in love with me very very quickly. 

How can it be so “in the past” if he was in love with her and hurt days or weeks before he met me ? 

He still hangs out with her and talks with her and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can’t help but to think I’m a rebound. I trust him though. But part of me feels like he went on tinder to try to find somebody to get over the fact she found somebody….. and here I am.

What I need is some advice and insight on what to do and how she may be feeling. 

So I have a midterm tomorrow so I went with my girlfriend to our university student Center to study. We took a little break to eat some pizza we ordered and when I finished I told her I was leaving to get a drink from a water fountain. I drink some water, and then I go to the washroom to wash my hands but on the way I see some people I haven’t seen since I lived in residence last year. I wasn’t planning on having a conversation but I ended up making eye contact with one of the two girls I knew, I’ll call her O. We both recognized each other so I went to say hi and ask her how she’s been doing and as I’m walking I see H, the girl who liked me during my first year. 

Just to add detail, my gf has known from the very beginning that I never had feelings for H (I met them around the same time and I complained about the attention H would give me, but she is uncomfortable with me around other women. I am very dedicated to her and would never cheat, but I made the mistake of watching porn during our relationship. It was a normal thing in my last relationship but I made the mistake of never asking my current gf if she was okay with it. News flash, she isn’t. In fact, she knew from when she was young that she could never be with someone who has watched porn because it would break her, and it did. It was my mistake for never asking her. 

Anyways, we all talked for about 4 minutes when I felt my phone vibrate. My girlfriend gets very anxious when I don’t update her on things so I responded immediately and told her who I saw. After that, we talk for 6 more minutes before I tell them I have things to get back to and I leave. When I check my phone I see she left a rant for me, explicitly expressing her disapproval of the situation. It was finished off with “U might wanna go back your things are unattended.” And when I get back to where we were, she’s gone.

First of all, I know we are young and there are plenty of fish in the sea but, we do love each other very much and second of all, we have had our ups and downs but I am unsure of my next step.

We have been together for almost 3 years, have had two breakups and live together currently. For my boyfriend, he has had a rough upbringing as an orphan from China and going through a lot that he felt comfortable sharing with me. The best way to describe him would be avoidant anxious and the best way to describe myself is anxious avoidant - very similar but opposite in various ways. We handle emotions differently depending on the situation and often like our space when we’re upset and will speak when we’re both ready. We’ve gotten better at it, in all honesty but at the current moment, all I want is the best for the both of us.

We got back together in September after being broken up for 5/6 months and I decided to take him back since he wanted to give us another try - I was hesitant but, saw he was willing to put in effort and we’ve been doing good up until now. We had a talk last night where we just both felt off about one another and I asked him questions and he answered. The main gist of it all is that, he said, when I asked if he was running away from me again because he’s never felt loved before, he said he feels like it might be. He said he’s used to being alone and being by himself and he said he does love me and feels like he hasn’t been able to miss me and suggested we live on our own. He said it’s hard to feel a connection with me and I asked if it was because of someone else, something I’ve done, etc and he said no, he doesn’t know why it’s hard this time and I thought to myself, maybe he’s afraid of hurting me again (which he ended up saying he was) and he’s self sabotaging (I didn’t ask him this part). 

I suggested separate bedrooms because I myself like my own space but, do my best to keep to myself or occupy myself with my own hobbies or sleep downstairs on the couch after work sometimes and instead of my saying “I want to go” when he goes to the grocery store, I started asking if he’d like for me to go or if he’d like to go by himself, just so I could give him his alone time.

I did ask to go through his phone to see if he was cheating because when we broke up earlier in the year, he said he felt disconnected from me and wanted to be with other people - it hurt, he liked someone shortly after that but she ended up not being the greatest, he worked on himself and stayed with his mom and brother for a while and then came back home and wanted to talk with me (all within the span of the 5/6 months we were broken up, it wasn’t immediate). I admit, it wasn’t the greatest move on him but, I figured one last chance could work and if not then I know it wasn’t meant to be, I’ll be okay and will move on since it’ll be a little easier, if that makes sense.

My main concern is, how do I go about this? He said he wants to miss me and says we’re together 24/7 (we also work together but keep it strictly professional and no one knows, I also have another job I work so the only time we’re together is when we’re at work (even then we work different departments but have lunch together and leave together) or at home/napping/sleeping), at home with our other roommates/ or when we go visit his mom or my mom.

I would love to give him his space and feel like maybe I should stay with one of my girlfriends for a week to see how he feels. We’re moving out of our current house near January to move in with one of our friends and we would have separate bedrooms but, I don’t know what else to do. I don’t ask for much, I trust him 100% and I encourage him to do the things he wants/ would like to do. He goes to parties around town with our two roommates on the weekends like 3 times within the month if there is one (I work the bars during those days and times parties usually happen) and before it would make me anxious but over time, I’ve gotten over it and will tell him to be safe and have fun and he’ll update me through the night or when he gets home and my roommates would tell me if he was acting out of pocket or, was cheating on me so, again, I don’t worry too much because I know he’s in good hands. 

He’d also tell me if girls flirted with him and what he said to them - he only has people he knows from high school and work on his social media and any new girl or guy, he’ll let me know of who they are after he tells me a story they told him (like an accident at work or something he think I’d find funny or interesting or relate to). We had our locations shared but, he stopped sharing his location (just turned it off) so I did too. I’m okay with him being friends with other girls so long as he doesn’t entertain them and lets them know he’s in a relationship. I asked him if I seemed controlling and he said no and said it was mostly him and had nothing to do with me and I also asked if he seemed a bit depressed and he said a little bit.

But, I overthink sometimes internally and like for things to be okay if I can help and the other person would like my help. He does have a hard time communicating sometimes so I’ll ask and he’ll be hesitant and I’ll sometimes get the memo but other times it’s hard. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially if any of you have gone through the same. I want the best for the both of us and, I told him if he has to let me go then I’ll be okay with it. He did hug me while I cried after it all just kind of hit me and wiped my tears and hugged me while we drifted off to sleep and this morning he was all smiley when he saw me come downstairs after freshly waking up and hugged me when I wanted a hug so, I just want things to be okay or for me to figure out the best way to respect his boundaries/emotional turmoil. 

Side note: he has done therapy before but doesn’t really like it and has said he’ll try it up again but I know it’s hard for him to open up so I won’t force him. Because of him being in foster care, he is in a program that helps and he has two social workers who will come by and he’ll talk to them so, in a way, he does have therapy but, not with a therapist if that makes sense.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7578230,public,self,My boyfriend (M22) and I (F22) have been feeling emotionally disconnected and he believes having space will make him miss me more.

This is a rather long read.

We met in August at a concert and it was an instant connection. It was a weird time for me as I had to travel across the country to deal with some family issues for about a month. We talked every single day, sometimes for hours on the phone, even with the 3 hour time difference. It was such a surreal experience to meet someone and feel like I’ve known them forever. In September I came home and traveled up to see him, we live 4 1/2 hours apart. What an amazing weekend we spent together and solidified out relationship. We fell in love with each other and it was mutual.

Over the course of the next couple months, we managed to land in 3 pretty big arguments, to the point of going to bed angry. They were honestly stupid petty arguments that could have been avoided and I attributed them to getting to know each other and learning what our likes/dislikes and boundaries are. During this time we have set in motion a plan for our future, which included me moving up with him and even set a date for that. I realize that seems rather fast, but the way we saw it, we have both been through a lot, both divorced, and both ready to not waste time and start our lives. We have been on the exact same page through all of this and had multiple discussions about it.

So Wednesday night, I get back from a wine night with my girlfriends. I talk to him on the phone the whole drive home (about 25 minutes) and when I park, I tell him I’m putting my coat on and will  call back when I get into my apartment. As I’m getting out of my car, my roommate pulls up as well and we walk together from our cara to our apartment. Our complex is open space policy and when you get home late there is never spots available upfront, so it’s a bit of a hike. We get inside and she wants to talk, so I put my stuff down in my room, come out for what I think will be a quick discussion, however it turns into about an hour and a half discussion. I was honestly so engrossed in the convo that I didn’t even think to check my phone. I go to grab my phone finally and I have several missed calls from my boyfriend and couple texts that he is worried about me. For context, back in March I was walking to my car at night after drinks with a friend I was attacked and landed in the hospital (I am fully recovered, but it was very traumatic experience). So I hop on a FaceTime with him and he is clearly upset, I apologize for making him upset, it was not my intention. He’s not letting it go and I end up laughing, not in a I’m making fun of him laugh, more of a I’m fine, everything is ok let’s move on way. In hindsight not the best reaction, but I’m not thinking clearly. He takes great offense this and hangs up on me. I call him back in an attempt to clear the air, again in hindsight not the best reaction, and we end up getting into an argument over it. He hangs up and I’m trying to call him back and he texts me that he is done. And then texts that he is done with everything. I text back what does that mean. And then tell him that is a heavy statement and I don’t think he meant to say what he did, but that we need to talk about it. He then said that he meant it and with the last couple arguments we’ve had this was the finisher. I ended up trying to call him about 15 times (psycho I know, but I just got dumped over a text message and level heads are not prevailing)-and he doesn’t answer. I am begging him over text to answer but don’t get anywhere. I finally give up and try to go to sleep.

I think I slept all of 2 hours that night, maybe. It wasn’t enough for my watch to record the data. I’m so sick to stomach about everything. I try to call him in the morning when I know he is up and nothing. I text him. Nothing. Finally at around 11 am I send a rather large,  straight to the point logical text. He does respond, and tells me he’s not giving me the silent treatment and that he fell back asleep this morning because he didn’t sleep well the night before and that we will talk later in the day. I just say ok and leave it at that. 5:30 pm rolls around and I haven’t heard from him at all, my anxiety is just at an all time high so I decide to call him. He answers and we talk for about 30 minutes.

He ended things. What it boiled down to for him is that he can’t deal with arguments like ours. He thinks that I turn everything around on him during an argument and that I scream at him. While I will admit that I raise my voice, I am hardly screaming, but I do have a naturally loud voice so I can see how that comes off. I will also admit that I get defensive in arguments and this is where the problem lies. He’s not even giving me an opportunity to work on it though. He’s made his decision and it’s final. I’m so completely gutted and heartbroken and don’t understand how a man who says he loves me more than anything can just drop me and future at the drop of pin without even allowing me to work on it.

I told him I would respect his decision but my heart hurts so bad. I ended up calling him later and asking him to sit on it for a couple days and talk on Sunday before completely calling it. I know I shouldn’t have done that. I have opened my heart and soul to this man in a way that I never before, not even with my ex husband. It hurts so bad to have my entire future just ripped from me. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for on here. A place to vent, for people to tell me I’m crazy or not crazy. I feel so lost right now. I just don’t understand how he is so wiling to throw away all the good and amazing memories we have already made and all our  future memories so easily. It does make me think there might be something else driving this, be it fear or something. I just want the man I love back.

(it ended up being a lie, she did not know) as months progress he was more open on talking about his ex and other past relationships to me, i did feel uncomfortable, but i’d still listen. specifically with this one ex, he told me different reasonings as to why they ended, one was due to distance and another was because he couldn’t see himself in a relationship with her. i don’t know the truth as to why they ended, but i do know it was mutual and she did initiate it. he told me they took a three month break back in march of this year from one another to lose feelings (which he said he did) i couldn’t help but not believe that, almost as if something was telling me that’s not the truth. since i had that feeling, i asked him if he can cut ties with her. it turned into a issue, he cried and things were said, in the end i was the one who had to comfort him about it. eventually he agreed to stop talking to her, but he still wanted to follow her on social media. to me that just felt as if he wanted a connection with her in some way, (following her family members as well) i explained my feelings towards him and how i felt about the situation, he wasn’t understanding fully and he took time away from me due to it. during that time he took away from me, i found out myself he was texting her the entire time. it started off him letting her know he can’t talk to her anymore, but progressed to saying things such as “i don’t know why i’m crying right now” “i guess i’m just going to miss you” “when i see posts that remind me of you i wish i can send them to you” “i cannot throw away anything you’ve gave me” “i still have you on other social medias” “this isn’t goodbye” and even mentioned that i was across the country from him and wouldn’t find out he was messaging her those things. i also want to mention the girl did not feed into anything he was saying besides mentioning that they did have a great times together, she wishes him well and how he needs to move on. she also agreed it wasn’t a good idea for him to talk to her either. i’ve been thinking about if she would’ve responded in the opposite manner, what could’ve happened? when i read all of the things he was saying, i was hurt, i didn’t know how to feel. we’ve talked about it and he was feeling guilty, crying/apologizing and was reassuring me for hours which lead to days and present time too, but i cannot help and think is he only sorry he got caught? does he still have feelings for her? i asked him what is there to miss? he told me just having another person care for him. which i can understand to an extent, he also clarified that there were no feelings there. i was only aware they talked to be there for one another, check in etc, but i’ve seen those messages recently and prior to that was more than just checking in, he would even send her photos of my personal items that i collect (funkos, squishmallows, nendoroids) and she would question whose is it, but he’d never answered. he also sent her screenshots of personal messages from him and i explaining how i feel about the situation with him keeping in contact with her and my past problems/trauma in relationships. i felt highly disrespected he felt comfortable telling her those things. i felt like he cared more about her opinion than how i felt. i didn’t even know he still kept sentimental things from her (which is now thrown away as he says) i felt betrayed and hurt that i had to find out those things and he couldn’t just tell me. we were always great on communication so this was surprising to me. when he was comforting me about this, he told me he will change because i deserve better and he wants to be that for me and i do notice the change, i genuinely can tell he’s working on himself and we’ve had no issues since. i love him, but i genuinely don’t know what to do or how to feel in this situation anymore as it still appears in the back of my mind. prior to this situation he never gave me any reasoning to distrust him nor had any other problems. the messages were from this october and him and i have been dating since july of this year.

For some context as the title is very vague. I dated this girl in the start of August 2022. Everything was great. She started as a new employee at the place I worked and I didn't give it too much thought, but she found me really attractive and started talking to me more and complimented me and just was really nice and was really refreshing. We started dating after a while of talking and me realising I was always looking at my phone, hoping to see that she messaged me and just how much I enjoyed talking to her.

But after a month of us dating. Things changed. We didn't see much of each other. She got fired from my place because she didn't want to do the apprenticeship they were offering as she wanted to go to college to study business. So she got a different job and started college and it limited the times we could see each other. It meant we started talking more online and over text. We would play games. But everytime I asked, she always invited her friend, who has feelings for her and she knows he does. Everytime in those calls, I always felt left out as I didn't have as much history as they did. She would always be laughing at his dumb jokes, but whenever I tried to join in, most of the time they would kick me out of the call after saying a ""bad joke"" or an unfunny joke. The guy never referred to me by my actual name and always got it intentionally wrong, she would join in aswell, giving him names to call me. 

There was one time I asked to play games with her, but she was already playing minecraft. I didn't want to bother her and rush her, so I said I'd wait for her to finish, by playing some games of overwatch. I assumed she would've bored and was done with minecraft for the day. I jokingly said I needed her to carry me to some wins as I was losing. She took it literally and came on. But I was in a comp game. I told her I was in one but that I would join her straight after. She said okay. The game lasted longer than I had expected. When the game finished, I read her message and she said she had gone to play minecraft with said guy as I took too long. This hurt me because we made plans to play with just us and then she left me to play with him. But I was like okay fine it's whatever. She invited me, so I came on and they were playing modded minecraft. It took him 15 minutes to send me the mod pack and it ended up not working and instead of being like oh you can't play, let's play something else. They continued playing together and I was just there. So I left the call. I wasn't enjoying just being sat there. She asked me why I left, I tried to explain to her, that she left me to play games with him and that I was just there feeling left out. She then had a go at me saying she did wait, that I took too long, that she has a very short attention span and that I know this and that it was inevitable that she was going to leave to do something else. 

After that argument, the relationship was not how it was. I constantly felt like shit. It didn't help that she called me boring. Then the day of us breaking up. I asked her to pick out an outfit for me for when we met up. And I showed off my doc Martins and she liked them because it made me taller (I'm 5'3, so not very tall) and I asked if she liked my height, she said she didn't mind it. But I asked her again and she said that she avoids wearing some shoes because sometimes it feels like she's walking next to a kid... yeah she actually said that and actually assumed I'd be okay with that. I asked if I could have an actual compliment rather than her just attacking my insecurities cuz it really hurt me but she was too tried to give me a compliment. But she wasn't tired enough to then stay up till 1am playing games with that guy. 

So I blew up. I said everything that was on my chest. I didn't care anymore because I was really hurting and I needed her to listen to me. Instead it caused another argument and ended up with us breaking up.

Ik I shouldn't have done that and I do regret it. But I couldn't control it any longer. It was 2 weeks of that sort of stuff happening and I tried brining it up before and nothing changed. I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't what I wanted in a relationship. 

But now I'm thinking that maybe what I was fighting for, which was more attention off of her, was me asking too much. That me constantly brining up being left out, was toxic of me. And idk if I was in the right and if I was in the wrong, I completely wasted a good relationship over nothing.

Throwaway and most ages a little off.

I’ve known my gf (now ex I guess) since my early 20s, always felt a connection. But she had a kid young, I was away at college, by the time I was out, she was gone in the wind. A few years later I moved back to my hometown ran into her at a bar with a mutual friend and the connection was instantaneously back like lightning, but now she was married with a total of 3 kids. We exchanged contact info and kept it friendly.

Over the next few years we got pretty close and a lot of things came to light. Her husband was emotionally and physically abusive to her and the kids. She helped him get through college and the state police academy. After he went away they essentially separated, he hardly ever came around, actually ended up getting a girlfriend. Before he was due to transfer back to the local barracks, she filed for divorce. That was two years ago. Last year we started dating.

At this point her kids are in middle/high school. I had met all of them before a few times, the girls liked me, the oldest was okay but indifferent really. The trouble started really as soon as she filed for divorce, all of a sudden he wanted to control everything again. Forced the kids to go with him every other weekend, the older two hated him and eventually he only fought to keep the youngest going. He gaslights her and manipulates her just like he did her mother. Now she throws fits if I’m even mentioned let alone hint at me coming over. Threatens to jump off the roof, and her grades have plummeted. She also talks to him through Snapchat and have their chats set to delete so her mother has no idea what they say. He tells her things like if it wasn’t for their mother, they would be back together, despite the fact he has a live in girlfriend.

My ex caters to this behavior because she doesn’t want anything to happen to her daughter, but both the other two and myself have suffered for it. She also does whatever the kids want because she doesn’t want to be seen as a bad mom, fills her entire schedule with their activities to the point it’s become detrimental to her own health. It became like we were having an affair but from her youngest. I got no real home life with them. On top of all that, her being abused understandably caused some issues, like not really enjoying socializing or being in groups. Like hanging out with me and my friends is a no go. Whatever I get it, my issue was she had no problem spending time with her family and friends in groups, like a trip to Disney world or the beach. Hypocrisy is a huge pet peeve for me. From my point of view everything in the relationship was on her terms and no compromise on her end.

It doesn’t help that her Ex is still being controlling by way of the court system as well. His brother is a lawyer so he has free legal help and files motion after motion in the court that she has to address and shell out money for.

Now I am also currently in medical school which is quite stressful already and she sees it as taking time away from having a family. However she won’t address her daughters behavior so I could even try. Where I fucked up was I called her out on all this last weekend, and she shut down and didn’t respond. She tends to shut down when she hears things she doesn’t like from me. Well I let it go 3 days with no response and told her I couldn’t deal with it anymore and said goodbye. It was left on read, that was Tuesday.

This woman is someone I could never imagine myself without, I just felt like I was at the end of my rope and being dismissed, no matter how many times I had voiced my issues (it was a lot). Now I’m reeling and I have no idea how to fix this, or if I even can. Quite honestly I have started organizing my affairs in preparation for the likely outcome of not hearing from her again.

He does not have plans for the future, but I am set to be financially secure enough for the both of us. It is also worth noting he comes from a wealthy family whereas I have wavered between lower and middle class, which does pose a bit of struggle in our views on this.

They knew each other because he worked with her dad.

It was never a relationship, just a “companionship”. Relationship with an expiry date.

It creeps me out. The maturity levels, the experience between the two is out.

Jay has two sisters, “Mary” (25f) and “regina” (35f). Both sisters have a husband and daughter. Mary approached us 4 months ago and asked if her daughter Katie (5) could perform a song for us. Katie is a very sweet girl and me and jay adore her. Mary said Katie had went to her music teacher and asked to help her sing so she could sing at our wedding but Mary wanted our permission first. Jay and I said yes and are very excited to hear her perform. 

Apparently, Regina caught wind of this and basically told us that her daughter Emma (10) is also performing….a stand up comedy act. Now, emma is a very nice girl too but can sometimes be a lot. She has no filter and will do whatever she wants. Regina kinda enables this behavior. She was diagnosed with adhd which is okay (I have it too) but her and her mom use it as an excuse to her poor behavior. For example, the other day I had told Emma to stop climbing on the furniture while we were all watching tv. Emma screamed in my face “I have adhd you can’t tell me what to do” I looked at Regina and she just shrugged. 

Jay and I were very wary when Regina told us this and asked what this “comedy show” entailed. She basically told us that it was a surprise and that we would love it. This was Monday.

Last night jay got a text from Mary. She had sent him a video that Regina had sent to her saying “little preview of the act😂” 

The video was of emma “practicing” her routine saying very inappropriate stuff that shouldn’t be said at a wedding let alone by your ten year old niece. The video ended as she was saying “congrats el and mouse!”

Backstory: jay and I have known each other since kindergarten. We had been friends our entire lives before heading off to college. Growing up, I was always on the bigger side. Jay however was a “late bloomer”. Senior year he was only 5’0 and like 100 pounds. I had been 5’5 since 8th grade and a lot more than 100 pounds. When I went with him to his families house as an official couple for dinner, Regina said “wow I can’t believe the elephant and the mouse finally got together” she laughed and explained that jay came home from school one day and told his family that he was going to to marry me one day. She saw me at an event a few days later and thought it was funny that a little mouse like  her brother would like an elephant of a girl like me. Her parents along with her siblings told her to knock it off and that was the last time she ever said something like that. 

Hearing Emma  say that in the video made Jay and I freeze. We had a feeling that a lot of the “comedy act” was actually Regina feeding Emma these jokes to pull some thing at our wedding. Jay and I are still really upset and do not know what to do. On one hand, we do not want this comedy act going on at our wedding. On the other hand, we don’t want to be seen as the “bad guys” for not letting a 10-year-old do something while letting our other niece perform.

Jay and I ended up texted Regina letting her know we do want Emma to perform her skit. Since last night we have gotten nonstop texts from Regina saying that we’re ruining her daughters life and being mean by letting another child perform but not letting hers.

She doesn't seem worried about anything. Anytime I can't provide for her, she gets help from her parents. But she uses that money to fund her own desire instead of putting it towards us or our home. 

We don't share the same interests. I am laid back and homey, she likes to go out more often. I use to cater to her because I don't hate it. But now that times are tough, I try to save but she gets upset that we don't go outside. She thinks I don't care about her. But when I try to explain, she says that it doesn't cost much to go out. However, whenever we do go out, we end up spending a lot. On top of that, we end up spending a lot of time too. It takes me away from working. She says is work too much. 

I feel lonely in these times of struggle. She says she can feel my stress and asks me to manage it well so that I don't influence her. But I myself am very stressed out about our life. She just wants to enjoy. She says we need a balance.

Good afternoon,

I'll be 31 in in december, I would not bother you with personal details (looking handsome, not rich but certainly not poor). I had 8 relationships(7 times they were cheated on me), no ONS (I felt it's beneath me) but the last girl really killed all of my hopes and dreams in terms of trusting someone, and build a family. What I feel now is something I have never felt anytime, ever. I just learned how does it feel when part of you dies. I can't love, I have no motivation to anything, so I'll write the story maybe someone has similar experience. (Explanation...)

So I met my last gf last year, it was kinda love at first sight (or second), she's a lawyer so I assumed she's super smart. Chemistry was wonderful, first month went okay.

And from valentines day she started to behave more cold, told me more about her exes, failures, etc.. She became more distant, we didn't meet for 1,5 month (I don't know if she fucked with someone else or not, but that was the starting point when I became paranoid. (Probably not because there were deaths in her family, or that was her lie)
After 1,5 month we met, spent a weekend together, after that she behaved kinda normal but in May the bomb exploded: 

I looked into her phone and it turned out she's been speaking with another guy with whom she slept 2,5 years ago (no contact eversince because the guy is british, lives there+covid lockdown) and ""I love you, etc. disgusting messages, profile on FB date, and the best thing THE GUY WAS SPONSORED BY MY EX IN THE LAST 2,5 YEARS!
I was literally in shock that how the fuck can someone cheat from a lawyer 30.000 EUROS and always promising it back? (Kept it a secret before everybody, even family)
And the best part: she spoke about me life satan itself to this guy --&gt; reason: ""it was a theatre in order to get back my money from him"" she said. No family intro, no friends intro, I felt myself ashamed, even with a known fact the her exes looked like Frankenstein's failed experiment, brainless As well.

I wanted to breakup, she didn't want to. Then after another 1 month of agony I sent her to hell, because she not just didn't want to compensate me for this stolen time, but lied to my face as well.
I have been cheated on, but I have never been a disposable toy to anybody, and when I figured it out... let's say what I wanted to do with her is not the best thing you'd do....
We are 5 months after that 7-8 months of poison and my anger and hatred are both soo deep and strong (if not stronger) that I haven't felt the time passed by...
To me it is like yesterday.. Everytime I think about her (not that I could forget) my heart is pumping like an earthquake....
The only thing that could help me to move forward is to shout at her, and learning the reasons from her messages she wrote... in order to understand what mistake I made, and/or how could someone has a shit personality like this and smile every other day?

Our relationship in most ways is perfect - we compliment each other well, get along like best friends, similar interests, etc. However, we have always had some issues when it comes to… you know.

When we were in person, it was easy for us to initiate intimacy. We find each other attractive, and just being able to physically touch each other led to great foreplay and then into sex. However, it was always a little awkward for a variety of reasons, but the main issue was her inability to finish.

I know how that makes it sound for me, but I have been with women previously and have had no issues in terms of my performance. She has also been in sexual relationships, but has never been able to finish with them either - in fact, even alone, she has never climaxed, and she doesn’t seem to be interested in changing that, which I will get in to later.

For the past four months, we have both been busy with work and have been in consistent contact, however our conversations never focus on anything sexual. We have seen each other in person at least once a month, and our sex has been a bit more awkward than usual. We have acknowledged but chalked it up to not being in rhythm with each other and the stress of “having” to have sex since we see each other as infrequently as we do. When I say awkward, I mean issues with timing and positions, anyone who has been in a distance relationship I’m sure knows what I mean - however you are redditors so I’m not sure how much that applies to y’all.

However, this issue came to a head this past weekend when I went out to visit her. Everything was great, as usual, seeing her again but when we got back to her apartment we hooked up and she did not seem to be interested - more like it was a chore for her. This was a huge turn off for me, which she then took offense to as she felt unwanted. That I was not interested in her. We stopped, started talking, and she revealed a couple of things. Firstly, she had not been horny at all for the past 2 months that we had been apart. When in person, things were manageable for her - she finds me attractive and wants to have sex, but more for my enjoyment than for hers. However, when apart, she had zero interest in masturbation or watching porn or anything. Second, she had been talking with her cousin (F23) about the situation, who recommended that she attempted masturbating. In response, my girlfriend had said that “(she) would not have an issue if she never had sex again.” When she told this to me, she broke down crying - I think in expectation of this being a deal breaker. I told her that I still loved her, but also that I don’t want to force her to do something that she doesn’t want to do, especially if that is having sex. However, sex is definitely something important to me in a relationship and that we will figure things out. We talked some more and then went to bed, and for the rest of the trip things were fine. We had sex one more time before I left, initiated by her, and it was the best we had had in months but still no completion on her end. However, after leaving, we have not talked about that conversation and any time conversation gets flirty we just end up going to bed.

I guess I don’t really have a good way to sum up what I am asking - how do I continue this conversation? I obviously don’t want to force my girlfriend to have sex with me, but I also never want to have sex. I love this girl and can see myself marrying her, but I don’t want to be in a relationship where my girlfriend is uninterested in sex at all.

Thank you
