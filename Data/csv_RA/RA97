I am a type of verbal-person and i tell him since day one were going on a date, he accept that and able willing to what he says learn to be verbal as well. At that time when I'm 100% sure what i have is not a lust, i said i love you before I'm going to sleep to show that I'm at my point for willing to be open and vulnerable for him. He froze and didn't respond anything, so at first i feel like it is one-sided love. (*Remember that scene from Netflix Sex Ed? That's exactly what it feels like)

At that night i just let it slip, but i keep asking to myself. ""Is the person I'm in love with, feel the sam as the way i am?"" I'm at my point where i can't stop overthinking and ask him how he never said i love you back. He just said that he never really date someone who says i love you at all, even in his couple of years relationship. And i ask him ""do you mind if u want to try to said it back? Since it makes me happy to get a reassurance from my partner?"" He said that he knows that he'll haye it because he feels like faking it, and my mind get more fcked up since he said that. I keep asking myself whether this guy just keeping me as a charm or he really does love me back. Cause he's the type of guy who never compliments, AT ALL! That moment i realized I can't date someone who is not willing to show his vulnerable side to me. 

I am crying nonstop from 3am to 7am thinking how could i end our relationship well, so i text him and call him. And he said that all my demand is just how i feel and it is too much to ask from him. Not gonna lie but i wish he ask me to stay. And i feel like I'm regretting my choice at this moment. Maybe I'm just being dramatic, and maybe because of the gap year he can't really said that he loves me back?

So the situation did begin in cold Thursday day, I was going to talk to my crush, when I was approached by my crush classmate Gloria.

So she basically said to me to calm down, and that I was making him uncomfortable, she added that she is married and not jealous of me, I asked how does she know that, she then said that he didn‚Äôt tell her anything is just that EVERYONE knows.

Needless to say I was shocked, I did cry a lot thinking that he didn‚Äôt even enjoyed my company and that he disliked me.

I honestly didn‚Äôt have any ideia of anything that I did that would make him uncomfortable around me, so I started to think and only 4 possible things came to my mind, and my friend thought.

1- I talked to him sometimes when he was going towards the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt know he was going lol, at first I thought that he was talking a walk, now I know that if he is heading towards the bathroom side he is going to the bathroom lol.

2- I did accompanied him to the train station, maybe he was uncomfortable idk.

3- I did go his class to talk him but after 2 minutes he stooped and begun talking to other people, and I stayed there in the spot in my cellphone thinking that he would return talking to me but nope, if I knew he would talk to me after that I would go back to my class.

4- I was flirting with him, maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested and was uncomfortable.

Next week in a Thursday again, I said to my friend Jessica what Gloria did say to me and she thought that it was weird, because if he didn‚Äôt liked me he wouldn‚Äôt greet me kissing my cheek like he did to his other friends, then reveled some bombastic information talking to my other friend, that Gloria sees Leo as some kinda of son??? I was like WTF üíÄüíÄüíÄ.

The next day Gloria did go towards my direction to talk to me she did say how it now was much better smiling(creepy Af)  And that now that now that I am less sticky we can even be friends and was like what gurl, you know dawn well that I want to kiss that juicy lips, you gave me the stares when I was showing my number to him, you clearly knows what I want from the way you did say, she says that we can be friends know like she maintained me in check now, and now that I am tamed I can have her permission to be his friend, yuck ü§¢.

IDk if I am crazy but the shit she is doing isn‚Äôt creepy right? Like I am definitely scared by this nutso behavior, and honestly I will definitely not be intimidated but I wonder at what what extent goes her feelings for him, and more do I need to buy some pepper spray lol, just kidding I will buy it anyway.

The worst shit is that she sits my behind crush and accompanies him to the train station so she hears the majority of ours conversations.

But honestly the big elephant in the room is if I should tell him or not, like if that situation was happening with me I would like the guy to tell me, because no way I would hang out with such a weirdo, if I am being since I want to tell him but I don‚Äôt know how and when, that is the question.

Everyone think that this shit is weird one friend is enjoying the drama, my therapist thing something stinks, some internet friend thinks it is fucking weird and my friend Jessica thinks that maybe she just did go overboard but she sees him as good friend(doubt it, and my friend is her second semester so she does know him for one year and is the overprotective, there is a possibility that knows him outside university but idk.)

Hey all! My husband and I have been married for 8 years. In the past he was liking local and nonlocals nude/ seminudes on IG. I only found out because he went through one of my sisters old friends instagrams and liked every single one. She messaged me with screenshots and a message of him begging her not to tell me when she messaged him saying she knew he was married. Anyways‚Ä¶ this was years ago and he told me he wouldn‚Äôt follow any more. Well, I found his TikTok and most of his follows are for girls that are half naked. 

He also recently sent a sketchy message to someone who is local and she sent me screenshots. Then he opened his Snapchat earlier and it was a selfie from some girl he works with saying ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm down well, how are you?‚Äù He said their work besties and that he slid up on her vacation post saying he hopes she‚Äôs doing good. But this made me feel really really insecure. I feel like he‚Äôs showing all these other women attention and I‚Äôm being made to feel like I‚Äôm wrong for feeling this way and that it‚Äôs all normal. 

How do I move past these feelings of insecurity? How can I trust him more after just recently getting that message from another woman? How do I voice my concerns without him getting defensive?

His parents moved out two months ago and we finally have the place to ourselves. We will be living in this house for about six years if everything goes to plan. My boyfriend I‚Äôll call Nick has a best friend (18m) I‚Äôll call Zach got arrested about three weeks ago. Zach got two felony charges for possession. Zach had a talk with his family three days after he got arrested and Zach pretty much blames his family for everything in his childhood. His mom is bipolar and a narcissist she wasn‚Äôt really a good mother from what I‚Äôve heard but she wasn‚Äôt ever physically abusing just mentally abusing. He didn‚Äôt have the worst childhood. Anyway Zach disowned his family and has chosen to go no contact with almost every family member. His court date is in late November and he has decided to try to get away from his charges by saying he blames his family for his childhood. Saying that they screwed him in life. He has graduated high school and is currently in college. And he basically expects that he will be staying with Nick and I on holidays and during summers for this year and the coming year. And possibly his whole college career about four years. My best friend (19f) I‚Äôll call Ivy and I have been friends for 7 years. Ivy has asked us to stay with us from December to February. Because of her situation at home she will move out in February and get an apartment with her cousin. They will both be paying rent and we have the room for both. But I feel that Zach is dependent on Nick too much and just expects Nick to help him whenever he is in trouble. Zach is an attention seeker all he does is try to get sympathy from others and he generally irritates the living crap out of me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting/what to do with Zach.

I knew going in there would interrupt since i‚Äôm trying to wean off of breastfeeding, so I decided to use my partner‚Äôs phone to browse instagram. As soon as I opened his phone, his bank details were on the screen, showing over 5k in credit card debt.

When they came out from putting my son to sleep, I steered the conversation towards possible debt and he said that he had 2k in credit card debt. I told him point blank that I knew he was lying about the amount because I accidentally saw it on his phone. 

He was immediately defensive, asking why I was on his phone. He then apologized and tried to explain away the debt, stating that his recent car repairs had been 4k but that he had paid that off and felt he was doing good. I told him it didn‚Äôt matter to me that he had debt in that amount, it only mattered that he lied, especially because i‚Äôve asked about debt before and he said he had none. 

He kept offering defense and it came out that he also lied about having paid off the car debt. I told him, at that point, I had no trust in him, because he had just lied directly to my face 2x in a row, and couldn‚Äôt even tell me why he lied, since I didn‚Äôt care about the debt itself as much as the lying. 

Also, He always has access to my phone and my laptop, and he knows I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who feels the need to hide their electronics. I don‚Äôt go snooping, but I should be able to use it for calls, texting, internet, etc. We have already agreed on that boundary.

It has been exactly 21 days (3 weeks) since the moment you broke my heart. We were together for 2.5 years and were always committed to one another. We had worked through more complex problems than the one that eventually broke us up; we had overcome more complex challenges, but for some reason, you weren't committed this time. This time, after all the promises of being there for me, the times you called me your soulmate, and all the promises we made that we were in it for the long run, you weren't? You left; You didn't want to try and didn't even let us talk it out. I don't know what happened, but if you see this, I told you I would do anything, but it didn't matter. You wanted out; suddenly, you didn't see a future with me. I don't know what happened; maybe you lost feelings; I had been there several times during our relationship. The spark faded, and the bright shit wasn't as bright. Do you know what I did? I stayed, worked it, and the feelings and love returned. I stayed because that's what we promised each other we would do. We promised each other we would make it work no matter what.

We met during the pandemic; maybe we were too young or naive‚Äîwe were each other's first love, first relationship, first everything. We were in our; little world for most of our time together; I became a part of your family, spending time with your Mom and Dad; Sisters, and we visited each other's grandparents together. We other's in a bubble together, and we fell madly head over heels in love with one another. You made me a Christmas tree the first Christmas we spent together with ornaments with pictures of us. You gave me a blanket with pictures of our faces scattered everywhere. For valentines day this year (the second one we spent together), faces carved you a box to hold your crystals and gave you a jar with 100 things i loved about you. We lived four minutes away from each other and for 2.5 years spent 6-7 days a week together and on the weekends you slept over at my house. We would text all day, and facetime for hours before bed. We could'nt get enough of each other.

We talked about marriage and that we would move in together after I graduated college. We talked about being the parents who would smoke a joint when the kids went to bed. We had our inside jokes, laughs, stories, our adventures.

We had some problems because of your Co-Dependency and the fact that you wanted to spend 24/7 together. It took a while but we figured out boundarys and everything.

Things started opening up at the beginning of the semester and you started hanging out with a guy who you met through one of your life time friends. Lets call the life time friend, Lauren and Lets call this new guy friend Dylan. You and Dylan would smoke weed after class for an hour like twice a week. I was uncomfortable because I didnt like the idea of you hanging with another guy and it took me a while to figure everything out and situate it in my own head, but eventually i became okay with it. I have confidence that you weren't cheating on me, because the weekend before you broke up with me, you got invited by Lauren to go hang at Dylans house and Lauren and You kept telling me to come over. You wanted me to meet Dylan so that i knew there was nothing wrong. I felt weird and maybe that's my fault, but you ended up staying with me that day.

Two weeks before we broke up, you surprised me with a bouquet and a card saying that I was your soulmate and that you would always be there for me. It was National Boyfriends Day. You said I made you the happiest girl in the world. A few days before you dumped me, you talked about the winter and how you wanted to watch all the Harry Potter movies with me. A few days before we broke up, we made an apple pie from the apples we had picked the weekend before. A few days before you broke my heart, we went to dinner, and you told me all the qualities you loved about me.

We got into a fight over plans for the weekend, we were supposed to spend the weekend together, but you suddenly were invited to spend the weekend with Lauren at her college. Dylan was gonna be there too. You even invited me to come with you, but i declined, which i regret now. However i told you you should go, and then i realized and begged you to stay. I know i made a mistake. I know that was wrong of me but i had this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach. I made mistakes in how we talked about it, but I told you I needed you because my mental health was not good, and I didn't want to be alone for the weekend. It was the first time i asked you to do something like that, to just stay back for me because i needed you. You said you wanted to go, and when you said that, I stopped begging you to stay but i I kept asking you to talk to me, and you wouldn't. You just refused to come over to talk, I said some things I shouldn't have, and I admit that, but you had switched overnight into someone I didn't recognize. you went completely cold and avoidant. You weren't the caring, loving person I knew, the person who wrote me love letters and sweet messages or said they would always be there for me. I could tell something was wrong, so I asked you to talk to me, and you kept saying ill talk to you Sunday, ill talk Sunday. You were cold and distant starting on Thursday. We were supposed to have dinner with my family on Friday, but you refused to come over because you didn't want to talk to me and then went to your friend's college early. We talked in the car on the way up, and things seemed promising, but then you arrived, and I texted you, ""goodnight, my love!! sweet dreams,"" to which you responded, ""goodnight!""

I wanted to make us work, so I spent the day before trying my best to figure out precisely what to do. I wrote you a letter about how much I loved you and how much I wanted to make our relationship work. I printed out articles on conflict resolution to try and help us. You ignored me the whole weekend, and I called you when you told me you were driving back on Sunday. I was in the staples parking lot, having picked up all the things I had printed out.

You told me on Facetime as you where driving back that you were breaking up with me. I was shocked; this was not the worst thing we had gone through. I was confused, and You had said you would talk to me about everything on Sunday and that we would finally have the time to work things out. You were on Facetime and told me that I was too controlling and that you couldn't be in a relationship with me anymore. I cried so hard; I begged you to stay and let's make this work. You told me you didn't want to make it work. You told me you didn't see a future with me anymore. I cried so hard; I wondered why you weren't letting me fix it, what was happening. I didn't know what to ask you; I was so blindsided; I thought this was an issue we would figure out; I had no idea that breaking up was on the table. I didnt say all the things i wanted to say.

You were cold and distant; I drove home sobbing and called you when I got home. I told you I loved you, and we hung up. You told me you loved me; you called me Baby.

I spent the next two weeks in a state of complete depression; I started tearing up in class and had to bite my cheek so hard that I tasted blood so that I would regain my composure. I started going to therapy twice a week, wasn't eating and didn't sleep for days. My mom slept on the couch in my room at night because she was terrified that I would do something stupid. I didn't contact you, though; I wanted to give you space cause I was praying you would return. I felt like I was withdrawing from drugs. I felt awful like I had ruined the most important thing in my life. I loved you with every aching bone in my body; I wanted to talk with you more than I wanted to breathe. I wanted to be with you more than I wanted to live.

Your parents, who referred to me as their son, didn't reach out to see how I was. You didn't even reach out to see how I was. My mom texted your dad to check in on you and was ignored. It was like this wall had suddenly appeared where there was no care or tenderness for one another anymore. For two weeks, I wondered what I needed to do, I drafted letters apologizing and begging for a second chance. I felt like I had ruined everything. I wanted to fix it so badly, but I kept wondering why you wouldn't let me.

2 Weeks Later, you sent me this text:

*hi, i wanted to reach out to let you know where my head at. I never wanted to lose you as my best friend, and I can still picture us being friends in the future. I can't continue to be in a relationship, and I want to experience life on my own. I never had intentions to end this on a bad note, and I always wish you the best with everything in your life. We need to take this time to grow as individuals, and eventually, we can be friends and go thrifting together. This is never how I wanted us to end, and it has been not easy to process, but it's for the best, and i appreciate you for everything*

I was confused; this was much different than the reason you gave me for breaking up in the first place. I didn't respond, though, because I had no idea how to. I felt whiplashed, We had been together for 2.5 years, and there was this message as if we were just a few months flings. I thought you would eventually reach out to talk, to get some insight into what changed so quickly into what happened. What I got was a text that felt like it reopened all the wounds I had.

It was Halloween weekend, you and I had plans to go to a little beach town, and you were going to dress as Dorothy. I was barely functional. I could barely speak without crying.

You posted pictures on Instagram that night in a playboy bunny Halloween costume. You were at your friend's college. I was crushed, you looked happy.

Why where you happy?

Why weren't you wanting to talk with me?

Why where you okay?

Where was the love?

I would have done anything to make our relationship whole again, I was giving you space so that hopefully we could talk.

After the weekend and a chat with my therapist I asked you to drop off my stuff, I didnt want to break no contact and I wanted to show some semblance of strength regardless of how non-existent any strength was. I was transactional and so where you. You dropped it off, the hoodies filled a Garbage bag. Some of them smelled like you and I cried as I inhaled the scent, my favorite scent in the entire world.

How is it so easy for you to leave behind all we had, without a single thought or conversation. We where best friends for 2.5 years and you completely changed.

Today has now been 3 weeks and I am still gutted. I cant stop crying and sometimes i feel like I'll never be happy again. I cant concentrate on homework or school, I don't want to do anything. Even though I've never been into drinking, I have started drinking at night to try and get a few hours of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and have a hard time falling back asleep for hours. I dream of you sometimes, usually its you laughing at me or breaking up with me again.

I deleted Instagram and Snapchat. I blocked you on TikTok so i wouldn't have to see anything you posted.

You've taken down all the pictures of us from your Instagram. It's almost insane how much of a gap there now is in your profile. 2.5 years completely erased. I took them down too.

I boxed up all your stuff, My room is incredibly sparse without all the pictures and paintings you made me.

I can barely do anything, I visited my sister this weekend and cried in several restaurants. I don't even know what to do going forward. My friend showed me a picture you posted on snapchat of you with lauren and dylan and it looks like you are wearing dylan's hoodie. Then you posted another picture with dylan. a selfie. 

Are you with him now? Are you still just friends? Maybe you needed a hoodie because i took all of mine back. Idk. Maybe you are just friends or maybe you are more. I don't know, It's only been 3 weeks.

I wish you had given us another chance. I wish you had given us a chance to talk. I would have given you anything to make things work. I am still madly head over heels in love with you. I have no contacted you in 21 days. Everyday i feel like shit, but i have not begged you i have not tried reaching out to you, I am giving you the break up you wanted but i still cant seem to move on. I dont want to admit that it's over because it happened so suddenly. It was like one second we where each others whole world and then in an instant you where gone. I want to apologize, I want to work things out, I just want to talk. Thats all i want is a conversation, maybe at some point but idk.

I miss you more than i can ever describe. I can't believe we have become strangers. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. I feel like you've died, but you aren't dead. You are 4 minutes away. I look at every car that i pass when i drive through town and wonder if I'll see you. I haven't seen you yet, Idk what i would do if i did. I guess i wanna know that you still exist. I wish this was a dream and I would wake up to us laying in bed, 4 days before you broke up with me and i was holding you.

I miss you in a gnawing desperate way. I miss everything we had and I would do anything for just one more day with you.

I don't know why things changed so quickly or what will happen in the future but I am still incredibly in love with you with every muscle of my being. I keep looking back at all the time we had together and want to tell myself to not take it for granted. (not that i did take it for granted) I just wish I had known the last time i kissed you was the last time i kissed you, I would have burned the memory into my mind and savored it. I wish i had known the last time i would be around you was the last time.

I miss you with every molecule of my being. I miss you through the heartbreak and pain. I miss you, i miss you, I miss you.

I don't know if hope is bad, just everything happened so quickly I don't know.

If you see this, let me know. Give me a call, I'll answer. If you wanted a star, I would fly into space and get you one myself. If you wanted a kidney, I would give it to you without hesitation. I would give you anything for just one more day with you.

today is 3 weeks since we broke up. 21 days has felt like an eternity.

I don't know what happened.

Did you fall out of love with me? Did you just want to be single? We started dating young, so i get why you would want to be single but what happened? I wonder how your family is. I miss them, I used to see them almost every day and now I haven't seen them in 3 weeks. I miss your cats. I miss the life we had because I had no idea it would end so abruptly. I dont know what to do, I feel so detached from reality.

I wish you would just call. You called me hundreds of times throughout our relationship and all I want is one single call.

I have so many questions, they run through my head everyday. Every second.

I don't know how to do this, I don't know how to exist without you. I feel like I have been cut free from whats holding me to earth, I feel as if I'm floating free of any true anchor. The sudden upheaval of my world has destroyed me completely. I no longer know who i am, who you are or what i am even made of.

Sometimes I think about if a comet would come down, before impact i would break no contact just to tell you i love you one more time. My last message would be for you, you would be the last thing on my mind.

All i know is that I want you back, but that's not a choice i can make for you. So I will continue to give you space and try to move forward. I miss our love story and I truly don't know how to be without you.

I have never said anything and honestly don‚Äôt care because I think she is beautiful regardless.

We normally live near each other but the past month I have been overseas as my dad moved there. I am coming back in a month though. Well here‚Äôs what happened yesterday.

She went to the beach with her sister and they were taking bikini pics of each other. Later that night she sent me some photos of her and I said she looked hot and good. A bit later she got sad because she said she has gained weight. I said I haven‚Äôt noticed and I think you are beautiful. About an hour later, she then sent me a picture of her sister (18F) in a bikini with her face covered and asked ‚Äúdo I look good in this photo‚Äù. I was pretty tired and didn‚Äôt look too closely and said ‚Äúyes you look stunning‚Äù, assuming it was her. She then got really mad at me for saying her sister looked hot. I didn‚Äôt know it was her sister and assumed it was her as she implied it was her. They also happened to be wearing the same colour bikini. They look very similar and have the same hair, skin and basically everything else except the face. 

My girlfriend now isn‚Äôt answering my calls and says I should go date her sister. I only want my girlfriend and would never go near her sister. Any advice on how to move forward?

We make enough income to cover all the bills, rent, and other expenses to move out together and still have money left over. We went on apartment tours recently and found a place we are very interested in that's for a good price and close to both school and work. I brought the paperwork home and it came with a photo of the layout of the apartment. I showed this to my dad because I was excited and I wanted him to feel involved and more comfortable with the idea. Even though I'll move out with or without his approval, I still want him to be happy for me. He told me I was annoying him by talking about it all. He once even told me he'd take away my health care if I got a nose ring, which later turned into my stepmom screaming in my face for disrespecting my dad for asking again. 

I'm at the point though where I am wondering if when the time comes for us to sign on the apartment if I just tell them the day of. Talking about moving out obviously pissed him off and he's been against the idea since the beginning. His points are 1) I'm his little girl and 2) I'd be waisting my money. I totally get the fact that by moving out I would be spending way more then I am saving currently. It's just that I would be happier on my own. My step mom can change on the flip of a coin and my dad emotionally unavailable. She's verbally berated me in front of him and he's done nothing. I personally don't want a relationship with her anymore and if he stands by her actions then why should I stand by him? 

I don't know what to do. It's hard. I move out and risk my dad's disapproval and maybe a strained relationship or more? Or stay at home where I'm unhappy and don't feel like I'm growing and put up with the constant stress of my disapproving family? I don't know anymore. I want to move out but I'm scared.

When we started dating over 2 years ago she had no tattoos. A few months in, she got two very small tattoos. Then, a month ago she said she was getting another small one and ended up getting a huge tattoo the whole way from her shoulder to her elbow.

Honestly I never loved her first two tattoos but I didn't massively care, but when I saw the latest one it just really hit home that I find them really unattractive, and they draw the eye like a blemish where it's hard not to focus on them. Still I didn't say anything bad, told her it was nice and I was glad she was happy with it. I just intended to try and ignore it and not care about it.

But then later she asked how I would feel if she kept getting more, and I told her that honestly I don't find tattoos attractive and that while it's her body, I really would prefer her without more. She was disappointed but understood we all have our preferences.

That was sort of it, or so I thought.

Today we got into a talk because she had been telling me to get a job in her city (where I used to live) and move in with her. So I had started looking, applying etc. But then she starts talking about maybe moving to some other country to do a degree there, so I'm like...what about the plan? You've been telling me to move in with you over and over but you also might just ditch me as soon as I do?

So she says she's not sure, I say she needs to communicate better when it comes to life plans etc. Then she says that she might stay in the city, and that she'd been applying for tattoo artist apprenticeships and had even gotten an offer for one.

Again, wtf? After 2 years I can't really believe that she makes these big life decisions while leaving me completely in the dark. She said she didn't want to tell me because I'm not into tattoos and that if she became a tattoo artist she would definitely get more tattoos and she didn't want to think about how I'd react.

Idk I can't really think of a worse way of handling it. Instead of giving me the chance to talk it over with her she just did whatever she wanted and was just going to let me know about it once it had already happened. I feel like I should stress here that I've never been very vocally against tattoos or her becoming an artist, just that I don't find tattoos attractive. From like one conversation. Nothing that I would have thought would make her hide something like this from me.

So then we got into a big fight, she asked for my opinion on tattoos, and I gave it, and then she got mad at me for saying it. I'm a bit worried about how impulsive it all seems as well - like becoming a tattoo artist, she got a cheap gun off Wish and practiced some messy scribbles on the fake skin stuff a while ago, seemingly a handful of times, and they did not look good. She only mentioned that maybe being a tattoo artist would be nice like a few times, never indicated that it was actually what she wanted to do, and it still seems like It's just a random option she's settled on, among others like graphic design etc, which I'm a bit concerned about given the time and dedication it takes to become a tattoo artist. From what I've read, it doesn't seem like a profession you can just pick up on a whim.


TLDR; gf of over 2 years knows I find tattoos a turn-off. She wants to get more tattoos and apparently become a tattoo artist, and has been applying for positions in secret.

So the situation did begin in cold Thursday day, I was going to talk to my crush, when I was approached by my crush classmate Gloria.

So she basically said to me to calm down, and that I was making him uncomfortable, she added that she is married and not jealous of me, I asked how does she know that, she then said that he didn‚Äôt tell her anything is just that EVERYONE knows.

Needless to say I was shocked, I did cry a lot thinking that he didn‚Äôt even enjoyed my company and that he disliked me.

I honestly didn‚Äôt have any ideia of anything that I did that would make him uncomfortable around me, so I started to think and only 4 possible things came to my mind, and my friend thought.

1- I talked to him sometimes when he was going towards the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt know he was going lol, at first I thought that he was talking a walk, now I know that if he is heading towards the bathroom side he is going to the bathroom lol.

2- I did accompanied him to the train station, maybe he was uncomfortable idk.

3- I did go his class to talk him but after 2 minutes he stooped and begun talking to other people, and I stayed there in the spot in my cellphone thinking that he would return talking to me but nope, if I knew he would talk to me after that I would go back to my class.

4- I was flirting with him, maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested and was uncomfortable.

Next week in a Thursday again, I said to my friend Jessica what Gloria did say to me and she thought that it was weird, because if he didn‚Äôt liked me he wouldn‚Äôt greet me kissing my cheek like he did to his other friends, then reveled some bombastic information talking to my other friend, that Gloria sees Leo as some kinda of son??? I was like WTF üíÄüíÄüíÄ.

The next day Gloria did go towards my direction to talk to me she did say how it now was much better smiling(creepy Af)  And that now that now that I am less sticky we can even be friends and was like what gurl, you know dawn well that I want to kiss that juicy lips, you gave me the stares when I was showing my number to him, you clearly knows what I want from the way you did say, she says that we can be friends know like she maintained me in check now, and now that I am tamed I can have her permission to be his friend, yuck ü§¢.

IDk if I am crazy but the shit she is doing isn‚Äôt creepy right? Like I am definitely scared by this nutso behavior, and honestly I will definitely not be intimidated but I wonder at what what extent goes her feelings for him, and more do I need to buy some pepper spray lol, just kidding I will buy it anyway.

The worst shit is that she sits my behind crush and accompanies him to the train station so she hears the majority of ours conversations.

But honestly the big elephant in the room is if I should tell him or not, like if that situation was happening with me I would like the guy to tell me, because no way I would hang out with such a weirdo, if I am being since I want to tell him but I don‚Äôt know how and when, that is the question.

Everyone think that this shit is weird one friend is enjoying the drama, my therapist thing something stinks, some internet friend thinks it is fucking weird and my friend Jessica thinks that maybe she just did go overboard but she sees him as good friend(doubt it, and my friend is her second semester so she does know him for one year and is the overprotective, there is a possibility that knows him outside university but idk.)

Hiiii, I‚Äôm a F21. I‚Äôm in college, I‚Äôm a junior and I‚Äôm from Pennsylvania, and I live in a college apartment with 2 other girls. We moved in in august and they were both pretty nice when we met they also told me That they are pretty clean people and are east going. (They‚Äôre both seniors.  And It‚Äôs a 3 bedroom 3 bathroom with a living room and a kitchen.) 

And it‚Äôs pretty nice. Ever since we moved in, the kitchen has been filthy everyday. And my one roommate (we‚Äôll call her Jules) she‚Äôs left a dish/dishes in the sink everyday since august. The sink has not been empty since august. She will clean her dishes, cook, use them and put them back in. The other roommate (let‚Äôs call her Jenny) has washed her dishes and she doesn‚Äôt leave them in there. The counters are always filthy from them and I have to scrub the counters and stove everyday. The floor is always dirty and I have to sweep it multiple times a week. The trash NEVER gets taken out and i have been the only one that takes it out ever. It grosses me out. The one thing that bothers me is that thier rooms are spotless. (I know because I went into Jenny‚Äôs room briefly before.) and it upsets me. Should i not be cleaning up thier mess?

In 2020 covid hit, and they were always hanging out without me, posting it on social media. Ended up deleting social media because I just couldn't take the lonely and heart ache I got from seeing them all party or hang at the mall without me.

Recently since this summer, started hanging with them again, things were going smoothly, until today when the topic of me 'disappearing' for a year from social media. I told them the genuine truth, that their social media stories of them hanging without me were causing me mental health related issues, and thought it'd be best to quit. They then started to argue, stating how they kept messaging me(like 1 message a month type of ordeal), and I wasn't responsive, even tho I did occasionally reply to her 'how are you?' messages, but often didn't reply because I don't just want a texting type of friendship, I want a 'hey let's hangout' type of friendship, this gave them the advantage to turn and say ""well if you weren't going to respond to me, why would I invite you out?"". 

The thing is, there was this one big party in someone's apartment that occurred on my 20th birthday, all of them had the decency to shoot a happy birthday text but not an invite, I managed to see their  social media stories from that day, and I wish I didn't because now I just get bitter and sour thinking about the fact they could've, should've invited me to a party on my birthday, while I just remained alone in my room sobbing the majority of the day.

They got all defensive about that too when I brought it up, saying how I should've asked to join or invited myself.

I stated how it's in the past, nothing can be changed and let's move on but they kept bring it up throughout the night and was pretty obvious they were texting each other about me on the bus ride home. 

One of the friends gave me a belated 22nd birthday card which I was grateful for, but wish she hadn't, it makes me feel guilty for stating my upsetness and to get a belated birthday card afterwards, feels like I am the bad guy. 

Her birthday comes up in a month or so, now I feel slightly forced to remain in this friendship because she had just given me a belated birthday card and giftcard. (she is the nicest out of them all, just don't like all the shit talking about a former friend she does).

Im sorry if you saw me post this before but im supposed to talk to her tomorrow and im pretty scared so im going to try and get every bit of help i can 

(Sorta) TLDR of my old post: my gf (18) of 2 years made a guy friend within the first days of university who she shares a class with. Im an insecure person and have been known to be jealous so i was uneasy but gave her the benefit of the doubt Especially considering how transparent she had been. Time goes by and she stopped acting so transparent, started hanging out with him alone (a previously set no no for us) skipping classes together and sometimes lying/being sketchy about them hanging out together. 

TLDR of this post: my gfs guy friend is straight up hitting on her and while she isnt engaging him she isnt stopping it, telling me about it or reacting negatively (just sends a üòÇ likes his messages and moves on) after she knows im already a bit uncomfortable with that particular relationship and had an argument about her lying to me about her company/school life. Idrk how to feel or what do if i even should do anything 


So after my gf became very close friends very quickly with a guy she met at University i tried to suppress my previous trust issues and let her embrace this new freedom without being my overbearing self. Early on she recognized that it was the type of thing that would normally bug me a little bit, so she was very consistently and vocally transparent about what they did who was all there (because we had a sorta rule about not having 1 on 1 hangouts with single people that we don't mutually know with reasonable exceptions like work, class things, parties, etc.) after a while she stops updating because she had privately been hanging out with this guy and didnt want to tell me including getting breakfast hanging out and having lunch daily plus sometimes skipping classes together to hang out. I saw some very questionable ""jokes"" he made towards her on her instagram and decided it was a solid enough point to justify having a conversation and checking some suspicions and feeling out what was up.
She tells me about how its just jokes and she doesnt encourage it anyways, she does ""üòÇ"" at all of them and hearts the messages but i accepted her point that she didnt respond positively and moved on.
We talked about how she was lying to me about things and she said she was scared of my reaction if she did tell me (ive never even raised my voice at her and even our ""arguments"" are very calm civil and always focus on constructiveness so idk why shed be scared enough to hide it) and we both agreed that she would try and be transparent and set boundaries and I would be more relaxed about her activities and friends and such. 

Well its been a minute and he's sending blatantly sexual memes/jokes like about how he looks great naked and she needs to see or  jokes about them being sexual, texting her at 11:30 about how NNN is killing him and he  wished someone would help, and even had a convo where he ""let her in on a secret that guys don't care about boob size and it's all about shape and feel"" after she mentioned, it was one of her insecurities in Conversation he talks about  how ""she has great boobs a great ass and given how they jiggle its more than enough""and asked ""what is you bf not complimenting them enough?"" Now ik a lot of this can just be bro-ish conversations but she talks to him more than ive seen her talk to any girl friend ever and it seems like shes gotten uncomfortably close with this guy and idk how to feel what to do or if anything, even needs to be done, considering she hasn't directly engaged anything he said (except the boob/butt convo) 

i feel like at the very least he doesnt respect the boundaries of our relationship and she never seems to express them. idk what to say but this feels like something I should address so really I guess I'm looking for whether or not my feelings are valid and how to go about handling them without damaging my relationship.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7515242,public,self,Need advice about my gfs guy friend hitting on her (post history has some backstory too),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ys0i2p/need_advice_about_my_gfs_guy_friend_hitting_on/,all_ads,6,,,

So the situation did begin in cold Thursday day, I was going to talk to my crush, when I was approached by my crush classmate Gloria.

So she basically said to me to calm down, and that I was making him uncomfortable, she added that she is married and not jealous of me, I asked how does she know that, she then said that he didn‚Äôt tell her anything is just that EVERYONE knows.

Needless to say I was shocked, I did cry a lot thinking that he didn‚Äôt even enjoyed my company and that he disliked me.

I honestly didn‚Äôt have any ideia of anything that I did that would make him uncomfortable around me, so I started to think and only 4 possible things came to my mind, and my friend thought.

1- I talked to him sometimes when he was going towards the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt know he was going lol, at first I thought that he was talking a walk, now I know that if he is heading towards the bathroom side he is going to the bathroom lol.

2- I did accompanied him to the train station, maybe he was uncomfortable idk.

3- I did go his class to talk him but after 2 minutes he stooped and begun talking to other people, and I stayed there in the spot in my cellphone thinking that he would return talking to me but nope, if I knew he would talk to me after that I would go back to my class.

4- I was flirting with him, maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested and was uncomfortable.

Next week in a Thursday again, I said to my friend Jessica what Gloria did say to me and she thought that it was weird, because if he didn‚Äôt liked me he wouldn‚Äôt greet me kissing my cheek like he did to his other friends, then reveled some bombastic information talking to my other friend, that Gloria sees Leo as some kinda of son??? I was like WTF üíÄüíÄüíÄ.

The next day Gloria did go towards my direction to talk to me she did say how it now was much better smiling(creepy Af)  And that now that now that I am less sticky we can even be friends and was like what gurl, you know dawn well that I want to kiss that juicy lips, you gave me the stares when I was showing my number to him, you clearly knows what I want from the way you did say, she says that we can be friends know like she maintained me in check now, and now that I am tamed I can have her permission to be his friend, yuck ü§¢.

IDk if I am crazy but the shit she is doing isn‚Äôt creepy right? Like I am definitely scared by this nutso behavior, and honestly I will definitely not be intimidated but I wonder at what what extent goes her feelings for him, and more do I need to buy some pepper spray lol, just kidding I will buy it anyway.

The worst shit is that she sits my behind crush and accompanies him to the train station so she hears the majority of ours conversations.

But honestly the big elephant in the room is if I should tell him or not, like if that situation was happening with me I would like the guy to tell me, because no way I would hang out with such a weirdo, if I am being since I want to tell him but I don‚Äôt know how and when, that is the question.

I think she got really jealous about the friendships and opportunities I got while at uni, but she didn't realize the stuff I went through while there ( a close friend passed away, she told me it wasn't a big deal, so I stopped tell them anything, but I used to be kicked out of my house middle of the night, money taken away so I worked 3 jobs to put me through school, poor mental health etc). With all this going on, lor had made a new group chat, Kim included, and said things behind my back that weren't true. 
A year later, Kim hosted a party and invited me. One of the girls let it slip about the group chat, so I asked but they didn't clarify. I started to feel uncomfortable and left, and it came out after that they had excluded me from all events and such over the course of the year. I thought kim wasnt involved as she was out of the country for the duration of this. Of course, I blocked them off all my socials except for Kim, as I thought she didn't have anything to do with it. A few years later, which is now, Kim had showed me some messages that they sent about me, calling me weak/pathetic, how my boyfriend (now husband) only dated me to be nice, how stupid I am etc. As I am scrolling I noticed she said some stuff too in the chat ( like how I ""forced her to meet my boyfriend"" when in fact, she asked to meet him). It put a sour taste in my mouth and I gave the phone back to her, I've seen enough at that point. How can they still talk about me after all these years lol. 

At this point, I want to cut her off. She's evidently a source of information for  them, and it's like, when we do meet it's like pulling teeth. It makes me so upset. She didn't make time for my wedding when I asked her to be a bridesmaid, which is fine, but what burned even more is that she didn't even send a card or well wishes for the day itself. It's evident that we have run it's course and she isn't there for me for in good faith. 

I am pretty upset over this. The whole issue with that group already put me in a loop and destroyed my self esteem and confidence for a loooooong time . I felt like I finally got it back, and it's shot again. I do have an amazing husband, and a terrific group of friends currently who I've been good friend with for years, but I know cutting her off is not going to be easy.

I moved out the instant I could afford to after my higher education (against everyone's wishes) and I'm starting to get a personality back.

So the situation did begin in cold Thursday day, I was going to talk to my crush, when I was approached by my crush classmate Gloria.

So she basically said to me to calm down, and that I was making him uncomfortable, she added that she is married and not jealous of me, I asked how does she know that, she then said that he didn‚Äôt tell her anything is just that EVERYONE knows.

Needless to say I was shocked, I did cry a lot thinking that he didn‚Äôt even enjoyed my company and that he disliked me.

I honestly didn‚Äôt have any ideia of anything that I did that would make him uncomfortable around me, so I started to think and only 4 possible things came to my mind, and my friend thought.

1- I talked to him sometimes when he was going towards the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt know he was going lol, at first I thought that he was talking a walk, now I know that if he is heading towards the bathroom side he is going to the bathroom lol.

2- I did accompanied him to the train station, maybe he was uncomfortable idk.

3- I did go his class to talk him but after 2 minutes he stooped and begun talking to other people, and I stayed there in the spot in my cellphone thinking that he would return talking to me but nope, if I knew he would talk to me after that I would go back to my class.

4- I was flirting with him, maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested and was uncomfortable.

Next week in a Thursday again, I said to my friend Jessica what Gloria did say to me and she thought that it was weird, because if he didn‚Äôt liked me he wouldn‚Äôt greet me kissing my cheek like he did to his other friends, then reveled some bombastic information talking to my other friend, that Gloria sees Leo as some kinda of son??? I was like WTF üíÄüíÄüíÄ.

The next day Gloria did go towards my direction to talk to me she did say how it now was much better smiling(creepy Af)  And that now that now that I am less sticky we can even be friends and was like what gurl, you know dawn well that I want to kiss that juicy lips, you gave me the stares when I was showing my number to him, you clearly knows what I want from the way you did say, she says that we can be friends know like she maintained me in check now, and now that I am tamed I can have her permission to be his friend, yuck ü§¢.

IDk if I am crazy but the shit she is doing isn‚Äôt creepy right? Like I am definitely scared by this nutso behavior, and honestly I will definitely not be intimidated but I wonder at what what extent goes her feelings for him, and more do I need to buy some pepper spray lol, just kidding I will buy it anyway.

The worst shit is that she sits my behind crush and accompanies him to the train station so she hears the majority of ours conversations.

But honestly the big elephant in the room is if I should tell him or not, like if that situation was happening with me I would like the guy to tell me, because no way I would hang out with such a weirdo, if I am being since I want to tell him but I don‚Äôt know how and when, that is the question.

Everyone think that this shit is weird one friend is enjoying the drama, my therapist thing something stinks, some internet friend thinks it is fucking weird and my friend Jessica thinks that maybe she just did go overboard but she sees him as good friend(doubt it, and my friend is her second semester so she does know him for one year and is the overprotective, there is a possibility that knows him outside university but idk.)

He didn't answer the majority of my questions. Like usual. I'm just deep down in my bones, tired. I just want to have what we had in the beginning but I know that wasn't real either. I don't think any of our almost 13-year relationship and 7-year marriage has ever been real with him. I'm just sad about all these feelings, time, and love that seem to be wasted and ignored by him.

I‚Äôm not really sure what I want from posting this, but any advice or kind words will be so, so appreciated. I‚Äôll try my best to explain what‚Äôs going on, but it‚Äôs just hard to explain everything via a Reddit post..

Basically what‚Äôs going on is that I‚Äôve come to realize that my husband has become emotionally abusive. It began after the birth of our daughter a little over 3 years ago and it has slowly gotten worse. It started to get a little better this past year, but we just had our second baby two months ago and it‚Äôs gotten bad again. There have been arguments where he‚Äôs said things like, ‚ÄúFuck off‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you fucking stupid?‚Äù 

There was one argument where I told him I felt like he was trying to make me feel stupid, and how it hurt. He got so angry that I felt that way then walked off and slammed the door. In front of our daughter. Later as he was leaving to pick up lunch I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I made you angry.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúRiiiight‚Äù and slammed the door again. I opened the door and said, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt slam the door,‚Äù and then he mocked me, word for word, in a whiny voice, waiving his arms around. Then he got in the car and left.

Emotional abuse‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so hard for me to even stomach the thought. For a long time I fought so hard to deny it, and it breaks my heart to admit that it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs been like this for a while now but I‚Äôve been too afraid to tell anyone. Probably out of shame or guilt. Or because I don‚Äôt want to admit to myself that I‚Äôm in an emotionally abusive relationship. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

What‚Äôs weird is that a lot of times, he can be so loving and caring (which I guess is common for abusers.) Other times he‚Äôs pretty of indifferent (which is most of the time.) But almost every day, in some way or another, he finds a way to hurt me. Whether it‚Äôs by being overly critical‚Ä¶or by insulting me, mocking me, shaming me, or belittling my feelings (or dismissing them altogether.)

And he‚Äôs so negative. ALL THE TIME. About every little thing, not just things involving me. When it is about me (which is often), he‚Äòs overly critical toward me about even the smallest of things. And he‚Äôs really good at gaslighting and making me feel crazy (sometimes by flat out calling me insane or psychotic.) 

Whenever there‚Äôs conflict, it‚Äôs always my fault and if I dare to feel victimized he calls me pathetic. Anytime I confront him about anything he‚Äôs doing wrong, he becomes angry and volatile, and always finds a way to turn it back around on me and make it my fault. He makes me feel so bad about myself a lot of times. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do anymore and could use some advice or encouragement.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7515152,public,self,Pretty sure it‚Äôs emotional abuse.

Basically, for around 3 months before I got pregnant he was cheating on me, and treating me like complete shit always lying etc. I found out, brought the girl over to our apartment and me and her confronted him together. Ever since then I was done with him. I always told myself if I get cheated on, I'm leaving and I'm done because I dont deserve that. Well, plot twist I ended up finding out I was pregnant a month later after the confrontation and now we're trying to work things out. Honestly, I hate him and resent him for everything he put me through. I was at one of my lowest points because he made me feel worthless. I'm not even really that nice to him anymore either honestly, so I dont understand why he even wants to stay with me. I don't really see a point in being with him beyond the fact that I want my child to experience a happy 2 parent household, and that I enjoy dick and cuddles from time to time. It's been since July that I found out and confronted him so it's been almost 5 months now and my feelings haven't really changed. Still don't forgive, I think he's a terrible person, and I don't see myself ever getting over what he did to me. So we've made some ""changes"" I guess you could call it. He doesn't go to parties or the club anymore without me (so fucking stupid I know, like again, what's the point of us being together if I dont even trust you) I also told him that if he wants to be with me then there's certain people he's never gonna hang out with again, because I have no interest in being with him so tf and again so fucking stupid, why am I telling you who to hangout with I'm not your fucking mom. So anyways he went on a trip to visit family and ended up going to the club with some of his friends from over there every night getting drunk ask (something that would never happen here) and I let it slide because I'm just so over fighting I dont have the energy because he doesn't listen anyways. Then his grandma dies, and he goes to where he grew up but here's the kicker ..he ends up going out and getting drunk at a club for the past like 3 days. Now, I personally wouldn't be partying if my grandma died but everyone copes and grieves differently so ima keep my mouth shut. So anyways, he was supposed to FaceTime me (we barely have spoke the past week, im trying to give him space to grieve but I also text him to make sure if he needs anything I'll help) anyways now I'm getting confused because he's now ignoring my texts and its been 2 hours. I call him and there's some girl in his air bnb. ALSO- he got a whole air bib when he has a home out there with his mother sister etc. anyways he tries saying it's his cousin and im like okay thats fine if you would have communicated this to me, but he doesn't communicate anything ever. I always find out things on the back end and then due to the past everything he does I think is sus. I can't help it and I'm very straightforward about this, I dont try to hide it. He knows I dont trust him and think he's a liar. Is it shitty of me to feel some type of way and say something because I've been keeping my mouth shut on his actions due to the fact that his grandma died, like im crazy but im not a crazy piece of shit.. but I also dont think someone grieving is a pass for them to get away with things.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7515137,public,self,"Am I obligated to be kind to my boyfriend, despite what he's done, just because his Grandma died?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ys067z/am_i_obligated_to_be_kind_to_my_boyfriend_despite/,all_ads,6,,,

despu√©s fueron 2 personas m√°s y le dijeron eso mismo y el solo se qued√≥ callado 

despu√©s no supe m√°s, pero mis amigos le agarraron idea debido al ego con que dijo eso, porque si, el sabe que es lindo y tiene un ego tremendo, la cosa es que no le dije nada sobre eso, ya que, que le dir√≠a por Dios? 

despu√©s de todo eso que pas√≥ el viernes, el ya no fue tan amable como tal conmigo, era m√°s cortante y digamos que seco, ya no buscaba tema de conversaci√≥n, estuve 3 d√≠as insistiendo para hablar y a √©l como que le daba igual, el lunes un compa√±ero le dijo lo mismo, que si quer√≠a conmigo o no, en ese momento el estaba con un amigo, y el amigo dijo que el no quer√≠a y el lo que hizo fue asentir con la cabeza, despu√©s de eso me sent√≠ s√∫per mal, pero horrible, y no le escrib√≠ m√°s, esa misma semana que el dijo que no quer√≠a nada, se fue, se fue del pa√≠s

Here‚Äôs some context. 

We moved into our own home last year in April, out of my parents house. We have a 2 year old. I don‚Äôt want to include the length of our relationship but I will for contextual purposes. We dated for 4 months and have been married for 3 years. We knew each other for a bit before dating and had a few mutual friends. If there‚Äôs questions I can go into the shotgun wedding but I‚Äôd like to, for the post, just get into the issue. (Also I know the biggest issue really stems from us not knowing each other well enough before marriage but there‚Äôs nothing I can really do about it now.)

He helps me absolutely none at all around the house or with the toddler. When we first moved out he was fine helping out around the house but slowly started doing less and less, both with cleaning and with the kid. We have an old ass trailer that he also really let some things go to shit on that I‚Äôm having to get my dad to fix, e.i. broken window that at least needs patching with tape that he won‚Äôt do. Or even my car that sat in the yard for a year with a flat while he told me every weekend he‚Äôd fix it for me. 

Lately it‚Äôs really come to a head. I‚Äôve been getting increasingly frustrated with his lack of help, mainly because we talk about it, he agrees to at least try, and nothing changes. My plate is getting more full by the second and I am so overwhelmed. I help babysit my 2yr old niece and 4 yr old nephew almost daily, my son has just been diagnosed with autism and has a severe speech delay so he‚Äôs seeing a specialist and therapist. I‚Äôm just doing every single thing on my own and I‚Äôm about to pull my hair out. 

Tonight we got into a huge fight bc I told him the autism specialist wants me to be working one-on-one with my kid 25 hours a week. I told him I REALLY need his help around the house bc of this, and he just shrugged and said ‚Äúso work with him 25 hours a week then clean the rest of the time.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit it really set something off in me, especially when he followed it up with ‚ÄúIm not cleaning.‚Äù I finally told him if he cant help me then I wont be helping him anymore. He can wash his own clothes, fix his own dinner, and take care of himself. He got pissy and threw some dishes that were sitting on the dryer in the floor. ‚ÄúWhy were they on the dryer?‚Äù you may ask.  I couldnt find the time between apt, grocery shopping, babysitting, and dinner to wash them and my kid had a virtual apt this morning so I needed them out of the background.

For almost two of those four he hasn't had a job. We live together and it's been just me supporting us. He says that he is actively applying and looking for jobs. I didn't really believe him, but wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Recently I realized that his email is still logged in on my phone. A lot of jobs, especially when applying online use email to communicate. His emails show that he's not applying like he says he is. Everytime I bring up the whole job thing he gets mad and it starts an argument. I have not brought up the email thing because I know he's just going to deny it and say he's applying anyways and I'm so tired. I don't want to argue or make him mad. The only time I actually see him applying is after an argument and I always feel bad. 

I think that part of our problem is he's perfectly happy staying exactly where he is for the entirety of his life. I'm not. I want to own a house and have dogs. I was 19 when we got together and I've changed and grown so so so much. I want a life, a decent future and I'm willing to give it my all except I can't. I can't save any money because I'm trying to support both of us. When I bring that up he tries to lay the blame on me. Hell say, ""I really don't ask for much, but you have to eat a certain way..."" If I went back to eating the way I was id be going back to throwing up every single day as I'm algeric to milk and have a very sensitive stomach. He doesn't have his license and doesn't want to have to walk and because of that and my hours he ""can only work certain days."" He will try to blame that on him not finding a job. 

I will admit that I am far from perfect. I don't really clean as much as I should because he doesn't do anything, I feel like he could at least keep the place clean, except he doesn't. The bathroom was super bad, so I finally cleaned it. As soon as I was done he had to go check it out and it still wasn't good enough for him. The bathroom was spotless, except, silly me, I forgot to clean behind the toilet. That really hurt. If I said something like that to him it would instantly cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do anymore. I tried to break up with him. I did break up with him, but it was so sad. I really hurt him and I hate hurting people because I know what it feels like.  It ended with us being in an open relationship. I felt fine for maybe a week, but that really doesn't change anything. I feel almost smothered. I think we need to break up, but how? I still love him, but I can't keep enabling this. Sometimes I do wonder if he loves/respects me. Part of the reason why I haven't just ended things is my self confidence. I feel like I won't find anyone that's relatively nice/cares about me. I'm nothing special.

I genuinely loved her for what she is and adored her. She did the same too and honestly everyone thought of us as the ‚Äúcouple‚Äù. Any issues that came up between us we talked it over and fixed it right away. This line will be important going forward.

Even when we were talking about the future we were hopeful and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see what happens‚Äù and actually focused on the present. (Me and her are from different religious backgrounds and it‚Äôs considered a huge Nono to mix).

Fast forward to a month ago, I had not visited my home back in my country for 3 years and was excited to go visit. My heart almost broke when I had to leave her for a month and come back.

In order to not feel bored and actually feel less overwhelmed from school, she said she started hitting the gym more. I honestly do not know when at this point she started to talk to this guy but she started talking to a guy let‚Äôs call him B. A and B quickly became friends and used to hit gym together, even study together.

When she told me this, I shared my views of how it was weird because she never talked to another guy like that and was bizarre. She started saying I was being toxic and needed a break from me. This is when I started smelling something fishy.

Instead of keeping it like that, I pursued the matter even more and made her blurt out that she thinks he is attractive and she likes him. This was the first major blow. I asked if she has confessed this to him to which she said no. I explained her that she has crossed the bounds of relationship and I consider this as emotional cheating.

She agreed to it but said there was nothing else. I was sure there‚Äôs more shit to be found underground so I pursued more. The very next day she agreed to confessing to him that she liked him and him back that he liked her. She tried to explain it in her own words and wanted me to talk to the other guy. I jumped on a call and asked him 2 questions . One if he did know I was her boyfriend before this he said yes. Two if he felt that he did the right thing, he said grow up. He added that he loved her and thinks she does too. I wished him all the best and hung up.

Later, I explained her that this is cheating and I would not want to continue our relationship after this. She started saying he is not her BF and she still needs me. Added we could be friends to which I only told that I‚Äôll come there and have a conversation with you on that. 

I feel shitty, heart broken and all the other feel bad feelings all at the same time. After this, she started texting me like nothing happened and also sends photo of me telling she misses me. 

Thankfully, I see right through her and tell what I have told her before. When she started lashing out saying I don‚Äôt know what she has gone through and I was toxic. I told her that what happened might be because of some mental issue and even asked her to go to a therapist. 

When asked to list what she felt was toxic, she cannot answer. Like I mentioned, this is huge giveaway too as we fixed issues then and there before.

I know that I should cut ties with her and that is probably what I will be doing once I go back but she is good friends with mom (who thinks we‚Äôre friends) and who knows I hang out her with her a lot. Idk how I can explain this to her(at the moment, she is packing gifts to her and seeing this breaks my heart).

My brain tried to think of reasons so as to why this happened but then I caught up with it and understood it was not in my hand.(B is the same religion as me if anyone‚Äôs wondering. I have been working for a year while A is not and have been providing all kind of support to her so that‚Äôs cleared too)

Albeit we haven‚Äôt dated the entire time, most recently the last 4/5 months we‚Äôve been serious. An ongoing issue in our relationship is that he talks to several women, everyday that he met off dating apps. 
A few now I‚Äôve caught that we‚Äôre obviously more than friends (I.e. nudes, flirty comments, etc.) but he‚Äôs cut them off and has assured me that he isn‚Äôt doing that with anyone anymore. 
He uses Snapchat and Instagram to regularly talk to women he‚Äôs slept with in the past or met off dating apps. He checks in with a couple of them pretty much every day or regularly comments on their stories. I‚Äôve expressed several times how uncomfortable that has made me feel, his need to talk to these women. Most recently he made me feel bad, called me over bearing for having an issue with one. I was made to feel terrible and as if I was the problem somehow and my reaction to him talking to these women was annoying to him. I apologized. He remarked that he can‚Äôt have any female friends, and in my opinion was bs‚Äî I told him he can have female friends, there are several I like of his but why do these women he‚Äôs slept with or met off apps have to be kept in touch with?
Tonight we were out with his friends, one of them made a comment about a woman he had dated in the past. I insinuated he still speaks to her and they‚Äôre exact remark was looking at me and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre okay with that‚Äù ‚Äî- THAT sentence coming from not just one of them made me feel so validated.

I'm 22 (M) and she's 20 (F), we met on Tinder 3 weeks, she lives an hour of road from me and she's amazing i like her and i feel like we ""clicked"" from the start, since we moved right off tinder and on instagram in the same day. We both ended a long relationship not a while ago (mine was of 4 years and her's was of 6).
At first we texted a lot since the first week i was home sick, but when i felt better we immediately organized a first date: she came a half of the way in a bus and i came the other half with my car; the first thing after my ""Hi"" was a hug that i appreciated a lot. At the end we said goodbye also with another hug. (If more details about the date it's needed i can add in the comments).
 We messaged a lot every day we, both used many ""ü•∞ü§ó‚ò∫Ô∏è"" emojis and everything was fine.
The second date was a week after, i drove to her town after she finished her shift at the bar were she works, she showed me her ""everyday"" places and we met a few of her friends, we also drove up a mountain and smoked a spliff, since we both like pot. I ate we drinked something at some place we hanged later, and after this i returned home since she was meeting her friends at the same place.
We messaged like before and i think we liked each other but we didn't do more than hugging or talking.

A few days later she had a problem with her phone not working, so my messages on whatsapp didn't come through and she couldn't receive calls. After 2 days of this ""stall"" and me being afraid i did something wrong, a friend of her helped and besides her being stressed for this thing i thought troubles stopped. I was wrong. After like 1/2 days of her not answering much (like 2/3 sms or vocals) and me sending the usual amount of messages we shared before (like 6-8 describing your day, tyipical long-ish distance relationship things), my messages suddendly didn't come through again. I thought it was the same problem as before, but now have passed 3 days until then, and i realized i am blocked on whatsapp and also on insta, i don't know what i did wrong or if something happened to her, i tried to call her 2 times throughout these days but she didn't answer.

Now it's 4 A.M. here and today after some sleep i thought that i could go to her town and try to see if she's working at her place, since it's the only place i remember how to get to, and ask her to talk. But I'm not sure if it's the right thing to appear in the middle of her shift, since even if we had these 2 dates we have known each other only for 3 weeks and a few days, i don't want to look like a stalker or something, I'm just worried and because things were going so well i can't comprehend why she blocked me on every app, i began to think too many things about this and my everyday's are starting to turn into another depressive episode where i sleep everyday and i don't go to class, i have this mood since me and my ex broke up and meeting a person that understands you again and that you can talk to helped me a lot and lifted my mood.

I don't know what to do, if i should go to her workplace and ask her this day? If i should wait next week to go?(Since i work all the weekend and i don't have time to go there in that time).
Or i should try to let her go and find a reason by myself?

Sorry for the long post, but i think that in these cases the details matter, if you need to know something else about what i wrote, you can ask and i will answer, but i need help quickly since i can move only today.

Abortion is just wrong and disgusting. Therefore, I am 26 and have never done the deed. I was thinking about getting an IUD but I've heard those can fail too. There's always a risk and that's why I'm celibate.

It sucks because I see lots of cute guys and am getting older and have never had a BF, but I just also am awkward about sex and don't think i would even be good at it since I have no experience. The thought that EVERY time there is a possibility of me getting pregnant is horrifying too.

Pretty soon I will be too old (let's face it, I'm no spring chicken) and the good men will run out, I'm really not sure if I'm missing out or if it's okay to just be alone forever. I am not happy being alone, but every time I meet a guy I'm either not attracted to him OR if he's really attractive, there are other women gladly having sex with him for nothing and I lose the competition because I don't put out.

For contextually I don‚Äôt know her age I just know that she is at least 50 or probably older, the names for crush is going to be Leo and the name of the classmate is going to be Gloria, my female friend is going to be Jessica and my male friend is going to be Matheus.

So the situation did begin in cold Thursday day, I was going to talk to my crush, when I was approached by my crush classmate Gloria.

So she basically said to me to calm down, and that I was making him uncomfortable, she added that she is married and not jealous of me, I asked how does she know that, she then said that he didn‚Äôt tell her anything is just that EVERYONE knows.

Needless to say I was shocked, I did cry a lot thinking that he didn‚Äôt even enjoyed my company and that he disliked me.

I honestly didn‚Äôt have any ideia of anything that I did that would make him uncomfortable around me, so I started to think and only 4 possible things came to my mind, and my friend thought.

1- I talked to him sometimes when he was going towards the bathroom, but I didn‚Äôt know he was going lol, at first I thought that he was talking a walk, now I know that if he is heading towards the bathroom side he is going to the bathroom lol.

2- I did accompanied him to the train station, maybe he was uncomfortable idk.

3- I did go his class to talk him but after 2 minutes he stooped and begun talking to other people, and I stayed there in the spot in my cellphone thinking that he would return talking to me but nope, if I knew he would talk to me after that I would go back to my class.

4- I was flirting with him, maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested and was uncomfortable.

Next week in a Thursday again, I said to my friend Jessica what Gloria did say to me and she thought that it was weird, because if he didn‚Äôt liked me he wouldn‚Äôt greet me kissing my cheek like he did to his other friends, then reveled some bombastic information talking to my other friend, that Gloria sees Leo as some kinda of son??? I was like WTF üíÄüíÄüíÄ.

The next day Gloria did go towards my direction to talk to me she did say how it now was much better smiling(creepy Af)  And that now that now that I am less sticky we can even be friends and was like what gurl, you know dawn well that I want to kiss that juicy lips, you gave me the stares when I was showing my number to him, you clearly knows what I want from the way you did say, she says that we can be friends know like she maintained me in check now, and now that I am tamed I can have her permission to be his friend, yuck ü§¢.

IDk if I am crazy but the shit she is doing isn‚Äôt creepy right? Like I am definitely scared by this nutso behavior, and honestly I will definitely not be intimidated but I wonder at what what extent goes her feelings for him, and more do I need to buy some pepper spray lol, just kidding I will buy it anyway.

The worst shit is that she sits my behind crush and accompanies him to the train station so she hears the majority of ours conversations.

But honestly the big elephant in the room is if I should tell him or not, like if that situation was happening with me I would like the guy to tell me, because no way I would hang out with such a weirdo, if I am being since I want to tell him but I don‚Äôt know how and when, that is the question.

Everyone think that this shit is weird one friend is enjoying the drama, my therapist thing something stinks, some internet friend thinks it is fucking weird and my friend Jessica thinks that maybe she just did go overboard but she sees him as good friend(doubt it, and my friend is her second semester so she does know him for one year and is the overprotective, there is a possibility that knows him outside university but idk.)

I was upset and crying earlier today about not being able to go see my dad on his birthday for the first time ever, and he was doing a little work that he needed to catch up on, and whilst I get that he was busy he was totally just ignoring me, and the most significant response he gave was a thumbs up with no eye contact (even a tiny response would‚Äôve been ok). A little later when he was done with the work, I told him that even if he was busy working, it made me upset to feel like I‚Äôd been blanked totally, and super unexpectedly he raised his voice (not quite shouting but LOUD) to say ‚Äòwhat the fuck, you knew I had some work to do today, what were you expecting?‚Äô. This upset me way more than the whole blanking thing did in the first place..

We kind of moved on from it later today, but I haven‚Äôt stopped feeling like this is a big deal to me..what do you guys think? Is this kind of thing a big deal?

My mom is narcissist, victim player, attention seeker and so insecure. 

I would tell my therapist but she went on maternity leave and it‚Äôs so hard finding someone under my insurance.

Basically my non loves my bow husband. To the point where she used her own insecurities and basically brainwashed me in to thinking my husband wasn‚Äôt going to marry me. After our one year she pressured me so much that I ended up moving out. She was super upset bc I help her take care of my disabled sister. But I just couldn‚Äôt live with her anymore. She was constantly making me insecure about my relationship. Mind you I was over 30 at the time with no debt a good savings and a really good job. I only stayed to help her with my sister. 

I was so insecure that I got in a huge argument with my husband bc he hadn‚Äôt proposed before the 2 year mark! It‚Äôs so sad because I was so confident in our relationship. 

Fast forward my husband proposes. My mom shit talks the way he proposed and my ring. Something that should of been so happy she ruined. I was so upset bc she kept telling me to return my ring. I love my ring and still do. It‚Äôs very unique and different and very much me. I hate that she ruined that week for me.

Fast forward to us having a Covid wedding. She had opinion about everything. To the point where she said if my dad walked me down the aisle she wouldn‚Äôt show up. It got so bad that I told her fine don‚Äôt come.

She also made drama with my husbands family. Trust me his parents weren‚Äôt innocent but she just goes out of her to make drama. 

Fast forward our wedding she brought my sister, fine but I asked her to bring a nurse to help take care of her bc it‚Äôs my wedding weekend and I can‚Äôt babysit her while my mom gets her hair and make some. She didn‚Äôt listen. Sister got sick during my reception and my mom basically disappeared for most of it to take care of her.

Also not to mention she walked out of the wedding pictures bc the photographer tried to bave my mom and dad in the same picture. I told my stupid photographer months in advance and reminded him multiple times that week not to put them together and he didn‚Äôt listen. I shouldn‚Äôt have tipped him in retrospect but I‚Äôm too respectful towards staff. 

I paid for my wedding by myself because I knew if she paid she would of taken over. Am I proud I paid for my own wedding yea, does it suck that all of my friends ans cousins had a way better wedding than me yeah. Mind you my moms upper middle class and does have money. She could of easily pitched in and wanted to. But I couldn‚Äôt handle any more of her drama.

Fast forward we‚Äôre in a good place hubby and I are renovating our place. She convince me to go with her contractor said such good things about him. I should of know  better. We basically got conned and are staying at my moms rental property. Contractors doing the work but takes his sweet time. It‚Äôs been 8 months and we‚Äôre still waiting for our house to be finished. We didn‚Äôt sign a contract yes I know we‚Äôre dumb. So we can‚Äôt fire him because then we will be out a lot of money. Found out he‚Äôs conned multiple people and even my mom! Who had been dating him on the low! 


My husband ans I are not paying rent or bills which is really nice of my mom. But I‚Äôm just so disgusted with the situation. I didn‚Äôt trust my mom with my wedding so why did I trust her with my house? I‚Äôm angry at myself and my husband for not having a contract but I‚Äôm also mad at my mom for getting conned and basically sucking us in to this whole drama.

Your asking why are you mad at your mom for getting conned? The truth is my mom has this happen to her all the time, because she constantly tells people how much she makes and how much money she has and how many properties she has she‚Äôs obviously very insecure and brags to people to get validation. She uses my sister to show herself as a victim while at the same time hating my dad and constantly putting her children in the middle.

I‚Äôm obviously so bitter about all of the negativity she has brought to my life. I still cringe about all the things she did to me while I planned my wedding specially since it was during Covid and I would of needed extra support.

I really felt alone.

Anyway I know I‚Äôm great full bc I‚Äôm staying here rent free but I also feel like this is partly her fault. So much bitterness.

Before anyone suggest I talk to her let me just say we had conversations about the things she‚Äôs done in the past and she either doesn‚Äôt care or doesn‚Äôt want to own up to it.I‚Äôve recommended therapy many time but she won‚Äôt go.
