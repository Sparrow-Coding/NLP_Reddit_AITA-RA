Recently some changes of a new job for me, and he’s just came out of school after a career change. He’s been struggling to find a new job lately, maybe relevant as he could be down or depressed. 

But he’s been distancing himself. By my side less often in the house, opting to go on another floor rather than sit next to me even when doing different quiet tasks. I’ve been checking in, offering support, mentioning resources and letting him know I’m there. Noticing lately he’s being weird around his phone as well which was never a thing. Felt now like he’s hiding stuff and becoming distant. 

Then last week on his side of the bed I found a plastic cup with rolled up socks and a rubber glove in it. Classic homemade flesh light if I’m not mistaken… queue my confusion as he’s been saying no to being intimate lately because he’s too tired or something similar (for around a month or so). I thought it was stress/depression regarding work or self worth, but the DIY toy made me sceptical. Also like WTF. We are both at home as I work remote… Not hidden, just sitting on the floor by the bed. We’ve bought toys together so no sure why he had to go to this length. But I didn’t bring it up, just put the cup in the wash and the socks in the laundry…

Next I decide to investigate further. We have an iPad that is a shared device. I snooped around a bit (I know , I know, Sue me). Nothing in the browser history. But In the hidden photos folder, which is unlocked with passcode we share, there was a lot of shocking photos. Screenshots off Instagram, cropped indecently of our close mutual friend in her bathing suit, my sister in law, our old neighbour and some other random nudes I imagine are off Reddit. Looks like I stumbled on his poorly hid spank bank. To add insult to injury all the pics were dated from the last month, and the first one was on my bday… we weren’t having any tensions at this time.  

Not sure how to proceed. Obviously a chat is the sensible thing… but it’s a hard convo to have just considering the distancing. But throw in his pics of our friends and family?! Yikes. In shock and anger I wanted to tell our friends what I found but have since rethought it.

We had been together for just under 4 months and everything had been going well. In this time we had met some family on both sides, met friendship groups and even had a mini-break away with my friends.

However in the week leading up the breakup everything turned a bit strange:

Sunday - we had spent the whole weekend together and she had asked for the rest of the day alone for some space so I obliged and gave her it

Monday - no issues, just general chatter as per normal

Tuesday - went on a date night which included dinner and our usual chats and laughter. I stayed around hers after and left Wednesday morning. Talking about plans for the coming weeks and seeing each other before christmas and for birthdays etc. She even posted couples photos of us on instagram for the first time.

Wednesday - no issues during the day, didnt want me to leave in the morning. She had work drinks in the evening so texting dropped off as usual when she was busy. Work drinks included someone she had a fling with before but she had pre-warned me and said nothing to worry about so thought nothing of it. However, whilst she usually sends me a home safe text she didn't that night.

Thursday - she messages me as soon as she wakes up with the standard hey, im hungover and nothing else. Rest of the day all fine including pet names etc. In the evening she seems a little off so i ask her about it and see says shes just had a bad day and she was sorry for being off.

Friday - same usual chatter with no issues, she had gone back to her family home for the weekend so i knew i wouldnt see her and she would be busy. Apologized again for how she was over message the night before. Still calling pet names etc and when i said miss you, she said the same back. She also paid for an event with all my friends in December that evening.

Saturday - asks to call in the morning which I say yes to obviously. She proceeds to break up with me because she feels 'something is missing' and that she can't see herself loving me in the same way that i love her. Confessed that she had kissed the guy on Wednesday night which had just confirmed to her something wasn't right and that she was confused. She said it had nothing to do with anything i'd done wrong and she thought i was amazing person and had loved her whole time with me.

I just cannot help thinking that there is more to it than meets the eye. I'm confident its no-one else purely because the amount we saw and talked to each other it would have been impossible to fit it all in. I've just been left in a very confused and depressed state given all this. I feel like i'm missing closure and it might be something to do with me but all the puzzle pieces just don't fit. Yes, maybe there were things we could have worked on but if she knew she was going to end it i'm just not sure why she would post me online and pay for the event the night before she ended it.

My boyfriend and I have been going out for 4 years now. He's not comfortable making it a relationship. I would love to date him but we're both close enough and he tells me everything so I don't mind as much. We've never had someone this close to each other and he makes me really happy. I had a lotta problems and he really talked me out of really bad phases in my life.

He entered college a while back and got close with this girl in class. He doesn't have that many friends in college. He told her about me and explained how it's complicated. She's really really nice so I hate that I thought of them in a bad light.

One day, we were out on a date(sorta) and got in an argument. He usually used to ask my advice on things so I was used to that. But with that particular thing (it was something irrelevant like if he should get involved in a class discussion or something) he decided not to take my advice and I was fine with it. But few days later his friend said the same thing and he listened to it right then. And when he told me about this on the date, I asked why didn't you listen when I said the same thing and he told me to let it go. When I asked again he said ""She convinced me cause she is prettier than you. So I listened to her"" and I told him ""I don't think I'll be able to let it go so if you didn't mean it, take it back now."" And he said no it's true. And joked it off but I was hurt. He told me he was joking when he saw that I was hurt.

When we texted later I brought it up and he said he didn't mean it and he has introduced me to her and we get along well. I just can't shake it off my mind. There were times I got a little uncomfortable with it because we don't see each other as much(distance) and he holds her hand and hugs her sometimes and hangs out with her everyday. She calls him by nicknames and plays with his hair and all. She clearly cares about him a lot and I like that he has someone close in college but he's not very touchy with me when we go outside. He said it's because it actually means something with me so he gets shy and worried my family might see and with her it's just normal and he doesn't notice it. He's denied it multiple times but I can't get it off my mind. I know he didn't mean anything bad by it and neither of them did anything wrong. He's very innocent and comes and tells me everything.

My boyfriend has been hosting a girl he dated once in 2019 from December 2021 to January 2022 in Paris (she lives in mexico where they met). They have been spending time together having sex... When we first met he told me that it has been years that he hasn't been in a relationship and hasn't had sex. However, one day i was scrolling on instagram and found a girl who was posting pictures of him, pictures of her in his place etc. I got really mad because i felt like he lied to me, but then he told me that he has never considered her as an ex. Then, he swore that she was the one in love with him and harrassing him to talk to her... Later, i found out that he was reaching out to her and sometimes he lied to me saying that he has anxiety and that it is better if we just spend some time apart in order to go home and facetime her. He swore to God after that i was the one he is in love with and that i was the one he wanted to be with and that there is absolutely nothing that i should worry about. 

But last week, i broke up with him for some reasons and surprisingly at the exact moment when we re not together anymore , she started posting old pictures of them (from the time they were together) where she doesn't show his face but i can tell that it is him from his clothes, his body etc even though she is in a relationship with a new guy (she just posted  a video celebrating his birthday 2days ago). 

It is triggering my insecurities and my anxiety a lot. I have been obsessed with checking her profile in order to make sure that they re not together but this morning i have decided to stop because it is so toxic. Do you think he is reaching out to her again? Do you think she still has feelings for him or they both still have feelings for each others? Do you think that i do have valid reasons to be worried about the situation or am i just being dramatic?

We've been together for quite some time (*nearly 10 years*), but I'm finding that quite a bit has been on my mind that has become something of a norm in this relationship. I feel that we veering on codependency, and I'm 100% sure I'm the problem.

When I met my S/O, I had left a series of bad relationships, namely from dating people that my ""friends"" approved of, but not necessarily those that I did (*i.e. we'd both be bullied because they couldn't ""imagine"" us together*). The last of those relationships *was* someone I personally felt ""all-in"" on, but they didn't. Turns out, I had spent so little time with someone that was my type, I didn't actually know how to communicate with them. This hurt me more deeply, because it was a pain I made exclusively on my own (*only my very first relationship and this one have this trait in common*). I stopped dating for 3 years, and used college as an excuse for why. I kept myself so busy that I didn't have to think too much about it. When I met my S/O during this, it was nice, but never in my mind did I think we'd be together as long as we have been.

At first, it was nice, because my S/O reminded me that I didn't have to live through my trauma, and while we were amongst friends, we were both pretty happy. However, I had a tendency to prioritize her over my friends, which today, long after moving across the country so she could pursue her dream job, I'm realizing that I now don't have any left. Then, my parents and I had saved up to buy a home and ring, but we ultimately had to spend it all on moving costs. Nearly 5-6 years later, I haven't proposed, and I'm wondering if I even want to. I'm trying to make friends as an adult, but I'm naturally hard to get to know, and nervous around people. Also, my career has been less than stable, where while I am able to work, reorganizations, restructures, pandemics, recessions, etc. have made settling down extremely difficult. So, I'm mostly alone AND have no stability. Through all of this, my S/O has been there, but even after going to therapy for 2-3 years, I find that something major is missing in my life.

My S/O is an extremely kind person, but at times, I find my life with them to be incredibly stale. We don't really laugh together, have fun, or feel like a relationship sometimes. We just sort of exist together, pursuing our own separate things, with no shared interests in between. Over the years, all marriage, family, etc. talks have been shut down, but when I mention wanting to leave the relationship, it hurts them deeply and they try desperately to make it work (*usually by talking about those*), but only for a couple days or so. I ask for breaks too, but obviously, they aren't for that either. It doesn't feel like we are growing together, but rather that we are roommates. Dates are often awkward, and they frequently get upset with me when I don't want to join them on their work ventures (*specifically when I don't want to hangout with their friends, fake-friends, or coworkers*). I try to tell my parents I'm not ok, but in their eyes, my life has been going extremely well, so they won't hear it. People have asked me out on dates despite our relationship, and even when I decline, they make sure to let me know they got married later (*seemingly to remind me that I waited too long or something*). My friends all seem to know what's going on, but are states away and can't really help me from that distance, and can only support me to the extent of ""just end it now"" or ""you seem married."" I hate when people say the latter, because it makes me fear what actual marriage is supposed to feel like.

Recently, we just bought a home, and it was an extremely difficult situation to get through. Our tastes, wants, and goals, were so different, and we effectively vetoed each others picks constantly. I looked at around 50+ homes (visited, toured, etc.) in an effort to find something that could work for us both. They looked at 3. I wanted a place to raise a family, but they wanted a place that was fancy. Once we agreed to ""consider"" a home, they hid from me that they put in an offer that went over budget because they countered. I was both livid and burnt out, but I was too tired and depressed at this point. So, I let it happen. Now, we are in a recession and extremely concerned. Now, we have a house, and things keep getting worse and its all my fault. I feel like no one listens to me, and now I'm afraid of everything. I feel like I'm drowning, and it keeps getting worse. I've been considering moving back home, but I don't know how difficult things will be if I do that.

Now, I've been thinking of giving myself something of an ultimatum, where if I still feel this way by a certain time, I just end it and start everything over. I'm trying to figure out things I can do to improve the relationship, and myself too, but again, I'm probably just wasting more time and making things worse.

I have no problem with my boyfriend not being 100% straight as he says, but the secrecy / contradictions around it have made me concerned he’s not bi or straight, but repressed gay**

My boyfriend identified as 100% straight (he is very adamant about this), but I recently found out he watches A LOT of trans porn and futanari porn. He typically looks at masturbation videos or trans female on male… 

He has been looking at this kind of porn for over 10 years, and has maintained he is 100% straight. I only found out recently and it came as a shock, and it’s making me rethink things.. he has always said he’s been too tired for sex, and has never really wanted to do anything sexual with me, apart from me giving him blowjobs. I always felt like he was never really into me. We went a whole year once long distance, and he didn’t want me to send sexy pictures or sext with him the entire time. (More on this later **)

So, 
I tried to bring it up to him, and asked if he had any kinks he wanted to try (like pegging) or if he was certain he was 100% straight.. I mentioned sexuality is a spectrum, he disagreed he was anything but straight, but lowered it and said he was at least 90% straight…
He didn’t want to try any of the kinks.
He says he’s confident in his sexuality, but for a while I felt he wasn’t attracted to me. And I always assumed it was my anxiety but now..

He says he’s not sure why he likes trans porn, but he says he HAS to imagine them as female (and likes the feminine features). If he thinks of them as male, it’s an instant turn off.. but this confuses me, as he can look at one video and, if he thinks it’s a women he’ll like it. If I then tell him it’s actually a man and not a trans person, he’ll say he’s no longer turned on by it… I’m quite confused by this? He also says he’s not attracted to the dick, but he obviously is as he’s watching this porn specifically .. he also says he wouldn’t want to be with a trans women irl, but then says it might turn him on to see a trans women irl at a strip club, where he can imagine it’s fantasy. Or, if he had an emotional bond with them, he may be able to look past the dick. It’s confusing me. 

If it’s important to mention, his family and home country are extremely homophobic. If he came out as gay, he would be disowned and cut off entirely. I’m concerned he’s repressing his sexuality, essentially.

Every time I bring it up he says that I’m overthinking and he’s straight and loves me. He says he’s confident in his sexuality but I honestly feel that isn’t the case. We are planning to get married next year - I don’t want to be in a situation where, 5 years down the line, he realises his true self and comes out as gay. 

How do I approach this situation with him in a healthy way?? 


** regarding his lack of intimacy with me, after I found out about the trans porn he said he had a sudden realisation that he had had a mental block for 5 years and that’s why he never wanted me?? He says he always felt too tired before to do things with me, but now he realises he can still feel tired and want to do things with me, so it was a mental block.

He was also my childhood love and we were both obsessed with each-other as kids but we’re unable to be with each other due to religious reasons etc and I ended up in a long term relationship with someone else for a while and we didn’t speak although he always made it known that he wanted to be with me

In the end, I wasn’t happy and 4 years later ended that relationship, and my current partner and myself got together. I am his first ever girlfriend and he has never done these things with someone before. I used to feel over the moon and could not believe that I was finally with my childhood love and that it was actually working out

To be fair, the relationship has been good, he is loving and caring and does anything for me, as I do for him. 

However, after the initial honey moon period and getting to know someone over time, I’m not sure how compatible we are. 
Firstly, we are on the complete opposite page on sex, I feel like I have a high sex drive and I love fun and exciting things

Him on the other hand he likes to have sex and we do have it multiple times a week, but not nearly as much as I would like to. And when we do it’s not for very long at all, like not at all. And he can never have it in him to do it again..

I feel like I constantly feel unsatisfied and annoyed, he was quite fun and exciting and adventurous when we were young and I didn’t realise how much he had changed ( which is completely normal I know) but it hasn’t hit me until recently. He’s become kind of boring.. or he has been this way the whole time and just wanted to impress me as he waited for me to become single for years and then just gave up once he had me…

He likes to just do nothing and be a hermit and have 1 minute sex then not think about it for two days but I feel like I need MORE. 

of course I never get upset at him as it’s not his fault and you cannot force someone to have a higher sex drive so I always find myself putting or smile but feeling constantly dissatisfied. 

We have spoken about this before and he just kind of said “what do you want me to do, you just love to have sex” but take that comment lightly as he does have a sense of humour and laughed when he said that, I think it hurt him a little.

Over 1 week ago we did quarrel because I tried to pressure her into finally meeting irl. She says she has her own doubts like self confidence about her appearance, scared to meet someone else than me, etc... I've been really inconsiderate. I proposed to take a break to look back at all of it. 

We started to text again this monday. I did a very long text of apologies, she did say she felt better and did want to talk again, but less obsessively. I said that's fine, and didn't pressure her into irl at all. Promising her to take our time, she said that if I keep being sweet again she might say yes, without any pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the problem... We talked only for 30mins on monday, she left me hanging without replying for 8 hours, she texted me back 8hours later apologizing because she was busy (that never happened before). 

Even though I felt frustrated I did not tell her and acted very understanding. Again... 24 hous later she replies me back, no apologies this time, she just said she was busy and went to sleep after coming back home at 1 am. This time I did not let it go. This was quite a drastic change, talking every minute to... that. I asked her what was going on, I told her to speak frankly. So she replied this : 

""I changed because I am still mad at you.. I am hurt and I am trying to convince myself it will get better but your mood swings are making me more mad, because I don't get them. I am still waiting to feel better, so I am trying my best too, I  went to soccer, took a shower and now I am just reading this again and yeah I am waiting to feel better for myself again ""

Am I being too crazy to think that she just doesn't care about me anymore, that we will never get to talk normally ever again and that she just moved on ? My mood swings she is talking about is me, at 8am answering to her apologies, being all sweet and understanding and then at 1am the next day I was a bit aggressive to not receive an answer at all, I saw her online doing other stuff, so she just doesn't reply me back.

He has recently bought a house which requires me to commute to work, as I didn't drive we have been living apart while I got my licence, which I now have so we were planning to move in together again. 

 He works on Christmas eve and Christmas day. I spent last Christmas with him, and my original instinct was to do the same this Christmas. However, my grandad has cancer and my grandma has called me asking me to come for Christmas day, as it is a v important day to her who is religious and they haven't seen me for a long time. She was crying. I let ny boyfriend know, and he kept saying I should do ""what I thought was right"". I told him that obviously I wanted to be with him and didn't want to leave him alone on that day, and that I would miss him all the time and come back a few days after so that I could spend new year's together; but that I felt I ought to fulfil my grandma's wishes as she is 97 and I would regret it my whole life and suffer a lot if she died and I hadn't done this for her. He asked me if I had made my choice, I said I wanted to discuss it with him, and he said it would make him very sad to be alone at Xmas, that he couldn't believe he could be; our first Xmas at the new house; that it must mean that I wasn't at the same point in the relationship as him; that he was so sad, maybe I shouldn't move in; that he had to accept and digest that everything we had planned for wasn't gonna happen, that I wasn't at the point he was at. I asked him if we could celebrate de day before, I would prepare q meal and do everything like last year; and then be together in new years; as he is working anyway and we would only be together christmas eve morning. He said it shows that he is not my priority that I am willing to leave him alone at Xmas. I haven't slept for three days, I am suffering a lot, I understand where he is coming from and I am sad that he feels this way. I let him know how much I love him etc all the time.

I have spoken to my parents and friends. The problem is they say he does this all the time, and in a way it is true that things like this happen a lot. My parents are convinced the relationship is toxic and that I am psychologicaly abused but I don't want to get into that as my concern is this particular occasion, what to do.

Especially to the people around her. They think that she is the best person alive and practically worship the ground she walks on. Wherever I go I hear praises about her, about how great of a person she is, and frankly speaking, it boils my blood to hear such things. I hate it.

I hate the fact that my mom gets to live a life full of happiness after ruining my entire childhood and giving me too many traumas that now I have to spend my days either hating myself and my life or crying at the therapists. I hate the fact that no one understands what I have gone through and just thinks that I am being dramatic and ungrateful towards the woman who has practically given up her life for me.

Here's the thing. I have never asked her to do these things for me. I have never asked her to be a SAHM for me. I would be happy if she had a job. It was her own fault that she never got a job. She gave the exam to be a teacher thrice and failed each time and then stopped when my grandma passed away and never tried again, after which she got married and just gave up. It might sound ungrateful but yeah I don't care anymore.

She never allowed me to have a life. Everything needed to be how she wanted. She didn't allow me to have friends whom I like rather the ones she liked (which were mostly the academically gifted stuck-up kids whom I hated). She wanted me to perform academically well, but it made me develop an intense fear of exams and studying in general. Yeah, I was the topper at my school and was among the top 10 in my country during the boards (grade 10th exam which we sit for around the age of 15-16), but what did it do for me? Nothing. Those marks won't matter during my future studies.

She never allowed me to wear dresses I liked but rather the ones she liked and was allowed by the religion she followed. Never let me have a hairstyle I wanted, rather the one she liked on me. Most of my friends and classmates hated me because she spoke shit about them and spread rumors about them and they thought the only way to stop it was to avoid me. I don't blame them, we were kids, and I would have done the same. 

I used to love her as well. Tried to mimic everything she did, which made me an asshole at school and lose the remaining friends I had. I have spent the last 2 years trying to correct my behavior and the general outlook I had. There are like tens and hundreds of people who deserve an apology from me. 

I wasn't allowed to show any emotion other than happiness. Whenever I would try to express anger or sadness I would be called mentally disabled and berated for being too much. She would call me a failure and say I would never amount to anything in my life. Whenever I went against my wishes she would give me the silent treatment for days and only talk after I had groveled at her feet for forgiveness.

When I was 4 years old she burned my hands because I had eaten something at a relative's house she had asked me not to (apparently I was too greedy), she then told my father I had burned them myself by accident. When I was 8 she broke my little finger thrice because I hadn't learned a lesson she had asked me to, and everyone gave me the excuse that she was frustrated because her elder sister had cancer and I, an 8-year-old should go easy on her. She beat me up whenever I got less marks or wasn't the top in my class. When I became too old for beatings she started giving cold shoulder and the silent treatment instead.

I thought she had improved during the lockdown, but the moment I went against her wish of me studying medicine she reverted back to her old habits and called me dramatic when I had a panic attack because of the stress. She told my father when I was crying and shouting that I was faking it and he should just leave me alone instead of consoling me as a parent should do.

When she saw my self-harm scars 3 years ago, the first question she asked me was which guy had i broken up with (i studied in an all-girls school and dating is generally a taboo where I live). She and the general physician made fun of them. I have spent almost my entire teenage years wanting to kill myself. I even tried quite a number of times but could never really go on with it.

The problem is despite all these she is still an amazing person to the people around her. Kind, helpful, outgoing, and every other positive trait a person may have. She even managed to convince and befriend the woman whose husband she has been having an emotional affair with that she doesn't really have anything going on and that they are just friends. She makes friends and acquittances left and right.

Seeing her living her best life, just makes me irrationally angry. She ruined my childhood and would be still doing it if I didn't learn how to stand up for myself. Made me hate my dad by dumping her relationship traumas on me (i mean my dad isn't the best person but at least he's not like her). She has used me as her therapist for years but never heard about my problems, and even if I did manage to tell her I was called overdramatic. 

I don't remember half of my teenage years. I don't have any memories of how our actual relationship was, it's like ages 11-18 have been completely wiped from my brain. I remember some of them but not all. Sometimes when I see her interacting with other people I think maybe I am really being too sensitive and that maybe what she had done wasn't as bad. I don't know why I am writing all these here. I think I just wanted to rant somewhere, where maybe someone would understand me at least. I can't say all these to my dad.

She thinks that money can solve all her problems and only thinks that buying New clothes/ makeup will fix her up . She also is least intertested in exploring something new .

I tried to become more like her , only to end up gaining 30 Kgs, growing a pair of Moobs , and getting further depressed when i look at other people 

 She is Cute but that does not stop me from comparing her with My Friends relationships or any random couple .Sex is also Uninteresting. 

Plus MIL teaches her to grow more fat coz wives should not be dominated by their husbands. Also she teaches her all the wrong things in our relationship.

To add on to this , One of my best friends have got married one year back and i have a serious Crush /Lust for her . She has got the perfect Smoking Body , She talks fun and she wants to explore new things. In Short she is simply My Type.

I would like to hear any pieces of advice, or even other stories from people who experienced an unplanned pregnancy (whether in a man/woman’s POV). 

We’ve been fighting a lot because we couldn’t find a common ground. I initially decided to get abortion, however, I aways can’t bring myself to do it. During that time, he was manipulating me into believing that the right decision was, indeed, to abort. He kept telling me that he will support me with whatever path I choose, but still pushing for abortion. He claims he cares about my physical and mental health, while gaslighting me.

I’m about finish my first trimester which means I’m past the date for medical abortion. I feel lonely as ever.. I am well aware this is part of the consequence of my action, but I know I will love the child. I am taking responsibility by keeping the child and raising it the best I can. My ex, however, seems to not understand what taking responsibility and accountability mean. He blames me for keeping it. He constantly tells me that he resents the decision I made, that I am robbing the child off a happy family.. because of the lack of father figure. But if that’s his concern, then just become a dad?

Right now, we aren’t talking to each other as I’ve gotten tired of making him realise what’s happening. Neither being nice nor angry at him works anyway; he only sees his own hardships. 

Has anyone ever experienced something quite similar? Please share your thoughts, thank you so much.

I get a call from my ex, bawling, that her bf “accidentally” exposed himself to our daughter. “Jim”(step father) alleges that he was too shocked to react. After a long discussion, we ultimately decided I should go into our nightly talk “unknowing”. 

Turns out he lied, he stood there and asked my daughter a series of inappropriate questions. “Do you think I’m cute?”, “am I too old to be cute?”

I am flying in tomorrow to help them move out, and get them an AirBnB until we find something more permanent.

I’ve been talking to this girl for over a month. Our conversations for the first 2 weeks were pretty consistent, messaging for hours etc. We got along great and clicked. But these last 2 weeks, she’s been hot and cold with me? One day she seems interested, but then there’s days where she won’t talk to me at all and will leave me on delivered for hours. I see that she’s active and while I understand life happens, surely if you’re active you see the notification pop up? We made plans to meet up last Friday, but she backed out last minute. I’m also worried I might just be a rebound/distraction because she told me she broke up with her ex in September. I’m honestly just confused because she did seem interest in me. sexting, sharing intimate photos etc and now I’m not so sure anymore and I don’t know if I should just cut my losses and move on? Definitely like this girl, but it feels like it’s going nowhere.

I’m having some problems in my relationship and I’m beginning to worry that it’s getting increasingly one-sided. I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for over six months now, and it’s beginning to feel like things have deteriorated quite quickly between us. There’s not been any major stuff that’s happened, just an accumulation of little things that are adding up to quite a big issue. 
I love him and care about him a lot, we are compatible in every single way and we get along like a house on fire, have a lot of fun together. Yet, sometimes it feels to me like he’s more just a best friend that I have sex with. It feels like the relationship is completely lacking intimately and emotionally, and it feels a lot of the time I’m making the most people effort in the relationship. When we first started dating months ago he told me his previous relationship ended because he struggled with communication and emotions but that he’s working on it (they were together 4 years which makes me think it was a pretty serious reason to break up). However, it is apparent to me that he’s not really working on it at all. I have been in therapy the last 3 years in order to work on myself and improve my relationships, and I suggested counselling or something to help him with the stuff he struggles with and said I’d support him all the way, yet, he’s very much against the idea. He’s very emotionally closed off in that way. I don’t feel it’s fair for me to be the one making all the effort in the relationship if that makes sense?
The event that’s made me realise there’s an issue was this weekend. It was my birthday Sunday (the 13th) and the plan was to go away for the weekend together. My birthday means a hell of a lot to me, I love to make a big deal out of it and go all out on my birthday weekend and my partner knows this well. (I had a lot of trauma as a child growing up so never really celebrated birthdays or Christmas or anything so I’m making up for lost time as an adult, he knows about this too).  He was supposed to get to mine for 1pm on the Friday, I was ready to see him and excited to get the weekend started. It came to 2pm and he hadn’t arrived (I also have anxiety so I was starting to panic), I was texting and calling and got no reply. It came to around 3 and he finally text me saying he fell asleep and he would be there for 5 and it just really upset me. He knows I struggle when plans change, especially on important events like this. he eventually arrived some time around 6 in the evening and he gave me my presents. None of them were wrapped, they were all still in the crushed boxes and parcels they arrived in the post in. There was also no birthday card. For me, the card was really important as he never really says nice things to my face about me or our relationship so was hoping he might have put something in a card if he struggled to express himself verbally. He also later made a comment about how he was impressed with how nice some of the jewellery he got me was ‘considering how cheap it cost’. 😕 bare in mind he will regularly spend £100’s on parts for his car…
I was really upset about the card, as I’d handmade him a scrapbook full of photos and tickets and memories from our dates and had written him a really nice handmade card for his birthday a few weeks prior. I asked him if he used to get his ex cards for her birthday and he said yes which broke my heart and I asked him why he didn’t get me one and he just replied with ‘I forgot’. This weekends been on the cards for months and I’ve not stopped going on about my birthday for weeks so it just doesn’t seem like a fair excuse. I know he works long hours but the effort just isn’t there. 
Fast forward to our meal out on the Sunday evening (the day of my actual birthday) I was really excited as we’ve never actually been out on a nice dinner date together before (despite me trying tirelessly to arrange one for us). I’d been planning my outfit for weeks and got myself a new black dress for it, spent hours getting ready and he just wore trackies and trainers ☹️
I’m just at a bit of a loss as to what to do now really. I told him how I felt after the meal and it ended up in an argument and me sleeping alone in the hotel on my birthday balling my eyes out. Since then he’s just been acting like nothings happened and if I’m being honest I feel like the whole ordeal has changed my feelings towards him..",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7571990,public,self,"Advice needed, what do I do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxotko/advice_needed_what_do_i_do/,all_ads,6,,,,

I live ten miles south of it. So he just got his license this year, and is ""saving"" for a car. He's not looking for just any car, but a type of older muscle car. I'm talking 70's and up for Firebirds, Impalas, etc.

 He does seem to have financial freedom since he only pays a few hundred dollars for rent a month, so whatever he has leftover is all his. On the other hand i live paycheck to paycheck. I pay about 2k in bills a month, I barely make that. I do small side hustles to have side money in which I invest in my car or paying off small debts I've had. I have a car, and have been picking him up from his house on the way to work, that's not what I'm getting weird about. So he doesn't really seem to understand the idea of responsibility of having a car and taking care of it, having to drive everywhere and being the only one who drives (Yes he drives, he's just still nervous and is still new to it). 

So he seems to be taking his time to find a good car for himself and I hear him mention that he's not really going to drive it very far, maybe to and from work. What I'm getting at here, is that I feel like I'm the one doing the work when it comes to this subject of having the responsibility to drive us everywhere with my car and gas and he doesn't really seem to worry about any of it, he just gets to get in the car and we just go somewhere. 

He says that he has been trying to save money here and there. As of this morning, he bought a PS5 (payment plan) and all I can think is ""you keep saying you want a car. You want a specific car and it's your first car and you seem to have the idea in your head that it's like owning a bike, it's just there when you need it. What am I? Your shaffeur? I just give you rides amd you'll get to it whenever?"" 

So I pay all the bills, have other responsibilities and take care of my mom financially and he doesn't really have any of that life experience yet. He lives with his father, and just works. He just doesn't seem to really see the picture of being an adult and preparing and achieving certain goals of being independent and I've been getting a bad impression of him that he doesn't have priorities in place and things just fall into his lap. He's talked about living together and this situation comes to mind when I'm supposed to have certain expectations of him? I'm older than him, he's had a more comfortable lifestyle than me growing up. so I'm used to grinding and hustling as soon as I get out of bed while he seems to take his time to yawn and stretch his arms before he puts on his big boy pants?

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get a perspective on the situation that I am in from disinterested 3rd parties. Of course, what I might say might be biased, but I shall try and stick to the facts as much as possible. JFYI, we are Indian.

&amp;#x200B;

I got married 2 years ago and recently had a kid. His mother and I get along (generally), but her mother (60 F) and sister (24 F) are proving to be a huge pain in my ass. Her father has already passed away in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

They live in a town that is not my hometown. My wife had come here quite a few months ago in order to deliver the baby. She has been at her place for more than 7 months now. Since I could not bear to stay away from her and my kid for long, I have had to stay at her place for long periods of time. Not for the entire timespan (I had to run off to my home because things kept getting too unpleasant. Cumulatively, I must have stayed here for like 3-4 months).That has contributed in their general disrespect towards me. Everyone has been saying that it's my fault that I live in my in-laws' place for so long and I am contributing myself to the disrespect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pay for everything here, for all - Rations, milk, baby's expenses, wife's expenses. So it's not as though I am not pulling my own (and their as well) weight. Recently, we had a function in order to celebrate our firstborn, I had to pay for the cook.

&amp;#x200B;

They absolutely do everything to disrespect me. When I protest, they simply say that they were just kidding around. Very recently, my wife had her birthday. I wanted to wish her happy birthday at 12:00AM as is custom generally, but I fell asleep at around 11:30PM. Next day, her sister says to me - ""Don't you feel any shame not wishing her at 12:00 AM? You are lucky that you don't have a wife like me"" (No shit. I completely agree.) When I confronted her regarding the same, she said that she was just joking and refuses to apologize till this day.

&amp;#x200B;

Her mother is a different piece of work. She is very opinionated and has very definite ideas as to how things should be. If there is even a slight deviation from what she has decreed, she starts shouting. Her mother is not educated (7th passed) and is hell-bent on having her way in all the matters. Whenever there is an altercation, she starts shouting. It's as though shouting is her default volume. She tries to intimidate me and whenever I back off, she has this shit eating grin on her face. She claims that ""Wives should not be tortured in their homes"", when I have not laid a single bloody finger on her. Whenever things get hairy, she threatens to involve people in my extended family in order to mediate. I even bought her some expensive clothes in order to pacify her, but to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Now even my wife is rebuffing me. She is saying to me that she is going to stay with me only for the sake of our child. Even when her due date was far away, she has been rebuffing my physical advances towards her. When I tried to repair things between us today, she drove me away saying that everything is over between us and she is accompanying me to my hometown is because she loves our baby. She keeps saying that everything is over, marriage is a fraud, and that she should never have gotten married. (She was already a divorcee when I married her.)

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do. I am bipolar. All this is taking an enormous toll on my mental health. I, my wife and baby are leaving this place on 22nd this month (in 4 days) when I have my ticket booked. I really don't know how I am going to manage to stay here for 4 more days.

She asked for space in the note and didn't explicitly state the marriage is over so this whole time I'm in limbo. I recently reached out to her to see if we could talk and she said she didnt want to talk and accused me and my dad of bullying her. Then she stated that if I want her to get better I will leave her alone.  Then she blocked me. The bully part is completely not true. My dad has been nothing but respectful to her. 

Im still married to her and a part of me wants to remain that way but I'm starting to see the writing on the wall that this marriage is coming to an end. Should I continue to give her space and see what happens or should I call it quits now?

I met Luke through his long time (11 years) best friend, Angus (22M). They became best friends in high school and went to university together doing a very niche degree and stayed close. Angus and I are quite close, while I’ve only known him for just over 2 years I consider him one of my best friends. We work together and have lots in common. 

Like most if not all friendships, Angus and Luke have both fought many times and have their own issues with each other. The entire time I’ve known them they’ve been best friends but quietly vented about the other to other friends. They have a terrible tendency to not speak to each other when they have issues and just talk badly to others until it explodes, they go NC for a month then then make up and repeat. It’s all a bit dramatic and tiresome but there does seem to be a genuine friend love for each other between them and it seems to boil mostly down to bad communication on both ends. Until recently…

Angus has a terrible habit of lying. He lies to me and I catch him. I get hurt but I forgive him and know that it comes not from a place of malice but deep rooted personal issues (divorced parents, closeted bisexual and more). Angus also gets very angry at times and says inflamed things. Im of the belief that nobody says hurtful things unless they themselves are hurting so I’ve always been able to look beyond Angus’ outbursts and forgive him. 

Luke is very quiet and doesn’t share his feelings. However, when he does, he is quite judgemental and incredibly stubborn. He can never accept when he is wrong and will never apologise for anything. 

I share these traits of two people that are incredibly dear to me not to be told that they’re toxic people because I don’t think they are. They are both flawed and imperfect early 20 year old boys. Nobody is perfect. I love them both. 

The issue comes here however, Angus in his temper and judgemental habits has spoken and complained about Angus’ work ethic, life choices, professional goals, and more quite harshly. He’s said some pretty not nice things. Some of which I can see his side and even agree with. Others I think are outlandish and I will tell him that. Angus has said some of this stuff to me in our close friendship when he’s needed a vent. I occasionally bring it up to Luke in a filtered down way with the hope it would encourage the two to talk out their differences before another explosion. 

Anyway, Luke found out about some of the more strongly worded things Angus has said and Luke has taken it very personally and honestly, fair enough.  Luke has decided to completely go NC with Angus. He has just stopped replying to any and all messages with him and refuses to talk to him in any social setting one on one (they see each other a lot through university courses and share lots of mutual friends as friends of 10+ years would). More so however, Luke has cut off any of his friends who are close with Angus. Angus is a little bit heartbroken that his relationship of such a long time is over and with no discussion or sense of closure. He’s attempted reaching out multiple times but to no avail. 

Being close to both of them I know both sides of the story. Luke is sick and tired of feeling lied to and talked bad about. Angus has recognised he has said things he shouldn’t have in anger (and apologised for these things only to be ignored) and also feels like things have been blown out of proportion. While at first glance I’d side completely with Luke on this, he has said and done some equally horrible things to Luke. I’m very much of the opinion (as are others) that they are both as bad as each other. Maybe it’s why they’ve been friends so long. 

Last week I met with a good friend Florence (19F) who is also quite close with Luke and Angus and knows their issues. Luke has since gone NC with Florence because she lives close to Angus and as a result they see each other often and have a strong friendship (they’re not in a romantic relationship). Florence and Luke used to be very close and nothing has ever happened badly between them so she mentioned how hurt she was that Luke no longer responds to her messages or calls and has declined all invitations to her upcoming birthday party. She’s confused mostly and feels like she’s being punished for something that doesn’t involve her. The same situation has occurred with other friends in similar situations to Florence where Luke has cut them off for mere association to Angus. 

Here lies my issue (thank you for reading this far). Friends to me are incredibly valuable and I’d never imagine cutting them off like he has. I don’t agree with it and it’s made me question his relationship ethics as his boyfriend but also as a friend. I find myself asking “if he can so easily cut off these people for mere association to Angus and not care a bit about the years of friendship he’s had with them all, what kind of value does he hold for our relationship?” 

He’s told me how he “feels sad” these relationships are over but how he’s “so much more beyond the pettiness”. Seeing how hurt Angus, Florence and others are I’ve suggested he reach out. Not to give Angus another chance but to clear the air at least. This has led to many arguments that have called into question my “loyalties” (his words). It’s also put strain on my friendship with Angus however, who now judges me for staying with Luke but also I think for not being able to convince him to talk to Angus and clear the air. 

I’m of the opinion that Angus and Luke are adults and can make their own decisions about their relationship. However I don’t need to agree with it. And I honestly don’t. Furthermore Luke’s behaviour and decision to so abruptly cut off these people who I still have a relationship with is affecting my relationship with them. I can’t talk to Luke and tell him to change, it’s not my place for starters but it’s also not going to happen (he’s very stubborn but also clearly hurt by Angus). But also he judges me so much for continuing a relationship with these people who he suddenly disapproves of. 

How can I help both Angus and Luke? How can I help Florence? Who’s in the right? Is anyone? Am I too forgiving of Angus? Is Luke a big red flag? 

I could use some advice on this situation and I know it’s messy so if there’s questions please ask them and I’ll do my best to answer them.

I’m sorry in advance, because this might be a mess. I just hope that I can get my pointacross and that I can get some insights on this or advice from people who felt/feel the same.

Me (23F) and my LDR boyfriend (23M) are together for almost 9 months now. We are through somethings mainly due to my mental health problems. I had therapy sessions, I was working onmyself to solve this issue and I can say that I’m doing much, much better now. So you couldsay that things are generally good.

BUT

I still have these days sometimes, when I just get super anxious - seemingly out of nowhere-over the “what if” scenarios in my head. What if he talks with someone else on the side?What if he finds some of his female university classmates more attractive than me? What ifhe gets to know someone who he finds more enticing/interesting/better than me?
I used to have these “bad days” more often and there were times when I literally couldn’t getout of bed because of the effects of worry and anxiety. It’s not nearly as severe now, but itdoes come up from time to time.

We can talk every afternoon/night so it should not be such a big deal, I guess. I don’t want tobe overly clingy, I do want to give him the “me time” he needs, because I’m aware that hehas his uni/study things and his own responsibilities. But when we say good mornings andbasically there is zero messages, text from him afterwards until at night, it sometimesbothers and hurts me a little bit. Especially when I know that he doesn’t have classes at uniand he is just at home in front of the computer playing games.
