TLDR: My best friend started avoiding me once school started and now doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

I  met her in college during the spring semester. After meeting we started  hanging out every week and would hangout before and after class for  like 15-30 minutes. We ended up becoming close friends and this  continued into the summer.

We are  both taking classes a community college. She is also taking classes at  university. We are both math majors and ended up planning to take a math  class together. So I enrolled into the college and we talked about this  a lot. She kept telling me she'd love to take a class with me. She even  asked me to take a second one with her.

Once  school started she suddenly became distant. We hung out the fist week  for a few hours. The first few weeks I tried asking her to  hangout/study. But she kept saying she was busy. I guess she scheduled  her classes badly. At the start of the semester we would meetup by the  class since we both get their early. But then she stopped showing up.  She gets to school 30 minutes early and has 45 minutes of free time  afterwards. In class she wouldn't talk to me unless I talked to her. I  would wait after class and walk with her but I stopped doing this since  she wasn't talking to me. She never reached out or messaged me. The only  text she sent was about something I asked in class.

After  2 months we had a test coming up. I asked her about this and she took  awhile to respond. And in class she seemed awkward but scheduled a day.  It felt like she was avoiding me and didn't want to be my friend. So  after class I sent her a message saying I wanted to stop talking. She  asked why and that was it. But I didn't want to talk about yet. I ended  up deleting her number but I was able to find her discord a few weeks  later and tried talking to her. I wanted to know why she wasn't talking  to me. She told me she didn't notice and wouldn't really talk to me. She  kept telling me I threw away our friendship.

I  did reach out 2 more times and she agreed to talk to me both times. The  second time I asked to be friends and. But still seemed distant. So I  asked her if she wanted to be friends again and told her we didn't have  too. And she never replied or said anything to me in class. so I assumed  she didn't and told her I wouldn't bother her again. But then she sent  me a message a week later apologizing saying she felt like she hurt me.  And told me she probably wouldn't be a better friend then she was before  and that she doesn't want me to forgive her and she doesn't feel like  making up since it's too much work. I did try asking her some stuff but  she just ignored me. She refused to explain anything to me and won't  respond. I told her I'd never reach out again and left it at that. But  I'm really hurt by this. She just ignores me then messaged me to tell me  she doesn't care about our friendship then ignores me again. I'm not  sure what do and I can't stop thinking about this.

We've been friends now for over a year now and have been hanging out after work every once in a while for breakfast.

Now Melissa is an old ex, one that I've told Emily about. Melissa betrayed my trust really bad and blew up on my family after cheating on me. However, she did help me more than anyone ever had (before the fire and brimstone anyway) which was around 5 years ago.

So far everything's been fine with Emily. She's dated someone else and I'm cool with that. I do still have hope for her but I doubt we'll become anything more than friends in the near future.

Anyway, I just passing told Emily that Melissa called after this long just wanting someone to vent to because her mom had just passed away right in front of her. Idk why she still had my phone number but I spoke to her for a while, just so she had someone to talk to.

When Emily realized this woman was Melissa, she got up and ran out. I chased after her and asked what was wrong but she said nothing. She got in her car and just took off.

I texted her asking if everything was okay but got a response saying that she didn't want anything to do with my old relationship. She said that if I wanted to put myself through that again, she wanted nothing to do with it. She noted it didn't hurt her but she thought that it was sad that I'd ""still drop anything for her""

I have no idea what to do about this. I've known Emily for longer than Melissa and she's proven more trustworthy, so I'd rather be friends with Emily. But why would she react like this? I don't understand.

I don't want to lose Emily over this but I still don't get why she did that. I mean we're not dating and we don't chat all the time like we used to. She told me before our relationship ended that she didn't want to lead me on and that she just didn't feel love for me. So it's not like she's secretly in love with me.

Technically we're long distance because she's still living at her university campus in another city, but we're still very close and call each other daily, and see each other whenever possible. We're both on the same page about our serious monogamous relationship, and have incredible trust with each other.

When I first met her, she was a very reserved girl, and her ex in 2018 made her feel horrible in many ways. While it may seem that some of that baggage carried over, I was able to help her talk about it and open up about some of her trauma, and we developed a great connection where we literally share everything with each other.

Recently, she revealed to me that post-breakup (2019-2021), she had a tinder phase where she would go over to random guys' places for hookups (mostly one night stands, with the exception of 2 FWBs).

This didn't bother me at all of course, since it's natural for any partner to have had intimate relationships prior to meeting them (note: I've only had sex in serious relationships, which is 3).

However, because she was super comfortable with me, she told me that she has a breeding kink which she developed over those tinder years. Basically, with every guy she hooked up with, she didn't force them to use condoms unless they wanted to (which was super rare for tinder guys to want), and she let them finish inside of her. Because she was on the IUD, she felt ""empowered"" with how she was able to have raw sex and not get pregnant. She followed up by saying how she would get STD testing done monthly.

However, she went on to elaborate that the goal from her tinder phase wasn't to have mind blowing sex and orgasms with different men; she claimed her goal was to literally ""get the guy's c\*m"". She couldn't care less if the guy was horrible in bed, as long as she got the load in her then it was mission accomplished. She claimed she did that so that there was no way she could ever get disappointed; she always got what she wanted.

Naturally, I've been feeling really unsettled by this revelation. She's STD-free fortunately, and I admire her sexual confidence and pride in being a sexual person in a monogamous relationship now, but the idea that dozen have guys have drained their balls inside of her without a condom has left me having difficulty to breath at times.

While she and I have a great relationship, and she is super honest and kind and trustworthy, knowing that she acted that way in the past is devastating.

I'm not sure what to do, whether I should bring this up with her or just try to get over it?

The next morning he was furious, he tells me I'd treated him poorly and that I was really rude, and that he does not snore on purpose. From my point of view, even if my tone could come out a little harsh I don't think I've treated him that badly but I can see that maybe even if it wasn't my intention at the moment it could come out nasty and it is rude to wake someone up, so I apologized and told him it wasn't my intention to be rude and that I was sorry for treating him badly, and that I was sorry for waking him up too.  
He has been mad at me for a week now, which is very frustrating, I know he is hurt but it seems like a lot of time to be mad for it and I've already apologized many times.  
The problem is we are facing a big decision right now, we are deciding if we want to sign a new lease in a new apartment, and having him not very close to me at this moment is really hard for me. We are in a hurry since there are other people trying to rent the apartment as well (is a good deal) and I'm very stressed about the whole thing.   
Is frustrating for me also because this is a recurrent issue in our relationship, but the other way around, he sometimes gets across a little harsh with me when he is in a bad mood, and rarely apologizes, even if a tell him how I feel, he almost never acknowledge that my point of view may be valid as well, on the other hand, I'm rarely rude at all, so I'm also a little pissed about the so little slack he is giving me in a time of high stress.  


Any advice on how can I handle this?  


TL;DR: My BF got mad about something that (at least from my point of view) is not that big of a deal, actually is something that he does fairly often himself.

Parents are aware and excuse it. 
To preface, my sibling and I are pretty much as opposite as can be. They were the popular crowd in school and I was never that, and it’s clear that’s how it was based on their general attitude in life. Also, as siblings, we’ve played roughly before and it was all fun and games. As I’ve grown up though, we don’t do that anymore. Now, we aren’t close at all because I do not get along very well with them. I will admit that I can have a short fuse with them sometimes because we are not that compatible as siblings. On to the incident. 
My family had rented a vacation house and we just arrived after a relatively long drive. My sibling was very upset (combination of being in the car for hours, hunger, and pressure to get to dinner on time). My sibling was struggling with the code on the door, as the instructions we were given were kind of vague and they already had very little patience. I walk up to the door and say, “Maybe you should let someone else have a go at it.” My sibling cuts me off and says, “I’m still talking.” I finish my sentence since I refuse to be talked to like a child and they let out a huge sigh and physically push me out of the way.
I was shocked. First, that they did that to me over a VERY minor inconvenience. And second, that no one else thought anything of it! It was incredibly childish and astounding that my sibling would do that to me, especially when I had done nothing to instigate that type of reaction. 
I talked to one of my parents, who actually excused it by saying it was just due to stress. I fought back and said that that wasn’t an excuse to get physical with someone. I’m super angry and hurt that my parents think this behavior is acceptable and excusable. For the next few days, I have to be in the same house as them. However, when I get back home, I do not know how to address this situation. I am by no means pretending everything is fine right now. I’m just being more quiet and reserved and I don’t let that sibling touch me anymore. That sibling has something to say every time I move away or tell them not to touch me. They’ve been treating me terribly every since the trip began as well because I don’t react the way they want (I do not cater to their needs whatsoever and I will not be silent to make things easier).

The cause of it was her stonewalling me in the middle of our conversation. She left my messages on delivered for four days, then got upset when I didn’t reach out to her. This tipped me over the edge and I responded by being firm, but still calm enough to not raise my voice or call her names.

I wasn’t perfect in my approach, before I called her I said “I will call at x time, pick up because I won’t call again.” After that text I got from her. I wanted to communicate something was very wrong, but instead it came off cold and distant. I realised I could’ve worded that better. Throughout the conversation, I would bring up the issue at hand, then her points would be her focusing on how she feels and not addressing the issue. There were multiple times where she would turn it on me and tell me how I’m affecting her negatively, how she’s always the one fighting for the relationship, how she cares so much.

I agreed with her and said I do see that. I kept asking her why she didn’t respond to my messages with all of this, she said she didn’t want to start a fight. She then said she feels she has to walk on eggshells around me which I didn’t like. I paused for a moment to reflect and ask why. She told me about the instances I said I would break up with her. I told her I never meant that and clarified each statement. Here they are:

The first time I said something was when she accused me of cheating and I denied the allegations. She didn’t trust my words at all, so I plainly said: “I’m done defending myself, without trust we can’t build a healthy relationship. Our relationship can’t survive if there’s no trust.” The second time was when I received an ultimatum. I told her ultimatums are toxic as hell and that I would not tolerate that in our relationship, saying if that’s how she is, then I’d have to reconsider.(now that I write that I can see how my message was interpreted.) The third time was at the end of our conversation when I said “moving forward stonewalling will not be tolerated. Unless there’s an emergency. If either one of us ghost the other, then that person is single when they get in contact again.”

I said that due to her admitting she saw my message, read it, and chose not to respond. The message in question was a small misunderstanding. It only grew when I felt ignored, and disrespected. She may feel that way too. Is there anything I can do to improve my communication? I’m not perfect so I hope I didn’t write as a victim. There are always two sides, I just want to know how I can communicate better so that my intention matches my words.

So for a bit of context, I (F21) and my ex (M22) started dating in June of this year. We clicked and connected like I’ve never connected with anyone before, he said the same thing. Everything was perfect and we were so happy, always laughing joking, opening up to each other, spending time with each other’s family’s and just building a really solid foundation. Apart from one problem that we had, intimacy. I was very open in the beginning with him that intimacy was something I really struggled with since my previous relationship was very abusive sexually and so it was something I was still learning to be open and comfortable with.
I explained to him it had nothing to do with him and me not wanting to and we were making steps together in order for it to be an experience both of us could be happy and comfortable with. He would always say things like, we’ll work through it, we’ll get through it together. Granted I didn’t put as much work into myself as I should’ve done in the beginning but as we moved forward my anxiety relaxed and I was feeling so much better and was looking forward to next see him to experience that with him.
Two weeks ago he was supposed to stay at mine for the weekend and was reassuring me on the morning that he was coming, the time he would be here etc.
That night he called me and said we shouldn’t be together anymore and it was because of the intimacy. Saying everything was perfect apart from that one aspect. I hung up and afterwards received several texts from him, which I ignored and then went to bed. I woke up to three missed calls and a text saying he wanted to be with me and so I called him, and it was so back and forth I’ve never experienced anything like it, saying he wants to be with me and he loves me, to then saying that he doesn’t know if it’ll work now, over and over again. I hung up and we stayed talking for a few days until I mentally couldn’t take it and so cut off contact. He then sent me a long message saying he loves me and doesn’t want to be with anyone else and to take time and we can sort it out. We talked again a little after that, and he’s gone on holiday saying when he’s back we’ll talk and see if we wanna meet up and talk. But I’m feeling so confused and like he doesn’t care about me since he seems cold now when we talked and so I cut off contact again. I want to be with him because I love him so much but don’t know what is really going on, or whether I should cut ties completely and move on.

I had to surgically remove a small benign cyst on my upper thighs. I had local anesthesia so I was awake and didn’t feel the cutting etc. This was around 3-4 pm in the afternoon. My woman (35f)  was at work until 7 pm. I was allowed to leave on my own and was given a treatment bag to dress and care for my wound. 

Okay, so she did call and check on me periodically. She had also spent time with me from Thursday to Tuesday morning and I would drive her to work in the am and rush home to work. I work from home. Well since my surgery she didn’t come to see me once. She did ask but I’m prideful I said I was alright so I suppose that was my fault. My friend called and checked on me. My mother and grandmother also checked on me. I went to see them and they cooked for me and offered emotional support. I live about 40 minutes away. 

Well, I did feel emotionally abandoned. I felt quite alone actually. November is not the best month for me emotionally. I lost my best friend three years ago and my great aunt last year. I am not the most emotional only when alone. So I was a bit taken back by her actions. Again, she did call and check on me but the conversations were mostly about her work day which is fine and she’d briefly ask how I was. She went home every night and sometimes start issues out of thin air. About how I was acting funny and ask me interrogating questions on why I had taken so long to answer my phone. I was downstairs warming up the amazing plate of food my grandmother treated me and it toke some time walking up the stairs to get my phone. She was very dismissive and hung up. She seemed intoxicated as well. ( she is trying to recover from alcoholism). Well, I finally expressed my feelings to her last night. Trying to be vulnerable. Something I have a hard time doing because some people tend to take that emotion for weakness and use it against you. 
Well, I was right in my notion. She was very defensive. Began attacking me stating I was acting like an infant. She did ask me and I said I was fine. How I was trying to make her feel bad and it’s not working. Then said I wanted to find a reason to break up with her for the holidays. She used very suggestive languages saying she’s always the one in the wrong in this relationship and basically I’m mentioning how I feel to bring out a negative action and response from her. 
I was taken back by her response and basically shut down. I said forget I said anything. I’m good. 
Now, let me share a background story. When she was in a car accident.  She was hit by a car. I jumped out of bed and drove to the hospital. We were separated at the time. She didn’t ask me I did it out of love compassion care and concern. I rearranged my schedule. I helped her for two months. Brought her to my house and was very doting to her while working from her. When she returned to work I drove her to work until she felt safe to go home to and from work on her own. 
When she had Covid, I picked her up to care for her. She didn’t ask. Disinfected my house. Nursed her to health though it was minor. She has the vaccine. So she Reuther to work after 5 days but I was there physically
So many times she needed me when we did leave together and I was there also. When she was arrested for being intoxicated and aggressive to her roomate because she felt they stole her phone, we weren’t together but her family reached out to me to help post her bond. 
I feel in relationships we should be there emotionally and physically for our partners when they are going through something. 
I was hurt and felt unappreciated and alone honestly.  I feel embarrassed to admit this. I expected the same in conjunction. Just to be here. It was my first surgery. I did and have been managing on my own but it’s made me think a lot about my care for others and the lack on return and that’s my fault. 
She’s coming over this weekend but I feel what’s the purpose now. I’ve done good on my own. Now you’re coming after the fact because you’re off.

It felt like things were finally falling into place, you know? We went on many great dates until we finally put a label on things towards the end of September after a few months of just dating and seeing where things go. Now, one important thing to note is I was extremely apprehensive towards a relationship in the beginning. As someone who had gotten out of a relatively toxic long-term relationship the year before, I was terrified at the idea of opening up my heart to someone again and giving them the power to wake up on day and decide that I never meant anything to them (This is kind of foreshadowing.) But he was so sweet with his words, and his gaze always held nothing but a soft fondness so can one really blame me for falling for his sweet words? Needless to say, I took a leap of faith and I decided to pursue a relationship with this guy. 

I won't sit here and say I might not have been too much to handle, but I had warned him several times that I overthought a lot, and that it wasn't out of a place of distrust exactly but rather a place of fear and trauma. In the beginning of the relationship, he gave me literally no reason to overthink. It was what one could call perfect. Surprising me in the parking lot of my job to take me to get ice-cream, sending cookies to my house after an exam that had me stressed beyond words, and randomly dropping by my apartment just because he could and wanted to. He made me feel so secure in the beginning that I probably looked past warning signs. Looked past his late night texts where he would say he would understand if I backed out now because he would hurt me in the future, that he wasn't a good person. But I desperately wanted to believe that nothing would come of those words. He was just an imperfect human being to me who had fears, and who was I to let that decide who I give my heart to? 

Fast forward a few weeks into the relationship, he had stayed at my place following a night of barhopping and he told me he loved me. And I didn't feel that feeling of dread and despair. I felt the same way he did, though I did not betray my feelings immediately. I told him I loved him too a few days later. This is where things began to fall apart though. He started to respond to texts less frequently, he stopped using pet names, he stopped sending silly little heart emojis and those stupid chibi cat love gifs that you can find whenever you search the term ""love"" in a gif finder. I wasn't prepared for such a sudden change, because up until then, everything was good. I didn't understand why it was happening, he said it was because college finals were starting and he was stressed but he had no problem answering my best friends (23f) texts and calls immediately. (She will play into this story a little too). I desperately just needed reassurance but it felt like every attempt to reach for some fell on empty words in response. This triggered my trauma immensely, but I tried so hard to not bother him about it and it honestly destroyed me inside. We would still have long phone calls, and I banked on that, but I began to realize that he even started to dodge actually seeing me. I noticed this when I just wanted to see him after a week of not seeing him, and he kept telling me he would let me know whats happening the day I asked about. We got to that day, and he told me he was still waiting to hear from his friend. Fast forward to 5:00pm, and I haven't heard anything from him yet and he's in our discord server in a voice call and playing video games with my best friend. I felt very hurt and upset by this, and I think my friend must've nagged him because he told me I could come over, he just didn't have anything to do. 

So I went over, because it didn't matter what we did, I just wanted to be with him. But then he wanted to continue playing games with my best friend, and I did bring my laptop, and I did play some, but then it died and he carried on finishing the game with my friend. He did eventually come to bed, and it felt okay, but I couldn't deny the sinking feeling in my chest. I would see him the following day though for my birthday party. the birthday party was okay, and I woke up the following morning after the party to him gently stroking my cheek. We exchanged I love yous and I drove him home. 

I can't lie, it was at this point that I felt like maybe this would be the last time I got to see him. The last time I got to kiss him. Usually we would linger in the car a little longer, try not to go, but he felt hurried, and he left as fast as we arrived. The days following only increasingly burdened my already disturbed thoughts. Phone calls started to become rare, and he would say he was busy doing things and I don't mean to sound like a crazy ex, but he would say he was at class but the snap map would show him at his house. I think it really started getting a little fishy to me though on the 11th when I texted him asking him if he still loved me. He left me on read, and kept saying he was on the phone. He wasn't on the phone. Again, he was in the discord server we had on voice call with my best friend playing a video game. He was deliberately choosing her over me again and it hurt. I sent a few more messages, detailing that if something was going on that he needed to communicate with me so we could fix it. I didn't receive an answer until several hours later when I finally messaged him again asking him what it was I did wrong, because at this point all I could do was assume I must've done something. He said I did nothing wrong, he promised I did nothing wrong, but things were happening so fast and his mental health went downhill so fast that he wasn't ready for a relationship. And just like that, the girl he claimed to love so much was left as easily as he came. And it hurts so badly. 

If he was struggling mentally why didn't he just tell me? Why would he leave me on read and delivered, why would he constantly pass up my phone calls, why would he say he was busy but then be busy actually playing games with his friends or my best friend? He wasted no time unadding me everywhere, which hurt the most, because it genuinely feels like I never did mean anything to him. I feel like I was used. This was the guy who pursued me, who wanted to be in the relationship first, the guy who told me he loved me 4 weeks into the relationship and constantly told me he would never leave and that he wanted to marry me. I still don't understand what changed so fast. Was I loved bombed? Is it entirely possible that his mental health did just get really bad?  I still hope he'll come back, but he unadded me literally everywhere.

This was all happening right in front of me and it made me very uncomfortable because my boyfriend is a very reserved and quiet person normally, and he’s always lead me to believe that he isn’t interested in female friends because, in his words, “If a guy is friends with a girl, it’s because he wants to have sex with her”. When I told him how I felt about it, he basically told me he wasn’t flirting, he’s friendly with all of his coworkers, she has a boyfriend, she’s too young for him, etc. My problem though is that he has a history of cheating on girls in his previous relationships, so I’ve always been a bit insecure in the back of my mind. However, we’ve never had this type of issue before because I’ve always chosen to trust him, and I’ve never seen him interact with a girl in a way that I didn’t like. This is the first incident we’ve had in about 6 years of being together. 

During the fight, he also said that every time I skip my medication, we fight like this. I take anxiety medication, and I skipped it one day like a week ago. I’m not psychotic or cognitively unaware. I just have panic disorder. He also said that I go to work “dolled up” and have social media because I like attention so I have no room to talk. These comments really hurt my feelings because I don’t entertain attention I get, and he’s seen that firsthand many times. I go out of my way to maintain boundaries with men because I don’t want him to feel uncomfortable. It’s been 2 days and we have not reached a resolution, nor has he tried to reassure me that nothing is going on, or that he’ll be more conscious of how he interacts with this girl. I haven’t had the courage or energy to bring up the topic again. I just keep going about my day thinking about what he’s doing when I’m NOT there.

There have been some problems/incidents in my 2 year marriage that I can't seem to get over. I'm dwelling on the bad stuff, some of it from years ago, and it's making me pretty unhappy. I just want to hear from people outside the situation to see how they would handle things. I've been trying to get him to go to couples therapy for 2 years. Should I keep trying? 

My husband has hygiene issues that have improved, but it was a struggle to get to this point. For the past year he's finally gotten in the habit of brushing his teeth everyday, so that issue is resolved. In the past (last year) he somehow left a bit of poop in the tub a couple of times and one time (also last year) he threw up on a blanket and just rolled it up and put it in the corner of the room. His breath (usually) and clothes don't smell bad anymore, so he fixed those problems. He has this one really gross habit that I've asked him to stop several times over the years. He says he's stopped but I saw him doing it two weeks ago. And he still needs to go to the dentist (I've been asking him to go for years) because it's been at least 6 years since he last went and his bottom row of teeth has a lot of discolored plaque. Even though he has changed some of the gross habits I can't stop being bothered by his hygiene. 

He choked me, but it was only once and it wasn't in a fit of rage or anything. It was a weird situation. I hadn't had sex with him in a while and I think thats why he was being snippy with me that day. I was snippy back. At one point he walked into the room I was in and put his hands around my neck. I thought he was joking but then he started to squeeze. When I realized I was actually being choked and that I was starting to have trouble breathing I started tapping on his arm and he let go and walked out of the room. He must have been joking around because we were at his parent's house when he did it and I don't imagine he was going to kill me at someone else's house. It upset me but I didn't say anything about it for a long time. When I finally did ask what that whole thing was about he said he didn't remember doing it. Anyway, that incident was 2 years ago and he hasn't done it again. I think about it a lot though, can't seem to let it go. 

He can get really aggressive when driving. He has antagonized other drivers when they've pissed him off. I've screamed in his car a few times. The worse time was maybe 5 months ago when he floored it and swerved the car to make a pedestrian think he was going to hit him. He's gotten better about not antagonizing drivers so much but a few weeks ago he pulled up beside a woman and started screaming at her that she was a ""retarded cunt"". It's very stupid but I say a little prayer that we get to our destination safely and without incident every time I get into his car. He's gotten a bit better about his road rage but I can't stop doing the prayer thing. 

He also rarely pays for takeout (which we get 2-4 times a week) and movies (we go 3-4 times a month). I've begged him to take me to a movie every now and again because going to the movies is my favorite thing to do. I've managed to talk him into paying for 3 of the movies we've seen in our 5 years together. I paid for the movies we went to on my birthday each year. He says taking me to the movies is a waste of his money. This seems to be a hill he's willing to die on. I've moved up in my career and make decent money now, but at one point he was making $27,000 more than me a year, but I was still footing the bill for takeout and movies. We own a home together now and he does pay $200 more than me toward the monthly bills, but I cover 90% of takeout, 99% of movies, and 90% grocery trips. 

I'm black and he's white. He has told me two jokes where the punchline was implying that I'm an n word. After he told the first joke I confronted him. He said ""how could you think I would call you that?"" and cried so much that I actually comforted him and forced myself to stop crying because it was like there wasn't room for my emotions. The second time I didn't want to deal with the tears so I didn't say anything. 

Sex is an issue. I can't get into it because I worry about his hygiene. He has given me infections in the past. Right after we got married he told me that foreplay for me takes too long so now we do it pretty quickly, so I'm never warmed up. Plus, he jackhammers so sex is usually painful. I told him I don't like when he does that, so he doesn't do it the whole time anymore. He does still do it toward the end though. I think thats the only way he can finish.

I saw her first and hit her up first. I can tell you, she gave me an unforgettable life till date. The first year was amazing, I was 17 and she was 15 without her I could only imagine the darkest days back then lol. Then we went to different colleges and I admit I turned into an asshole, I was micro cheating her and all and I swear I don't know why I did shit what I did. Then in my 2nd year of college responsibilities grew on me. So for some reason I decided to break up with her because I was feeling too comfortable with her that I started feeling fearless about anything in life lol, like I was in my most comfortable zone ever, and I knew I had to work on myself now so I broke up with her and she obviously assumed the worst. Then I took up a course and stared working on my start up plan. Meanwhile to cope up with depression I started going to pubs. I admit that was my darkest time seeing her heart broken and me not doing anything in life and all. Me going to pubs, talking to girls sent her into a bad depression, I couldn't take that anymore so after a couple of months we decided to meet and we eventually got back again, after a while it turned toxic for some time for the stuff I did during the 'break up' period and god I swear I had the most productive time of my life. Then the relationship was all good and I am all over her and deeply in love with her. Then comes drugs phase where I got addicted to alcohol and weed due to the parental pressure and college pressure because I chose a degree I never wanted to do just to please my parents and here I was not being able to work either for myself or for my parents, I got hooked to drugs.

Months pass by, doing great and I put the substances a side for a while but am at my lowest. I can't explain everything but I keep failing in so many subjects, not being able to focus on my start up properly and still pushing it hard and hard. My relationship with my family is at it's all time low so from a while I was thinking of a break/ break up again. I am already the worst boyfriend and there's that pressure  to fix myself to be better for her but now I am totally stressed out, I was afraid to explain everything because she only thinks the worst about me due to my past. But I still gave it a shot today, after having continuous bad time I explained her everything that I am going through on our 3 year anniversary and all she could assume is that I like other girls and I want bang other girls so I am breaking up wit her. No matter how much I am trying to explain my position, she can't get it. I need some advice on how to properly break up with her.

I feel like I’ve been living in anticipatory grief ever since, knowing that this cannot be cured and will eventually take his life. He was doing well for the first few months of chemo but he has been steadily declining the last few months and it seems like we are nearing end of life for him unfortunately.

It has been so upsetting to witness his decline.. he has always been so healthy and only started experiencing symptoms a few months before his diagnosis. We just never saw this coming. That being said, my mom has not taken this well emotionally. She has done everything she can to take care of my dad during this and does an amazing job! However she breaks down frequently and cries to me almost every day now.

I’m struggling so hard with supporting her. I feel like I haven’t been able to fully process my own grief and feelings about this because I’m so worried about her emotions and mental well-being. I’m so concerned with how she’s going to manage whenever my dad passes. 

For context: My mom and I are very close and have always talked on the phone every day, sometimes multiple times per day.  Almost every phone conversation we have now ends with her crying to me about my dad. Recently I’ve had to end calls fairly quickly whenever she gets emotional because she always calls me during my workday. I talk to clients all day long and don’t want to be in emotional anguish during this. I’m a sensitive and empathetic person so whenever my mom gets upset about my dad, it makes me upset too. I hold it together on the phone with her and probably seem almost numb or cold, but I frequently break down once I get off the phone and am by myself. I had to tell her recently that I can talk about my dad with her after work but I just can’t do it during work hours anymore. She understood but I felt so terrible shutting her down. 

I’m also feeling incredible amounts of guilt surrounding my priorities during my dad’s illness. I’m starting a new job soon that is a huge leap in responsibility for me. I’m overwhelmed but excited for it because it’s a good opportunity for me to gain experience and make more money before I start a family of my own next year. I’ve been focusing a lot on preparing for this position and I’m realizing now that I should have been focusing more on spending as much time as possible with my dad. 

I have a great relationship with my dad but have always been closer with my mom. Like I said, I talk to my mom every single day. I love my dad so much but I have never been close with him emotionally like I am with my mom or talked to him on a daily basis. Because of this, I have struggled and failed at spending as much time with him during these past few months as I should have. 

I’m trying to reconcile my need to support my parents while also keeping my own life on track. I really want to start a family soon, I was hoping even before my dad passes, so I’ve tried so hard to keep my mental health in check and my life moving in the right direction. I also just got married and want to focus on keeping my relationship with my spouse strong and maybe even celebrating this new chapter of life for us. I guess I just feel so guilty for wanting to focus on these things while my dad is suffering physically and emotionally, alongside my mom. 

Has anyone felt this way? Any advice would help me so much. I am incredibly blessed to have close friends to talk to about this but l’d like outside opinions too. I think I have been a little selfish through this and my friends love me too much to say that.

I feel kinda confused in relationship.

My GF(24) of 2 years, who I (25) love and see daily, loves me too, i know that. 

I knew she had rough past relationships which she told me at beggining, but never mentioned anything again and I didn't want to interfere. She only had 1 long relationship with guy for 3 years.

I asked her again when we were 6 months in relationship, if she ever been with anyone from her circle of friends, because there are alot of guys and I just wanted to be aware of that so we can joke about it. She said no.

 I told her about my relationships, even introduced her to my ex not long time ago. I have been open about it and casually answered her questions about details. 

She opened to me few days ago, told me that she didn't wan't to tell me earlier because i was looking unintrested, about this guy we were hanging out with 4 times at different occassions, we spoke every time.  They were  hooking up one summer when she broke with this guy from past relationship. Everyone knew that except me, who entered her circle of friends and thought everything is flawless.  She said that she doesn't hang with him even tho her best friends are sleeping at his place sometimes, and she and I were sleeping at her other best friend place. That guy that she used to hook up with, came to her bestfriend place with bottle of wine while my girlfriend was making ready to go out at pub. We were having fun and it was good time. 

It was a lot for me, so I broke up with her. Kinda processed whole situation at home, and went to her after 1 hour of breakup to reconcile as i thought this is just bullshit to worry about.

I listened and didn't judged her, later she wanted to open up about other relationships she had.  There are 2 guys she told me about, she knew whole time I knew who they are, and 1 older guy than her and me that is in another country which I will probably not meet, and by omitting kept it secret for this long. I have been friend with em for long time as teenagers (10 -16 years), now we just say hello to each other. I even mentioned my stories from that time with that particular group of friends, she said she knows those ppl and hinted that she used to hang out with em, but that was after i splitted up from that group of friends. She knows i knew those guys and kept it a secret from me.  

I acted neutral and even remembered and told her about some happy times with them, as I am very sEcUre boyfriend. Day after, I went home and got stuck in overthinking, kinda omitted why I was not chatty when texting with her, but later at night i told her i was overthinking why she kept it secret from me, those 2 exes and past fwb thats still in circle of friends. 

She said thanks for telling me that while i am on job, and that I never asked her about that (i only asked has she been with anyone in circle of friends or someone I will have to meet, but it seems like she is not remembering this question). Also scared of being judged because of her unrest feelings. This time we will break up for real, as rhetoric question she said.

I told her I need some time and space.

While processing whole situation my gut is repeating words ""Can't Trust"" even tho i love her and i know she loves me. She is my second love, and now I am feeling like this is not the last..",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7581453,public,self,Are omitted info really lies in the relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yyna32/are_omitted_info_really_lies_in_the_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,,

I (19F) and my boyfriend (20m) met in college. We have been dating for 6 months now. From first look, I knew that he was my person. I love this man to death. I can confidently say that he feels the same. We were inseparable. Wherever he went, I went. We were each other's first kiss, first real love, and first sexual partners. We were happy and in love.

Unfortunately, hardships started to affect our relationship. To name a few, my college roommate tried to sabotage our relationship out of jealously, my father didn't approve of our relationship (we're interracial), but most notably he hid the fact that he had a daughter. To make it even worse, he showed me pictures of his daughter, had me in the same car as the mother of his child all while I was under the impression that his daughter and mother of his child were his cousins.

You can imagine the hurt I felt when I learned the truth. I felt like such a fool. I treated the mother of his child like a cousin, not someone that my boyfriend had sex with. I would make comments like ""your cousin looks like she can be ours"", not knowing that was his child. What really stung was the fact that I could no longer be first. He had me under the impression that I would be the first person he shared that with. I had truly hit rock bottom. I was angry and jealous of a baby. Now, I look at his daughter as my own but it still stings.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend and I get into a fight over the mother of his child. No, I am not jealous but I don't like her. I don't like her because she treats the baby like shit and she is using my boyfriend. She can't put my boyfriend of child support because he provides financially for the baby. Everything that the baby has, clothes, diapers, crib, toys, bottles, etc. he has bought. He got the baby health insurance. He takes her to every doctor's appointment. He takes her to and from daycare. He spends time with her multiple times a week for hours each visit. The only thing she does, and I mean the only thing, is breast feed the baby and drop her off at daycare.

Recently, since my boyfriend confirmed that we were dating she stopped letting him see the baby as often. Citing reasons like I have to go to group (she lives in subsidized housing) or it's too cold outside. My boyfriend has a car and the baby doesn't have to go to group, she does. What really pisses me off is that she's always broke. Her welfare program pays her thousands of dollars every month, she doesn't pay rent, she on SNAP, and my boyfriend buys everything the baby needs. So how are you broke? Why are constantly asking my boyfriend to buy you groceries? Why are you asking my boyfriend to buy you McDonalds? Why are you asking my boyfriend to do your laundry at the laundromat? The math is not mathing for me.

Anyway, everything comes to a head when the baby came over for a couple of hours. My boyfriend does not play about the well being of his daughter. Him and the mother of his child have gotten into arguments over her not eating or her house constantly being dirty. Because of this, he checks her fridge. She did not have food in her fridge. She two TV dinners, a carton of milk, and about 12 bags of frozen breast milk. However, when the baby got over to our apartment, the baby's stomach was flat. It was obvious that the baby had not been fed. On top of that, when my boyfriend was packing her up for her to go back to her mother's house she threw a fit. The baby is a pretty docile baby. She'll coo and talk but she only cries she's tired or needs to be changed. That baby was wailing. She was red in the face and tears were rolling down her face. She did not want to back to her mother and would not let go of my boyfriend.

Of course this was a big red flag to my boyfriend and I but more so for me because I have lived through exactly what his daughter is about to/going through. I have lived with a spite mother that was taking advantage of my father while she spent the money partying or on drugs. I have lived with a spiteful, bitter mother that used me as a weapon against my father because he moved on. I have lived in subsidized housing. I have purposefully not been fed, clothed, or bathe just because my mother simply didn't feel like it or she just wanted to get back at my father. I know how it feels and it doesn't feel great. I grew up resenting both of my parents because of this. I wouldn't wish that experience upon anyone, not even my worst enemies. I know the warning signs.

When I brought up my concerns to my boyfriend he flips out and calls me jealous. I am not jealous of her. The only thing that I could possibly be jealous about is that fact that she had his baby first. Even then I consider the baby as my own. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just concerned. You can't run female bullshit on another bullshit. I know your bullshit. I tried to explain this to my boyfriend but he wasn't having any of it. He's refusing to talk to me.

I don't know what to do. There's something fishy going on and my boyfriend refuses to look into it. I won't listen to me and not am I concerned for the baby but I am hurt that he won't listen to me. Granted, I have been aggressive in my approach; constantly bringing it up, yelling whenever he tries to walk away, giving him the silent treatment when he refuses to talk. I know not the best approach but I don't know what else to do.

He has reassured me that he’s never done that and he never will after I told him about my suspicions. I know many people are okay with their significant other watching porn and masturbating but I am uncomfortable with the idea of my person getting off to someone else. 

Last night, we’re in a cabin with my brother and his wife and he disappears when we start watching a movie for a good while. TMI but I pretty sure he wasn’t pooping.
Then I calm myself down and say he’d never do that in this tiny cabin when my siblings are here. 
But i go to the bathroom and there is a rag on the floor next to the sink that’s crusty and smells like chlorine (which apparently is what dried semen smells like) 
So I panic a little. Truthfully, I put the towel to hang in the bathroom to see if he would do anything about it / hide it again. He gets upset when I ask him because he doesn’t want to feel like I don’t trust him. I trust him but the situation seemed so unavoidable. What else could it be?

My (f31) fiancee (m36) and I are getting married in 4 months. We have been together for almost 4 years. He is a very liked man with many friends, great humor, happy-go-lucky attitude, and a great work ethic. However, he grew up in a very wealthy family and has little sense of responsibility. Growing up, his family had housekeepers and gardeners so the kids never had chores or jobs, and they didn't even own a single pet to learn responsibility (when we got our dog, I had to show him how to pick up dog poop - he had never done this before). He actually failed out of his first year of college because he just didn't know how to be responsible and did nothing but drink and party and get money from his parents.

I don't want you to think he has absolutely no sense of responsibility, as that is not the case. He actually has now received his masters degree and when it comes to work, he has an amazing work ethic and is a top performer. And when I try to talk to family and friends about this, I feel like I get not-so-helpful responses because everyone just loves him as a person and sees how great he is to me on other aspects. They feel this is all ""minor"" and ""that's men for ya"" type attitudes.

My problem is with overall responsibility and financial responsibility. Right now we are saving up for our wedding and buying a house, and I just feel as if I am the only one doing anything. When it comes to chores, I primarily do the laundry, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. He helps with doing 50/50 with taking care of the dog, and will do things like empty the dishwasher if all the dishes are clean, or does sometimes come with me to the grocery store. We have talked about him taking on more before, and normally he will do great for about a month, then it all just goes back to how it was. I even have to keep track of his own personal appointments because he forgets to do them. For example, we just moved to a new state and his car registration is expiring in 4 weeks. I have reminded him numerous times in the past month to get this taken care of before his registration actually expires and he ""forgets"". I feel as if I am having to keep track of all my personal responsibilities, as well as his. 

As for the finances, I do make more money so I often take on more expenses. We split rent and utilities 50/50 (we live in a state where these things are very cheap. When we used to live in an expensive state, I paid more in rent and took on utilities), and then extra things like date nights, pet expenses, etc. is more like 75/25 (me covering more). I am okay with this due to our salary differences, but we did create a budget for him about 6 months ago to follow that would have him contributing to the house fund and wedding fund as well.. while still leaving money for fun activities like golf and going out. I have a budget for myself also, so I wasn't just singling him out with this. This budget was also something along the lines of him contributing 20% to my 80% of the savings.. but it has truly only been me contributing anything. I went to talk with him about this last night, and found out that not only has he not contributed anything to the funds, but he also has put a significant amount on his credit card the past few months and doesn't have money to add because he is trying to pay that off (his credit card was fully paid off in June this year because his parents randomly gave him a lot of money and he used that). I don't even know how this happens since I pay for majority of things in our relationship.

The problem is he doesn't even stress or worry about things like money on his credit card because every year his parents will just throw him money (anywhere between $5k - $20k) and he uses it to pay off his credit cards or any debts he has. He never had even checked his credit before we started dating and when I did have him do this, he had like 3 collections on there for bills he didn't pay with internet or AT&amp;T (easy to take care of things!)

I need advice on what to do. I don't want to just rely on his parents for money and I want us to be responsible ourselves, and I just don't know how to get him to turn into the responsible adult I feel he should be at this point in our lives. I almost feel as if he is just waiting for his grandpa to pass to collect an inheritance and planning on using that for his contribution to the funds vs adding some now. We are talking about having children after our wedding and I truly am scared to do that with him because I just don't know if he is responsible enough. I worry I will have to be responsible for taking care of our finances, taking care of the chores, taking care of the kids, taking care of the kids appointments, and also still taking care of his own appointments. Which I know I want kids, so this just has been having me second guessing so much.

I love this man. He is so amazing in so many other aspects. I just don't know how to make the responsibility piece stick.

I've never written on reddit so I will do my best with wording and explanations, even though I am widely known to be the opposite of a word smith. I (19f) have been with my boyfriend (21m) for about a year and a half. The beginning of our relationship, was like any other, filled with complete bliss. We met in the beginning of the school year, and once we met we were essentially attached at the hip. Every second of every day was spent together, which I now realize was probably very unhealthy. 

The problem starts when we went on our summer break. There were a few problems throughout the year, but nothing too major to cause me to lose feelings for him. Over the summer, he was an asshole. He was always snapping at me, and taking his anger out on me. He would apologize, and use the excuse that he is burnt out, and since he is living at home he's just always in a pissy and horrible mood. However, his apologies were recurring, and for the same actions. Multiple apologies for the same actions lose meaning after hearing it a multitude of times, especially if there's never any improvement. 

Once we returned back to school, things did get better for a little bit, however it quickly fell off again. When he is in a bad mood, I get ignored and we do not talk - or should I say he does not talk. I will spend 20 minutes attempting to get him to interact with me, and nothing.

Sprawling chronicle incoming.

I’m hoping for a little advice on this one, or maybe just a reality check, if that’s what I need. You guys are likely going to rip into me for this one.

Some background, I (m23) was with my ex (f23, girl A) for 3.5 years. Things were fine at first, we were young, it was my first serious relationship, whoop di doo. I started to question whether this was right for me around, say, a year ago, maybe a bit longer (which didn’t stop me from moving in with her this February…), culminating in our breakup in early July. Things had been a little off for a few weeks prior, I confronted her about it, she tells me that she doesn’t want to keep dating but also “doesn’t want to lose me” &amp; so I assured her that she wouldn’t lose me because I genuinely valued her friendship &amp; our deep mutual understanding. We stop talking for a while. She finds a new best friend/girlfriend she spends most of her time with, two days after the breakup I’d found this girl (f21, girl B) on a dating app whom I did NOT expect to fall as hard for as I did. The feeling was clearly mutual, we talked for 8 hours straight after matching with one another, met up within 24, despite her living in a different city, 2 hours away. It was electric, and we essentially became inseparable and began talking all the time &amp; dating one another. Everything about her suited me perfectly, I thought. All of my reservations I’d had about my ex, this girl was the opposite, and more. It’s not even about comparison, either. I loved her exactly how she was, everything about her. She made me want to be a better person, I saw a future with her. We were already joking about marriage within a week or two. I was on cloud 9 over her, and she me. If things had gone to plan, I probably would have ended up with this girl. They did not.

Some time not too long thereafter my ex comes back into my life and basically wants to start a fwb sort of situation with me. We missed one another. Clearly I was not yet over her, on account of having a whopping 2 days to process things before I lost myself in the excitement of a new relationship, and so I’d suddenly found myself in a situation that I did not know how to navigate. I’d never cheated on anyone before, and I never will again. I will never enter another relationship before being 100% confident in my severance from the previous one. I should have been honest with girl B immediately and asked her if we could have just started as friends. If I’d done so, we’d probably be together now. Looking back, what I did was fucking horrible of me. I did just about the worst possible thing I could have done. I was so caught up in the whirlwind of it all. Instead of talking to anybody in my life about it to get some advice/have some sense slapped into me, I kept it all bottled up inside. Nobody, family, friends or otherwise, had any idea of what was going on (although my family may have suspected, what with my mysterious departures). Bipolar runs in my family, I have OCD but have not been diagnosed bipolar, yet my sister thinks I might have had my first manic episode during that period, in response to the breakup with girl A. I was wired. I had spun a web of lies, I should have come clean but instead I completely shut out any feelings of guilt or shame. It was like I turned off that part of my brain. My feelings for girl B were, and still are, completely true. I met her friends and family, we all loved eachother, she and I had made some unforgettable memories in the short span of two months. She tells me she’s never had another guy treat her this way, she’s never felt this way about anyone before, etc. all of it is mutual. She is perfect for me, it feels like I made her up. The two of us were madly in love with one another. Just because I was a liar didn’t mean my feelings for her weren’t true. I’ve dealt with issues with honesty in my previous relationship, too, although it was only ever white lies to prevent her from getting upset. I love girl B more than I’ve ever loved anything before. She truly believed we would end up together, and I wanted that too, except now I’d backslid and was too chicken to do anything about it. 

So 2 months into being with girl B and maybe a month into occasionally seeing girl A again, I get caught and girl B gets a nice long message from girl A about how I’ve been cheating. Everything implodes, girl A offers forgiveness while girl B is, rightly so, in shambles. Girl B has me come see her again maybe two weeks later. I give her full transparency on what happened, I’m extremely apologetic, she offers the ultimatum of never speaking to my ex again &amp; trying to make things work between us. I ask for some time to decide, she gives me two days, I freak out and eventually choose what I perceive as “neither”, because I didn’t want to completely lose either of them. I promised my ex I would stay friends with her, and felt a sense of obligation to her based on our past &amp; what ledges we’d talked one another off of, and of course I didn’t want to stop talking to girl B either. This decision, clearly, was perceived by girl B as me choosing girl A. Still, B was texting me on and off for the next few weeks, she was really sad &amp; just needed me to cut all contact &amp; she would have taken me back, up until about 2 weeks ago. She had even made me a sad &amp; sappy Spotify playlist pertaining to her feelings on the situation. I haven’t heard a peep from her since.

There’s about an hour break between lecture and lab, and recently we’ve been sitting and chatting for most of that time. She’s told me that she likes my outfits, and when I am late she says “aww we’ve missed you.” We get along pretty well. We even got accepted into the same program to start in the spring. 

I really want to ask her out, but the two times in the semester I casually asked to grab a coffee to go over material she said she was busy with work and family (which I think is true). What’s the best way to approach this? I don’t want to make things awkward for the next few semesters, but I feel like we have some real chemistry.

I will try to make this short! i gifted a girl i know from one of my family friend cousins a beautiful cat, i liked her the first time i saw her.

i talked to her on Instagram about the cat, and we had a pretty good chat, i guess! We laughed and everything was OK, i also followed her, but she didn't return follow back.

anyway, after a few days i met her by accident at a wedding, but she totally ignored me like we never met before! She only smiled at me, no thanks or anything, but that's normal.

so i went to her, and I'm not gonna lie to u guys it was a little bit awkward this time, i got very nervous around my family and didn't find a subject to talk to her about, so i started talking about how she is going with the cat.

She was just looking at her phone and answering me while I'm standing, it like she was in the middle of an important conversation or smthg or just doesn't care, so i just gently said take care and left.

The problem is i don't know what to do, i like this girl, but I'm not quite sure if she is shy or nervous around boys or just not interested, or I'm just bothering her.

i know what you're going to say is ""just ask her out"" well i can't do that, it because she is a very close friend of my (20F) cousin they talked about everything, they don't separate at all, always together.

i don't get a chance to speak to her alone, and even if i tried to ask her out on Instagram, she will definitely tell my (20F) cousin about the whole goddamn thing and my cousin will 100% tell her to dump me. why?

it cuz I'm not very good with my cousins or my family in general. It a whole another old story. Don't know what to do! I'm trying to think of a way to hang out with her without technically asking her out. so just to get a chance to know each other.

She is absolutely amazing, and I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her.

She and I live in southern Arizona.

Our political ideologies are the same (liberal). Over the last couple of years, she’s become more focused on politics (which is great; everyone should stay informed). She is getting more and more worried about the future of abortion rights in the US (I feel the same way), and while Arizona is blue/purple for the time being, we don’t know if this is for the long-term.

She mentioned that she doesn’t want to live in any Republican states. While I don’t agree with most of Republicans’ views, I wouldn’t say that I’m not “totally against” living in a Republican state, especially if there are blue districts, and they have good job markets/it’s affordable to live there — one of our biggest criticisms of where we live currently, is that it has a horrible job market. I’m not really able to work remotely, but she is, fortunately. We both work for the highest-paying employer in town; we’ve reached our wage ceiling here. I also hate my job currently lol.

Things went a bit far i was traveling to her country and she visited my country as we live in nearby countries, but most of the times, i paid for hotels, always bought her the presents, and always tried my best to be a nice guy and she was quite sticky and she enjoyed having sex with me. but after a few months she mentioned its FWB for her. but i don't know why i felt she loved me with her actions, stickiness and sharing each and everything and calling me almost everyday. i started to have intense feelings for her. we met continuously and have had a great time together. (only worst part was i was paying for everything)

after 3 months we went on a trip in her country to a different city where she told me F\*\*\*k you and acted rude on some of the things on which i got angry and she started to cry after i said i am going back, i convinced her and then we went to our countries. and since that day she started to treat me like trash, watching my messages and responding after 2-3 hours and upon asking she says i was busy with a friend or i was cooking bla bla but it was not the case before, after immense depression and thoughts i decided to ask her what she feels for me on a call where she said she doesn't know, and after i said how is it possible, she said you treat me like your girlfriend, after meeting you i got to know a men would do anything for a girl if he wants to do. you were very flexible, you are a nice person. but i don't feel the same as you do, and i don't want to give any hope.

I guess being too nice was the problem, i was checking her insta and fb all the time, if she is online and if she is not i was thinking what is she doing :( i know we had no commitment but still she was more like a girlfriend for me as she did so much but i guess i was stupid. but i really liked her.

I don't know why i still feel for her and want to seek her attention, while i am not talking to her much as i feel i am bothering her as she does not text me or ask me to call or anything like before. so i am waiting for her to text me. before i respond or just stay busy or talk less or i don't what i should do. i am not a pro in dating nor i am playing any games but i don't know how can i handle this.

She’s the only person I’ve actively dated in this time. I’m worried that I’m in a codependent/trauma bond relationship after conversations with my therapist and opening up to a close friend.

We initially dated about 3 years ago for ~9 months or so. At the time, she was severely struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm, and was unwilling/unable to get professional help. It reached a point where I was feeling more like a therapist than a partner, and I ended up breaking things off abruptly. She then attempted suicide by overdose (which at the time was something she did on a smaller scale “to be numb” and I was aware of the warning signs of it in her texts), so I found her and stayed with her until she was of sound mind again. I then ended up contacting a family member of her’s who intervened and then was able to get her to go to a hospital. 

We’ve never really had the chance to take time away from each other, especially since I visited her in the hospital and stayed close after she got out. She had come to me at one point to say we should, and we didn’t speak for maybe a week or so, but this was right at the start of the pandemic which of course, we were unaware of at the time. She started texting me again since she doesn’t have a very strong group of friends, and we’ve maintained close contact since then. Once we were back in proximity to one another, we began hanging out again, and sort of entered a phase where we were basically dating again, but I was hesitant to put a label on it. This phase ended because I didn’t feel like I was ready for how things were moving, but we then officially got together again a few months after that.

I’ve been noticing a lot of the same patterns as before in the last few months, and I’ve been getting very concerned. I’ve spent multiple nights with her in the last few months where she’s talked to me about wanting to end her life and I’ve had to talk her out of it or keep pills/other dangerous objects away from her. As far as I know she has not opened up to anyone else about this including her family or roommates and she cannot afford professional help. She also gets mean when she’s feeling suicidal, often telling me that she’s frustrated that I’m not saying the right things, and saying I should leave her for someone happier. She also will often give me the silent treatment, either refusing to talk to me until I figure out what’s wrong or leaving and not telling me where she’s going if I step away to use the restroom or something like that. 

And even when she isn’t suicidal, there are other issues. There have been some physical intimacy issues that we’ve talked through. She often promises sex and then doesn’t deliver, and she also had expressed at a party that she misses being physical with women, which the combination of the two things had me feeling very inadequate. She expressed that I’m not, but that she’s often too tired/depressed at the end of the day to follow through with sex. I also feel like she expects me to read her mind with what she wants sometimes, and she’ll get mad at me if I don’t say/do the right things rather than communicate her needs calmly first. I’m just worried that she’s become to dependent on me as emotional support, since I’m the only one she talks to about her issues, whether it be suicidal ideation or anything else. My therapist has expressed that you can’t truly love someone if a relationship has fear driving it in some way, and I’m scared to accept that fact. The friend I opened up to introduced the term trauma bond to me, and expressed they were worried that’s what I’m going through because I’m often doing a lot to take care of my girlfriend, and not really getting an equal amount in return. 

I really want things to be better, but I’m starting to feel like I’m in a cycle that, no matter how much I want it to end happily, won’t actually end until I leave the relationship behind. It’s hard to feel like I can’t talk about my own issues with my partner because it will be too much for her to handle. I want to bring my relationship concerns up to her, but I’m worried it won’t go over well and she’ll get mad or give me the silent treatment again. I just feel bad because I know she really loves me, she makes that very clear to me. And I love her too. If I felt unloved it would be much easier for me to just express my concerns or leave, but I know how much she cares for me and I don’t want to mess things up. I just feel at a loss on how to have such a tough conversation with her. She’s either not in a mental state where it seems good to bring up, or if things are good, I don’t want to mess it up with a conversation like this because the purely happy days are something I really cherish. I would really appreciate any advice on how to go about bringing my concerns up to her, or any other things I should do.

TLDR; Been in an on and off relationship with my current partner for the last 3 years, and am noticing a pattern of codependency/trauma bonding.

I'd get married at an Applebee's, genuinely, I love Applebee's. I do think nice weddings are cool, but it's just not a big thing for me. It's a big thing for her though, and I'm ok with that and want to make her dream come true.

My fiance is all about the idea of ""first looks"" (a photo of someone's first time seeing the bride, usually somewhere around the venue), she wants one with me, her dad, her bridesmaids and even my groomsmen (????). Personally, I think the only first look that matters in a wedding is when the two first see each other at the aisle, but again I want to make her happy.

My issue arises with the fact that it feels like she really wants me to cry when I see her.. (she's said it jokingly, but from other context I know she's definitely not). I don't ever cry, and I get really annoyed when I feel like I'm being forced to do something overly theatrical (mommy issues), but I want to make this thing happen for her. I just know I won't look anywhere near as happy as these guys in the videos she watches, specifically because I'm supposed to look as happy as them.

If it were the more traditional, I see her for the first time walking down the aisle, I probably would look as happy as she wants me to.

I'd also like to state that she is the opposite of a ""Bridezilla"" and if I told her all of this she would immediately cancel any plans she had for ""first looks"", but I want to do this thing for her because she's all about it.

I can tell there are a lot of lies in what he tells me and that he manipulates stuff to make me jealous/attached. 
Some examples include that he likes to drive me crazy making me think that he cheated on me (fake chats, calls, etc.). Also, a lot of what he says is inconsistent and I started realizing that now. In addition, he does very weird stuff. So, say we are talking and he gets mad at me, what he does is he starts going through his phone and looking at hookup pictures claiming that he does this ""to feel better""! and then when I tell him ""you got mad because I am talking to you about these stuff and went to feel better through doing them again"" he says i love to make him feel small. 
He once said he has not hooked up since 7 years (that was before the last 2 people he dated) and then goes to show me pictures that look fairly recent. When I confront him about it and he gets stuck he says this was a test of my trust and that I will always find something to doubt about him. 
Moreover, he knows that latelty I have been paranoid about HIV/STDs and he keeps doing things to mess with me. For instance, last weekend I was having a horrible episode of stress about him having something because he keeps bragging about how much he hooked up in the past and I didn't want to sleep with him before he gets tested, which he tried to avoid saying he didn't want to feed into my brain's thoughts (he then did an anonymous test which he recorded on his phone and turned out negative) (from my side I tested negative and he is my first and only partner) I was up most of the night afraid that he'll do something to me. Next day he starts telling me that we had sex (and gets so descriptive about what we've done) but I had no memory of that. Not a single one. I still don't to this day. And this is not the first time he says something I don't recall happening.
To be honest I don't even feel like sleeping with him anymore. And to him sex is very important in a relationship. I am afraid of being lonely if I talk to him about all this. (I am an international student alone in Canada).

I’ve (24F) been with my boyfriend (25M) for 6 years. When we first started dating it was wonderful, the first few years were honestly blissful. He makes me feel so loved. 

Within the last year and a half a lot of things have changed. It is mainly due to him being poly and wanting an open relationship. 

December 2021: boyfriend told me that he has crushes on other people, and that he identifies as being poly. He had just discovered this about himself, I am also his first and only relationship. 

April 2022: Boyfriend mentions that he’s had a crush on one of my friend for a while. He said that he kept spiraling into a dark place when imagining a poly relationship with the 3 of us, and wanting to get to know her better. It was unbelievably hard to hear but he kept saying that he wants to be with me more than anything, he just can’t help the thoughts and “delusions” he sometimes has. 

June 2022: I was away on a month vacation and the time apart helped quite a bit, we were even talking about getting engaged soon. 

Now (Nov. 2022): On Saturday we designed for and paid for an engagement ring. Saturday night he surprised me with getting a Stitch Squishmallow off of marketplace and we were going to pick it up…on the way home I mentioned something about my friend and her bf (the one he was crushing on). I immediately could tell that he was jealous. 

On Sunday he seemed to pull away and was asking for space. This made me extremely anxious and worried. On Wednesday morning I confronted him and asked if he still had a crush on my friend, he screamed no and blew up in my face. 

When we spoke on Thursday night he confirmed that he still has a crush on her, and that he has never gotten over any of the crushes that he has. He tells me that sometimes he wakes up to “different realities” (ex: me being ok to an open relationship). He says that when this happens he gets in his head about wanting to get to know and date other people, which causes him to get to a dark place - when he gets like this he said he resents me. 

He also said that he needs space to get out of the “funk” because at the end of the day he wants to be with me more than anything and have a future with me. Apparently I make it hard on him when I don’t give him his space to sort out his own thoughts. He said he loves me and wants a future with me, and that’s why he bought me a ring and got ready for marriage. But I’m still confused. 


This morning we had another talk where he mentioned that he thought that an open relationship would help him with his thoughts and getting into that dark place. But he also said that it is something he doesn’t expect me to be ok with and that it’s okay he just doesn’t want to lose me, but it kills me because I feel like this is going to continue to be an issue and that he won’t be happy or at peace if he stays with me. But I can’t get over the thought of losing him and a future without him.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7581229,public,self,Are we trying too hard to make it work?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yymh10/are_we_trying_too_hard_to_make_it_work/,all_ads,6,,,,

I wanna state that I am bad at English, sorry if it's terrible.
I sometimes go all over the place also, so I'll try my best to go in order. 

My boyfriend (M/21/BF) and I (Non-Binary/21) have been dating for 2 years and a month. Despite how many times we talk about this, I still hold on to this topic and think about it a lot. 

Back in October, a few days before our planned 2 year Annivarsay date. He told me an issue that has happened at his college club. A rumor was spreading around that him and a girl (G) were dating. Despite how many times he has told the club that he was already taken. 

You might be wondering when these two met. Both G and my BF met back in early 2022 when G first joined the club. They became close friends and soon my BF developed feelings for her while he was dating me. He told me that he has beaten himself up for 2 days about it.
They continued being close friends despite all of that and never told me until Oct of 2022. 

During the night while he was telling me about all of this, he has told me that the rumor started when college began, so beginning of September of 2022. 
He wanted to know how I felt about all of it, and I initally told him at first that I was glad that he told me. And just told BF that him and G just gotta ""pretend"" to be friends. BF told me that they were already doing that and I said ok. I did threten a bit and said that I'd storm into his club to find out who is spreading rumors because its very childish of them to be acting that way. 

Over time after that talk, I just fell out of Earth and in-touch. I kept lingering onto the thoughts and became very unhappy. 
Very unhappy that I cried very badly. An example was a night when I talked with our roommate about stuff and pretended I was okay to not scare anyone. BF came home to grab something real quick and told me that he'll be back right after club practice. He never came home at the time he said he would and texted an hour later saying he'll be home late, I said, ""Oh.. I was waiting for you"" and he replied an hour later again and my responses show that I wasnt too happy. BF came back until 2:30am. I wasnt in the room, I was in our basement closet, hiding and crying. 
BF did make it up by spending an entire day with me, but it was a already planned thing before the incident. But hey, the thought counts. 

I talked it out with a neutral friend (F) that knows us both about how I was feeling. F gave me the advice to talk it out with BF. I more so put it on a google doc on everything how I felt about this situation. 1) Just to not be friends in G in general and 2) I was extremely lonley since we barely do anything together other then sleep in the same room. 
BF understood but tried to reasure me that him and G are not friends anymore. And I asked him polietly to block her on all socials in front of me. And he did, other then facebook since he needs it for club usage. 

A few weeks passby again and I became upset thinking about the same 'ol problem again and again, crying quietly at night again. 
It became a bother when we were talking with our roommate about stuff, and BF always mentions about G. It kept bothering me and kept eating me up inside and I just didnt want to talk about it to him. 

I felt like I am not good enough for him everytime he mentions or talks about her. It made me feel that he was still interacting with her when he promised that they arent friends. But I constantly feel useless.

I also just continue to pretend that I am okay around him, despite how many times I let him know that I'm sad. I pretend that food makes me happy, but it really dosent.

While when we met she was kind of attracted to me or probably she wanted sex i didn't know, but i liked her and and she was continuously trying to get me to kiss or hug her(atleast i felt) i did kiss and we agreed to book a nearby hotel i paid.

Things went a bit far i was traveling to her country and she visited my country as we live in nearby countries, but most of the times, i paid for hotels, always bought her the presents, and always tried my best to be a nice guy and she was quite sticky and she enjoyed having sex with me. but after a few months she mentioned its FWB for her. but i don't know why i felt she loved me with her actions, stickiness and sharing each and everything and calling me almost everyday. i started to have intense feelings for her.

after 3 months we went on a trip in her country to a different city where she told me F\*\*\*k you and acted rude on some of the things on which i got angry and she started to cry after i said i am going back, i convinced her and then we went to our countries. and since that day she started to treat me like trash, watching my messages and responding after 2-3 hours and upon asking she says i was busy with a friend or i was cooking bla bla but it was not the case before, after immense depression and thoughts i decided to ask her what she feels for me on a call where she said she doesn't know, and after i said how is it possible, she said you treat me like your girlfriend, after meeting you i got to know a men would do anything for a girl if he wants to do. you were very flexible, you are a nice person.

I guess being too nice was the problem, i was checking her insta and fb all the time, if she is online and if she is not i was thinking what is she doing :( i know we had no commitment but still she was more like a girlfriend for me as she did so much but i guess i was stupid

I don't know why i still feel for her and want to seek her attention, while i am not talking to her and waiting for her message so i will talk or else i won't, 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: she just texted me now after 3 days asking how i am, and i haven't responded her, before i was responding her no matter if i am free or busy like in 5-10 mins, or what i should?

We've been together for 4 years and have been living together for the last 2.5 years. 

I am technically the first person he has lived with other than his mother. He had roommates briefly, but he was never really there so I'd say living with me is the first time he has moved away from home.

I feel it's also important to note that his parents divorced when he was very young and he lived with just his mom. He is an only child and I don't think his mother really made him do chores growing up.

He is very kind, caring and gentle. He shows that he appreciates me cooking and cleaning everyday. So he is grateful and appreciative to all the work I do around the house. 

HOWEVER, we are adults. We are both 26 years old. It's been 2 years. I have mentioned to him before that I'd appreciate some help around the house. He has a very mentally draining job so I understand that when he gets home he wants to relax... But guess what? SO DO I lol I've asked if on days off he could help by doing dishes, sweeping the floors or doing the laundry. Bc currently I do all of this daily, along with regular cleaning and cooking of our meals. 

I don't mind doing things for him. I like cooking. I like cleaning. I like looking after him and our pets bc for me this is how I show my love. However, idk if he's gotten so used to me doing everything for him that he just thinks this is life now and doesn't think he has to help out?

I want for us to be equals. For him to have more energy and motivation to help me. 

I love him. But I want him to be an adult and do chores. He complains I ""tell him what to do"" but I just try and suggest things he can do on days off while I'm at work. 

Any suggestions? How do I encourage him to be more helpful around the house without sounding naggy and annoying?
