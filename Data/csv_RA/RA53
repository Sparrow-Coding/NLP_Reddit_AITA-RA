I’m in a bit of a situation and would appreciate some feedback. Thank you for reading. 

I met my current gf at a rough time in both our lives. I had been in an abusive relationship  and she was also dealing with the fallout of separating from her spouse. We live in different countries and I finally got the opportunity to fly out and see her for a couple months. 

Her kids live with their father in another country and her children were supposed to come the day after I left. We agreed on this to avoid any discomfort for her kids. Today, her ex called and said they had to come next week! I’m supposed to be staying for another month, so this is not ideal. Unfortunately, her ex said if it wasn’t now. They wouldn’t be able to come until their next school break, which, I’m not well versed on the school schedule of their country, but it would be a few months down the line. 

I told my gf, if that’s the way it had to be, then, of course, I wouldn’t mind them coming, but to make sure she talked about it with her kids first. She just got finished talking to them. She has 3 kids. 18, 14, and 9. Her oldest was not very happy about it. I think he’s at the age where it’s still hard to see his parents as not together and his mom with someone else. The 14 year old, well, didn’t say much of anything and I don’t think the 9 year old really understood what was going on. They said they would talk with their father about it, but he was already not happy about her being in a relationship (He’s repeatedly tried to get back with her and calls and texts her almost stalker like) So, idk how that conversation will go. 

Obviously, my gf is a wreck. I offered to leave early so she could be with her kids, but she doesn’t want me to leave. She also desperately wants her kids to come, so she’s caught between two worlds. Obviously, her kids come first and I understand that. I would never stand in the way of her getting to spend time with her children. It’s obviously not what I want though. 

Her younger kids obviously look to the oldest for what to do. I’m confident if I was able to get the chance to meet him we would get along. We like much of the same stuff,anime, video games, etc. (I know, I’m a nerd haha) I want to talk to him and introduce myself and explain everything. What his mom has been going through and ease fears over living with a stranger for a month. I don’t want to come off as creepy or crazy though and msg him randomly since I’ve never met him, but I would feel terrible if I didn’t do everything I could to make everyone happy. 

I know that ultimately it’s her kid’s decision and there’s not much I can do. It’s between her ex, her kids and her. I just feel terrible that I’m the reason all of this is difficult. I love her very much and would love to meet her kids, but I won’t be the reason she can’t see them. 

I didn’t know if anyone had any advice or had faced a similar situation?

Note: They both have lawyers and are negotiating custody. My gf went through a bad bout of depression and it was decided they would live with their dad for the time being.

For some background information, I had extreme social anxiety as a teenager and it really affected me, I have no one in my life (I have no parents, no friends/colleagues or anything) except my best friend. We bonded through our similar traumas and have been inseparable ever since, he helped me through my depression and some of the hard times in my life and he makes my life worth living. 
The only problem is that he confessed his love to me after 3 months of our friendship, I told him I wasn't interested and started to avoid him but we soon realized that we both needed each other and we forgot about this ""incident"".
The problem is that after 1 and a half years he did the same thing two weeks ago and I had to say no to him once again, the only problem is that he starts acting weird with me and it makes me very uncomfortable: he always touches me (he teases me, he grabs my ankle when we are lying somewhere, etc...) or makes weird comments about the fact that we are in a couple. Now he is starting to look my chest when he think I am not seeing and it make me really really uncomfortable. 
I don't know if I'm overreacting or not, I don't know if I should make up a fake boyfriend so he'll stop being weird or if I should just cut off contact with him. 
I'm hesitant to do that because my sanity depends mostly on him and I can't afford to lose him completely.... Do you think It’s possible to be REALLY friends with him or should I just give up?

I knew her (F, 17) for ages, but the talkative phase began like a year ago, I suppose.

Now, like a week ago, she told me that she has dyscalculia.
I asked her about the consequences she had to face with this problem and if there are any ways to compensate the bad math grades with a special class exam or a mark in her school report so she can still apply to the most jobs without them thinking she was just lazy or dumb for maths.

I sent consoling messages as she clearly didn't sound happy about the situation and she sounded thankful to get my messages. The rest of the week went rather calm, I asked her about her day, asked her about any advancements with solving the dyscalculia problem, and told her some stuff about my life.

After a break of two days, exactly yesterday, I started as always but after a short talk, I asked her if she has a boyfriend. After she denied it, I asked her if she wants to have one (Might not have been the best way to ask her this question🫣).

She answered really nice (which I was glad for, as this was my first time asking someone), but she said that someone else really hurt her and it's only a week ago, so she needs time to recover from that. I totally understood and after the normal talk we usually did, we stopped the chatting.

Today, I was quite happy about how the chat went and I thought if I still care for her and hold up the talk, she might understand that I want be there for her or just want to brighten up her day as I do with my friends and family. But this afternoon, a good friend of mine (Who I would 100% trust) told me, that she might not like me as I like her (explanation: He overheard a talk between her and her friend about me)


I am partly happy that I know what is happening right now, but partly sad that it had to go this way. The only thing that confuses me and makes me really sad is why she didn't directly tell me how she feels. And: Was her apology, where she stated that some other guy hurt her really much (mentally, I think) a comfort lie? If so, why does the name of someone (I don't really know) in my biology class often come up in connection with ""the other guy""?

Another point: What do you think should I do now? My friend told me to continue the conversation as long as she doesn't reject me, but I think if she doesn't want to, then I won't force anything.

Little bonus: My imagination of a friendship, especially in the beginnings, would not really include the hugs and kisses stuff but only a warm base for conversations and the willingness to listen to each others problems etc.
Is this an odd imagination? I often meet these people who directly think about the love when they hear friendship.

I come from a broken home, I dealt with terrible anxiety all of my life and my parents never helped me get my license, and I had severe health issues my parents didn’t take seriously. When we started dating he helped try to get to the bottom of my health problems, about after a year of dating I ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks and my mom and dad visited once whereas he visited everyday, he was my support. 


I should mention he has a very good paying job and has been able to support the both of us and we have 3 cats no kids, I’ve been in remission for 7 years as well, for the past 8 years I’ve cooked, cleaned, did his laundry etc and when covid hit he just changed, he started drinking so much, coming home calling me lazy and useless, saying he regrets being with me etc, I would lock myself in a separate room and he’d be screaming at me and then the next day he would act like like nothing happened. We almost broke up but he insisted it was because of his drinking and he eventually stopped drinking so heavily. But the attitude and insults would still come up every once and awhile but no yelling so o thought okay maybe he’s not drinking anymore.


Well then the screaming about how I’m lazy and when I bring up I do the household duties and cook food he comes back with Well I should be thanking him for buying the food (which I do, and put them away) 


About a month ago I suspected he had a hidden booze stash and was possibly drinking behind my back again and I did find some vodka.

What’s made me want to write this is last night my boyfriend was looking for something to eat and was miserable and said “there’s no snacky foods” and I asked “why didn’t you get more snacks?” And he said food was my job and I said “I made chili and garlic bread yesterday, that’s food I made you expect me make snacks from scratch like your personal chef?” And he yelled “YOU’RE WELCOME FOR THE FOOD” he’s been working lots of overtime lately and I’ve been trying to make extra sure things are taken care of for him during this time, trying to be supportive and I feel as if Me and what I do mean very little but part of me feels like I deserve this for not getting help with my anxiety sooner but dealing with that and learning to live with crohns was one of the hardest things I’ve had to go through",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7567628,public,self,Verbal abuse or do I deserve this?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yxa4ed/verbal_abuse_or_do_i_deserve_this/,all_ads,6,,

My partner of 2 years and I have been in LDR for quite some time now. Most of the time our communication, both when we are close and apart, is fine, however, I keep noticing that my partner has a very poor ability to communicate negative feelings. A typical case is when we have a good chat for a few days, and then all of a sudden (it especially sucks when I need him the most to support me) he stops being caring and attentive - his answers are yes/no, and when I try to tell him that I feel bad because of some events in my life, he tells me that no it's OK, and why do you find a thing to worry about every week?

Today was one of these days - I had rough two weeks, today was the last bit I just needed to cry while cycling back home from uni (I am a phd student there), and I was absolutely hoping to talk with my sweetheart today over phone, shortly tell a bit the things that made me sad, but also share a laugh, a good story, and have a good conversation overall. And when he calls me he is... only capable of saying 'well, that happens', 'yes/no' and sound like having a complete disinterest in my life. Then it turns out that I dare to feel sad at least every week (what a sin, indeed!) and that I should just chill. We haven't seen each other in 3 weeks, and were supposed to find tickets to see each other soon, but he quickly got tired and said that he could wait cos he is not that missing me yet. And only then it turns out that he's been not sleeping well, having constant headaches and so on, and the only reason he called was because I asked him to, Now, I would have been more understanding if he would just said so in beforehand! Instead, I now kinda understand him still - but also cry my eyes out, because today was really shitty and the closest person in the world just acted so arrogant and careless that I am hurting AF.

We are very effective communicators and talk about this thoroughly quite often, and usually resolve specific issues through talking about it. He is the most emotionally mature man i have ever known. 

We often have different ideas about initiation, he can sometimes be pushy and I am likely to be reserved in physical contact as I feel it will always lead to sex. 

Recently, I've become unwell due to long covid. I don't have energy for sex and find it difficult to feel sexual while I am so unwell. He has hurt my feelings by asking me for sex while I am visibly unwell, asking me to initiate when I'm fighting sleep. I have a hard time setting boundaries but this time I felt I needed to, so I had a long discussion with him about this and asked if, for the time being, he could let me initiate sex when I feel up to it. After a while he confessed he'd been hiding how much sex impacts his insecurity and that he has an unhealthy relationship with sex. His anxiety is high and his m*sturbation is at an all time high (at least three times a day) because his sex life is ""irregular"" and his sexual needs are not being met. So, because I'm not having sex with him very often, his insecurity is rising. He is very apologetic and largely sensitive about this.

I can't help but feel responsible, but at the same time recognise I can't fix this on my own. He agrees that he should seek therapy. I just feel that I am hindering him in this and at the same time it is damaging my view of sex and contributing to previous poor experiences of sex. Not to mention the impact on our relationship as a whole, and the fact I am really poorly at the moment.

He then began speaking about another girl and kept mentioning her several times in a way that I have made clear to him is very triggering for me.

I stayed calm and he started making vague suggestions in a way that felt really negative, I didn't feel like he actually wanted me at all. I straight up asked him if he was even interested in me at all as he kept speaking about someone else all night.

I tried to say that I didn't really appreciate him speaking about another girl constantly all evening and then making half assed attempts to intimacy (which to be honest made me feel quite bad about myself). He kept ignoring my feelings and started throwing himself a pity party.

Then he began saying I should find out what the other girls did for him that made him want them and then maybe I'd have a shot too. I asked if he was being serious and he then went on to say that ""he shouldn't have forgiven me"". (I'm assuming he means forgiving me for last weekend seeing a picture of a child I used to babysit almost 4 years ago and somehow convincing himself that he also saw pictures taken in a hotel the same day and because I did not remember that day 4 years ago when questioned, I must have been lying and sleeping with the child's father in the hotel. Where we would have put the 6 year old during that alleged encounter I have no idea. I also only saw the mother that day and have a full message and picture history from that day to support that).

I asked him to leave if he was going to keep triggering me so I could sleep (secretly hoping he would apologise and comfort me instead and make me feel important, stupid of me I know).

He then got up to leave and I begged for him to not go and tried to tell him how much he hurt my feelings to resolve it and move on (all I wanted is to hear the words ""I shouldn't have  said that"") but he kept saying I'm annoying him and after some pushing and shoving from both of us, he left.

I feel like I'm going crazy. I know I shouldn't have told him to leave when I didn't want him to and then tried to prevent him from leaving, but he triggers me so much I end up not even recognising myself. I'm tired of telling him something is upsetting me and to please not do it only for him to keep doing it in what I feel like is a purposeful way.

5 months ago I discovered that my (37) partner (36) of 13 years (married 8, no kids) was sexting with a long time friend of mine. It turns out my partner sent a photo that I took of them (totally sfw) to this person and they responded that they got off to it. Normally, that would disgust most people of it was unwanted, but it seems this was a pretty normal interaction for them.

After freaking out and snooping I found there were lots of similar interactions. During the 4 weeks before I confronted my partner, they deleted several more conversations (text logs).

The confrontation went as expected: they cried, lied, but generally admitted it had been going on for years. To this day, I'm not 100% sure it never got physical or if nudes were shared.

After being in denial for almost 2 months, we had another conversation where I learned the flirting started about 6 years ago and then the sexual content began. It seems my partner would pleasure themselves during these conversations while I was enjoying my hobbies in the next room. This is when I snapped awake and said we each need our own therapists (me for the betrayal and them for choosing this behavior).

The last two months have been very strained between us because I'm really not sure I want to go through couples counseling. That would mean forgiveness and accepting they made a decision so selfish that my feelings didn't really matter to them. Respect? Boundaries? Like, who does this to their spouse?

I guess I'm just looking for a general sense of validation that this is serious enough to walk away. I'm probably scared to be single again, give up my home, etc. But on the other hand, I really don't know if I can move forward and let this go.

We've been having trouble recently with coworkers being inappropriate with us female employees at our job. To solve this, we've been meeting and chatting in a semiprofessional manner on how to stand up for ourselves in the workplace.

We met recently and some group members shared personal stories about some really serious things that had happened to them. One friend in particular shared her story about her assault by a male coworker and was very emotional. When we left the meeting, we all agreed that like our previous meetings that stories would not be shared outside of the group. Anonymity was a vital part of the group, and it wouldn't be fair to share someone's story without their consent.

Yesterday we received a message from our friend that she had been contacted (I'm assuming by our school's conduct and safety board) that someone had reported the story of her assault to them. It was likely done by a well-meaning individual worried about danger in our workplace, but still. It wasn't their place to share their story.

I have a sinking feeling that everyone is going to think it was me who reported it. For context, I am a student supervisor for our department so some of my friends technically work for me. While all of my other friends are loud, exuberant, and excited, I am pretty quiet/serious and focus on my work. I have never been unkind to any of my friends, in fact I go out of my way to do what I can to make their days better. For once in my life it is working and I have friends who genuinely want to hang out with me.

The problem is, I'm the odd one out. I get overstimulated so I don't go to many parties. I don't show a lot of emotion. I am the only one in our office who doesn't get loud or overly excited. I am very different from my coworkers. Usually not a big deal, but this might be an issue now.

Right after my friend posted her heartbreaking message in our group chat, I DM'd her to say I was so sorry. That I would be there for her and that I couldn't imagine why anyone would do that. I've been left on read for a few hours.

Not a big deal, but I'm terrified that everyone thinks it's me. Deep down I have my ideas of who it was, but it doesn't help to speculate and pointing fingers would make me seem more suspicious.

The reason I think everyone secretly thinks it was me is because I've always been treated differently in our office. Like I said, I'm clearly the odd one out, and only in the past year or so have people stopped treating me like I'm an alien. I'm scared that I'm about to be without friends again just because someone was unkind to my friend. Plus, our female empowerment group is ruined, so if anyone has any ideas about how to fix the lack of anonymity in our anonymous group I'd be grateful.

2 days ago I hooked up with this chick, freaking hot as, at first I thought it was some fake profile trying to scam me until we met up. She gave me her addy, I drove and met her outside and was surprised it was her.

She said she had broken up with her bf 2 months ago and hadn’t been with anyone since.

Anyway I drove to her house, met her outside, she led me inside, locked the main door (this is her parents house and parents were out) and led me up the stairs to her room, we start making out and had great s*x and after we finished just sat and spoke for maybe 5 mins, I asked whether she wanted to have another round and she said her parents might be coming so I said ok I’ll leave then just to be safe.

I get home and text her “That was fun. Wish I could have had a few more sessions with you to really let it flow more”

She says something along the lines of yes it was fun, but I just realised I’m still not over my ex blah blah blah.

The next morning she’s blocked me on Insta, I tried to message her on WhatsApp but messages didn’t go through, guessing blocked there as well, then a day later she removes all of her messages from WhatsApp!

Now I’m freaking out because I don’t know what this means, am I to concerned about her behaviour or what she’s upto, what do you think?

I haven’t deleted our texts on WhatsApp, just incase I need it. But all her messages have been removed!

I have known this guy for a while now. We have met on valentines day this year and a few weeks later he asked me out. I had a great time. But since he is in the military I was afraid so I said I just wanted to be friends. He continued reaching out to me and we have been talking now since the end of may. We were hooking up (beeing fwb for a while but never said that we were in that kind of relationship). I left him a seen because i got angry and he continued sending me a lot of snaps. Our comunication was based on snaps alone for two minths (we have that pink heart now). We would organize our meet ups over snap and then we would hook up. And after a while we would start talking more, usually about deep subjects, like people we lost, what out goals were in life and things we love and love to do. Sometimes we would listen to music for hours and he would sing to me and make me laugh. One time I started laughing so hard and he just stopped and looked at me weardy. When I asked him why is he looking at me like that, he just said you laughed like someone that is not here anymore. And after some time we started chatting od whats app again. We talk everyday and he replys soon, the longest it takes him is an hour to reply. And we startes seeing each other more and would rarely hook up, but go out talk and listen to our favourite music. Once he pulled me close to him, put an arm around me and sang all od the songs he knew I loved and would play knew ones that he loved to make me learn them. We watch our facourite tv show together in his car. He comes to the coffee shop I work at every day with his friend righr after my shift and I make them coffee and he said that it is the best coffee he has ever had. He usually says that my coworkers do not know how to make a coffee. And when he commes he always invites me to sit with them. He always leaves a spot next to him for me, and he hugs me all the time, touches my hand pretty often, massages my upper arm, his hugs are pretty long, and he puts his hand on my knee. When I listen to his friend talk I catch him looking at me, and while I am working I also catch him looking at me or feel his eyes on me. He came once alone and talked to me. When we go out he always wears the t-shirts that I hate and says things that irritate me. At one time he said you are cute when you get angry like that. He teases me constantly. We share fawourite food, music and tv shows. Once while we were in his car he said out of the blue I am tired and feel asleep in my lap and hugged my legs. When his back started hurting he got up but still kept his hand on me. And while we walk with his friend he always stands next to me, 70-80% of the time our shoulders touch. And if his friend is walking next to me he will somehow find a way to get his spot next to me back. And we are always a few feet behind his buddy. He got out his phone many times and started talking pictures of us. And he calls me on video chat qute often just to sing to me and we chat for hours. He also invited himself to my house when he heard I was making chicken nuggets and crapes. He said he had never had better crapes and always sais when he comes back I will make them again. When I talk about opening my own bar he said he would be a regular there. But he is in the military and went there a few days ago. I told him I like him. He said he does not have time for a relationahip right know because he is focused on the military and does not want to loose a friend. Before I said how i feel about him he said that he never thought that he would meet a girl like me to whom he can to about everything, and he knows I will always be here and give him an honest advice.

We instantly clicked and were dating within two months. We had a great relationship we were very close, always spending at least a day outside of school with each other each week, and spending the days at school with each other and our friends as it was a small private school in England. Over the next year and a half we rarely fought, never actually raising our voices at each other in the relationship. 

However, we got to the end of the senior year and would be spending the summer apart so we decided to breakup, we had considered for a few months staying together, but ultimately decided it would be best to seperate. 

Over the summer we had many instances of having issues moving on, and we realised we set up the breakup wrong and had a few talks to help transition into a friendship, this is where I screwed up. I said that I wanted to know if she was getting with anyone new over the summer, and also told her at one point that I thought if she did get with someone else within like a month of us breaking up it would be disrespectful. I know that was stupid and not right but I was in a bad place. Summer went on and she was a bit annoyed with me for that second bit, rightly so. 

She never did do anything in the summer with someone else and neither did I, and before going to school I asked her to get back together with me. She seemed willing, but was questioning me if I was certain that’s why I wanted or if I just was afraid of losing her. I wasn’t sure, because I hadn’t tried anything with anyone else and told her that, we decided to give the decision a few days. I had a lot of outside influences telling me not to over those next few days, mainly my dad telling me not to and that’d I’d miss out on the college experience. So in the end we decided to stay friends but potentially reopen that discussion later.

I visited her some two weeks later as we had been planning for a month, and we pretty much fell back into our couple pattern, being together in the same way we had before. However, she was also confused because we had said only two weeks prior to be friends yet here we were like that. There were times where she seemed to switch mode, and I was later told by her it was because she was just not sure if it was right what we were doing. There were also some times where she would say to me that she wanted to talk abt the state of our relationship, which led to her just asking what I wanted and not actually saying what she wanted. So we never really got anywhere with that convo because I would say “idk where I’m at maybe let me get to college and settle first and then we can revisit this as u have already done so”. The trip ended with both of us happy it happened and I immediately moved out to my own college and got accustomed to life there. 

Over the first month of college we had a bit of a tumultuous time, as we both were adjusting to college life. We had several talks where in later ones I pretty much lied about my feelings and said I had moved on and had done so since she hasn’t immediately wanted to get back together when I asked and that had hurt me. She said she was also moved on, and over the next 3/4 of a month we talked less and less. 

Over that almost month I started missing her again as it was the first time she didn’t feel present in my life in almost two years. I recently called her to tell her this partly and also apologise for a lot of what I had said and done in the summer, and she seemed very receptive and glad I was apologising. I also told her “I didn’t know where my head was at right now when it comes to us and that I’m not saying we should get back together but I just wanted to let her know that I wasn’t entirely over her like I had said in previous talks”. She said that she will always care about me but she doesn’t know if forcing a long distance relationship is the best thing right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I (18M) have been dating my girlfriend (18F) for almost 6 months now. Simply put, we are both young and have a lot on our plates due to our age and trying to figure out our futures. 

Before we started dating, we were working together and we were both set up by her best friend and started talking for a good 5 months. **I found it pretty hard to talk to her**. I am nervous around pretty girls by nature, but she just never really initiated conversation. 

Eventually we hooked up and started ""talking"". **I was weary about dating in general** because of the situation we were in. I didn't want to be tied down when trying to figure out college/career things. But my emotions got the best of me and I ended up asking her to date me, and she said yes. 

For the first couple months, things were just fine and we got along well. But eventually we would start to have arguments about little things. Of course she didn't think they were little, but I couldn't seem to understand how she could be upset about these things. 

One example of this is when we would shop together, if I looked or even glanced at a model on the wall, she would get extremely jealous. One time specifically, she wanted to buy lingerie, so she brought me over to the lingerie section and asked for a suggestion. As soon as I started looking, she got upset and stormed out of the store because the **Lingerie had models on them**. I could not understand how she could put me in that situation and then be mad at me. 

She will also get upset if I don't hang with her every day when I don't have anything to do. But I personally need a lot of alone time. She would take this as me hating her and not wanting to be with her. 

I have tried to stress the importance of communication, but the only times she will try to talk to me is when she is leaving my house late at night when I have work early in the morning. I have sat down with her at better times and tried to have a respectful conversation to try to make things work. Every single time, she would stare into the distance and I would do the talking, despite asking her to respond or give insight to what I say. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have gotten close to breaking up about 3 times, but it always ends with us crying and me not wanting to do that to her, because I know she is going thru a lot mentally. 

One time, she brought up wanting to commit suicide during an argument. I broke down crying, practically begging her not to do that, and told her about my mom's suicide attempts and threats. She quickly backed of and said she has never considered suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot more things that have happened, but I don't want this post to be too long, so I will get to the point.

Last night, there was a party for her work (my former work) and I was invited as a +1. We got alcohol and started drinking. She tends not to handle alcohol very well. We were sitting with a group of her female coworkers (they are hostesses in a restaurant). One of the girls, who threw up 5 minutes before, asked for a sip of my water (which I brought from home). I said sure and **let her keep what was left of my water.** 

My girlfriend then looked at me and said ""that was my water wtf"" and I responded with ""no that was my water, from home. I can get you more water at the bar""

She was silent for a minute and then, without warning, stood up and stormed out of the restaurant with no explanation. I got my male friend with me and we went to find her. I knew this shit would happen. 

When I found her she was sitting in the cold. I sat next to her and asked her what was going on. She then started *yelling* at me, saying that I put another girl in front of her and that if I wanted to fuck the girl, then go ahead. I was flabbergasted and just told her that I'm not going to put up with this bullshit. She then started to put words in my mouth.

A good three hours of arguing went by and I eventually told her that this shit isn't going to work out and that we need to break up if this is how shes going to act. She started crying and calling me an asshole, saying I don't care about her, and that I ""really don't see what's wrong"". I sat out there with her the whole time until everyone left and it was just her and I and my friend waiting out of range. 

I told her that I will call my mom or her friend to pick her up, because we were all to intoxicated to drive. She kept insisting that she would sit out in the cold instead. I refused to let her do that. I eventually called her friend, and she came and picked her up. 

My gf hugged me and asked if we could talk about it in person, and I said ""sure, but-"" and she let go, stared at me in a disgusted way, and then ran off to the car. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Fast forward to today.*** I'm at work, and her best friend, who picked her up, is texting me, trying to get me to talk to my gf, to make things work out. I kept trying to tell her that if we talk it out and stay together, the same thing will happen again and again. We will eventually break up anyways.

I haven't talked to my gf since last night. I know for a fact that what I did last night was fully justified and that she was in the wrong. I don't want to put up with that shit anymore. I'm not a perfect person whatsoever and some of the things she is mad about is justified, but regardless, the fighting is not healthy and definitely not what I want out of this relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that we should stop talking and focus on ourselves. What do y'all think? Is she manipulating me? Or am I treating her wrong?

I have been with my gf for about 14 months (some off and on). I am also a woman. She has this friend, who she was with for 2 years and a bit. She came to this country in 2020 for work, and her ex came a year after. When we first got together they didn’t really talk, then she asked for permission to start talking to her in anticipation of her coming here. I wasn’t super comfortable but obliged because i trusted her. Well, when the ex arrived she broke up with me stating she felt “guilty” about leaving her and felt she owed it to her to try and work it out. 2 weeks later, she told me she wasn’t attracted to her anymore and just wanted to be friends. She moved into the same building as my gf. Somehow, her ex magically fell out of love with her in this time according to her.

Stupidly, i agreed. I later found out she had been having somewhat of an emotional affair via text etc just before she came. For the next months, my gf tried to forge a friendship with us and we did spend some time altogether but it was uncomfortable for me so i stopped. 

My gf continues to be best friends with her ex. they text almost constantly, talk on the phone, they spend extended periods of time together alone at her house or her exes house. Her ex even planned an elaborate day out in another city for her birthday. They still use pet names and their text convos are packed with heart emojis and the like. My gf tells me she’s all she has here and she feels like she needs to be there for her “more.” I don’t have a single friend i text everyday or see a million times a week. I don’t feel the need to ask my friends everyday how their day was and know all the intimate details of their days. It just feels inappropriate and pretty codependent honestly.

I have made the argument that I don’t want my partner to feel like she owes her ex any constant emotional support. Her ex also gets mad/jealous when we spend a lot of time together and my gf doesn’t see her because she just “cuts her off” when i’m around. IMO, this is a pretty normal dynamic of an adult relationship? 

I think i’ve been totally stockholmed into believing any of this is okay. Am i crazy?

I (F, 25) in a LDR with my BF (M, 25). We both live in different countries and have been together for almost 5 years. He used to be emotionally unavailable but was always up for trying to improve their himself, his communication has gotten better and I see him initiating more in the relationship. 

But being in LDR, it's hard, I like constant texting, he doesn't, I like to have movie night or game nights (via video call) he doesn't, he says they are more pain in the ass. I would like to video call him regularly, he doesn't. I even try to play video games with him but he gets very irritated with me as I suck as almost all games we manage to play together. 
He says we talk to each other every night and isnt that more than enough? Why do I keep trying to ask more? 

So recently - we had a fight, 
I was traveling and he just left me alone - he didn't bother asking me what time my flight is, when I am landing, what my plans were etc. I had only called him and was talking to him but he still was bothered, he has his own plans in the weekend so he was busy with that. The same night I came back, I kept calling him and he told me next day he slept off, but he rightfully apologised.  I kept calling him after that (not continually but at intervals of 1 hour or so) as I was wanted to talk to him about my trip. 
He didn't bother explaining why he cut the call so I left him a bunch of messages - and after so many of them be replied he is busy and was driving (this reply came after 4 hours!!) 
I asked him to call me that night but he didn't - so I called him and shouted at him and he said he lost track of time playing the new gold of war game .
I told him he doesn't care - and he argued it was just today. It ended up in a fight and he apologised profusely, and I told him what is his apology going to do? He will just apologise today and do the same thing tomorrow. 

I just wish he cared more to know about my whereabouts and well being, there were instances when I used to drunk dial him and he never bothered to ask if I was okay or doing well- he used to in fact be jealous that I was hanging out with some dudes.

(19M)I’ve been dating this girl (18F) for a year and half and fell in love pretty quickly and I love her insanely. We are long distance and we see each other only at weekends. We’ve been in argument many times, especially lately but only about small things, but last one   isn’t that small problem for me and it has probably ruined this relationship. So what happened. She wrote me that she is going outside and I was okay have fun, and then when she came home I found out she was with his friend one by one. She was in some bar only with him whole evening. I known this guy he wanted her even before I started dating her. So I was like it’s okay when you have guy friends but one on one is making me uncomfortable. I trust her she wouldn’t do anything but I don’t trust him. She told me it doesn’t matter if he wants her becuse she doesn’t want him, so she told me I am overly jelous and I think it’s not okay being with other guy one on one, like i am not sure if he wants her but he is fboy, so I wouldn’t be suprised. After this argument she told me that if this bothers me she’ll break up with me, so I suggested a compromise but she told me that in this situation there can’t be any compromise. I really love her and I know she love me too, it’s my first love and I really don’t want to lose her and I don’t think this is reason for breakup. So what compromise should we do I really trust her she would never cheat on me., that’s why I want to save this relationship. I will be very grateful for any advice.

When I hear about other relationships I get the impression that both parties have a stable, continuous feeling of love for one another, but that is not the case for me. It definetly takes me much slower than average to feel love for someone. However, I have been with my partner for around 7 months now and I still only occassionally feel love for him. 

About 4-5 months in we had pretty significant problems that stemmed from his end (he was often petty, pretentious and just rude), which almost led to me breaking up with him. At this point I was barely attracted to him. However, after a long discussion he asked for a chance to fix his problems and he truly has been working on himself and making progress. And now I feel that our relationship has been going fairly well.

The issue for me though is that my feelings are all over the place when it comes to him. Most of the time I just feel neutral towards him. He is just someone I enjoy spending time with but there are no powerful feelings. Sometimes (this occurs mostly when he does something to anger me) I dislike him and his presence irks me. And more occasionally I get strong feelings of love towards him and am so happy that I am with him. 

What really confuses me though is when my strong feelings of love show up at times where it just doesn’t make sense. For example, when we have a problem where both of us are at fault I feel strong love for him when I think about him being angry with me, but anger when thinking about how he slighted me. I understand my feelings of anger, but not those of love. It’s like my feelings go from guilt → love.

Most of the time though my strong feelings of love stem from his actions. When he does something sweet for me or I’ve really enjoyed his presence, I do feel that I love him. If he is just there though, I feel neutral.

He has a brother with whom he is very close. That brother has a four-year-old nephew that he loves very much and enjoys spending time with.

In theory I “like” children, but in practice they usually stress me out. If given a choice, I would ALWAYS prefer spending time with my friends sans kids. The kids are important to them and I love my friend and by extension love the kids in like a tribal, primal, universal way, but I don’t enjoy spending time with them. I’ve nannied, babysat, tutored, and coached all ages, from babies to college seniors. I care about kids and want the best for them, and I never want to hurt a child’s feelings, but as I say… they just stress me the fuck out.

So I don’t want to have kids, and neither does my boyfriend. That is somewhat hard to find and I appreciate it. Part of the reason why he doesn’t want kids is because his nephew scratches that itch for him. I appreciate that and also appreciate that my BF loves his nephew. If I come across ways he can spend time with the kid, like a local petting zoo or kid-friendly event, I always let him know. I keep an eye out for Xmas and birthday gifts for him too. I try to encourage and support his relationship with his brother and nephew as much as I can and is appropriate. My BF frequently likes to go over to his brother’s house and hang out, and he likes for me to join them. The child hangs out until his bedtime.

But that child’s behavior is awful, and I have come to the conclusion that I REALLY don’t want to be around him until he grows out of whatever this phase is. And I don’t know how to approach this without making my boyfriend mad or sad or something. I realize I should be able to talk to him about this, but it is hard.

When I first started spending time with them, I thought the bad behavior was a one-off, just catching the kid in a bad mood. But I’ve realized that literally every time I’m around the child he is destructive and mean. I feel like I’m being bullied by a four-year-old when I’m around them. Below are examples:

1. Lots of screaming. That’s not unusual, but the amount he screams is… a lot more than some other kids I’ve dealt with. I REALLY hate screaming.

2. He repeatedly deliberately knocks food and drinks out of adults’ and other childrens’ hands and then laughs about it.

3. They allow him to climb and jump all over the furniture, which is why he could stand on the coffee table and deliberately stomp on my food

4. He hits at least one adult multiple times every time I see him.

5. He deliberately knocks over speakers, chairs, anything that amuses him, and laughs about it.

His parents and my BF do very little to manage him, and I’m left feeling like I have to defend myself against a tiny terrorist. I do NOT want to be in a position of having to hide my food and drink from him and run away from him when I’m planning on having a relaxing evening spending time with adults. I have realized that I will NEVER have a relaxing evening spending time with adults as long as that child is awake and engaging in those behaviors.

My BF is pretty defensive of his loved ones and I don’t know how to talk to him about this without it coming across as me saying the child is a shit and they are all shitty parents. I have brought the subject up once, and he got defensive and changed the subject. 

Tonight he wants us to go over to his brother’s house and I just don’t want to go. I’ve been coming up with excuses to avoid being around the child, but I feel like it is time to put on my grown-up panties and deal with it.

My(24M) girlfriend(22F), M is an amazing person, and I would never do anything to hurt her. I have what's considered a large friend group, with well over 12 people in it. Quite a few of them are female, and I have known for a while that my girlfriend didn't exactly like them, but I've never cut ties because I've known them for a long time, and I didn't feel anything for them, and neither did they, me.

After going to a meetup with one of these female friends(23), who I'll call W, my girlfriend, and two male friends(22&amp;27), about a week before Halloween, the male friends and my girlfriend were going to rent a movie, while me and W went into the kitchen to make caramel apples. While we were making the caramel, W told me she had liked me for a while, then kissed me on my lips. M came into the kitchen at that moment to tell us the movie was starting, and caught her kissing me.

M started crying, and I told her it wasn't like that, but she didn't believe me. I know she has insecurities about cheating, as she told me I was originally a rebound from a boyfriend she found cheating on her, and she grew to love me. I have been with her for 7 months now, and she told me she really trusted me. After she caught us, before I had a chance to explain, she left and kept complete radio silence on all her social media, not texting me or calling me, and several of her friends called me and visiting me to chew me out. i told them what happened, and most of them left without saying anything after, or called me a liar.

Yesterday, M came over to my apartment, and asked to talk to me alone. She expressed her hurt, and I told her W was just a friend. W, who I hadn't talked to since then, decided to send me a text at that time. My phone was in my pocket, and M saw who it was. She left, and we haven't spoken since. How do I fix this?

It's not even that I don't love her because I really do. I've just been doubting for a while and I feel I need to do this.

I'm a 38F and have been with my husband 7 years, married 5. Pretty much from the second we married my husband changed, he became the most negative person in the world, he has zero sexual appetite, I can count on one hand how many times we've had sex since we married. It's knocked my confidence, it's knocked my love for myself.

I have tried for years to support him, I've tried to spice up the bedroom, but all he wants is me to give him a hand job and then sort myself out alone. 

I've tried to talk, I've spent 5 years trying to improve his negativity and frankly I'm exhausted. He has no interest in anything...ever.

I work away and have recently been on a 3 month trip, on that trip was a guy, we spent a lot of time together and initially thought a great friendship was blossoming. A month or so in we realised feelings had dramatically formed, one night we found ourselves at a point about to kiss, but we stopped it. 

Nothing more has happened but I absolutely love spending time with him, he is so positive and the difference is refreshing. I feel special again, I feel interesting and I feel like I'm worthwhile again, for the first time in 5 years. 

As silly as it sounds, my husband showers once a week because ""what's the point"", this guy just smells so clean and fresh, that's a silly example but he is literally the polar opposite of the man I live with. Just the fact he smells nice blows my mind that it's something my husband never does. 

I feel awful, although nothing physical has happned, I am very aware that feelings are developing and how much I want this man. Something neither of us are prepared to move forward with whilst I am married. 

I don't know what I'm asking really, but does it make sense if I say I'm so exhausted from the last 5 years of caring for someone who never even looks at me, never sees me, I just feel like I need to leave. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation that could offer advice?

At first I was happy, S seemed to be the opposite of what I always went for, which is usually fixer uppers and codependent women, probably because of my abandonment issues that stem from childhood abuse. 

She was in university, had friends, driven, kind, funny, pretty, sex was good 

The first domino to fall a few months into the relationship was an unlucky random medical emergency that required surgery of her cervix. Obviously I understand the side effects of that physically, but the mental PTSD of the whole thing basically killed her “sexuality” overnight. Years of therapy, arguments, tears, money &amp; desperation has done nothing to alleviate this. 

Now this isn’t a dead bedroom situation, we can and do have sex once a month or so, the main problem is she’s basically become asexual, she doesn’t initiate, I don’t feel she WANTS me. We kiss and cuddle all the time but I don’t even see her as a sexual object anymore &amp; she’s openly said she’s no longer sexual 

Secondly she decided upon graduation that her career dream (and degree) wasn’t actually for her, so she took a dead end minimum wage job, and has done that for 2.5 years now. Again the therapy, arguments, desperation … I have tried to help her find a career, she either doesn’t like anything or she would require years of re-education. She already has 70k of student debt, she can’t get another loan, I can’t pay for her education on my salary + the mortgage. 

Speaking of the mortgage, we co-own a house. To maintain our standard of living she has to work 70 hours a week to match my income. She’s out the house 12 hours a day 5 days a week and always has to work one weekend day as well. Now hats off to her for being the hardest worker I know, but we never see each other, not to mention that this schedule leaves no time for gym, beauty, relaxation, vacation, self improvement, hobbies, ANYTHING 

She’s now cut all her friends off, saying they are too childish, me and her live in this little bubble, I’m introverted to the max and don’t have any friends, I rely on my partner to be the social butterfly and get me out of my comfort zone socially. Without this I basically become a semi shut in. (Happily)  

Thirdly is that we are just .. different. I’m pretty fearless, I travel extensively, combat sports, thrill seeking hobbies, my ADHD requires stimulation constantly, and she HATES it. raised by ultra strict parents that basically said if you go outside - you die. 

She’s made loads of progress in 4 years, first trip abroad, first plane ride, first time in the sea etc etc 

But it’s not easy, she’s scared of everything, she often gets overwhelmed and goes into what I call “child mode” where the whiny voice comes out and she full on panics. Bear in mind this can happen if we miss a stop on the tube in Paris - honestly I find this behaviour weak and pathetic 

Your probably wondering why am I still in this relationship and honestly that’s my question here, I care for her, I want to protect her and give her a wonderful life, there’s so much she hasn’t experienced - but that’s not my job right? I keep telling myself, I’m not her parent - I feel like her parent 

But is life really better elsewhere? She’s loyal, and devoted to me. Sure having barely any and poor quality sex sucks and I’m not getting to do 3/4 of my hobbies but we share many viewpoints and our friendship/companionship is excellent. I know if I leave it will destroy her, she really relies on me emotionally. 

Is the grass really greener? Can I expect to find someone who shares my hobbies, is social, can’t keep their hands off me, earns at my level, is intelligent etc? I feel like I’m trying to build a “perfect partner” and that obviously doesn’t exist

She went through the death of her pet around august/september and hasn't really been the same. Since then, we've only managed to have sex two times, me not finishing.

I've expressed how I felt her being distant for this and other signs of affection, she's been very sweet and shared she couldn't concentrate when being intimate and her mind drifting off to bad thoughts and trauma. She used to go to therapy a few years back, but she doesn't have the means to right now. She hasn't shared with me exactly what her trauma involves, nor do I want to push her before she feels ready. 

However I find myself always beat up when trying to initiate intimacy. We've never had a crazy sex life or anything, but it's been more than two months of this and getting depressed almost every time I see her and we have an opportunity at sex. In turn I've been masturbating more than usual or necessary, which only made the last time we had sex worse as I couldn't finish and making her self-conscious and insecure in turn.

It doesn't help that we'll start a long-distance relationship in just a couple more months, as she will move away. I've always pushed her towards this change, but I do dread it now as I'm sure it will make intimacy more difficult, especially with how the situation has been lately.

I'm afraid that sharing this with her will only worsen the mental burden she has to carry now. I feel immature with how beat up I get for not managing to have sex, especially when she has bigger problems weighing on her, but at the same time I really do miss an intimate touch as I am a very physical person and feel something has been missing from us. There's also nothing I feel I can do to make things better for her, without professional help.

I have a problem, please help

Firstly, I am aware I am not the ""good guy"" in this story. I have a problem, I am aware of the problem, I just am not aware of how to solve it. Here is the background.

I started seeing this girl, and we hit it off. Good chemistry and such ya know? Well, she is an extreme extrovert, and I am an introvert. I am home most of my free time. If she is not with me, she is either working as a bartender or out somewhere with friend(s). Basically, she is never at home unless it is to sleep. 

Her social media has lots and lots of posts, and she posts often. There are multiple bikini pics with guys making comments. There are several pictures with old hookups she has had. There are posts of her dancing in clubs or concerts and such. She is just an extroverted person and she has lived her life as such.

Now, I know she has done nothing wrong, but all of the above mentioned things eat at me. I feel negative emotions, and I cannot really describe them. Anger, jealousy, controlling type things. I understand these are not good. I'm not sure why I feel this way, or how I came to be this way. 

So I tried to take the high road. I understand these thoughts I have lead to toxic, controlling relationships. Therefore, I tried to end things. She came home to me around 3AM after her bartending shift and climbed in bed. I looked at her snapchat story and saw two posts of her goofing off and giggling with some old HS friend that came in. This angered me so much that it happened, and for some reason that it happened while I was asleep at home. I got up and went to the couch and thought for an hour or so. I went back to bed where she woke up and asked me if I was ok. I replied no, and that I wanted to end things.

This caused about a 2-3 hour conversation that consisted of her absolutely ugly crying and essentially begging me not to go. She brought up she understood how I felt, which I did not believe, but whatever. Then she made a point I thought was good, and caused me to change my mind in the moment. She said she sees those older, mid 30's+ couples come in her bar, and they make her happy. She said she knows they don't have large friend groups, or take trips without each other, and essentially said in their eyes, its them and everybody else. She went on to say she wants that life, and she knows her friends now won't be there when she is in her 30s. She begged me to give it a try, and finally convinced me to stay.

So now here we are together. I still feel all these negative emotions. I am afraid they will not go away. I understand that if they do not, I must end things. But I do really like her personality, and I would like to overcome these thoughts and become a better man.

He had been disloyal and I literally felt a 'snap' like our connection was broken. Like I literally lost my soul mate? He was being disloyal.
I know not everyone believes in soulmates, but honestly I felt him. I felt the moment he decided to be disloyal and I confronted him about it. He eventually admitted he was and he thought I had been watching him even though I was 200 miles away at the time.

I don't want to give up the relationship. I invested a ton of money, time, and effort. But those aren't reasons to stay. It will significantly hurt me financially and I'll loose just about everything doing this... but I feel disgusting.

I literally look in the mirror and feel like I'm disrespecting myself staying with him. I don't feel happy. I'm crying everyday in complete shame. 

We found an exceptionally good marriage counselor and admittedly he's acting much better now, but it makes me feel like he should gave been this way the entire time. I feel like the core aspects of him cheating were something he should've worked out on his own and he didn't have to hurt me or anyone else.

His doctors did mention he has health issues with his heart and he's not receiving proper oxygen to his brain, but I still feel this was a sound decision he made. 

But I can't do this. I can't trust him. I can't build a family with him, but I'm so scared to loose my apartment, job, education, and have to move away from my friends.

I also feel like I'm old. Who tf is gonna want me after this. I'm legitimately scared ill never love someone as intensely and it's going to be just me forever. People say I'll find someone else, but if I truly believed someone else was out there I wouldn't have ever gotten married.

Every time we see each other she ends up arguing or complaining to me about something, it could be something small like me singing along to the song on the radio, or the way I react when I receive exciting news such as me receiving 100% on my exam. I must note the relationship has became semi-long distance as she moved to another city for university, but it’s only two hours away by car. So most weekends she will come down. But I don’t go up to visit her very often because of university and work and I don’t drive so it takes me 6 and a half hours with public transport to get to her, I wish there was an easier way. She says she feels it her that is putting all the effort in, I don’t know what she expects me to do… she hates I have to work and have class, if I were a millionaire I wouldn’t be in this situation, but I’m not lmao. When she asks to FaceTime I know she will complain about something. It’s been making me feel quite shitty about myself, I feel if I’m not at work or university I can’t go out with my friends or even family. And I recently got my dream summer job for next year, working abroad in a vacation destination for the whole summer, I’ve asked her to apply for the same position also, she said she will, but if she doesn’t get it, she’ll be pissed if I go myself. I said to wait until she hears back, and even if she didn’t she would could come visit. I’ve recently asked her if she loves me which again sparked another argument saying of course she does. 
If she isn’t complaining about something I’m doing or done, she is complaining about something else. I’ve tried to talk about how I feel, but she reacted erratically, she started crying and saying she’s not a good girlfriend, I then sat there, she then shouted at me asking why I wasn’t comforting her as she was clearly upset… I was upset, I just don’t show it very much. I’m embarrassed to take her out with my friends or family as she won’t speak, or when she does she just seems pissed off, even my friends and some of my family have asked me why she seems so disinterested when she speaks to them. She hates when we go out with other people, and only wants to be with me.
She also says she’s pissed at how happy I seen all the time, I like being happy, even when I’m not I force myself to… recently it’s became much harder to do, she says i shouldn’t be happy all the time.

This meant that 99% of the time they would be working together on projects and would be in contact with each other everyday. He works from home 3 days a week so he would use work chats to communicate with his coworkers throughout the day to complete work tasks. 

However early this year his male coworker was transferred into another role and he was replaced with a female coworker, let’s call her “N”. She is around our age (we’re both 27) whereas most of his female coworkers are older women. 

He would communicate with N over the work chats regarding work and often would have video calls to go over training and work related issues. 

A few days ago I was standing by his work desk when “N” sent a message regarding how she was being transferred into another role. From the way she sounded it seemed like she was upset about not working with my husband and was seeking comfort. I found this to be quite unprofessional/weird.

My husband and I both have each others phone passwords and social media accounts from the very beginning of our relationship. We felt no need to keep these things a secret as we wanted to be very transparent with each other. So last night I went through the work chat with “N” to see if there was anything out of the ordinary. I found so many messages where he was venting to her about his work situation and would even message her when she wasn’t able to make it to work events to tell her that she’s missing out. 

He would often go out of his way to constantly make jokes which seemed like he was trying to impress her. She would even send him a picture of herself at work and often heart reacts everything my husband would say. She would put little x’s at the end of her sentences when she would talk to him. 

I talked to my husband regarding this and at first he was adamant that he jokes around with everyone and it has nothing to do with her. Looking at the chats he had with his male coworker prior to his transfer showed that he never went out of his way to constantly joke around with him and neither with any other coworkers. 
He then admitted that he was constantly joking around with her to somewhat impress her and to get her to like him. 

I thought this was super disrespectful as he’s seeking attention from another women when he should have kept it professional. He is apologetic and is saying how he would never do this again. He is saying that regardless of him trying to impress her he was no way attracted to her or was trying to flirt.
