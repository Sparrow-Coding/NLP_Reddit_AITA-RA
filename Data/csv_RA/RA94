We have two problems: sex &amp; spending time together outside of the apartment. 

Our sex life has not been thriving because I have not been prioritizing it, which is something I am planning on priorizing &amp; working through. My sex drive is quite high, but I just have had a lot of bad sexual history &amp; been with pretty terrible men.. so it’s taking me a while to realize that it’s okay to be sexual and express that to my partner! But yesterday, he made a comment to me about how he feels like a old man that’s a virgin and when people around him bring up sex.. he thinks it’s funny because he used be a hoe at one point but now this is his life. Hearing that really hurt my feelings because I’ve been doing a LOT of thinking around our sex life and what I can do to improve it.. &amp; it feels like it’s all jokes to him. IDK. But I do get how he’s feeling really rejected &amp; sad by me.. so it’s two sides. I can take some accountability here! 

The second issue… spending time out of the apartment. Financially, he’s not doing great. He had to spend a lot of money due to his father passing &amp; he really is struggling in general. So for the past 3ish months, literally all our time together is spent in my apartment. I feel very sad and like there’s something wrong with me when he doesn’t show me love outside of being with me in my house. Or even in my house.. like there are ways to show me love and make me feel desired. Like when he made the bed last week.. that shit almost made me cry because it showed me he cared. How does he show me that he care? That I’m important to him? I can’t really say I can name that much. He treats me well and is kind and makes me laugh.. but I cannot spend the rest of my life not being prioritized. It hurts me! Is that so wrong.. &amp; I feel like he feels like my needs are stupid. Which triggers me because it’s like.. if you think my needs are dumb, then why would I work to make anything better? But I recognize that as toxic behavior. I don’t know how to tell him that him being kind to me and romancing me and being sweet are the things I need in a relationship. But then comes up the question.. is he too preoccupied with his life to make me a priority? He has been through immense pain this year.. it’s devastating really to think through what he had been through this year but I really cannot be with someone who cannot pour into me nor has made the effort. But financial issues crumble you.. so I don’t want to chalk this up to a lack of effort.. just a lack of ability at this current time. 

Then last night, he brought up the fact that he is thinking about if my family will accept him (because he has a kid) and how his friend was in a similar predicament, and his friend was saying that one thing to think about is; are you ok being the reason your wife doesn’t have a relationship with her family if they don’t accept you. He said it’s not a red flag or anything but just something he had never thought about. 

I am wondering if we are getting into the power struggle stage of our relationship &amp; I know the cure is to communicate!!! But what do I communicate about? And how? Do I prioritize one over the other? Financially he starts a new job next week.. so things will change. He keeps telling himself that once he starts making more money everything will be different but I don’t think our problems are really rooted in the financial. I tried to talk about the effort thing a couple weeks ago &amp; he got super triggered &amp; shut down. There’s been a lot of women in his life that have used him for his money.. &amp; I feel grouped in.. which I understand is his own shit.. but it’s confusing for me because why can’t I express myself without being grouped in with all the women who have done you wrong?

I’ll try and explain the context super quickly. So, last year me and my boyfriend and his friends all had a Kris Kringle thing set up. We went over to his friend’s house and she and her boyfriend had invited about ten people. One of these people, I’ll call N, was friends with another guy, D, who wasn’t invited to the Kris Kringle because he wasn’t super close with my boyfriend’s friend. 

Last year, D was teaching my boyfriend boxing with a few other friends around, and he has a massive ego problem. So my boyfriend got a good punch in (was just training, his punch wasn’t hard and it was more of a jab because he was practicing landing hits without being blocked). D got pissed and punched my boyfriend hard in the face, so hard that he fell over and his nose bled. Obvi after this him and D stopped being friends. But N was still friends with D. 

At the Kris Kringle, which happened after the boxing incident, N had happened to be given my boyfriend as his gift recipient. We all had put up wish lists and the unspoken rule is that you buy something from the person’s wish list. Basically N bought my boyfriend something that wasn’t on his wish list - it was a boxing glove or shirt (don’t remember exactly) with the word “Knockout!” on it. I later learned that D and N had laughed about it and decided to choose that gift for my boyfriend.

Now obviously, I’m pissed off for my boyfriend. N isn’t invited to this year’s Kris Kringle because he kind of drifted away from the group and is an overall asshole, but a few of the guys are still in a bit of contact with him. So I’d like to pass along a gift for him. 

Does anyone have any ideas for gifts that are a jab at him? I don’t know much about him. I know he enjoys boxing but isn’t super into it, I don’t want to get him anything useful that he would be happy with. I was thinking maybe a shirt with a message on it that would embarrass him. 

My boyfriend is okay with me doing this. I did ask him. He says he knows it’ll cause a stir but didn’t say anything when I asked if it was okay. I think he might feel bad saying yes - but I don’t think he minds. And if he ends up minding, I obviously won’t do it.

Any ideas would be helpful. My budget is $30 AUD. Thank you!!

My fiancé (23,M) and I (23,F) are in a long distance relationship (US-Germany) and I plan on moving in with him soon. During this summer I visited him for 7 weeks and for 4 of those we were housesitting for his mothers friends, which she seemed to have a problem with. 

Me and his mom always got along super well, but for whatever reason things changed this trip. She seemed jealous (maybe?) because we were gone for so long (even though we were still seeing her every couple of days) and every time she would see us she constantly made ""jokes"" and how we're not there and that my fiancé is not living there anymore. (He lives with his mom and brother). And every time we were with her, she was super pissy and rude towards us for no reason. 
My fiancé and I didn't see each other for 3 months before that trip and it was obviously amazing for us to also get some alone time. 

But even starting the first day we were together, his mom was calling multiple times a day sometimes, for no important reason. Plus sending him Snapchats and Instagram pictures and saying how much she misses him etc. 

Me and him unfortunately also had a lot of problems because of that, cause she called him (for no good reason) for example while me and him were on a date, and he picked up, which really bothered me. 

While we were gone she was also cleaning his room (he didn't ask for it), with all of my and our things there as well, which I thought was definitely crossing a major privacy boundary. 

We were also talking about this coffee maker that we saw at someone's house, and then she just bought it for us as a gift, even though we didn't even want it (it's a 600$ coffee Machine and his mom has been struggling with money for years and she's in debt), and that specifically also bugged me. I know  she didn't do it with malicious intent, but it still never felt right to me, considering everything that was going on. 

My fiancé didn't think all of these things are even a problem, which also led to a lot of arguments between us. He doesn't know how to set boundaries with her and he doesn't see that a lot of things she's doing are super inappropriate. All of those things are weighing on me a lot, and my therapist said that my fiancé and I have to be a unit and that he can't stand in the middle between me and his mom. And that seems to be very difficult for him at times. 
Every time we talk about this situation, he gets very defensive and tries to defend her behavior. And even though he agrees with me that those things are inappropriate, he still says that I have a bigger problem with this than he does and always makes me feel alone in this. 
And my therapist said, that if me and him can't be a unit on this and if he can't distance himself from that toxic relationship with his mom and work towards a healthy one, it's gonna be very hard for our relationship to survive, because things between me and her will never change then. 

He is always worried about how she's gonna react to certain things and he doesn't wanna be rude or hurt her, but he ends up being all those things towards me in the process. 

This is a very hard situation for me and I don't really know how I'm supposed to deal with it..


EDIT: the father hasn't been part of the family since my fiancé was 16/17 and he pretty much had to take over the role of the man in the house and his mom always relied on him a lot emotionally so that could be another reason why she's having such a problem with letting go",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7518503,public,self,Mother in law + SO problems,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yscxrw/mother_in_law_so_problems/,all_ads,6,,

I’ve had a discussion with my partner about how we’re going to spend New years eve together. He (30) told me that he wants to go to a big house party with some people that he knows. Knowing that I don’t enjoy big crowds and I’m not a fan of parties, it made me a bit sad that he wants to drink the night away and party with people(he told me that he definitely doesn’t want to stay at home). 

Then he suggested that i can come with him , but knowing that i don’t want to stay there for long, he said:” you can just leave early if you want to”. I’m cool with going there for a bit but i don’t want to leave in the middle of the night and walk home alone. I told him that I’m fine with staying home alone but I also don’t want to spend the rest of the night wondering when he will come home or wondering how drunk he is. Also he’ll probably come home (drunk)sometime during the morning/day and sleep the whole day so i can’t spend time with him the next day also.

There is still plenty of time til new year’s but i cant get this out of my mind. Any recommendations how to balance both of our plans?😭

Started dating a girl and truthfully everything was great. We dated for a month before breaking up. Although a very short relationship, it felt more genuine and real than anything i had in the past, even after a 4 year relationship where i was ready to pop the question.
 I had come to find out that there was only a few months between me and her last relationship (5 years) and i gave her an out. I gave her the out bc i had gotten out of a long term relationship 3 years prior and know how fucked up and confusing it was for me to process and i guess ""find myself"" or learn to be one person again after a long term commitment like that. I wanted this relationship to work but i needed to make sure that we were both in good spots for ourselves first for this to work.
We split, minimal contact over the next couple weeks but still both putting in the effort to communicate through this time and check up kinda.
Last night she asked if we could talk and she broke the news to me that she had cheated on me during the time we were together. 
It was once in the middle of our relationship and then again after we split.

I understood to an extent, being in that place and becoming self deprecating/self sabotaging and feeling like you don't deserve the person you were now talking to. 
I've never cheated but in similar situations in my past I've purposely fucked up good things because of self worth/ fear/ etc. Just threw the relationship away on a whim because i saw myself as some kind of piece of shit that didn't deserve the love i was receiving.
During our talk last night i could see how sorry she actually was and how much this has weighed in her for hurting me and keeping it from me.
I feel kinda stupid bc i know i still have these very deep feelings for her and i can see that she still has those same feelings for me.
I'm scared that if i don't allow myself to forgive her that somewhere down the line i would regret it. Despite this happening there is still a huge part of me that wants to be with her but the anger. The anger and broken trust is boiling up in me and i don't know how to deal with it. 
Outside of this she was the best relationship I've ever pursued. Things were easy with her, i never felt like i had to pretend to be something I'm not or persuade her to spend time with me. We were open about alot of things and even in my past after a long term relationship where i was ready to pop the question, my feelings for her were much louder than anything i have ever felt before. It's something i fear that i might never feel again with another person.

So 2 questions.

1. Has anyone had a successful relationship after being cheated on? What was your experience/how has it turned out?

2. How do you deal with the anger, feeling stupid and betrayal feeling? How do you work through it and move past it?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7518444,public,self,advice please,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysco0z/advice_please/,all_ads,6,,

I (F29) and my husband (M37) have been married for 5 years, and are now pregnant with our second. 

Well, tonight In a group chat, a friend of ours was cracking some Christmas jokes. No big deal. My husband eventually chimes in with a very bad joke about God, then follows up a meme of him going to hell. I don't know why I was so immediately triggered by this. I am not religious by any means, but I was hardcore raised in what felt like a religious cult and have those beliefs sorta engrained in me, and I currently don't know where I stand now with religion. My husband knows my background there and use to help volunteer at a church with me forever ago, so I was just deeply hurt at the moment seeing him joke about going to hell. I know, it's incredibly stupid. 

Anyway, he cracked his terrible religious joke. I got hurt by it when I saw it, and to him in the room I very quickly, and meanly, said ""if you're going to hell, I'll just find a new man in heaven with an 8 inch dick. And he's not you"". I DONT KNOW WHY I SAID IT. I have no problem with my husband size whatsoever, havw always loved our sex life. I immediately knew I fucked up and started to apologize to him over and over, but he eventually got up and left, saying he needed some space. I understood completely. He had tea water on, so I thought he would just make tea and eventually come back up so we could talk, but he disappeared downstairs forever. I really started to punish myself for what I said, mentally beating myself up and really struggled with wanting to regress to cutting myself again to punish myself for my stupidity. I eventually got myself to calm down, and went to find him. 

I found him downstairs, and asked if he was going to sleep there. He said probably, and I started to apologize over and over saying I really fucking up, I didn't mean it at all. I tried to explain why I was a little triggered, but he kept saying he needs to distance himself from me for a few days and that I don't know just why that hurt him. I do know why, I know I belittled him and made him feel insecure, and I kept apologizing asking what I could Do. He said nothing at all, so I told him i really mentally beat myself up over this and struggled with wanting to regress to self harm. He said that was a complete bullshit made up thing, I got instantly raging angry with him and chucked a pillow at him and left. 

I laid upstairs crying for a bit, and finally about 30 minutes later he comes up and gets ready for bed. I laid there hopeful that he would come to bed so we could talk, but he came out and grabbed all his things, and started to leave. At this point I was sobbing. He stopped before leaving and said ""do you know why I don't want to be here with you? Because you never once said down there I love you for who you are"". (I can't read his fucking mind!!) I said of course I love you for who you are, and he proceeded to then say he does not find me attractive at the moment, does not lust over me, that he is just going to sleep, work and ignore me. He kept yelling these things at me, i just covered my face and sobbed uncontrollably. He eventually left. I then stayed up for hours just crying, hyperventilating, and panicking over what this stress would do to my baby.

We started talking but I admittedly wasn’t being straight forward with how I felt about because of this I feel like that’s why still talking to her ex. She ended up getting back with her ex and I think I partially responsible for her going back because I was playing games and still didn’t make it clear I was interested in her. 

(Side note: this relationship she was in was a horrible relationship, she was constantly told she wasn’t enough, made fun of, even called unattractive) (ex and his friends would even make fun of her too her face because she used to be very skinny)

This dude was jealous of me because she had told him before that she found me attractive and had a crush on me, she says she was trying to get out of the relationship and was doing everything she could to get out (this retard was threatening her family and I can’t say with what but it was so stupid) so to sum it up she was scared for her family, unsure I wanted her, didn’t want to be alone, and though this dude could change so she wanted to give him a chance (they had been on and off for a while)

Fast forward this dude does a bunch of things to try and get her fired while working with me and they all failed. The irony is if he never started acting crazy I wouldn’t of felt bad and felt like I needed to help her, so I probably wouldn’t never got with her.

Fast forward she ended up leaving this dude  for me and I can tell I just make her 50x happier she is now with me. She also telling me how much better I am sexually and how she was shocked how big my dick was.

Here’s the issue for me, I was ok for months and then saw and Instagram post about sex that she had liked from the time she had went back to him and it really just set me off.

I felt a hurt and anger I had never felt before. I remember driving by her house and seeing her exs car there in the mornings and knowing she was doing sexual things.

It drove me to ask a lot of questions about the sexual things that happened then and they grossed me out. (She never had penetrative sex so she technically lost her virginity to me) 

It’s not that she did it, it’s that I was apart of her life when it happened thats painful.

She didn’t make an objectively bad decision to go back, but it’s painful to me that it happened, I can’t look back at any pictures from tht time because it makes me extremely sad.

I want to get over this because she is literally head over heals In love and obsess with me and I want to fully enjoy her without the memories and thoughts from the past.

We live together, both have good jobs (I earn $112k plus ~15k bonus, while she earns $90k and I also have a student loan which eats up about 11% of my salary). I generally contribute about 20% more to household bills while also paying for most dinners, drinks etc out. 

I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to horse racing and over the course of the last 12 months have made on average about 125 per week profit. Nothing crazy but a good side hustle nonetheless and obviously this comes with both profitable and non profitable weekends.

I fully understand that the role of a man is to be a provider, but it has all really come to a head when we went to the casino with some friends after a dinner tonight (something we've done 4-5 times max throughout the duration of our relationship) and I ended up winning $165 which realistically is not a significant amount for us. 

That being said, she was trying to demand that because I won this amount, I should be giving her $60 that she spent this week on buying us tickets to see a classical music concert that she wanted to see (I have no interest in it whatsoever but was happy to attend given I know she wanted to go). 

All in all I would've been fine with paying for the tickets but the demand really made me feel uneasy and as a result has caused an argument.

My bf and I were shopping at Sainsbury a few days ago  and he ran into an old acquaintance of his during the time. I say  acquaintance not friend because apparently they went to college together  and they had a falling out over something.

This Hijabi woman (this is relevant) was just looking over at us  suspiciously the whole time when my bf finally noticed her and began  holding me closer to him. 

I saw her expression change and she quickly moved towards us and  began talking to us. She said hi to my bf with a very sour expression  and looked at me like she was x-raying me as we made introductions. Her  face was grew even more serious when she heard my name and simply told  my bf ""you don't deserve this you POS"" and walked away. 

I was shocked and when I asked bf he just told me it's ""someone from  college"". I figured okay maybe it's an ex, maybe it ended badly, who tf  cares about some random b\*\*\*\* right? 

However, my bf had been sort of lost in thought ever since then and then pulled away whenever I initiated anything sexual. 

I asked him if he was okay and he kept saying ""I'm a bad person"", and  ""Don't leave me"" and ""I cannot lose you"". This naturally freaked me out  as I thought he was initiating a breakup or even worse confessing to  cheating. But the truth is apparently something else.

He told me it's time to confess his mistakes and begged me to hear me  out. My bf was involved in a group called the English Defence League  and was active in their street protests. I am an Indian immigrant and a  Muslim (also relevant) and didn't know what this was until I googled it  later. 

To sum it up, it apparently is an anti-immigration British political  party with specific viewpoints about a certain religion. Guess which  one?

And now I don't know what to fucking do. My bf kept saying sorry and  saying he wasn't involved in any criminal activity and he was only  protesting. He said he was not coming from a place of hate and that he  has changed his mind about politics since then. 

The thing is, I love him. He loves me. This whole thing was almost a  decade ago. But some part of me feels like what if he's not as attracted  to me. What if he loves me but doesn't like me? 

I'm so confused how do we proceed. How do we go from here?

We both joked about going but made it very clear we were kidding, he literally put (kidding) at the end of his text. 

I thought the conversation was done until I got home and he and his friend were talking on the phone about it. For like the next hour or so it kept getting mentioned and I still thought it was a joke, so to play along I was telling him “No it’s like $60 a ticket and I don’t really want to walk around a bunch of naked pictures of women and half naked cosplayers”. Then his friend found a volunteer sign up page where my bf would get to go for free. Still thinking it was a joke I expressed I really wasn’t into the idea, but dropped it. 

Later after he got off of his computer he signed up on the volunteer page. I asked if he was really going to go, his explanation was and still is that it will be an experience and he may never get the chance again. 

Is there a way I can explain to him why I’m so uncomfortable with him going without sounding like I’m just insecure. It’s more about respect than anything. I don’t think it’s respectful to me for him to go to meet and greets with ecchi cosplayers and watch a burlesque performance when he has a girlfriend who has told him she wouldn’t be comfortable with it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7518324,public,nsfw,Bf wants to go to Ecchiexpo,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysc3n8/bf_wants_to_go_to_ecchiexpo/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,

I have previous post here, from this we kinda just put it under the sand and got over it. But since then we are having more problems.  I will start by saying i am a very difficult person to deal with, very head strong, stubborn and often blunt which does not help the situation at all. 

When we do argue i like space and like to get into my own headspace to gather my thoughts and think about what's been said and what I've said. She always says ""you've put your wall up again and your not communicating"" but its my way of dealing with things, ill often just get over things with time when I've come to realise its pointless being angry or upset about it if we want to move on.

The problem we are having she is the complete opposite to me and will just want things to go back how they are the next day, while I'm still in my zone and thinking. She'll get frustrated because I'm not giving her anything, like not wanting to do anything, hug her, etc.. then shell start saying ""you are emotionally manipulating me"" ""its not fair, since its always on your terms"" but all i want is space. Im thinking I'm kind of being gaslight slightly because I don't think I'm doing anything apart from ignore her and trying to get my own space.

As you can imagine it constant back and forth and my wall is just getting higher and higher because i have not had time to really reflect and think. ""is this worth fixing"" because like the last post this isn't the first time, when we first got together we'd argue constantly but to make things work we really tried to understand each others point of view, this isn't the case. 

She had to make loads of sacrifices to be with me because i've got a child soo she uses that against me as ""no compromise""  

The issue im finding is that she does not understand where im coming from and just see's it as ""mean, nasty"" whenever i try to explain that i think shes overacting about a certain situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My ask is - How do we move on from this? We both think what each other is doing is wrong and therefore always pointing the finger at each other.

We live together just the two of us

Before moving in together we’d play PC together pretty much every other day after each of us had finished work. Our other friends aren’t really gamers at all so 90% of the time its just us two chilling and enjoying each-others company. Never any arguments or disputes. He is a chill guy, id say I’m the same.. so its pretty fun and easygoing, hence why a year ago we decided it’d be a great idea to move in together. Hell, go to work, come back, kick back and game out with a tv in the background showing whichever sport happens to be on! Whats not to love?

This is what I thought it would be like. We stay up late but not too late, but apparently late enough to make my friend tired and cranky when he’s come back from working a 9-5. He just seems constantly grumpy, will only watch what he wants to watch, do what he wants to do and talk about what he wants to talk about. Anything I suggest to watch / bring up as a topic of conversation is most of the time met with a ‘I don’t actually care’ or ‘I’m not watching that’ or ‘why would I want to do that’. Its almost like hes just living his life as if he was living alone, and im just there on the sideline getting frustrated. I feel like im walking on egg shells whenever I suggest something to do or talk about something im interested in and its really beginning to piss me off. It’s like I can’t be myself - around my best friend!?! 

This seems like a completely different person to the guy that I’d stay on PC with for hours on end with, nonchalantly talking about the most random or absurd phenomenas. There is just no fun. I’ve seen heaps of stuff online about why moving in with a best friend is a bad idea but I looked at them with a jokey pinch of salt.

I’ve essentially started to realise, that my friend is chilled out, but only with stuff he enjoys or cares about, which seems to be quite a short list. Its growing clearer that he is rather stubborn and close-minded, in the sense that he only likes what he is familiar with. This glaring issues is exacerbated by the fact that he is genuinely quite messy and borderline disgusting to live with. Day old dinner plates left on the floor etc…

Don’t get me wrong, I still like the guy heaps, when we have a good time, its really fun. Its just that its only the case like 10% of the time. We have not fallen out or anything, he is probably none the wiser. But I cant stand living with him anymore and want to go back to living on my own whilst being friends with him. When im not with him, its back to normal being friends, but when living together I feel tense.

What do I do? Is this normal or it a sign for other things?

I’m just going to flat out say it. If he’s sweeping he misses half the room and doesn’t get the corners. If he’s doing laundry you’re lucky if your clothes are folded neatly before getting shoved in the drawer. But it’s the dishes that really get to me. He doesn’t clean the bottom of the dish, the handles of the utensils and cutlery, the bottom corners/books of mugs and cups, etc. and it is genuinely a safety concern. If I wash my hands before dinner then pick up a dirty utensil handle that literally defeats the purpose. Or when we stack the plates and all the dirty bottoms are touching the clean tops, that defeats the purpose too.

I usually do the dishes because I like the standard that I have. I accept that if I want things done my way then I have to be the one to do them. I do the dishes, the laundry, the scrubbing, the cat litter, the tidying and organizing, the sweeping, the mopping, everything except the garbage. I accept that and usually I am okay with that! Although in the odd time I need help with a task if I’m busy or overwhelmed I ask him to help out and he has no issues doing so. But then it’s legit a safety concern yet again.

No matter how many times I ask him to make sure he does the dishes properly, giving him examples of things to change and how while making sure i’m not babying him or backseat driving, he never seems to improve. I think I have told him like 10 times “please don’t put the non-stick pans upside down on the clean dishes, the dishes are now greasy and need to be rewashed” and yet as I am writing this there is a pot upside down on top of the dishes…

Am I doing something wrong? Is there something I should change to encourage him to build his cleaning skills? Is he doing this on purpose or just out of unintentional ignorance? All I want is to have a helping hand around that actually helps, because right now I need to redo most of the dishes…

I’ve been in a LDR with my boyfriend for almost a year now. He’s finally coming to see me next week and now I don’t know if I want him to come. 

For whatever reason throughout our relationship his mother has never liked me. Which I’m very sad about because she’s always seemed like a very sweet person whenever he’d describe her to me. And sometimes when we’d be on call she’d come over to him and hug him and tell him she loves him which I thought was so sweet. My mom was never like this with me and my boyfriend told me all the time she’d welcome me with open arms and in a way I hoped she would. She was so sweet and caring I don’t understand what I could’ve done to make her hate me so much. 

Every single time I’ve ever heard her talk about our relationship it’s always been negative. I can count on my hand how many times she’s said something nice about me. And I’ve never been rude to her before. If anything I was already scared to approach her (I have horrible social anxiety) but my boyfriend would warm me up to the idea of meeting his family and I’d be fine with it at first but then something would happen and it’s circle right back to me being afraid to meet her. 

For example, one time while my boyfriend and I were on call discussing our trip to see each other, and she came up behind him and started talking to him about it and I heard her say “well if she can wait a little bit longer maybe you can go see her in February” 

I know it’s not the best example but number one we’ve been saving a lot of money to see each other. We already had to cancel the first trip we had planned because of lack of money so I’ve been overworking myself for MONTHS trying to save money. Two - do you know when you can just tell in someone’s tone that they’re being snarky and mean? The way she said it made me so sad I just made an excuse and left the call and started crying. He told me it was “just a misunderstanding and that I wasn’t supposed to hear it, it wasn’t meant for me” but it honestly just reinforced the idea that she didn’t like me. 

Ever since then I’ve been wary about anything having to do with her, whether it be trying to avoid her, or owing her money, I didn’t want to owe somebody who doesn’t like me. This whole time she’s never wanted my boyfriend to stay the full week we had planned. So when he said she was gonna be the one buying his plane ticket instead of me I just knew something was off. 

Well she’s decided to cut the trip short by a day to have him home sooner and that she doesn’t want him here for thanksgiving. The wind was just knocked out of me and I said something to protest and he said to me “she said take it or leave it” 

I’m gonna be honest I’m not trying to make myself the good guy, I exploded when I heard that. I was - and still am, so angry about this. I sent him $500. a MONTHS worth of my checks from work. For him to stay the full week her and she waited till the last second to pull the rug out from under our feet. My boyfriend isn’t even upset about this. 

I said a lot of things to him. Some I regret. Some I don’t. I told him about how this whole time he’s tried to convince me that she likes me. Someone PLEASE TELL ME IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOES THIS WOMAN LIKE ME??? I told him I didn’t want to deal with a mamas boy and that I was contemplating leaving him over this.

The more complacent he was about it the angrier and pettier I got. I’m a petty person I’ll admit it. It’s not a trait I’m fully proud of. I told him if that’s the case I want my $64 dollars that she took for the night he’s not gonna be here. I said that since he was fine with taking days off to not see me, I’ll just go to school on the days he was supposed to be here. I’m missing 4 DAYS OF SCHOOL for this. I’m so tired of sacrificing SO MUCH OF MY TIME MY SLEEP JUST TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM AND HE NEVER DOES THE SAME FOR ME. I said that we wouldn’t have the time to meet my friends then. Which honestly I was just being mean at that point. Not very mature of me but I’m not looking for someone to tell me what I did was wrong. Trust me I know. But I’ve been holding in all these feelings to myself for so long now. Nobody to talk to about anything. All the times he put me off or didn’t want to make time for me just fueled my anger more and more. It wasn’t right of me, but I’m tired of being a low priority to him. I’m tired of being told she likes me when she so obviously doesn’t. 

I don’t care who sees this I just need someone to please tell me I’m not going crazy over this. Please. I don’t know what I did to make her hate me like this. I’m at my wits end. I love my boyfriend more than anything but I don’t know if I can handle this anymore.

He was the toughest guy in the entire campus and he was the typical protector type guy who believed that the world has become bad and only he can protect me.   


He hid the fact that he cheated with the same girl that I had a big problem with (she stole my phone). I spent 5 years in my college looking at her eyes and talking and laughing, not knowing that she had fucked my boyfriend. Ever girl in my class hated this girl. She used to be attracted to guys who were already in relationships. Alas, I thought she would never go this far with my guy because every student and every teacher knew how serious we were about each other. Once we went to a college trip. That girl was drunk one evening and she was fighting with her then boyfriend over the phone in my boyfriend’s room because she went to ask for his help with her relationship. I knew about that. But he never told me that she put her head on his lap and then they did the deed. He cheated on me in that room. In the same room where I stayed secretly out of our teacher’s eye with him. I slept in the same bed (I was a virgin then. We didn’t do anything). My friend told me that after we came back from our trip, he cheated once more. One time that girl went out of class to go to the washroom and after 2 minutes he went out too. We used to sit near each other. Now I just can’t imagine how I was so stupid to not notice it. He fucked her at college and after classes ended, we held hands while I put my head on his shoulder and talked while we went home by the college bus. I just can’t get the thought out of my head about how they must have stolen glances at each other. How they might have felt.   


I might think that the first time was a mistake, but the second time, he wanted it to happen. Maybe he did it more than twice. He has never told me about this and apparently everyone in my college knew but he told everyone to never tell me. I know he loves me now. He will give his life for me an I’m not kidding about. His family knows about me too. I had so many restrictions. No guy could ever touch me (eg like giving handshakes or high-fives), hugging was out of question. He didn’t want me to work cause a man’s job is to provide for his family and that he would be ashamed if he made me work. When I came into the relationship, everything was perfect. There was no restrictions about wearing short clothes or strapless tops. Our relationship became toxic gradually. In our 3rd year we knew that we have a future together and we will get married. But looking back, I knew nothing about life, I trusted him blindly, believed his words, tried to fit myself as the girl he desired. Back then I used to believe that I was mature and old enough to understand about relationship but now I believe I was still a child when I was 18. I have changed.   


My goals in my life has changed. But he can’t accept my changes. He wants me to be like I was before. But before, I didn’t know what I wanted from my life myself. He wants to get married after 2 years from now. But I want to explore the world. My father raised me to be a strong woman. He never expected me to become a useless human, staying at home, not working after what he has done for me all my life. I can’t break up with him because he will actually off himself. I’m not kidding. He will. He isn’t threatening me. I am it for him. I know him. But if I stay with him I know I will regret that I didn’t do what I wanted to do in my life. My parents have no problem with it but he has. I cannot be known as the girl who went from underneath her father’s roof to her husband’s roof. I want to enjoy my freedom. I want to live alone. I want to study more. Learn new languages. Live alone. Take responsibility of myself. I want to do that. Life is too short and I don’t believe in heave or hell. I’ll be 30 after 5 years. I want to enjoy my life. I don’t want live my life in restrictions. If I have sinned by destroying his life then so be it. I can’t spend my life living in fear. I do not want to waste this life being the perfect wife so that I could go to heaven and fear about hell. This life might be it. There might be nothing after this. I cannot waste my life for someone else’s happiness.   


I need your help. My only way out is if I leave him suddenly. When I leave, I will call his sister and brother and tell them to look after him, so that he doesn’t do anything dangerous. I want to scream at him. I want to cry. I want to shout at him and ask why he betrayed me. I love him so much. But he is not good for me. I think when I leave, I’ll tell him then. If I get selected in my desired university, then I’ll be leaving in 6 months. Sorry I couldn’t tell about the good things in our relationship. But believe me when I say that he is the only person for me in this world. I would live him till death. He might be a monster but he treats me like an angel. I love him so much. Please help me.

He left me alone sitting and waiting for him, went to sit by his friends, didnt bother inviting me over and when I left slamming the door he said I made it a big deal and none of his friends like me. It broke my heart as I care about people words and he knows. He then said I need him to survive the job. I still took him back cause he d say sorry and start with the love words. Then, he cancelled a date after promising for a match with guys, last minute and said sorry when I got mad.

I told him thats possesive and he stopped talking for a whole month until I accepted I made a mistake offending him and I was sorry. Even that , he said he was angry at me and I had to wait for his forgiveness.

He charms almost anyone and I look like the bad person, although I think I did nothing wrong. He was saying he was always used by women and blamed me for withdrawing my love. I was just scared and wanted him to make things right. I told him twice I did love him , but wouldnt mention it often. We then texted in the middle of the night and I told him I had always loved him, but his actions made me back off, he treated me like crap, gave the silent treatment for a month and was punishing me , in order to beg. I cried that night and in the morning he hadnt bothered to send any text of apology , so blocked him but then after 2 months unblocked to phone him and say I miss him. He said he was waiting for that phone call and it arrived a little bit late. Lastly, he flirted with another woman in front of me, avoids me, and pretends to be really happy at work as if I dont exist. I phoned him once and a ""friend"" opened the phone for him as he was driving. I felt completely disrespected and said -sorry for calling, bye.

He leaves every office Im at, but checks all my stories, stares at me.

Sorry in advance, if my English seems bad. Brief info about me: 

I(27/F) have been dating my childhood friend for a year now and we are expecting a baby together. He(28/M) until we got together, lived with his family on state funds and has not completed education(he had semi good grades i would say, but still acceptable). We live in Europe so these situations are not that uncommon since we get help from the government.   
I really love my man more than anyone else in this world. He is caring, loyal, funny, a gentleman and we just seem to be soulmates for life. Since I lived in various other cities in our country for education reasons, we didn't see each other for almost 10 Years. But now a year ago I moved back and we kind of just happened. I am really glad it turned out this way.

He also found a job recently thanks to my help and asked me to drive my car to work, otherwise he would not be able to park in the underground garage with his own car. His car is absolutely awesome... or not... It is a limousine, typical car to show off, however, there is one problem: his parents.   
The car has everything a luxury car needs but his parents have been driving it around for a year and a lot has happened. His father ran over a deer with it, which is why a lamp on the left side is dented. At the back of the bumper is a dent, everyone assumes that someone drove into the car while it was parked, but I think it was his father by accident and does not want to admit it. On top of that his father smokes in this car, which is a no go for that type of luxury car. The inside of the car itself is covered in dusted, completely trashed and some buttons do not work properly, which is why his father has clamped a penny piece between, so that the car no longer displays an error message(Since everything is so advanced).  

My hubby complains every time we are on the road with his car. Like how trashy it looks and what needs to be repaired. He cries inside every single time, since this car was one of his Dreams and really not that cheap.  
Now I have to go to work with this junk car and my work colleagues ask me why I drive such a cool car that is so rundown... . 

Best part comes now:  
Every single day, since I need that car to get to work, I have to go to his parents and ask for PERMISSION to drive with the car, since my hubby uses my car. It pisses me off soooooo much.   
He pays the expensive car insurance ALL ALONE without his parents contributing a penny and he paid off the car himself without the help of his parents and so I expect him to be able to reasonably explain to his parents how to handle it. He is also to blame, because he has hardly paid attention to the car since we started dating and his parents take everything for granted. 

I tried to talk to him about his parents parents and I always get the same answer: ""That's my parents, what do you expect me to do?"". I understand that he loves his parents and cares about them, but at some point he has to realize that he also has an obligation to other people. What happens when our baby is there and he always takes his parents side, no matter what?  

I have a bad image of his parents anyway, in this case especially of his mother, because she always says stupid things.   
When we talked about politics especially the Ukraine-Russia war(she initiated the whole conversation to this point), she was completely infatuated with the Russian side and was talking nonsense. My hubby and me share both the same opinion on that war: its not good in general. Nobody deserves to die under such miserable circumstances and with so much fear.  But she on the other hand was like: ""The poor Russian soldiers, dying for mother Russia. I hope that Putin will put an end to this soon... bla bla I hate all  Ukrainians. They are evil people"" and much more nonsense that really made me angry. (Sometimes it feels like lots of Russian people that DON'T live in Russia anymore are just brainwashed by the TV shows they keep on watching)  
When I wanted to convey to her that before she babbles such idiotic statements, she should inform herself in advance at various sources. She then proceeded to tell me ""I do not listen to fairy tales of children who have no life experience anyway"". I got up and left that instant, because I wont let anyone disrespect me in such a way, since I was always polite to her in the first place. 

When my hubby got his new job, she came running out of the house in a panic while we were on our way home and demanded to talk to him. She looked at him and said ""Your new job, yes that's nice but you could try to start an apprenticeship as a painter at this company around the corner. If you do not like it, you can quit it again."" Well knowing, that my hubby already tried over 6 times to start a career, but always canceled every single time ... and I am no longer surprised. Well knowing that we are expecting and need that money really bad  to secure us financially. Well knowing that I was the one who helped him getting that job in the first place..

I am at my limits when it comes to his parents. I really want to like them since they are his Parents but it just isn't my world and I can not just sit back and endure everything. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN MY HEAD... I want to get along with them because I love my hubby so much and I would be so happy if he could try to understand me here as well. What should I even do at this point?

It would be too easy to just let things go by as they are right now. I could just say ""Sorry Honey, I'm driving to work with my own car again. You should try to find your own way to get to work somehow. Maybe your DAD could drive YOU to work every day."" or something like that which is even more stupid in my opinion, since the gas prices are a whole new level.   


I already tried to tell my boyfriend what I thought of this whole situation but again, running against a wall. We are going to talk about this topic in the evening, so wish me luck that everything goes smoothly.

We’ve had plenty of ups and downs no relationship is perfect. My main problem is sex, We started having a dead bedroom for months and when we had sex I won’t lie he was pretty selfish it still always ended once he was finished. 
I soon found out he was sending money for pictures of feet and was secretly jerking off on Reddit/porn sites to pleasure his foot fetish and he was to ashamed and embarrassed of it to tell me. honestly he was never going to tell me and never was going to stop cause I knew for a while but waited to see if he ever would stop or tell me eventually I always wanted him to trust me and be comfortable, I felt incredibly bad at first for feeling upset and betrayed that he couldn’t trust me or didn’t even give me a chance to know he’d rather have a dead bedroom with me. That was a few months ago but as you can see I’m still healing from it all. 

And now I have a hard time having sex I never wanna have sex anymore he does try now he’s not fully selfish but sex is still I’ve never been able to be finished or pleased, I don’t wanna go full detail into all the lovely small things he does or doesn’t do or this and that, I just wanna express I’m feeling like I’m losing feelings and idk if I wanna keep fighting for something I feel exhausted on when all I did was try to make him comfortable but I have to complain for the same things over and over.

Non-Jewish woman and Jewish man.

So basically, I am converting to Judaism to honour my family who perished in WW2. I met a great guy at a  Jewish holiday gathering, we’ve been hanging out and dating for some time now.

It’s been pretty fantastic. Great understanding of each other. He’s so supportive. I would be very proud to call him my boyfriend. I’ve never really felt this way for anyone. I’ve been single for 10+ years.

So I grew up in a non religious household, but we do get together for Christmas. Share gifts. Eat food. It’s the one time a year all of my family is together. I’ve always been without a partner, so I asked if he would ever like to come to one of these family events surrounding those holidays in the future and he said flat out no because it’s a Christian holiday.

I can respect that. But we’re not doing any Christian things. We’re literally just drinking and eating food, watching the younger kids have fun together and talking. It’s more of a commercialised Christmas than anything.

I cannot give up that side of my life for someone else and I want someone to be able to participate in it. I don’t put up Christmas things in my own house, because like I said… it’s not a thing for me. But I love being able to spend time with my family. 

I am really conflicted, can I please have some of your thoughts on this?

Last we spoke, I ended things because I really need a partner who can be there for me at those type of events and I wanted to respect his choice and my needs. But I’m going to see him tomorrow because he called and asked for us to talk about it.

TLDR; Jewish guy hates Christmas wants no part of it and I need a partner who can accept that I had a life before my new Jew life.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7518221,public,self,Conflicting :( advice pls,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysbktk/conflicting_advice_pls/,all_ads,6,,

I still ignored as I loved her and assumed she does the same I did so much for bought flowers, gave her presents and we lived in different countries I even visited many times while she visited just once and due to some of her works.

He has kids from his last marriage who come over every other week. We have two male roommates. He works from home, I leave to babysit on the off weeks when the other kids aren't here and I take our toddler with me.

A few times, when I come back from babysitting, I've found blue hairs in our room, the kids' room, and our bathroom. I have red hair. I know they are human because they look kinda faded/have been bleached and darker at the roots. (The kids do have dolls with multicolored hair, and I've considered that but like I said it looks human, and my blue wig is a completely different shade of blue.) All the findings were just chance (I never think anything is wrong until I happen to see a blue hair.)

Each time I've seen them and asked my fiancé he gets super defensive and we get into a huge fight, he tells me I'm ruining his day, cusses me out and says to stop being insecure. But this isn't an Insecurity thing and I'm not even aggressive when I ask about it. I just simply ask if someone was here while I was gone. I never accuse him of cheating or anything, but he blows up and makes me feel like it's my fault for all of our problems and fights when I didn't even do anything wrong except ask a simple question. I always end up crying and feeling like I'm a terrible person and forced to drop the subject even though I know I'm not crazy and blue hairs don't just pop out of the ground.

Other than that, our relationship has been fine I think. I do kinda feel like we aren't very connected anymore, but I've pushed that feeling down so we can just live our lives without me being that clingy, naggy girlfriend who complains about never spending any time together lol. I've suggested couples therapy but he says we'd be wasting money. 

I've also considered roommates having people over but they always let everyone in the house know when they have people coming over, and like I've said, I found the hairs in mine and my fiancés spaces. Oh and on our toddler's carseat once.

To preface, my husband is the sole provider in our relationship due to me being unable to work normal jobs (severe mental health issues) and I'm currently in the transition of working online, it's just taking time to start up.
my husband and I met long distance and we moved in together a little over a year ago, which again, he is the sole provider (I have contributed every cent that I had prior to being here, and even when I receive money I send it to him so we can save for things, etc - point being, i have no money and any money i make i give back to him because i think thats fair)
For additional context i come from a very poor family, and suffered from abuse both physical and mental- because of this, whenever I needed money for food or other necessities I would turn to SW (not anything physical, only selling risqué content online) and this ranged from the time I was 15-19. Due to my upbringing I hate relying on people, I can't stand the thought of asking people for things because when I was younger that wasn't allowed, or eventually when it was it would be held over my head constantly. (basically that i didn't actually have anything and everything i had belonged to them, i didn't deserve to be helped, etc)

Now, before I get into things I want to make it clear that I know that I fucked up.
A week and a half ago I went behind my partners back to start selling content again.
I was too scared to tell him I was interested in doing so because of reactions, or things that were said about girls who did ""that sorta thing"" from previous conversations. 
I planned to do it for a couple months and save some money so i didn't have to keep asking him for things constantly (even if its things i need like hygiene, or weather appropriate clothes, etc)

Well, last night my husband found everything. I kept all of my stuff on a singular twitter (that he found) and I let him go through everything. 

Here's where things get tricky-
My husband sees things as I was emotionally interested in cheating, I was online looking for a relationship, etc.
However, for me its purely transactional. To me, it's not at all different from working any other job and I don't harbor any type of feelings for these people..

He has said he wants to work through things, and I do as well, but where can we go from here?

I have since deleted all social medias I own, and told him I'd be okay with a daily-weekly check up so that he could see I am not, and will not ever do something like that again but what else can I do?
I know it's my fault he's feeling the way he is, but how do I comfort him?

The more we talk about it, the more I understand he's not as mad about SW but the fact that I did it behind his back, and because he genuinely believes there's more to it than what it was.

I love my husband endlessly, even though my actions were truly truly terrible, and I want to fix things but I am unsure how.

I (31) have loaned my car to my brother (41) for the past two weeks. My brothers car was a write off and he needed a way to be able to commute for work/deal with his kids (transport). My father (61) also asked if I could help my brother as I work from home. I agreed as it's short term and I could manage around it (getting groceries delivered and taking the bus which are extra small cost to me).

My father dropped in earlier in the week and asked if I needed anything as he was going to the shop. So I asked if it was ok to pick up some milk &amp; chicken nuggets to tie myself over before next grocery delivery.

Today my dad called and in conversation asked me for 5 euro - the cost of the groceries. To which I was completely shocked for something so small we clashed and I don't agree if family offers to do something small like pick up milk they're expecting 2 euro from you. My father is by no means dealing with financial struggles.

I found this quite upsetting as in my own position I would never dream of asking someone a few euro for something I offered. I almost feel like I can't accept any future offer of help from him as it would have strings attached?

I'm having trouble navigating my feelings on this and understanding his position if someone asks you to get something from the shop you pay for it (even tho I did not ask, he offered). I have in the past picked small things up for him and never expected money. Ok if something is more frequent or more expensive then sure you ask in advance - I'm just so taken aback and wondering if I could get some help as I'm struggling to understand",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7518177,public,self,Surprised at my dad's request,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysbe3n/surprised_at_my_dads_request/,all_ads,6,,

My son is 23 years old still he stays with me.  Today a 23 year old woman reached out to me via Facebook. She is 6 months pregnant with my sons child. I had no idea he even had a baby on the way. She messaged me videos of my son threatening her to get an abortion. 
Also my son was texting her trying to bribe her to abort the baby with money ($200) and i knew it was my son from the phone number the screenshots had on them. She told me she was my sons ex. And was scared. I watched the videos she sent and was in shock at some of the things my son had said to her. He sent videos of her admitting she would be doing it alone and he wanted nothing to do with them and to just get rid of it. 
  She blocked my account after sending me this 


My son told her in the messages he basically was gonna be a dead beat  dad she was going to do it alone numerous times. 

My son didn’t tell me he had a child on the way nor could i believe how bad he was trying to manipulate this girl too abort my grandchild.
I want to meet up with her for support and to apologize on my sons behalf. My son hasn’t denied that it’s his child but he admitted to emotionally abusing the situation 
 

i  want to be in this child’s life but I’m not sure how to go about it i can’t force my son to help?
