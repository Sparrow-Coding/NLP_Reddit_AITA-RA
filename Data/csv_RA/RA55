My girlfriend (23F) have been going out for a while, and I love her with all my heart, and she is by far the best person I have ever dated, and I like to think I get along with her amazingly well.

Coming into the relationship, my GF had someone who she says is her best friend, who she once sent a nude to, and he sent some back. Some time after (no idea how long), she said she realised it was a mistake, and since have been friends, sitting down watching films together online (he lives in a different country). She says that he has been there for her through rough times, however I expressed my concern at the beginning of the relationship, saying that I was uncomfortable with the situation, and would rather her end things rather than continue talking to him, if she wanted me to be a part of her life.

About a month into our relationship, I discovered that she was still talking to him after she had promised to me she had stopped, and we had an argument, and she agreed she would block him.

This girl means the world to me, and I consider her to be the most beautiful, amazing and adorable girl going, and I love every moment I spend with her.

She has recently come back to me saying that she misses him, and wants him back in her life. She has given me an ultimatum of either I accept it, or that will be the end of our relationship. I have done everything I can for her to make her the happiest girl in the world, and treated her as if she is the only woman in existence.

I am also upset by this because she has no problem going through my phone and looking through all the conversations with girls on snapchat that I may have, although there aren't really any, whether this is her being insecure or not I do not know, but if her looking makes her feel happier then I'm all for it.  (I have no problem with her doing this and have offered for her to have her facial recognition thing on my phone, and will happily provide her with the password whenever she will ask).

She will send me messages such as ""Just wanted to say that I'm really grateful that I have you in my life and I love you so much and you're amazing and perfect and kind and sweet and the best person ever""

and 

""It also makes me realise that l'm not the problem in the past relationships like I'm normal and it's them that had a problem with me being me.""

&amp;#x200B;

So it just feels like a massive blow for me, and I'm unsure of how to proceed, I can't accept her talking to this guy and sitting down and watching films with him etc. Please help

On the night she leaves, she will be going out to her favorite club. Recently she posted about the club on her Instagram story, and the ex-situationship screenshotted the post and sent it to her guy friend, then insinuated that this was his “chance.”

My gf told me about this and asked me what she should do. When I suggested she give him the cold shoulder or tell him to “fuck off”, she stated that she would prefer to be polite, make small talk, and disengage. She argued that she didn’t want to be “mean” and that he wasn’t being “mean” to her. This was disturbing to me given the setting, her clear awareness of his intent, and the fact that he knows she is in a relationship. She eventually agreed to be confrontational with him, but I am very bothered by the fact that her natural response was so agreeable and I wonder why this is the case given her very confrontational personality.

He is a generous and kind man, who works hard, and wants me to have everything I want. He is very affectionate and concerned about my happiness, which he talks about often. He is also currently paying all the rent and most of the bills while I am between jobs. He takes care of me, wants to share chores and cook for me. He is patient with my untidiness and untidy brain. He is the perfect person to live with I try not to take advantage of him.

We met working on a ship and when covid hit, he remained onboard as an essential position but my position was non essential so I was sent home and eventually found another job. Last year, one month after proposing to me he started an affair with another crew member. The physical affair lasted until he disembarked (for 3 months), but they kept in contact (did not see eachother again) and remained in a very serious relationship/affair for another 8 months. During this time he would not let me travel to see him or vice versa. He said he was too stressed with an application for a landbased job which he was applying for at the time. One month before he told me about the affair, after an intense chat he reluctantly agreed for me to visit and while I was staying with him, he found a land-based job in my country.

4ish days after moving over here, he told me he had been cheating on me. He seemed genuinely distraught, telling me he was mentally sick, begging for a second chance, although initially he was not honest about the details, but I found a way to contact her and heard it all from her. Eventually he told me the truth. After a couple of days I decided to give him a 2nd chance, because I really believed he was sick and wanted to help him get better and bar those 11 months had usually treated me very well. The first few months were horrific and I almost ended it twice, but eventually we found a couples therapist and have been slowly getting better. It's also worth noting that the job he now holds is incredibly high stress, sometimes he will work long days in high pressure scenarios for weeks straight with 0 days off.

Initially, before finding the therapist, I rarely got a good response from him when I was feeling triggered (which was often); usually very defensive and not understanding. Through therapy that began to change to a much calmer, more understanding, loving and compassionate response. Recently though, I have felt that the response I get from him when I am feeling triggered is a 50/50 chance between these two.

With the background covered, the situation I need guidance on is this:

He is currently out of the country for work. Yesterday he was travelling and had a hugely stressful day. We had a lovely chat over facetime, I was feeling tearful and missing him a lot. After we hung up, we have a little goodnight ritual, part of which is that we send eachother a string of emoji (the same ones every night). In his though, he included 🍆, which is not one we usually use. (Jsyk 🍆 is a dick).
And at first I thought ""oh we're including that now ok"",  But before I could say anything he's like ""Oops I sent by mistake 😂""  and told me that its in his recently used, even though we never send that to eachother. My immediate thoughts were... why is it there,  who are you sending it to that isn't me?! So I messaged him saying ""I'm sorry this makes me nervous"", to which he replied ""don't start a drama where there isn't one"", ""please"", ""please"", ""please"", ""I can't do this"" and the immediately called me, when an argument ensued. He was very defensive, upset and honestly it reminded me of the arguments we had last year before I knew he was cheating on me, which made me worried he has a guilty conscience again.

Not to get into the argument, but considering our history, both the fact that this emoji is in his recently used but not to me, and his reaction are making me very nervous. I feel like I ignored the signs he was cheating for 11 months last year and I absolutely don't want to make that mistake again, but I also know this could be literally nothing. 

FYI my fiance read and approved before I posted this.

If you cba to read the whole thing, a quick summary for you: My fiance cheated on me for 11 months last year. We're in therapy and doing our best.

She is a full time student and stays on campus, I work full time and rent a room at a house. 

My lease is up Dec 31. Due to some severe issues with my roommates, I refuse to resign my lease at my current place. My landlord is also only willing to sign another year lease, so I don’t have much choice but to get out the end of the year. My girlfriend has until next June before she needs a place to stay. 

The issue stems with my girlfriend not being able to drive. She has a car at her parents the next state over (only an hour) but does not have her full blown license, and is scared of most driving anyways.

This really limits us to pretty close to her school, so she can use public transit. Her school is downtown in the biggest city in the state, and me coming from a town of 150 I don’t want to live in a city bigger than my current one (60k). Other semi close places require the highway, which my girlfriend straight out refuses to drive on. She’s willing to drive at most 20 min, but is scared of the highway (required in my area), and doesn’t really want to drive to commute until she has her full license. 

How can I help “push” her towards driving? Her main issue is confidence in her driving, and the fear of other people on the road. She won’t drive my car since it’s a manual, and having to drive 60 miles one way to drive her car is killing my wallet (she does not work.)

Another issue is her not being able to work right now unless it’s remote (her field has a lot of remote work, but she hasn’t found anything), I take her to a job, or she figures out commuting (she hasn’t found a “normal” job in the area that wouldn’t need a car to get to)

As it stands it seems my plans are

1. Bite the bullet and move in to the big city, let her bus to school. I don’t want to live in the city and we both have hangups with her being alone commuting in the city. This also leaves the issue still of her getting a job

2. Resign my lease, which I really don’t want to do.  

3. Help her get driving, and get a more suburban place. But this seems to not be able to get done before Dec 31 

4. Find a roomate or get a place by myself.

And recently her inability to clean up shit has been driving me crazy.
I do most of the housework, like I would say 85:15. She’s in school, so I try to clean up as much as I can. That’s fine. I took that upon myself. 
But one thing that has bothered me over our relationship is that when it comes to cleaning up pet poop she completely taps out. She came into the relationship with a dog, who I loved from the beginning. My wife let me know that she “doesn’t do poop.” And that her last partner dealt with cleaning up the dog poop in the yard. I let her know from the get-go that I was not cool with that and that I needed her help. I even got her a long-ass pooper scooper so she didn’t have to be around it but could still help out. But she has never helped with the task willingly. If I ask her to help she will spend five minutes loudly gagging, doing minimal pickup, until she comes in and tells me she just can’t help. 
You see, I also don’t like picking up poop. The smell of poop makes me nauseous but I dissociate or do whatever I have to do to clean up the mess. It has been frustrating but I have gotten past it because I’m not sure if I’m justified in being upset.
Our dog is getting older and occasionally will have accidents when we leave her at home. These occurrences are happening more often. Most of the time when I leave her there I make sure she uses the restroom before I go so we can avoid accidents. I have pushed for my wife to do the same but she has said she forgets to do so. 
Multiple times in the last week the dog has had accidents. A couple of days ago the dog had a poop explosion situation after my wife didn’t take her out and I spent two hours scrubbing the walls, floor, and crate. Yesterday my wife called to tell me that she left the dog at home, the dog shit, and our robot vacuum went over the poop and spread it everywhere. I was upset but she told me she would clean up the mess so I didn’t worry about it too much. This morning on my way home after a busy 24-hour shift she called to let me know she couldn’t clean the mess all the way and that she needed me to clean the rest of it. I was so upset. I was already exhausted and now I had to come home to this. 
I’ve had multiple conversations with her about this sort of thing but I’m becoming resentful.

She talks a lot and is annoying but in a good way. She actually wants me to talk to her and I feel like she could make me a better person. I think I've grown to like her and would love to date her but she's been down recently since her boyfriend just recently broke up with her and her dog passed away.

I'd like to date her but idk how to go about doing that when I'm socially awkward but at the same time she understands why I am. Even if I knew how to pursue her I don't know if it's the right time because she's been sad and she just got out of a relationship. Also I've never dated before. She said things like “you could pull girls” but I said I'm too ugly for that type of thing but she said I'm not ugly. When I got put in a group with her in class she kept trying to get my attention but everytime I talk to her I have this dumb nervous “about to laugh” looking grin on my face.

Met &amp; had a wonderful time. I stayed the night. Talked on the phone for the next 3 days, then he texted ""*I love you. And I would marry you. You are my one.*"" while drunk. 

&amp;#x200B;

I matched with the guy on Tinder nearly two weeks ago. We started messaging immediately and moved to talking on the phone the same night. We talked on the phone every day for hours. We even joked that it was like middle school because we would talk into the night even as we were getting tired. We have a lot in common, he seems very sweet and very genuine, and I've been actively looking for red flags but did not find any. (We've talked about flaws. We both have them. I can identify some of the things that will likely annoy me in the future, but nothing I can't live with.)

  
He and I are both in the divorce process and our divorces should be finalized around the same time in \~6 weeks. We've been open about our past relationships and what we want in the future. He's been living on his own for over a year and he has had at least one relationship that I know of in that time and has been actively dating.   
He's shared things with me that he said he usually doesn't talk about but felt comfortable with me.   
The condensed version is that his marriage ended after the loss of a child. I share this because I think it is relevant.   


After a week of long phone calls we met irl and had an amazing time. I stayed the night with him and everything was great. It was that actual ""I feel like I've known you"" feeling.   
The next morning, while he was down my throat, he said, ""Oh my god, I love you."" But I didn't think anything of it given the situation. (It happens. lol)  


It's been 3 days since and we've again been talking on the phone for hours. I've been sick so we couldn't see each other again and now he is out of town for work for the remainder of the week.   


Last night he called from a bar to check in and see how I was feeling. He told me he would tab out and head back to his room so we could talk. I encouraged him to stay and have fun. He is with a couple of coworkers and his company is paying so might as well make the most of it.   
About an hour later he texted and he was drunk. (totally fine with) He told me he would call when he got back to his room and we could talk if I was awake. Two and half hours after that he called, but I was asleep.   
Then he texted, ""I love you. And I would marry you."" then ""You are my one.""   


This morning I just texted to ask how he was feeling. I was hoping he would say ""hungover"" or ""embarrassed"" or literally anything to try to walk that back, but he didn't.   


I don't have a problem with us being in two different places, but I can't tell if this is love bombing, a not unusual thing for the amount of time we've talked and our age (his more specifically), or something else.   


Some things to consider:   
\- he was understanding when I said I didn't want to make things official too quickly  
\- he hasn't said anything about me not responding to his texts  
\- he hasn't made me feel pressured or overwhelmed in any way other than those texts being overwhelming  


\- We have kids around the same age and he has told me I am welcome to come over when his kid is with him (he has 50/50 custody) and that also seems too fast. I don't want to come and go from a kid's life. I have no plans to introduce anyone to my kids any time soon (he knows this and is ok with it).  
\- He's talked about maybe wanting to have another child. I think this stems from the loss (he brought it up right after telling me) and I think in part that may be pushing him to speed up his timeline. I think he may be viewing time as a constraint on his ability to have another child.

We would talk a lot everyday and hang out most of the week then all of the sudden he became very distant and started ignoring me from Saturday - Monday. I felt horrible this whole past weekend and had intense anxiety to the point I felt sick because I thought I screwed up or that there was something wrong with me. Im not a clingy person but when it went from talking a lot everyday to dead silence, it freaked me out. I thought he was mad at me so I texted him Monday night and he didn’t respond to me until yesterday afternoon. He said he wasn’t mad and I asked if we could talk and fix things because something felt off. I told him we could talk around 6:30 and when the that time rolled around he said he was doing work and he would come over afterwards. Then his friend snap chatted me a picture of him playing poker. Then my roommate asked me if I wanted to go down to get food with her and I ended up seeing him in line (I’m in college). I waited 3 hours for him to come over. He said he was sorry and that he’ll come over after that. He said he realized over the weekend that he was too emotionally attached to me and that he still liked me but not like that. He also said that he wanted space to think things over. I told him though if he doesn’t know what he wants after thanksgiving break i’m not waiting for him and Im moving on. He said he still wants to be friends and still text which i’m down for but I told him not at the moment because I need space. 

Now i’m still a little upset (bc it just happened yesterday and I still have some feelings for him) but if anything i’m more confused. He was the one who liked me first and was the one who initiated us becoming a thing. He would always text me and ask to hang out. When he asked to be a thing I told him we needed to take it slow because of what I’ve been through and he agreed. I was not being clingy or putting pressure on him at all to move things further. Now all of the sudden within 4 days he doesn’t want to be anything/doesn’t have feelings for me anymore? Yet he’s still emotionally attached? Is he just scared or is there another girl in the picture? The way he explained it all is so confusing. There was one time when we were hooking up and all of the sudden he just blurted out “I love you” then immediately took it back and didn’t know why he said that so I think he’s telling me the truth (mind you this is just two weeks into us being a thing).

I'm expecting to be pregnant again soon and I don't want to tell them until we announce publicly, but that would place a strain on my husband's relationship with them. What do I do?

My husband and I have been doing fertility treatments for the last 5 years. Getting pregnant isn't easy for me and I tend to miscarry pretty early on. As a result, I’m very tight-lipped about my pregnancies, but MIL is generally a great person so we've always shared our struggles with her. 

Recently, we had a pregnancy that was going really well for the first couple months. By 17 weeks, we really thought we were in the clear. We let MIL know that we were planning on announcing publicly at 20 weeks, and she agreed that that was reasonable. 

Not 2 hours later, she spilled the beans right in front of us. Just mentioned it in conversation at a family dinner like it was common knowledge. I was livid that she would take away our chance to announce our own pregnancy. 

I was even more livid when MIL and FIL told me everyone was going to find out eventually anyway, so it's no big deal. 

I stormed out of their house and my husband made it very clear to them that they fucked up bad and needed to apologize to me. 

Still, weeks went by with no apology. Then, the very day we were about to post it on Facebook, we found out that we had to terminate the pregnancy for medical reasons. The termination took days and was incredibly traumatic for both of us. 

When my husband told them about the termination, they suddenly understood why I was so hesitant to announce in the first place. They realized how badly they fucked up and swore to never do anything like that again. 

But since then, my in laws haven't reached out to me directly. Not even a quick text to say they're sorry for my loss or ask how I'm doing. Certainly not an apology for announcing the pregnancy. My husband speaks to them regularly and says they always ask about me, but aside from a few short ""happy birthday"" texts, they haven't reached out to me at all. 

I haven't pressed the issue with my husband much. His parents are generally good people, and I know their relationship means a lot to him. I don't want to put him in the middle. Even if he should be picking my side, I don't want to perpetuate a situation where he has to choose sides at all. 

Now onto the part where I need advice...

I'm doing another round of IVF soon, which we're expecting will lead to a (hopefully viable) pregnancy. I really don't want to tell them anything at all this time around. I’m still really hurt by their actions. Having to un-tell people that we’re having a baby was devastating. I don’t want to risk it happening again. 

But I’m sure my husband will want to tell them what’s going on, and I'm worried that it might be unreasonable to ask him not share *anything* with them moving forward. 

Tbh, I don't think they even realize how much they hurt me. I've been skipping family dinners for months now, but I don’t think they realize I’m avoiding them specifically. They probably think I’m just not up to seeing people yet. 

I'm anxious about the holidays will go. I'll be in quarantine for Thanksgiving due to IVF, but they'll definitely be expecting to come to their house for Christmas. I’m definitely not going to their house until they apologize or reach out to me in some way. 

And even if I don't go to Christmas, what do I do when they send over gifts for me? Act like nothing’s wrong and thank them? Send them back with a note that I'm still waiting for an apology? Ignore them altogether? 

The whole situation just sucks. I don't want to put my husband in an uncomfortable position with either of us. MIL has been a great support for him over the years, and I don't want to take that away from him. He deserves to be able to share his struggles with the people he cares about. 

So do I just continue waiting for an apology that will never come? Press the issue and make him confront them again? Let him tell them whatever he wants and pretend that I’m not ridiculously hurt by all of this?

I’ve known Lia and Liam since high school and kept in contact since then. As a couple, they have been together for years. I’ve been with Seth for years. Ana and Andrew have been together for a year and we just started hanging out with them for a couple of months.

Andrew was an old friend of Liam from high school. I also when to school with Andrew but we had a falling out because I was friends with a girl he was seeing and that ended so I ended contact with him as well.

We all hangout once a week, unless we are busy, to eat and play games and talk. A lot of the time we see Andrew being very controlling over Ana. Like talking over her/controlling the conversation, making sure she’s not sitting next to my and lia’s boyfriends, even when Lia and I try to incorporate Ana into our girl group convos he’ll interrupt and insert himself which Lia and I don’t like. 

There was also a situation we’re both Ana and Andrew would ask Lia for relationship advice but to not tell anyone even her boyfriend about what they tell her. I didn’t really have a problem with that until they were being really obvious and secretive about things and would pull lia into another room to talk. It just felt uncomfortable and lia said she felt awkward that they only came to her and she had to hold all their secrets when she had her own things to deal with. One night, Andrew blurted out a secret Ana was gonna tell me to include me and he said he did that cause he didn’t trust me.

We complained to Liam about this and how we don’t like how controlling Andrew is but he said that he thinks Andrew has a communication problem (maybe something undiagnosed) and that makes him come across the way he does. We talked to Ana to tell her how we feel because we like her and when Lia and I are alone with her she seems confident and headstrong and will tell it like it is. So we told her how we felt about Andrew and she said she would talk to him and the the undiagnosed think is probably true. I thought she’d talk to him about his controlling behaviour but instead she told him that I don’t like him (even though Lia said the same things I did).

This ended up causing issues where I had to talk to him myself even though I didn’t want to. We were mostly talking about how I felt excluded when they would be secretive with only lia and how I felt that he said I wouldn’t be able to hold a secret. He basically said who he wants to tell his secrets to is his thing and that he doesn’t need to include me but he’s sorry it came out that way. I kinda just shutdown after that and just nodded knowing whatever I say won’t solve anything.

After Lia and I started unintentionally distancing ourselves because of holidays and work. I ended up having my birthday were Lia organized it and she asked me who I wanted there and I said I didn’t want Andrew cause he’ll try to control the whole weekend and Lia agreed. But we invited Ana to a girls mall day on a weekday.

We ended up having my birthday weekend and without thinking we posted the whole weekend. We ended up being really tired because we had to drive very far that next day so we ended up canceling with Ana. Ana then said that she sad she wasn’t invited and she hoped we had fun which made me feel really guilty. But we didn’t wanna go cause we were tired and the weekend took most of our money. I told her we can do a different day and that Lia wouldn’t be able to join us cause she has other commitments but she didn’t text me back yet so. ? 

I don’t know how to navigate this friendship with them. I really don’t like drama or being inserted into it and I feel like they are but I’m in a weird situation because Andrew is Liam’s friend so I feel awkward.

He said it's believed that m isogny is far more common than m isandry, across the world and throughout history. And he said everybody you ask will say M uslim countries (like I ran) hate women, and that's billions of men.

He said women have always liked men more through time and across the world too.

He said men who hate women hate them for personal reasons. They see women as i nferior, l esser, i ncapable, u nfunny, etc etc.

And he said women who hate men hate them as backlash against m isogny, not because they see men as i nferior, etc.

He said traditional roles for men and women are not seen as different but equal, and instead most people these days say housewives are housewives because men think women are not c apable and are i nferior. They don't say housewives raise families, they say that they are o ppressed.

He said take s ex with women away and these men prefer men in every way. But take s ex with men away from women and they have many things that they still like about men.

He said many people say that men o bjectify women and think they own them or women exist in relation to men, but nobody really says that women reduce men to o bjects.

He said therefore women accept more about men than men do about women and he said f eminists complain about how bad it is to be a s traight woman and how they are helpless because of this. They complain about how bad men are and still want them. They are happy to find the needle in the haystack.

He said women are believed to treat men better than men treat women, respect them more and to also put up with a lot more.

He says it's widely believed that women hate each other, get catty, bitchy, cliquey, jealous, backstab, two faced, drag down other women, compete for men and say ""I'm not like other girls"" or try to be a ""cool girl"" and put other women down while it's also widely believed that men form deeper bonds and connections, friendships, camaraderie and bromances.

He said it's widely believed that women want male friends ""guys are less drama"" etc and g ay b ffs more than men want female friends and lesbian b ffs. Men who cannot get women to have s ex with them complain that they are in the friendzone.""

He said women are also therefore more s traight than men. But that nobody questions how s traight s exist men truly are. Meanwhile women who h ate men &amp; f eminists...are often called l esbians.

He also said look at how much teenage girls worship boys, boybands and talk in diaries and with friends about boys they have crushes on. He said meanwhile teenage boys aren't into girlbands or talking about girls. In fact fathers warn their daughters that boys that age only want one thing. He said teenage boys often have to outgrow their immature anti girls views and only want girls for s ex.

He said therefore women accept more about men than men do about women and he said f eminists complain about how bad it is to be a s traight woman and how they are helpless because of this. They complain about how bad men are and still want them. They are happy to find the needle in the haystack.

He said women are believed to treat men better than men treat women, respect them more and to also put up with a lot more.

He says it's widely believed that women hate each other, get catty, bitchy, cliquey, jealous, backstab, two faced, drag down other women, compete for men and say ""I'm not like other girls"" or try to be a ""cool girl"" and put other women down while it's also widely believed that men form deeper bonds and connections, friendships, camaraderie and bromances.

He said it's widely believed that women want male friends ""guys are less drama"" etc and g ay b ffs more than men want female friends and lesbian b ffs. Men who cannot get women to have s ex with them complain that they are in the friendzone.""

He said women are also therefore more s traight than men. But that nobody questions how s traight s exist men truly are. Meanwhile women who h ate men &amp; f eminists...are often called l esbians.

He also said look at how much teenage girls worship boys, boybands and talk in diaries and with friends about boys they have crushes on. He said meanwhile teenage boys aren't into girlbands or talking about girls. In fact fathers warn their daughters that boys that age only want one thing. He said teenage boys often have to outgrow their immature anti girls views and only want girls for s ex.

Is he right?

I have been with my(23f) boyf(23m) for nearly five years. When we first started dating he would kiss me randomly or “make out” for long periods of time as well as constant intimacy. Now he goes days or weeks without purposely touching me (in any way) or if we kiss it’s for the minimal amount of time possible. We rarely have sex (Can be months) or if we do he seems uninterested and eager to get it over with. I’ve stopped initiating anything because it makes me feel like shit to get rejected every time (don’t get me wrong I respect boundaries and I don’t expect anything) but getting an “ew” thrown at you when you’re trying, really fucks your self esteem. 
I have tried to speak to him many times about it but I get the same response that it’s sensory issues or that it’s affecting him too… But it wasn’t an issue when we first started dating which is what I’m struggling with, his reasoning just doesn’t seem truthful my minds going everywhere.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7564956,public,self,"My boyfriend gets “overstimulated” by any intimacy that’s not for his comfort, do I just try and get over it?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywzvui/my_boyfriend_gets_overstimulated_by_any_intimacy/,all_ads,6

I (18NB) am not that close to my mum. We never have been. In march 2021 we moved so she can be closer to my brother, sister In law and nephew. 
 
In August of 2021 she started to date this guy, they got engaged barely 2 weeks later. During this time we were living in a caravan on my brother's drive.
 

 
During the September of 2021 we found a flat and we decorated. I moved in pretty much as soon as my room was complete.. My mum stays with her partner 100% of the time. The only time she stayed with me in the flat she pays for, was when her ex boyfriend was here and they stayed together. And at Christmas because my grandparents were down too. 
 
I appreciate and love my mum but she makes me uncomfortable when she comes around. I don't like being around her. She made it clear that she chose her partner over her own kids. 

But when I came out as non binary she was extremely against it and would dead name me. However she is now not dead naming me but she will still use the wrong pronouns and roll her eyes when I correct her.

Thanks for sticking around if you’re still here. 
So we just came back from a lovely trip, and I wanted to send myself photos he took from his phone. We have each other’s faces on the phones, we don’t care about going on each other’s phones. But we never do anything super privacy invading. This time though I crossed a line. I went into his notes app where he writes down his thoughts and I read the most recent one. Among other things, he writes about how he still wants to be with other women, how he thinks about wanting others, etc. he also wrote about a time when he got high, and felt really lustful for someone else (a stranger he saw at the front door of our building). I talked to him about this right after I read it, admitting my wrongdoing. He said that he just writes that stuff down so that he can process it alone and put his best foot forward for me.  That seems reasonable, fine I let it slide. But it is still gnawing at me because of our history. 
It gets worse. A few days later I’m still feeling bad about things so I read his physical journal. In it, he writes a love letter to girl Z. It doesn’t say her name, but it talks about her (it is very evidently about her and he confessed to it being about her). He talks about how he misses her presence, how he feels empty without her, how he feels lost, etc. In the same entry he also writes about how he misses his childhood and becoming an adult is hard and it’s all meshed together. Then he talks about me, how excited he is to be with me and how much he loves me. 
Ive talked to him about this, once again confessing to my new wrongdoing, and told him that I hate the way I have become. I hate that I’ve invaded his privacy so many times, I hate that I’ve become so insecure, I hate that I’ve been so unkind to my own body and self esteem. He told me that those are just thoughts that he’s processing, that although he’s imperfect in his thinking, this time around he’s never done anything to act on his thoughts. He said that his journal entry about Z can be interpreted as him missing his childhood, and not about missing her, that he is also just writing fiction for the sake of exploring an emotion. 
So I am conflicted. He has been good to me this time around, and I love him I think (unsure if I love him or if I’m just attached or obsessed, I have ASD and ADHD so it’s hard to trust my frontal lobe) and I’m having a hard time deciding if I should stay or not. 
I have a gnawing feeling that I’ll always feel this way, like I’ll never be enough, like he will always want something other than me. He promises he won’t, he’s only loving me and will only love me, etc. 
i think I would have a good life with him, but can also have a good one without him, just different. 

What do I do? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend loves me but has a tendency to think about wanting to be with other women, has written about his desires but has also treated me respectfully and well and I don’t know what to do.

Things are generally good, he is very loving and a good man over all, but there are some issues that keep gnawing at me and I’d like some perspective from others. 
Bear with me, this is a long story as it does span a decade. 

We started dating in high school when we were 16/17, I was in the year before last year and he was in his last year. We started out as friends and connected really well. We were headed in the direction of a relationship, and then he made out with someone at a party (call her X, she will come back in the story). A week later, he asked me out and although I felt uncomfortable with the whole situation I agreed to it because I already liked him so much. Throughout that relationship (lasted like 7months) there were blips where he’d be a little too interested in other girl friends (call them A, B and C) of his that made me uncomfortable. He never did anything, but when we would fight or weren’t in a good spot, he found a lot of relief talking to these girls who, in my opinion, were flirting with him. We broke up when he was in first year undergrad and I was still in my last year of high school largely because he was wanting to explore life (and other girls) and I was not happy with the way that unfolded. 

We half-ass stayed friends the next few years, although he says he always considered me a dear friend to whom he’d turn to for emotional support, whereas I just thought of him as an acquaintance from the past. He actually tried dating girl X at some point in university but after a brief period of them talking, turned him down. He also made out with A at some point when he went on a date with her. He also was interested and tried dating some other girls. 

Then a few years later, he tried dating me again. We were on a certain path, but while travelling, he actually ended up going on a date and making out with B (they just happened to be in the same city, not prearranged). He told me about it after in attempt to be transparent, and I told him that due to our past, I am uneasy knowing that he is still someone who deviates in thoughts and actions from devotion to me. So we stopped talking, he started dating someone else after that, and then eventually we resumed chit chat. 

A few years later he tried again with me. This time he was pretty serious and really put in the effort. Now another significant piece is that when he was in junior high/ most of high school/ some of undergrad, he was pining after this girl Z. I knew that he always liked her and he considers her his first love (not me). He told me he reached out to her to cut off contact because although he said he didn’t feel that way about her anymore, he wanted a clean slate before trying to be serious with me. This time, things didn’t work out because I was not interested in the kind of life he wanted (he wanted kids, I didn’t). 

We moved on with our lives, I dated someone else and so did he. Now this time around, we rekindled things from a pretty serious standpoint. I told him that I was willing to have children, but I needed to be logistically secure before I could (enough income to care for the children so that the rest of our lives could still be comfortable, enough support so that our lives are not only about our children, enough support so that our careers are still prioritized, you get the gist). This allowed him to think about me the way he wanted to, he said he was holding back because he knew we didn’t want the same things. So now he’s trying full force, he tells me all the things about how he’s changed and he has no desire to date other women now and girls XZABC are all in the past. Things are great, we love each other and have made big plans for big dreams and so on. I then realize that when it comes to this guy, I am very insecure. I feel that I’m not pretty enough, I’m not smart enough, I’m not enough to keep him interested in only me and not others. Normally I’m not like this, I am very confident and have this ‘what is for me will stay with me, and what isn’t for me will leave me as it should’ kind of attitude. So I am on edge, looking at him when we’re out to see if he’s looking at the surroundings or the other pretty women. I’m anxious about what he writes in his journal and so on.

We hit it off and started going out, everything was platonic at the start but then things started to escalate from there till she told me weeks through our relationship that she is actually married. Truth be told, it was weird that she said so after so long but she never said she was single either. Her husband lives overseas and she lives in my town now to finish her masters degree.

Also, whenever she would travel to visit her husband she would go AWOL and shut off all sorts of communication for months at a time. Which in retrospect, seems like a HUGE red flag if I were to pursue a relationship with this woman.

Morally speaking, I would never dabble into another man's family as I would not want that happening to me. I am a strong believer in karma and I know that wrecking houses is one of the worst things a human-being could possibly do. I came from a broken home because my father was a huge cheater.

A few months pass and I start to actually like the girl. I was in denial about it but it crept up on me by surprise. I asked some of my friends and they told me to open up to her about the entire thing and take your leave.

So, I heard through another friend that my friend doesn't like my boyfriend. She's only met him a few times and can be rather sensitive. My boyfriend had never met her boyfriend and when we met up with her at a bar, she was sitting by another guy around our age. He (my bf) later asked her if that guy sitting by her was Will (her bf). The guy sitting next to her at the time (turns out it was a family friend) was not the most attractive guy, so she felt very offended that my boyfriend could even think that this guy was her boyfriend. My boyfriend felt a bit uncomfortable about her getting upset and just explained that he didn't know what Will looked like etc and just was curious if that was him. Then, he started asking how she knew this other guy to kind of divert the topic. She started talking again about how much she couldn't believe he thought she would date someone like him and he asked again where she knew him from and she accused him of ""cutting her off"", although he really was just asking a question. After this happened and she headed home, she called our other friend and said how he offended her badly and then proceeded to cut her off after doing so. Other than this incident, everything else was completely fine and I believe this was an honest mistake that I personally don't see why she was so offended by. Am I missing something? Is this a reasonable situation to be upset at someone for?

I also think it would be possible to salvage this situation if just a few things were very slightly different, but they are as they are and I think maybe it’s gone on long enough. There’s a lot to unpack here so this will be long and rambling, but any advice, help, support, or encouragement from anyone who reads to the end would be appreciated beyond measure.

We’ve been together 8 years - since we were 21. It feels like a lifetime. Our entire adulthood. We met through mutual friends and we were both in strange spots in our lives. I’ll admit I was pretty desperate for support and a connection at that time due to some other life circumstances, but I found it unbelievably organically in her. It took no time at all for me to be sure we had something unique between us. She quickly became my best friend and maybe I put too much pressure on her with how much I let her be there for me.

We started living together a couple of years ago, still (I believed) a relatively strong couple. We had had a few major bumps in the form of less-certain-than-ideal conversations about whether this relationship was still what we wanted, but nothing that I thought was out of the realm of natural variations in a romantic bond.

A month or two before our seventh anniversary, six months or so after moving in together, a complicated situation with someone else led to her hand being forced into admitting to me that she had drunkenly slept with a “mutual friend” nearly five years prior. I was devastated, but the reaction was complex. How could I let a situation so far in the past determine our lives now? 

I chose to try and work past it with her. She insisted it was only the one time and that she isn’t a person who would make that choice today. I believed her. I think I still believe her. She cut the friend off after telling me and neither of us have spoken to him since.

Since that time, she has quit her job to work on her mental health and try and focus on starting a business from home. I was fine with this - I made just enough to support both of us and would be working regardless. If that was what she needed, I supported her and we could scrape by if need be. She told me she wanted a year and she would start looking for at least part-time employment to help with bills. 

She doesn’t regularly put work into her home business while I’m at work. She mostly sleeps and watches TV and YouTube. I view being content to live like this and lacking motivation as likely stemming from depression, but she can’t afford to get help for her mental health without a regular source of income, and I can’t afford to get mental health help for her while continuing to support the two of us. I’ve offered couples counseling for the two of us. She’s refused, saying she doesn’t feel it would be fair for her to be in couples counseling before her own individual therapy.

The house chores continue to pile up. We *do* work on them, but mostly only together after I get off work for the evening. She tells me often that I don’t pull my weight, but I feel that because I’m often working on chores simultaneously with her or initiating regular chores in addition to my job, it might be okay for there to be a slight imbalance in how much we contribute to the house. She does make dinner regularly, but I do try to help and she tells me I’m ungrateful for this when I dispute the imbalance.

She’s gotten increasingly controlling, recently demanding I block the phone numbers of female coworkers on my cell phone and going through my Reddit and message history on one occasion. She’s demanded explanations for who people are in photos, tells me she doesn’t want to hear about my conversations at work, and sometimes text-bombs me while I’m at social events to keep my focus away from what I’m trying to do.

She blows up small perceived slights into full days-spanning arguments. Little miscommunications or tonal misunderstandings become emblems of my deep disrespect for her as an individual.

I recently did something stupid - admittedly - I guess as a way to try and feel like I still had something for myself. I didn’t physically touch anyone or get romantically involved, but I knew it was crossing a boundary. This was after the suspicion had already been put upon me. 

I almost feel like she’s trying to get me to walk away. Feeling like I’ve damaged the trust makes me feel like giving up hope.

Met in college in pretty much the most ordinary way college kids meet. Day party, mutual friend played cupid, rest is history. . 

I guess I will preface by saying she is pretty amazing...as a girlfriend. She is so sweet, compassionate, supportive of everything I do or feel even if she doesn't agree with it, loyal, always down for anything, beautiful, and I could go on.

So wtf is the problem? 

The one really big thing (and I am going to try put this as delicately as possible without sounding like a complete A-hole) she is not the most interesting person( I suspect it could just be to me). She doesn't really have hobbies, she says she wants them but doesn't put time into finding an interest, and I have tried to tried to initiate conversation about certain topic that I may or even may not necessarily be interested in and she will only scratch the surface before kind of just changing the subject/going back to tiktok (yes this also gets on my nerves, but I know it can be addictive)She's a huge romantic, which is cool, but like that's the only thing I've ever heard her talk about with true passion and hunger to ""find out more"". She doesn't have that innate ""curiosity"" for other things that I kind of do and she doesn't really care to dive into something deeper unless is related to romance, or dogs. I have even recommended maybe opening a business to groom dogs, shelter, etc and I was quite taken aback when she shut it down almost immediately, but I get it, that can be scary. 

Because of this, our conversations suffer, they are pretty dull and really lack substance to the point where sometimes I kind of just sigh and roll my eyes at her lack of enthusiasm for somethings. And she really tries too! We have spoke about this, but after 5 years, but I kind have come to the conclusion that, that's kind of just not who she is. 

Another good example is I'm really into cooking, she likes to eat as much as the next guys but realistically doesn't care about the food in front of her as long as it doesn't make her gag although I have slowly transitioned her from someone with only having a taste for cream cheese bagels and chicken tendies but I choose the restaurant 100% of the time because she could not care less as long as it isn't tooo exotic. She (kind of) wants to progress professionally, but doesn't care enough to take the step in doing research, asking question on what can give her an edge. She recently started working out but only sometimes and doesn't care enough to do at least a bit of light research on, proper nutrition or form in the gym. Someone says a word she's never heard of, she never googles it... (this especially gets to me for some reason) . I don't care what the hobby is, I just want her to WANT to learn more about the intricate nuances of something. I not saying this is wrong of her, this is just something I wish I had in a partner though because i feel like that is what leads to fulfilling discussion.

 I start talking about something she might be more interested in, something pop culture related and its the same thing. 

The problem is she is so amazing in every other way, and I know the conversation point might sound trivial but man does it make me feel alone and sometimes I worry if years down the road when we don't have as many friends, will I just be speaking to myself?

We Went on a short break a year ago and had many conversations with friends with from reflecting on the relationship and I learned that the general consensus is that, without saying it outright, they think I can do better. Basically, they like her kind of, thinks she's really nice, and obviously a great gf but also that she can be obnoxious (she can be sometimes), uninteresting. My parents think despite my feeling about this, she is great for me and I likely wont find anyone else that sort of lives up to par. In a sense, they are kind of right statistically speaking, and based on an experience I had with another girl I was talking to on our break. She was exactly what I wanted in terms of interested and amazing with conversations, but she just had to much baggage in her life, and was just a bit to unconventional for me. That's when I realized my original gf was the one for me, we get back together and things are even better than before, we communicate and fight less but Id be lying if I said our relationship didn't still lack substance. I'm not unhappy with her, I love her and would do anything, but this kills me inside, to the point of me not being 100% certain she's ""the one"". She is aware of this and is actively trying to take an interest in more things and ask more questions/be more curious (another reason why she's is so great). Problem is I can tell its not at the core of who she is and I feel guilty for her trying to change that. 

**Does that mean I should leave her?** 

**Am I wasting her time by giving her a chance to grow in that aspect?**

Obviously I would prefer the latter, I'm not unhappy with her, and I love her and can see a future with her but this does bother to a notable degree at times. 

TL;DR

I love my GF to death, she is basically everything you can ask for in a significant other, but our relationship lacks substance. She lacks a certain curiosity for life to learn about new things, that are valuable or completely random that I sort of value a lot in a relationship. She is kind of just: Target, dogs, romance and that's it. She doesn't care about much else or have any hobbies. My Friends like her but think I can do better, parents understand my feelings but warn me I likely will not find a good of a girlfriend as great as her even if they are a bit more interesting. We have talked about this and she is trying really hard change that, but I'm starting to realize it is just not who she is. I don't want to leave her but does this mean I should?

We have been together for over 6 years and want to get married within the next year. He’s very careful with his money. If he wants something, he will wait a month or a few weeks to buy it. Can be something simple as a pair of jeans. Or something bigger like a computer part. 

Yet he struggles with money often. He makes about $2,400 a month working 4 days a week in construction. He pays I believe $200 rent, maybe a little more now because he said he would his dad more. He helps pay for bills and groceries. We “share” a car. Even though I don’t even drive. I’m scared to especially after we got in a bad car accident once where the other car crashed solely on my side. I use to pay for the insurance which was $285. I told him it made me feel bad paying for it when I’m not even the one driving it. He sympathized with me and said he would pay it. He does the car payment as well which is $514. 

Many times through ought the year he will ask if I can help with something such as the tags for the car, or half the insurance, or if I can buy him a video game. I see him struggling often. He says what kills him most is gas and that he isn’t spending it on useless things which I believe because he really doesn’t he’s so picky with that. 

I told him I’m scared of the future because I don’t see him able to afford to be giving for rent if he’s struggling like this only paying $200 rent. He said that it’s only this time because he needed to pay for the car tags for both cars which was about $560, one of the cars had gotten impounded because he parked when they were going to work on the road so that was another $300, he had bought a phone and the payment was $250, he needs to get a smog check done, etc… but I told him this isn’t the first time I see him struggling. 

He asked me to be patient with him and have some faith in him. He also said that he really doesn’t need to hear this from me right now, for me to say he can’t do something (afford living together). I told him that I’m still scared. He said he understands me. I told him that he wants to save money but yet only works 4 days instead of 5 days. That he would probably do better if he worked the 5 days a week which he can do but chooses not to. He told me that’s true. I also mentioned how I feel like I’m the only one making plans for the future and that when I told him my fear of this last year, he told me he didn’t see the need for planning things out or working more when he is just living with his dad and not wanting to get married yet. He told me this was a long time ago, that he does have plans but that it’s okay for me to think this way. I told him how I’m going to go to graduate school, which isn’t cheap, so that I can make more money for us and our future family. But that he won’t even study for his GED. He said he doesn’t see how it will help him, being that he won’t get a job with his GED since he doesn’t have documentation. I understand this part. 

The conversation ended here. I’m glad he was very calm throughout the whole talk, using his calmer voice and not getting angry. I still feel scared but at the same time I know he’s not someone that throws money around. I try calculating everything in my head and try thinking about where things are getting troublesome for him. I get anxious because why doesn’t he just work more?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7564843,public,self,Financial situation with boyfriend scares me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywzbtr/financial_situation_with_boyfriend_scares_me/,all_ads,6

I (19F) have been with my bf (19M) since we were 15, we've never had any issues or arguments bar the tiny little ones you have, until his first year of university. We live in a little town about a 2 hour drive away from his university, everything was going great until he became a bit too close with this girl (19 as well, she shares my birthday). My first time meeting her I thought she was lovely and we became friends very fast. 
The second time I went up was for Halloween last year, we were doing a spooky DND campaign and everything was great until she started getting flirty due to the alcohol. She sat in-between me and my bf and started saying comments on how he looked good in a black shirt and was leaning on him. My bf didn't think of this and didn't stop it, when I brought my worries up to him he told me I was over reacting and she meant no harm.
After this we had no further issues until April time, me and my bf were spending the day together when he slipped out some Information about the fact him and this girl has been in each others bedrooms alone to 'talk about bas about the flat' I said I had an issue with this as he hid it from me and the bedroom part. He started having ago at me saying that I clearly don't trust him anymore, we talked this out and it became fine afterwards but with the rule of don't hide stuff and no bedrooms which I thought is reasonable of me.
Skip forwards to September I just started my first year of university as I did a gap year and he was on his second year, we went to different universities and we had planned stuff out to keep in touch and to meet up like we did last year.(last year I was the only one who travelled and I spent my money I earned on train tickets every 2 weeks)
About a month ago from now I found out he'd been having this girl around his place a lot to talk with everyone which was fine until he asked if they could be alone more to talk... I found this questionable but just said 'I guess so' as I trust him. About two days after this he started ignoring me when she was round and it got to a point where we ignored me for 3 days straight. When he finally messaged he said 'idk if we work anymore' I didn't know what to think. I left it for awhile on open and the next day he messaged again asking to call. He said he didn't want to split up and we'd work on ourselves and the relationship more. 
But on the Sunday just gone he said he was going to hers to speak to her and his mate Tom, as soon as he arrived at there's at 12.22am Monday morning he started blanking me again, I found that him and that girl had been in the middle of no where for a walk due to her story. The next day still nothing from him but he was online. I messaged the girl asking if anything happened, 'she said she hasn't seen or heard from him since Sunday night either'. She told me yesterday that he mentioned seeing me next weekend on Sunday night and that apparently he's got a lot on his mind right now and won't tell anyone.
My stepdad says it seems like he's emotionally cheating on me with this girl and that hes planning on ending things.

I (M21) have been frequenting a bar in my town which is really nice, i like it very much. There's this waitress who is really cute and always smiles at me with the biggest smile. Now the problem is my signal reading and the gray area that is the server/customer relationship. I really want to approach her, not necessarily with sexual/partnership intentions, but because she seems like a genuinely kind, warm and interesting person and I would love to get to know her. 

A few notes before getting into details. Its a mixed coffee shop/bar, so its not really a late night hangout. I don't drink alcohol there, not once. I always treat all of the staff with basic human decency and respect. I am there about once or twice a week on average.

I consider myself a somewhat outgoing and a positive person. Not really that confident, but not afraid to approach a person. I don't know how old she is. Looks a few years older than me. The first problem that i have with this situation is that its a massive unknown about most of the signals because its her job to smile and serve me, but she always seems ""extra"" happy when she sees me, she could have the worst day of her week, or the busiest hour of her shift, but she just lights up when she sees me walk through the door. Maybe i'm just her favourite regular, i don't know. Second problem is that everytime i go there its always busy, not rush-hour busy, but busy in a way that even if i sat down at the bar (i usually sit at a table somewhere) we wouldn't be able to have a normal conversation and because of the gray area i think its just too straight-forward to ask her out without rushing unknowingly and unnecessarily since we haven't had interaction other than the usual server/customer relationship + a few ""nice weather we're having"" chit chats. I know her name, but everything else is blank.

So I've been working at a fast food restaurant for almost 2 years now, and I've developed a close relationship with one of my managers. We've progressively gotten closer; we've spent a lot of time inside and outside of work together. We even went on a trip out of state with each other and some friends and all of our friends said we give off couple's vibes.

Needless to say, we both like each other. 

But this morning, after I clocked out, she said she needed to talk to me in private. No big deal right?

So she pulls me into the Manager's office, and she starts telling me that she has feelings for me and has had feelings for quite some time. I said my feelings were likewise, and in that moment I thought she was going to ask for a relationship. But instead, she gets on one knee, takes out this super nice engagement ring and proposed for marriage.

Now, I'm feeling pretty blown away at this point. I asked why she wants to skip straight to engagement, and she answers that she doesn't really believe in courtship as it relates to dating. Obviously I like her and all, but I don't think either of us are in a position to make marriage happen anytime soon. So I said I'd get back to her with my answer.

So here I am now. I really like her, and I feel like we'd be a fantastic couple, but I'm not even close to thinking about marriage or any kind of engagement. It's jarring.

I kinda always just had an issue with our lack of communication, emotion, and affection. Not even just sex even though that was few and far between. We never really opened up to each other and/or talked about ourselves or really got deep. Kinda always stayed on the surface. It was affecting me mentally so I had to get out of it, which I never wanted to do because I didn’t want to break up my family, but I finally put myself first and did it.

Well I met this new girl naturally through friends and honestly just really enjoyed her personality and the way she carried herself. I enjoyed her as a human before I even thought about it being a thing, I did think she was attractive but didn’t think anything else of it. Well she came onto me in a subtle way and it took off from there, like super well. I’ve felt comfortable enough to talk about anything and everything and to have nice legitimate conversation. This has been going on for a couple months now.

Here’s where it gets sticky, the girl is in our friend group. The group that my now ex is still apart of, we’re doing well with co excising for our son so we still hangout with everyone sometimes. Not only is she our friend but she has a relationship that she wants out of with kids also. 

I do not support cheating but I do support a natural connection like we have. This has felt more right then it ever has in 5 years with my ex. 

So I guess what I’m asking is should I keep at the situation I’m in with the friend or end it? At least until she’s actually single?

My wife and I have been married for 8 years. She's a high school teacher with the workload of two teachers. I also have a day job, but my employers actually value me which gives me time to be a good partner. I do all the cooking, most of the cleaning, grocery shopping, dishwasher, laundry, etc so that the wife can come home, relax, and do the hours of grading required of her after work. I do that because I like taking care of her and mention it so you can appreciate the imbalance.


We do not have children and no desire to. We have two cats, both of which who receive more physical attention from her than I do.


My wife's love language is acts of service and quality time, so me doing all of the above is a great way to make her feel loved and appreciated. Again, I like taking care of her.


My love language is physical contact. To clarify, this doesn't mean I need sex everyday. I could survive with 2x a month. The most important thing is that I receive touch (hugs, hand holding, back/shoulde rubs, cuddles, or something) on a regular basis. I'm not getting that. When I do receive physical touch, it's clearly an after thought or it's when she notices that I'm anxious or bothered. I feel like I'm being touched by a friend, not a lover.


It's not as though she doesn't know that this is my love language. A year ago I dragged her to couples therapy to discuss our communication issues and lack of sex in our lives. From those tense sessions we learned a couple things, but most importantly she hates initiating sex. It's up to me to physically initiate sex, but it's also up to me to tolerate regular rebuffs. 


I would be fine with the narrow slice of vanilla stereotypical hetero sex of me doing 90% of the touching and fucking (sorry, I'm getting heated and frustrated as I type), but how the hell am I supposed to be the one initiating sex if I am not receiving any sort of regular affirmations of her attraction to me or a desire to touch me? 


It bothers me even more that she appears completely unconcerned about the lack of sex or touch in our relationship. I'm terrified that I'm trapped in a sexless marriage in my mid 30s and my wife has no desire to change that. ENM is not an option since she very much desires monogamy.


My theory is that she's overwhelmed with work. I mean, I cook, clean, do all the super-husband stuff when I'm overwhelmed, but I can understand.


How do I have this discussion with her about the lacking sex and very lacking physical touch? 


I would love her to go to therapy and talk to someone about, the stress, anxiety, and things blocking us from having sex, but getting her to go the first time was so hard.


So much of sex is ego and I don't want to make her cry. ",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7564756,public,nsfw,Mid 30s Married Couple Need More Touching,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywyyzk/mid_30s_married_couple_need_more_touching/,promo_adult_nsfw,3

He had dropped out of high school at this point. Over the first couple years of our relationship I caught him looking up exes on my facebook account because he didn’t have one. Girls from like 7th-10th grade. It hurt my feelings of course but I let it go. He eventually made a Facebook of his own. We got into a bad rut in our relationship at this point living with my parents from 19-20. He decided to go on Facebook and add literally 100 pretty girls he said he went to high school with, 95 percent he never even spoke to. Or hed say this is his “ex” from like first grade or 5th grade. Just strange he was even considering them exes in my opinion. He admitted he did that to make me jealous and hurt my feelings because our relationship was on the rocks. I let it go and the women stay in his facebook. I was not overly jealous so I really never spoke of it again and only brought it up because it was such a large amount at once. Things were quiet for a while. Recently I caught him sending facebook bikini pics from a girl he went to HS with to coworkers talking about how hot she is. He told me he did it because he wanted to fit in (no one asked him for that). He did this 2 days before I gave birth to our 2nd daughter and as a postpartum woman it completely destroyed me. I have postpartum depression and feel so insecure seeing that right after id given birth. I cry daily. Child is 12 weeks okd now. I asked if he does stuff like this regularly. He told me he has showed off girls on his facebook in person. Bragging about a girl he “hooked up” with when he was in 7th grade and hes 26 years old now.. I put hook up in quotes because he did not sleep with her but I think he uses that term to leave it open for interpretation to his coworkers, wants them to think they had sex. He had 2 failed attempts at having sex with girls before I came into the picture and said he would have showed those girls off too if they were his Facebook friends. He never talks about new girls. The fact he even uses the word “crush” when referring to some of these girls now makes me think he is stuck in high school in some aspect. He lies and hides all of these chats with friends.  I have a hard time trusting him as his first instinct about most things is to lie. I could ask how much a redbull was at the gas station and he would say $5 even though it was $2. I harbor a lot of resentment. We have a very active sex life. After 10 years together, how can I get him to let these girls go? I am concerned he wishes he would have been more sexually active with more women before me so he often revisits the time when he feels he peaked in that department?

I’ve been dating her for about 2 years now and everything is going relatively fine. I’m focusing alot more on school and myself right now, specifically self improvement. I see my girlfriend once maybe twice a week and we talk over the phone.

The issue arises with the idea of me not knowing if I’ve fallen out of love (if that is a thing?). She still completely loves me and has never done anything wrong to me except for the occasional jealousy which I’m mostly fine with. We have been through a lot together. 

She feels really excited when coming to see me but i unfortunately done see it that way? We still have fun together, we go on the occasional dates. There is genuinely nothing wrong with it but I am just not as enthusiastic anymore. When someone asks me if I love my girlfriend I have to hesitate for a second and say yes, unlike others in relationships where they can say it instantly. 

I also sometimes question wether I am sexually attracted to her either anymore. I could not confidently tell you I want to spend the rest of my life with her. And if I really love a person then why would I consider other people (I know it’s an asshole idea but it’s a genuine question).

Yet, if I don’t love this girl, why do I feel so genuinely bad about the idea of breaking up with her. I genuinely from the bottom of my heart wish the absolute best for her and that’s what is making it so hard for me because I don’t want a break up to ruin her.

So I (f26) met this guy (m28) on Tinder a few months ago. He‘s been super nice and we found out that we have a lot of matching interests and priorities, which made him even more interesting. Talking about looks, he‘s the exact opposite of what I look like. I‘m heavily tattooed, got a lot of body modification etc, he‘s more of a serious business man with slick back hair and no tattoos or other stuff like this. Still absolutely attractive to me. 

After a few days of talking we decided to arrange a date. The first one didn‘t work out because he came back from a business trip that night so we rescheduled a week later. Due to a lot of stress and us not really talking to each other that week I completely forgot about the date on the weekend. He waited two days and then sent me a message about how he already knew that our date wasn‘t going to work out (his argument was „women like you usually aren‘t interested in men like me“ and that he was curious if we would even get the chance to meet irl) which seemed really odd to me. I was disappointed that he would rather wait to send me a bitter message than texting me to remind me of our date (as I did the week before because I didn‘t know if he would have time for me after coming back from his trip). Needless to say, we didn‘t meet after that.

He reached out to me a few weeks after that to ask me out again. My reaction was a bit dismissive so he stopped texting me, which I understand. 

Well, it’s been a month and a half since then and I still can‘t forget him. I think a lot about what would‘ve happened if we met and I also think about texting
and asking him if he still would be down for a date, and apologizing for not taking the chance the last time. I guess the reason for not being able to get over it is because we have very similar opinions on things and relationships and I really appreciated that. I‘m just not sure if him acting that way is a sign of him always trying to be „the poor guy“, which would be a huge red flag.

TL;DR: I met a man on Tinder that I really liked. After rescheduling the date once because of a business trip on his side, I forgot about the second date due to a lot of stress. He thought I didn‘t want to come and blamed me for keeping his hopes up. I felt irritated but I can‘t forget him, probably because we have so many mutual interests and opinions.

The person messages me on social media and says, “take it slow with (my boyfriend’s name).” I respond asking who is this? And what do they mean? The guy then sends me screenshots of a convo between he and my boyfriend on Twitter. The messages consisted of them sharing what each other are into sexually and their location. The next day my boyfriend sent the person a photo of himself. My boyfriend actually isn’t aware that I know he sent the guy a photo. He thinks I only saw the initial messages of them exchanging their sexual interests. 


Immediately called my boyfriend and he goes into panic mode. Tells me that his account must’ve been hacked, it wasn’t him, etc. My boyfriend then sends me a screenshot of his inbox because he says that he doesn’t have any messages from this guy on his end. 
He then comes over to my place, gets on his knees saying that it wasn’t him, it must be spam, he’ll delete the account, and I’m free to check his phone at anytime. He was also surprised that I was so calm. 

I was calm because at this point, I’d figured out and accepted that he was lying. The messages were too detailed. When he came over, he was also wearing the same shirt that he had on in the photo he sent the guy. Also, the guy sent me a screenshot showing that my boyfriend blocked him, shortly after I confronted him about it. If he didn’t have any communication from this guy on his end and if it were truly spam, how would he know to block him? 

I think what hurt the most is that he could look at me with a straight face and lie about it. If he would’ve owned up to it, and admitted that he messed up, then I would be able to move on easier. He says that he wants us to move past this and he doesn’t want the relationship to end. How can I remain with someone who just lies to me with a straight face?

We live together and as a result are naturally are in the same vicinity a lot of the time. We also are often working from home which increases that time. While that time is not quality together exactly, she will often interact with me while I am working(this is it's own challenge and we are working on setting up boundaries). That is exhausting for me.

I tend to have a challenge bringing up boundaries or conversations that are uncomfortable. Stemming from my chronic people pleasing tendencies, this behavior has caused more problems than it has, or could, solve. I've been working on this with a counselor and we've been making progress, though it is slow.

My partner takes it personally when I request time alone and I tend to get those much needed moments entirely on her busy work days when she stays out late. I love her and love spending time with her, but I find that it becomes almost a chore to spend time when I haven't had chances to be alone and recharge. I really hate that I can't enjoy those times together.

What makes that harder is that she is very busy and even though we are ""together"" a lot of the time, that doesn't count as time spent together even though I feel burnt out and tired.

I need to communicate that I need this time and that it has nothing to do with her but simply that I need time alone doing my own thing.  


TLDR:  
I fail to find and push for time on my own and by myself that I desperately need to sustain a healthy mental state. Without it, I find that I can't enjoy time together in this relationship. She gets offended or even pushes back when I request that time and as a result I don't really even request it anymore.

So here's the current situation. We are both friends AND roommates but we both like the same girl. The three of us hang out ALL THE TIME. And now we both swiped right on our close friend. Now it kinda feels like a subtly toxic environment when I hang with him; especially around her.

There's always all kinds of people at the gym including this ripped guy that's always slamming weights, just throwing them around.  Now my GF already hates this guy. And last time we were there while I was inbetween sets he started using the same machine. I said ""so sorry I'm using that"" and he said ""no you're not ,you're walking around"" and he just kept using it.

 My gf hears this and comes up to him and just starts insulting him ""listen here, you juicehead midget, treat people how you wanna be treated. You walk around between sets and watch your square head in the mirror. So stfu. And by the way you don't have to throw the weights around we already know you're a little bitch."" and she just kept going telling him that he can take roids all he wants he's only gonna get wider, not taller.
And the whole time I was scared. I don't wanna have a problem with him and have to move gyms. Or have her fight him and get kicked out. Because she has fought people before. She's over 6 ft and athletic so she's overly confident. 

And stuff like this happens all the time. Always takes it too far. Like last week we were at a fast food joint and the girl that was working there was really slow and she was eating an apple the whole time. When she forgot the sauces and my gf told her to go get them the girl said I'll get them, don't tell me what to do. So my gf said something like ""Listen here bitch, if I slap you you're gonna get that apple stuck in your throat like snow white. Don't make me jump this counter.""

I understand she grew up in a shitty neighbourhood and her parents are war immigrants from the 90s. But her behaviour sacres me.

Halle (28f). Earlier this year my gf made it clear that she wanted to be proposed to by the time she was 28, she said if I didn't propose by then that she would leave me.

I didn't appreciate the pressure of this but didn't wanna tell Halle that I couldn't see myself getting married ever. (pointless and a waste of cash). I told her I would think about it but not to get her hopes too high.

Anyway 3 months ago was her birthday and she had a great time with all her friends. At the party her besy friend apparently told her she was engaged to her bf of 3 years. Halle looked upset for the rest of the night and wouldn't talk to me until we got home.

At our apartment she asked if I even planned to marry her or if I was just wasting her time. This question made me feel pressured so I told her that I couldn't see myself ever getting married. Halle started crying and told me to pack my stuff and stay at my mom's house, which I at first tried to argue with her on but eventually agreed since she was being emotional.

We later face timed and she broke up with me, saying she wouldn't wait around forever and that we weren't right for each other. I've moved back in with my mom since then and am looking for my own apartment but I still can't help but feel I made a mistake.

I've been on two dates since we broke up 3 months ago but neither of them went beyond a casual one night thing. I still think about Halle most of the time and I wake up and miss having her next to me. How can I move on from her or is there still a chance I can win her back?.

now, in the week after the accident, they are extremely broke but not because of the accident (they have not paid for anything out of pocket, and only offered to cover the tow which they did not have enough money for). they are broke because their job isn’t scheduling them enough, and as a manager at my own job i can only assume that’s because they probably aren’t the best worker. they told me a few days after the accident that they were only getting scheduled 1 day a week. i told them they needed to talk to their manager and get more days and they did so now they are at 3 days… which is still not enough for them to support themselves and pay rent. 

so now i’m mad that they crashed my car and can’t pay to help fix it, while also having to support them until their job stuff gets figured out. they moved in with me literally two weeks before the accident, and now they are just using ALL of my stuff. wearing my socks, using my shower products, it’s been about three weeks since they moved in and i feel like my home is just a place of chaos now. i got off work at 12 last night just to come home to no body wash and no milk for my cereal. i’m just so tired and i honestly wish i didn’t let them move in. i wish i could ask them if living with me could be temporary and have them find a new roommate somewhere else but they can’t even afford that and would probably be homeless if i asked them to do that.

Funny thing is he is brutally honest but also a great liar.  Has given me “half truths” until I push for more details then I get the full truth or I hope to believe it’s the full truth.  I have no proof he ever cheated on me. 

My problem is that I don’t trust men.  I thought I fixed that getting into this relationship but he did lose my trust.  My dad cheated on my mom and my mom continuously got into toxic-ish relationships after that.  I read all the relationship advice on here and it just adds to the fire. I hear stories from other girls on tiktok and it worries me. So I feel like now I am looking for lies and assume he’s always doing something behind my back. And then it’s not fair to him because if he is telling the truth I don’t believe him. 

He wants to fix this and work on this and has given me full access to his phone, his location, unfollowed a bunch of girls on Instagram, doesn’t like girls posts, deleted a bunch of girls off Snapchat, if a girl snapchats him (which doesn’t happen often) he would wait for me to open it together or save the chats, etc. he offered couples therapy, he’s in individual therapy himself. 

I’m close with my mom and have told her all of this so now she isn’t a fan of him and says I can do better (ironic). I’m obviously still stuck because there are so many positives about him and he does treat me well in every other aspect, always wants to communicate and compromise when issues arise, we have the same goals and interests, etc. I know every relationship has its struggles and if I never go out looking for things I wouldn’t find anything to hurt me but I can’t help it and I know that’s something I need to work on.
