He said that he mentioned it the first time around, because he wanted to be honest that he's at a critical point in his life where if he decides to take an opportunity to start a new job, he'll have to do it, and that he wouldn't want to hurt me if he had to go. His words.

I was upfront that I want my relationship to be meaningful and lasting, and if that means he wants to break up. He didn't. We had another talk about it, because it still bothered me and turns out, there's more to why we have our doubts about whether this will last or not (long story short, he got lots of emotional baggage and some traumatic experiences that he fears would be too much of a burden for me), and that he also assumed I'm in a similar situation and he would want me to prioritise getting a career over keeping him too. We both want each other to be happy, the difference seems to be that I believe that it's possible to get both a career and keep the relationship, while for him it's two potentially mutually exclusive concepts, and he also worries he'd mess things up for me.

During the second talk, I said I'm willing to put the effort in and make the compromises to make this relationship work, if he is willing to do that too, and he said he wants to give us a try despite any doubts (he's also been expressing desire to move in with me at some point, when we're both ready), but again, that didn't entirely put me at rest, because he doesn't talk much to me about what he's doing and what he's planning and when he wants to take the next step with his career.

Of course if he chooses to go in the end, there's nothing that can be done. I won't stop him, because it'd be counterproductive and I do genuinely want all the best for him. But what I don't want is to end up emotionally investing myself into it and then get left behind if he really decides to take a chance with a new job. I think I deserve to be my potential partner's priority the way they would be my priority too, not a second choice he keeps around until he decides it's time to go. But I also think that I can't expect to be the priority of a person I've only dated for 3 months, or that he'll jump and commit to me this seriously at this stage, because I don't know if I could do it either if my life circumstances changed, except I'm willing to do my best to try and approach any problems from the perspective of a couple and a team and he seems to want it too, but lack the confidence whether it can work or not, again, partially due to his own past trauma, so it's not just about the career. But! I think I need him to know that this is what I want, and I will be way more hurt if I put the effort in and get abandoned than if we cut it now. But isn't it too early to be able to give a definite answer like this?

I just don't know if it's appropriate time to say things like that, because it does sound heavy. But if I don't establish it now, then when? When it's too late?

Next morning I messaged her saying I enjoyed it and asked if she would like to go out again.

I was unenthusiastic about the idea of not seeing her for 2 weeks and our texting conversations were not frequent enough for me to just message her for that time, so I asked if she would like to study together some days.

She has always had a little anxiety and issues from emotional trauma from previous relationships. With that being said, I looked past all of it because she seemed to handle it well with therapy and time. 

We have been to the ER 3 times in the last month because she said she was having mini seizures, numbness all over and can’t sleep. We have done every test known to man, every bit of imaging and the neurologists have said this is 100% anxiety induced. No seizures at all and she is googling everything saying she’s going to die from random diseases they haven’t diagnosed her with. She’s been falling into these weird psychosis states with blank face and zones out for 10 seconds. Doctor said it’s lack of sleep and anxiety induced.

Imaging months ago found a tiny benign cyst in her abdominal area that poses no threat or symptoms and she tells people we meet that she has a tumor. 

I found out she lied to me last year visiting a male friend at his house (he does have a gf) with her sister. I find out a year later she went alone and lied to me because she thought “I would get mad or jealous”. The guy straight up asked my wife to not mention her going over there to his gf a year later. Red flag.

She hasn’t worked in 5 months and we left an amazing situation in Texas where I was making a good six figure income because she found her “dream job” in Louisiana. I express my frustration, she says she’s going either way so I pay $4K to break our lease bc she can’t afford it. She quit that job 3 months after moving.

I have dreams and ambitions, feel like she’s holding me back and I want kids. She thinks she can’t have kids (zero medical reasoning) but at this point idk if I want her to be the mother of my children.

We are in couples counseling, we meet with our counselor in two days.
I am in counseling on my own. Still waiting to be ""matched"" through the online system. My work pays for up to 18 sessions so I am taking advantage of that. 

DH (31M) and I (29F) have been married 9 years. Our plan has ALWAYS been when he finishes undergrad wed start trying for kids. 

In the past few weeks his Step sister had another baby and his younger brother had a baby and he keeps talking about a missing piece and how maybe if we'd had a kid 5 years ago we'd be happier. 

Now we are almost there and I don't think I want kids any more. I don't want to give up my career. I look around and see women who either don't have children, have a partner who stays home or are 20 steps behind their peers because they took time off for their kids. I don't want that.

He told me there was a time when he could see if my career took off that he would stay home with the kids, but now that he wants to pursue his doctorate he doesn't see that happening. 

I don't want my kids in day care 10/12 hours a day. I don't want to miss out on events at school or sports games. I travel quite a bit for work and I love that. I miss my hubby while  gone, but I get to see a lot and meet a ton of people at my company as a result. 

I also can't help but think what if I have a miscarriage or loss a child. He carries a genetic marker that could mean our child would be born without kidneys and live a very short (days or minutes) painful life. 

I told my husband this and it has BLOWN UP in my face. He's cold and distant. I wish we'd started counseling before coming to this realization, but good grief. I feel like shit because I changed the game. I feel like shit because he refuses to sleep in the same bed as me. I feel like shit because I think my marriage is over and I can't face my friends and family about that.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post with your advice! So here's what ended up happening:

Again, I'm 18m and she's 19f

So later that same day when she proposed, I shot her a text, inviting her over for dinner so we can have a talk, she of course agrees and comes over later that day. 

So we discuss why she proposed over some Red lobster takeout, and she basically said that her family, mainly her mother, never dated anyone. They had all skipped to proposal because of religious reasons (I don't know what religion, I never bothered to ask). So I said that I would love to maybe date, but marriage is far off the table. Neither of us has the resources to make anything like that happen, and again, we were just close friends so it would be jarring to skip to such an intimate level.

So in the end, I said the only way we'd be able to court is if we started dating.

So she wastes no time and straight up cuts me off and asks me out 😂

Y'know, of course I said yes :)

So of course, sappy love ensues (crying tears of joy, hugs kisses, y'know lol) and she said she's willing to keep an open mind regardless of what her family thinks. 

It's been a few days and things are going pretty well! However, she hasn't told her family yet. So I'll come back with another update when she tells her family.

We hooked up for awhile and then he told me he wanted something more serious and we went on a lot of dates together. I noticed he suddenly became very on/off with me and was also a pretty heavy drinker.. I would get some odd drunk texts and calls every week. I expressed that his behavior was difficult for me and he told me that he was considering therapy and having a lot of personal issues. He told me he couldn’t commit to a relationship and that it was nothing against me. I was understanding and let go easily. 

Right after the break off, he kept texting me to check in, and as soon as he found out I was seeing other people, he started getting jealous and escalating. I’d get so many drunk calls and texts asking to see me. He kept starting fights and told me “sometimes I just like to fight for the fight so everything feels real.” If I didn’t answer right away he’d send aggressive messages like “f you don’t ignore me.” Then suddenly he told me he was dating a new girl.  I completely cut contact with him. 

All of a sudden, he’s been reaching out again. He calls me late at night and sends me random “innocent” messages fishing around to talk.

I (27F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) for 2 years. We have opened up our relationship a few months ago, and we agreed that the people we meet up with would just be casual. However, my boyfriend has been talking to this woman for a while and he has told me that he has fallen hard for her. He said that he still loves me and that he's still attracted to me and that he doesn't want to lose me, but I was devastated to hear this and I am still having a hard time processing this. 

What I am most worried about after hearing this revelation is that I am worried he's going to fall in love with her and then leave me in the process. What bothers me most about him telling me this is that he has told me before that he doesn't feel attracted to me; I had to work to improve on myself and now he is attracted to me. However, he fell for this girl instantly. 

Another thing that has bothered me is that yesterday was my birthday, and while I was still sleeping, he took an Uber to where she works just to see her and say hi to her. He didn't tell me this after I brought him to visit my mom's grave; it was the first time I brought him there because we both lost our moms when we were teenagers. I told him how fucked up that is and how upset it has made me.

I don't know what to do about this, he has apologized to me many times about this and is really remorseful. I don't want to lose this relationship, but at the same time, I feel so hurt.

( English is not my first language and i hope what im gonna right will make sense )   
My gf  (43) and I (39) had an argument yesterday .  
 I dont think why we argued is important though.   
What is important for me though is that she showed passive aggressive behaviour, she was a bit of a smart ass , rethorical  , showed anger out of proportion to the argument and displaced anger .   
I then got a bit fired up and i started yelling  and the whole argument shifted focus on me yelling rather than discussing why  she showed  all the things above.   
She stopped the conversation almost straight away saying that we weren't having an adult conversation and it was better to chill down before continuing.   


What i think is that requesting an adult conversation requires some solid foundation ( which she didn't provide in my opinion )    


All those things happened before with the same pattern.   


Why does she focus on my reaction ( yelling ) and no much on her actions ( that sparked my reaction)?

A couple of years ago we had an argument about him using cocaine at a friends bachelor party. I told him it made me very uncomfortable. For multiple reasons. His safety, his judgment being impaired, the overall environment and I have a family history of drug addiction. He agreed with me. 

Fast forward to last night, we were at a family event. It got a bit crazy, everyone was drinking a lot. I happened to see him leave a cubicle with another male - wiping their noses. Was obvious. I asked him about it. He admitted to doing it with him. I told him I just feel so disappointed in him and that’s not the type of person I want to be with regardless of how infrequently the use is. He is spitting apologies and trying to assure me it won’t happen again. I honestly feel like he doesn’t see anything wrong with the behaviour and is just trying to placate me. It makes me feel like in future he will just lie about it. 

We’ve been together for so long and I love him, but I feel this has left a mark on how I see him. I respect everyone’s right to live their life how they see fit, I just have no space in my life for drug use. It makes me feel like I don’t really know him and how he likes to spend his time.

I met B 4 years ago on Hinge, we went on a few dates, I found her charming, enjoyed her company a lot, and she’s extremely attractive but I didn’t feel anything romantic, she wanted to take things further but I didn’t so we agreed to be friends. I asked her if she wanted to be casual thing and she said no which I accepted. We remained friends for a few years and fooled around a couple of times when we were drunk (never sex, just kissing and being touchy with each other and we did oral a few times). We had an argument and she asked why do I get sexually physical with her and I told her that I do find her very hot but I only see her as a casual platonic relationship and she said she started to develop feelings when we became touchy with each other so she asked me to distance from her as she didn’t want to feel confused.

We didn’t speak for about 6 months and I reached out to her and invited her to a summer bbq I was having. She agreed and came along and seeing her again was great, we have a lot in common and I get along with her really well and she pretty much told me she feels nothing for me now so we can go back to being friends again. I invited her to a games night I was having and this is where she met my friend A. A and B got along great and started dating. I really didn’t care, A knew of our past history and it didn’t bother him and I had no issues with them dating. 

Since they’ve been together, I’ve noticed B doesn’t talk to me much, anytime I see her, A is always with her, she never hangs out with me alone and I always see her in group settings. This bothered me because I had a great friendship with B, I love her company and hanging out with her. I confronted her and asked why she doesn’t hang out with me alone. She said it’s weird to be alone with someone you used to do sexual things with when you have a partner and she never wants to do anything that’ll make A feel uncomfortable. I think this a bullshit excuse but I didn’t question it. To be honest, at this point, I didn’t see them lasting for a long time. I have more things in common with B and I’m more her type physically. 

Now they’re engaged and A invited me to the wedding, I feel so uncomfortable with going. I’m very happy for them and I’ve never seen A so happy before, B is an amazing girlfriend to him and I have nothing bad to say about either of them but I do not want to go to their wedding. My friendship with B is completely gone as she avoids hanging out with me, I really miss her and our times together and I think it’ll be odd me being there because of our past.

About a  month ago I got out of a two year long relationship, he took it very hard and wants to still get back together, compared to me who feels very much done with that period of my life. Part of the reason behind the breakup was that we were both going off to university (in different countries), as well as the intensity towards the end. He was very controlling. 

Since then, I have been enjoying university life, and honestly just getting settled in a new country and city. I met this boy around two weeks ago in a pub, and we needed uk meeting up again later that week. He is very sweet, but I knew that this was not something that I would continue with/ he was not right for me. However, for some reason I did not stop texting him, and he asked to meet up again tonight and I agreed. 

One thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. The experience was completly consensual, and he was super nice throughout it all. However ever since I got back home, I cant stop feeling icky about it. I feel gross and dirty, and as if I have done something very very wrong. 

I was just wondering if this is a common feeling after a hookup? Or if anyone has any tips on how to not feel massive anxiety after.

We've moved to multiple places together and we share pets together. We move two months ago to a remote town away from family and were absolutely excited for the change. 

Ever since we moved I've been completely ignored. He only cares about his friends and coworkers but when I need him to be there for me he calls me dramatic and ignores me. 
We've been having issue after issue. He completely ignores my feelings. I've tried to talk to him about communication, boundaries and goals but once again he ignores me. 
There have been a few incident he'll blow up in front of his friends and blame me for it even though I'm just trying to have good time. ""I can never have fun around you"" 
And tells me I have better things to do than talk. 

I don't know what happened, what's going on with him and the sudden change of attitude. But being away from everyone it made me believe he's having a power trip cause I overheard him talking to his buddy how much more comman sense he has and how he's better than his coworkers. 
One day I made a joke with his friends, everybody laughed everybody was having a good time except him. He took offense to my joke and made the comment that he never has a good time around me. I bought it up when we were going home. ""Why are you mad at me?""

""You're stupid for not knowing""
I had enough and I blew up. I was tired of being the rug to his feet and I was tired of him shutting me down ever time I needed him. He responded with ""you should leave""

He's kicking me out of our own place. I called his family out of desperation cause I have no where else to go, I want them to talk to him. He's been ignoring me for several days and acts like nothing ever happened.

Actually, through video chat she showed me a sneak peak of the brown colors she was using for it and said she crocheted all day to try to finish it before I left town to visit my family. Due to some confusion with times, I couldn’t pick it up before I left anymore, and we settled for me picking it up when I returned from my trip. 

However, when I return from my trip and see her again…… CRICKETS. I assumed maybe she was doing some finishing touches so I didn’t bother bringing it up. After all, I simply appreciate the gesture that she made me anything at all.


BUT…. then I see on her twitter (that she doesn’t know I know about —oop), I see a picture of her wearing it. You could say I hurt my own feelings by snooping and seeing her wearing it, yeah yeah but I still would have wondered why she never gave it to me. In the meantime, I see her several times with no mention of the hat, but only a conversation about what color I would like for her to do for her next project (I throw out the color green). And now a week or so later she is showing me a green hat she is crocheting FOR ME…… 

So, I just feel played and I don’t know how to bring this up since I allowed so much time to pass without confronting her on why she never gave me my present…. and why it’s not the one she originally was giving me… I feel that she liked the brown one so much that she wanted to keep it for herself, and that makes me feel like she doesn’t fully respect me or want me to have her best work. It would feel easier to address this if it wasn’t over a material item, especially a birthday present for me, because I don’t want to seem ungrateful or entitled… ultimately she owes me nothing for my birthday, but it feels demeaning to expect me to blindly accept a whole new gift with no context — feels insulting to my intelligence.

B wanted to get balloons for A’s party and I asked her if she wanted some help because I make up balloons as my job. We went to one store and got a few balloons there, I used my team member card so that she could get them at a discounted price and she paid for the balloons. 

We then went to another store because the previous store didn’t have all the balloons that she wanted to get. We got the balloons and then I scanned my team member card again and then she turns to me and asks me to pay for the balloons. I was shocked but I paid for them anyways. 

We then went and got McDonald’s afterwards. I went to the screen and started ordering my food. She came over and ordered food on the same screen as me. I decided not to pay card because I didn’t want to pay for her meal. We go to the registers and I end up paying for her meal too because she was just playing on her phone and it felt like she just expected me to pay for her food. 

B owns designer clothes, bags, shoes worth $1500 and I don’t have a lot of money. 

I’m upset with her but also myself for allowing this to happen. She also owes me $160 that I need to ask her for.

She hated her job - mostly because she never went to college so she wasn't able to move up or make more money.  She envied those who did and she was pretty bitter about being in the same role as college students, who would then move up.  

I was not planning to go to college, mom discouraged it because she didn't understand how people pay for it.  I ended up getting a full ride scholarship.  I had some issues in college, my mom relied on me a lot through her abusive relationships and the rough conditions at home.  I was on several mental health meds and they changed my personality a lot, it's hard to explain unless you're been on psych meds.  Anyway, I did my best to get through, I got a social work degree.  I went into higher ed admin and got an educational leadership degree.  I fell into a career, and I'm glad I did.

Now that I've had a good 5 years full time work experience, I realize that I don't want this job long term.  The outlook isn't terrible.  They pay is livable outside of large cities.  I won't be looking at $60K or higher unless I move up to director or upper admin, which is going to take a while.

Secret - this is a really bullshit job.  It's a really bullshit degree.  You just help people do things they should be able to do themselves.  I feel my job doesn't matter.  I know how this sounds, but I feel I'm too smart and talented for work like this.

I've decided to go back to my original goal, way back when, if studying accounting and going into the field, eventually to become a CPA.  I loved my accounting classes in high school and college.  I can get a free AA in accounting through my job, transfer it to the university, and pay for a BSBA in Accounting out of pocket, which will take under 2 years.  This opens so many opportunities doing work I don't hate, and my long term salary is so much higher.

I want to do this.  Ever since I was a kid, when I've told my mom accounting interested me, she's gotten angry with me.  She'll say ""accountants hate themselves"" and ""accountants don't have souls"".  I know she is just bitter because she could never move up.  I've been miserable my whole professional life and my mom just says ""but you have a masters degree"" (because in her mind, that solves life's problems).  I'm very unhappy and I want to go into a field where I learn a skill that people want and pay well for.  My job now is such bullshit and I feel it's not a good use of my mind or my time.

I (F20) have been with my girlfriend (F21) for about three years now. We’ve always been a couple who can communicate easily and listen to each other quite well and we still do. We both noticed for the past month that things just don’t go quite well. 

I think we both just feel like roommates more than a couple. We get up, work/school, decide where to eat (we don’t live together) and then proceed to go to sleep. I love her deeply but don’t know if I’m currently ‘in love’.

Our sex life has never been that great. We try to improve it, but don’t know where to start (why isn’t there more sex education on lesbian bed-partners?!?!).

We’ve talked about our feelings a lot the past couple weeks, but don’t know what the exact issue is. We just get irritated at each other more often then before and don’t feel that ‘spark’ or enjoyment when we see each other again.

On a note: we see each other everyday and don’t have a lot of ‘alone time’. Almost 0. Next to that we experience both mental health issues at the moment (for me it’s a burnout and for her it’s ADHD).

Does anyone have tips on how to get past this? I can see myself grow old with her as we have about the same long distance goals. We already talked a lot and listened to each other and right now we won’t see each other for a week (for the sake of alone-time).

Tips would be much appreciated! :)

For context we are both 23, got together in high school &amp; have been married for a year. Our relationship has had its ups &amp; downs like everyone’s but one issue that has never been resolved is her temper/explosiveness. I am a very passive, non confrontational person, where as my wife isn’t. She is the kind of person who will say what’s on her mind even if it hurts your feelings because its “honest”. This has led to here saying very hurtful things to me in arguments throughout our entire relationship. Im a terrible boyfriend, now husband, i dont care about her/make her/us priority, been called every name in the book, have been threatened with divorce. Stuff like this doesn’t happen all the time but when it does, it hurts really bad. She always apologizes later on or the next day, but it doesn’t make it any better.

For more context, she is chronically ill &amp; has struggled with physical &amp; mental health a lot of her life, so it feels like there is always an excuse after the apology. Bad pain day, changing meds, depression, etc. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, &amp; self harm so I am sympathetic but I never take my struggles out on others. from my pov it seems like she is okay with whatever she does as long as she can point to a cause. Recently (this is where me being non confrontational is an issue, I should have addressed this long ago) ive started to be more up front about the routine of her being hurtful &amp; apologizing later, that it isn’t okay. Not long after this she said she may be bi polar (it does run in her family) &amp; wants to be evaluated for it.

I guess where im lost is, what now? What if she is? I hate to say it but I cannot live with this routine, there is more context of course but for the sake of the post I’ll keep it short.

She and I get along very well and for fear of ruining our friendship and our group of friends I never risked telling her that I liked her. On the other hand, he had already told her several times and she had rejected it, but this time it was not like that.

They had told me that surely he also liked me because we look like boyfriends: we walk with our hands intertwined; I hug her by her waist and she hugs me by her neck; We kiss a lot, except on the lips because we both reserve it for something already special; and when we are alone we also give each other eskimo kisses.

Confident that the other was not going to ask her for anything since she had already refused several times, I planned to declare myself the following Saturday; because these weeks we have been very busy with school and I did not want her to feel uncomfortable, if she rejected me, studying for exams.

The truth is that at first I did not feel sad but I was surprised by the news. But then I realized that once she even hinted to me that she wanted to be my girlfriend and I didn't understand her until now and on reflection I realized that it wasn't the only time, and now I feel sad and a bit silly for not having declared my feelings to her sooner and for not having taken her hint.

Some useful background info: early in our relationship/marriage I had a lot of mental health issues, and it has taken years for me to get to a healthy place. My spouse was relatively supportive, though not perfect. There would be moments when they would vent personal/private details to their family, their family would reach out to mine, then it would get back to me. This felt like betrayal to me, but I let it go because I felt I had put my spouse in a bad place due to my mental health. 

Recently we have gone through a major life change, that did not work out as expected and we got screwed over. We are picking up the pieces and trying to work things out legally. (I'm keeping this vague because my spouse is on reddit and I don't want them to know it's me). Since this huge change, my spouse has understandably had major mental health issues and changes. I an doing everything I can to support them, because I know how this feels. And I know the things my spouse did for me that were great, and the areas where my spouse could have handled things better. But practically everyday I am told or talked at about how I am not doing enough. How I am not supportive enough. How I never compromise. All of which feels like a slap in the face, I am the only one working right now and I handle all repairs to our homes and vehicles. I do all the grocery shopping and a majority of cooking. My spouse has been doing a majority of the cleaning and doing a few emails a month about our legal issues. 

I want to tell my spouse how they are making me feel, but I feel like the backlash I'd get isn't worth it. I feel like I can't speak my mind anymore. I feel gaslit.

It was a video of someone showing their dick. But her reaction was kind of off. She said “what the heck” in the most rehearsed way and then proceeded to do that fake gag in a joking manner.

I am a 30 year old woman who has been single for two years. After taking some needed time for myself, I’d say I’ve been seriously dating for the past year, maybe year and a half. I’m in a great place in my life, and would love to find the right person to share it with. Dating has been pretty disappointing… I don’t think I’m being too picky or not giving guys a chance, I have. But even the guys I’ve gone on maybe 3 dates with haven’t felt quite right, like I haven’t met someone who shares my same humor and that I’m genuinely having a good time with and excited to be around. Until I met this one guy. He checked all my boxes of things I was looking for in a partner, all our dates were fun, good conversation, sex was great, i feel comfortable and happy around him, I started to fall for him… but about 6 dates in, he loses interest in me. Im pretty crushed. I was starting to worry I would never meet someone great and fall in love again since it’s been so long, but now that I could imagine it again with someone, he doesn’t want me. I know that’s sort of the game of dating, but it’s starting to feel like I’m getting older and older while most of my friends have found their people, and like it just might not happen for me. I just feel so disheartened, and like I’m never gonna find a happy relationship and as much as I love the rest of my life and people in it, that makes me so sad.

This is going to be long so buckle up.

Some background: I’m originally from Colorado but moved in with my parents in Illinois at the very start of 2021. I met my boyfriend on a dating app and we hit it off. We had really similar personalities and got along super well. I ended up moving out of my parents place and moved in with him about 4 months in to the relationship (which I’m starting to realize was probably too soon.)

I never really questioned anything until the first time I caught him *almost* cheating I guess. A while after we had been living together, I felt like something was very off. He was showing some really weird behavior like being distant and just overall not like himself. Then one night he said he was going to his friends house because his friend group was having a little hangout and I was excited for him because he had expressed that he wanted to spend more time with them so I told him to go. Side note: we always use snapchat to talk, we never text each other with our actual phone numbers. But when he got to “his friends house,” he texted me on his actual number that he got there safely. I had a gut feeling something was very wrong so I downloaded grindr and checked to see if he was there and sure enough he was. I confronted him about it immediately and he basically broke down. He claimed he had no intention of actually meeting someone but to this day I find it hard to believe that he was just aimlessly driving without a destination. He also admitted to texting me with his actual phone number so that I couldn’t see his location on Snapchat. I’ve tried to just be completely over it but I find myself still really uneasy about the whole situation. 

Another major turning point was when we invited someone that went to his school over for *activities.* A few hours after it was over and the person had gone home, my boyfriend wanted to go to the school to rehearse for a performance he had coming up. He was gone for a few hours which was fine because he’s done that before and I didn’t initially have any thoughts about it. When he got home, and even the day after I kept asking him if he had heard from the person and he always said no. I already knew this wasn’t true because I had seen the Snapchat notifications from him on his phone. So I made the stupid decision to check his phone after he had gone to bed, and saw questionable things. He was texting him while he was rehearsing at school saying things like “it’s so lonely here right now.” I confronted him about it in the morning and he started by still trying to tell me he wasn’t talking to him. 

These two situations alone probably should have made me question thing more than I did. But I held out and now after a collection of smaller situations and feelings I’m not sure if I can keep this up any longer. I’m usually expected to be the rock in the relationship and prevent him from spiraling mentally, but he has a really hard time returning the favor I think. He usually just gets really down when I talk about things bothering me and says he doesn’t know how to help me. 

But the biggest issue with all of this, is that even if we did break up I have nowhere to go. I can’t move back to Colorado, and I can’t live back in with my parents. Ideally I would just get my own place but I’m nowhere near financially stable enough. So we would be forced to live together in an extremely awkward environment. 

What are my next steps here?

TLDR: My boyfriend of almost 2 years has been caught doing really questionable things like *almost* cheating and I really don’t know if after everything I can keep this relationship up. I’m also expected to be the rock in the relationship that keeps him from getting too down on himself or spiraling mentally. However he’s expressed that he doesn’t know how to help me and usually just goes silent when I bring up something that’s bothering me. The problem is I have nowhere to go and almost no money to my name, so even if we broke up we’d be stuck living together in a very awkward and uncomfortable environment.

We met when I moved to my grandparents small town. We were both virgins when we met. My boyfriend grew up pretty sheltered and “uninformed”. He doesn’t really even use the internet other then the look things up.He was home schooled and didn’t really interact with women besides his mom. He doesn’t have social media or anything so he’s not like a normal 20 year old. He’s never had a girlfriend or even held hands with a girl before we met and he’s kinda weird but I like him. We decided to started having sex last week and it was fine the first time and we had a good time but the next day he wanted to have sex again and I said no because we had just done it the day before and I wasn’t in the mood. He kept asking and pestering me and I continued to say no. It’s like he’s obsessed with sex now. 

Then yesterday I decided to sleep over and watch movies with him and he started masterbating and I felt awkward so I just rolled over and pretended to sleep and then I actually fell asleep. Next thing I know he’s on top of me and pulling my shorts down and I’m telling him to stop but he somehow got them and my underwear off. I then try to grab them but he throws them and pushes me back on the bed forces himself on me without a condom. All of this actually happened over a span of like 5 minutes of us going back and forth and me pushing him off me and him just putting me back on the bed. I started crying and he just kept telling me to “shhh” and “relax it’s not that serious”. 

When he was done he went into the bathroom and I just went and grabbed my shorts and purse and ran out of the house and started walking to my grandparents house. It’s on the other side of town so he must’ve noticed I was gone and didn’t want me walking at night alone and “as a women I should know that” I then told him that he just did to me what he’s trying to protect me from. Anyways he drove me to my grandparents house and I’ve been talking to him and trying to tell him what he did was not ok and it’s rape. He says that it’s not rape if he’s my boyfriend and that he thought I wanted it. I showed him the definition and he blamed what he did on how he was raised. I don’t know if I should break up with him because besides last night we actually have fun and get each other and he seems really sorry like he really didn’t know.

I’m typing this out on mobile, so the formatting may not be the greatest.

For the last couple of months, I’ve been exclusively seeing/dating someone that I work with. I always said I wouldn’t date someone that I work with, but here we are. I wasn’t expecting it. It kind of just happened. We clicked so fast and easily. It felt right, so we both just jumped into it with no hesitation.

The first few weeks were amazing. We hung out together almost every day at my house. We always had a great time and it was hard to say bye for both of us when she had to leave. We were both so happy to have found each other, and made sure to let each other know. We were truly head over heels. I didn’t even have to ask if she wanted to hang out, we just knew that we were going to hang out after work or on our days off… and then came the excuses.

“I’m trying not to make my mom mad by coming home late.”

“I have to clean my room.”

“I don’t like driving at night.” (She drives at night all the time)

“I have to give my dog a bath.”

“My dog is sick.”

“I’m sick.” (She never seemed sick at all)

Etc. etc. etc.

Come up with the worst excuses you can think of, and she’s probably said it. It bums me out more that she doesn’t tell me she just doesn’t want to spend time with me. I’ve told her before to just say no when I ask after she gives me a shrug, but she won’t. When we do make plans and she actually agrees to them, she always cancels last minute with some excuse. Since those first few weeks we started seeing each other, I could probably count on one hand how many times we’ve hung out. It’s starting to hurt a lot.

I know you’re probably thinking “She’s not interested anymore. You should just leave”. But I don’t know what to believe. She told me “I love you” first and still tells me to this day that  she does. She calls me every day on the phone and on FaceTime at night and we’ll talk for hours. Sends me a good morning text every morning and says she loves me. Holds my hand. Always wanting hugs/kisses. Always compliments me. Says she’s never had feelings for a guy like this or loved a guy like this before. Us turning into an exclusive relationship was her idea.

I know I’ll still probably hear that I should just leave, but it’s so hard. I don’t think I can. I think it’s so hard for me to leave because she’s all I have. She pulled me out of a dark place. The thought of losing her hurts and gives me anxiety. You’d think it would be easy to just leave, but it’s not. I really do love her despite what’s been going on. I just don’t know how to move forward.

I’m supposed to be a significant other, but I don’t feel significant.

I’ll answer any questions you might have. Any advice would be greatly appreciated too.

Things have been pretty great between her and me, and we've both been aware and open about how we feel about traveling. 

Roughly 4 months into our trip my mind started to change a bit, feeling homesick and lacking in time as an individual (we've been hip to hip for months now). About a week ago we both sat down and started talking about me going home soon (though we planned to travel together to Australia after Asia to make money and live sort of normal lives again). We're currently staying at a place in Thailand for the next 3 weeks and after that, I'm either going to continue traveling with her or go back home (not in a financial position to go home and back). If I was to go home, it would likely mean the end of our relationship, as long distance doesn't really seem to be on the table. She wants to continue traveling no matter what, and I don't blame her.

So here I am, unsure of what to do. I feel like continuing to travel with her could be a great option, as it could be better to wait for our new situation to see if things change. My heart hurts like hell when I think of leaving, but there's something in me that misses the flow of life at home, and I feel like maybe I'm delaying the inevitable.

I strongly believe that as long as I’m financially dependent on my mom then I will be worthless to women.

She makes also a good amount of money (when hours aren’t cut since pandemic) and wants me to do school and she doesn’t mind me living with her. I truly think if I did move out she’d go into a depression.

But even if I could afford to move out there’s a chance she’ll need to live with me. I suspect dementia eventually. She’s a heavy smoker and not active enough and definitely not getting nutrients.

So I predict that even if I did finish school and get a job that pays enough to live alone (unlikely) I’ll still be stuck with her.

And I love her but she still helicopters me and it’s fucking depressing.

So I truly just hate myself for ruining my life by not finishing school like a normal person.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 months, and for the most part it’s been fine.

For context, he goes on Snapchat maybe 3 times in a day and when he does he only speaks to one or two people. He’s never given me any reason to assume he’d be cheating or ignoring me but it seems really odd that He still hasn’t responded to me even after I’ve asked him to call me.

Anyways, I've lost all my friends. All of them. and I don't me like they 💀 but like were no longer friends. I had a close group of friends like a years ago. we were a group of 4, 2 girls, 2 guys. originally it was a group of 3, it was me, my friend May, and their younger brother Greg. We were friends for years with no problems. I think that the only problem was that we weren't close close but close enough to hang out and 🍃. my friend Jack came along a year ago and we all became closer. Jack and I lowkey had a think but nothing ever happened because we wanted a friendship more and because May had a think for Jack. Jack and May got together around Halloween of last year, so they've been together for over a year now. After they got together we all started to drift not by choice but because May was a very jealous mf. we would all hang out together but if I or Greg were to laugh to much or interact too much with Jack, May would get upset and moody. they wouldn't talk and put on a RBF. we all new this but we hoped that it would eventually go away over time. it didn't. 

May and I graduated in June. May moved and Jack, Greg, and I started in our town. Jack and Greg still have a year left of school and I'm saving money before leaving. I hang out with Jack and Greg some times but mostly Jack. (Greg got a girlfriend and he started spending less time with Jack and I and more with his gf, which we understood). Jack has became like my best friend despite our friends/w benefits at the beginning of our friendship. there is no awkwardness at all and no feels. he loves May and I love someone else. we are nothing but close friends BUT May doesn't like or trust me. not after they've started dating. it's made our friendship very hard because all they do is get moody and upset with me, so I distanced myself. I didn't want that kind of friendship with them. I don't talk to them but I still talk to Jack. I ask how his and May's relationship is all the time and I genuinely try to stay in good terms with May because he's my best friend. I didn't want issues with his partner. But it still didn't do shit. 

May first started by telling Jack that we couldn't hang out all the time anymore. we started hanging out less, once a week. A couple of months later they tell Jack that im not allowed to stay over at his house anymore. I live in town, Jack lives out of town. I  don't drive... I would walk a cross a highway sometimes at 3 or 4 am going home. sometimes I would be drunk or high or both. Jack would walk me across the highway sometimes but for the most part it was me on my own. and of course May didn't stop there. Today May told Jack that we can no longer hang out. we can't be friend. Jack texted me this morning say that. I HAVE FUCKING NO ONE ANYMORE. May is a fucking bitch and I don't want that friendship anymore. Jack is May's bf so he obviously chose them. and Greg is May's brother and also Greg and I aren't that close.

I was seeing this guy, and everything seemed perfect untill I realised he didn’t make a move on me. I thought, aw how cute, he must be a shy and nice guy. So our fist date and outing we didn’t fu€k despite us sniffing lines as long as the china wall, drinking and smoking. Like we partied like animals and the only logical outcome I saw was fu€king like animals,yet, he didn’t make a single move.

 Ok..I did say I’m on my period cus I didn’t wanna rush and I ac was but As oxymoronic as it sounds I would probably let him fu€k me dirty anyway, I was so intoxicated! But anyways. I went home, thinking what a nice he is. finally I’ve met someone respectful, maybe this could be something real and lasting.

Next time we meet, I’m off my period, on my ovulation, mad horny and playful. Just happy, flirtatious and bloody horny. This mf didn’t make a move again. At some point I had to ask if he’s gay (jokingly ofc, I didn’t wanna kill any sexy future vibes) he said he was okay we’ve kissed numerous times since and the way he was looking at me gave me hint that he was into me. Eventually, thank you lord! We had s3x. It was lazy from his side but it felt so damn good despite it being quicker than I would’ve wished. But anyways.. we spoke, got high, etc etc and I decided to bring the convo about sex and I’ve got an impression that he’s not bothered by sex which left me baffled.. I’ve never met anyone like that. He said he had that problem with ex girlfriends. 

MY QUESTION IS, WHY COULD HIS LIBIDO BE SO LOW? and can I try to enhance it?

People wouldn't really consider these remarks to be offensive and say them to each other all the time, but it would upset me. I've always been aware of myself as being quite sensitive (I have autism and emotional dysregulation issues), which I think is why I may have given into that perspective too much and started to rationalize others' disrespect toward me. I'll give two examples:

I was once speaking with a girl at college that I have went on a few dates with. She asked me what kind of music I liked, and I said that I liked screamo and hardcore. She continued by saying that screamo sounded like animals screaming, and that was why she disliked it.  I told her that it was what I enjoyed listening to, and she laughed in my face and walked away. This seemed rude to me. I returned home, and during dinner, I brought this up to my mother. She said that the girl was correct and just clearly speaking her opinions and I shouldn't be a crybaby about people being straightforward. I always knew my mom was somewhat wrong in the head, and that she was a disrespectful person who would never show gratitude even after the sacrifices I made for her, but at that moment for some reason I chose to take her words as reality for some reason. Next day, I talked to that girl again, and just to confirm it, I told her that what she had said about my music taste the other day was disrespectful. She said, ""It wasn't haha, get over it"" and she once again walked away, with a smile on her face. This felt very invalidating to me and I didn't realize until years later that she was actually rude and it wasn't happening just in my head. 

One other time, when I was in high school, I was speaking to my first girlfriend and told her to send me a selfie. She sent me one, but in it, she was sitting next to her ex-boyfriend and they were physically close. I told her it was disrespectful, but she said she just randomly picked a selfie and sent me that. I didn't pursue it and just went on with my day, trying to ignore it. After a few weeks, I realized it might have been because she saw me walking around the school with a female classmate on that day, and she may have wanted to get back at me for that. I had never even considered that because I never looked at my classmate as someone I was romantically interested in. That relationship ended in a very angry way, BTW.

Since the incident regarding my music taste happened a year ago, I made a new decision on how to handle this situation. Whenever I feel like I am being disrespected, I have been paying extra attention to address disrespect in my relationships and to articulate it clearly but also politely, that I thought what they did was disrespectful.  Some have given me weird responses since I am very articulate about it, but overall I can say that this has made me happier. I think this is what people call 'setting boundaries.'

This week, I went on a first-date with a friend of a friend, and I believe she treated me disrespectfully on one occasion. I later sent her a text message to address it, but she disrespected me once again over text and I'm worrying if I may have said something offensive to her. If not, how should I respond back? I kind of actually really liked her vibe and I may be misunderstanding this, so please give me advice. 

Here is our text conversation, I cropped it out because I deleted her contact and her phone number was showing. But she blocked me after this: [Imgur link](https://i.imgur.com/I1nENOy.png)

I'm a female in her mid twenties and I have a question regarding a guy I've known since high school.  We only started to talk to each other more often since a few months ago when we met at a festival. 

We clicked the moment we started talking more, and we both found out that we have similar backgrounds, similar interests. We can about literally anything. He's a very sweet guy and he always tells me that he cares about me. He also knows when I'm not feeling okay, he knows the things I like or I don't like, and he's always on point with lots of things. He also tells me all the time that he can't wait to meet me, even if we met very recently, like a day or two before.

A few weeks ago he came to the city where I moved to for my studies and we went out for dinner. Some of his friends were calling him to ask him to go out with him and he told one of his friends (who's a mutual friend of ours) that he went on a date but I thought he said it as a joke. After a few days he told me that us going out that evening felt like a date to him. After that we continued going out for dinner or lunch when I'd go back to my hometown (each two weeks) and he almost never lets me pay, even though I manage to find the opportunities to be the one paying. 

Anyway, I feel like I'm starting to fall for him. He's so sweet to me, so comforting, he really makes me feel appreciated and cared for.

A few days ago he told me that he wants to make me happy and that he'll try his best to help me with my self-confidence so I'll be able to find a partner. That made me a bit sad, feeling like he was drawing a line between us.

Does he like me or am I getting ahead of myself just because he's doing the bare minimum and I'm not used to that?   
I'm scared to tell him about all these because:

1. I have bad experiences with guys I had a crush on and after I told them I liked them I got rejected. So I'm not willing to do anything like that anymore.
2. We get along so well that I'm afraid that everything will go down the drain and I'll lose a very good friend.

We’ve never really fought and have been great friends the entire time. 

The past 5 years I worked my tail off supporting him through his graduate program. Took care of the finances (working 12-14 hour days between full time work and side hustles), handled most of the household chores, and did about 95% of the dog care. It was hard but I was proud of him for pursuing his dream, and I wanted to be a supportive spouse. I believe I was! 

Now that he’s out of school and has a decent job, I thought things would get a lot better. We don’t struggle financially anymore, but I’m having a really hard time feeling happy again with him. I honestly think I’m just spent and drained, and I don’t know how to get out of my negative thought spiral. 

Important note: we’d been talking about starting a family so I came off the pill in September, which may be playing a role, but now that it feels like a real possibility, I’m panicking about the prospect of having a child with him. He’d be a loving dad, but man, given how poorly he takes care of himself and how little he did around the house these last five years, I know I’d be on my own for the “work” parts of child rearing and I just can’t handle that. 

I want to be happy with him, be attracted to him, and enjoy everything we worked so hard for. I don’t know why I can’t and am hoping to hear from other couples who have recovered from similar challenges. I start therapy after the Thanksgiving holiday which should help. I know it’s not depression - I’ve been there before and am happy with the rest of my life.

So I posted a long time ago about this guy I was seeing. We had a great connection. I don’t meet many people who strike me in a way that he did. He’s charismatic, intelligent, got his life together and successful. I felt like I met my match. We were seeing eachother for over 4 months and there was no rush on his behalf for commitment and it ended up being a situationship that I walked away from because he couldn’t give me what I required: I was falling in love with him and now I realise this. I blamed myself for a while m thinking it’s me. I’m not good enough - he just isn’t into me.

HOWEVER 

I left and I moved on. For the past few months I’ve been doing my thing, single girl life. Lots of time with friends, family &amp; working at my job. Been feeling GREAT and gained confidence again. He has tried reaching out to me a few times: saying it sucks we don’t talk anymore. wants to get a drink etc with me. I dismissed them. However last week I caved. I thought I could just see him casually (the fun stuff) and no emotion as I felt over it. 

We had a date Friday and it was great. I planned on being a little cold but it was like nothing ever happened and we was back to how we were before, the connection &amp; energy was just great (as well as the bedtime stuff). He said to me that evening that he’s only felt the way he has with me with one other person and he wanted to see me again. But then asks in the morning did I want that to be a one time thing or just a casual seeing eachother thing because he’s still not prepared to get in any serious relationship. But why is he messaging me saying it sucks we don’t talk if he knows I’m not here to go back to how things were? he wants to have his cake and eat it. I also have ‘needs’ and he does cater toward those very well. Unlike anyone else I’ve ever had before. And it’s killing me because he is very loving but still says he doesn’t want to lead me on. Why are some people like this? 

It’s hard I listen to all the TikTok’s, I did no contact. I moved on. But those feeling had start to resurface as the way we are with eachother is just so right. It feels like it’s right.

I met a girl, let's call her Jenny, a couple months ago. Things with her hit pretty fucking well, she's sweet, inteligent, beautiful, treats everyone so kindly. She is recently divorced from a 5 year marriage. I thought it was too good to be true.

Well, today I found out that it is indeed too good to be true. My sister's friend is cousin of one of the oldest friends of Jenny, and told us that Jenny used to cheat on her husband with her college teacher. She worked 6 years on a dental clinic and also cheated with her wealthy customers, whose wifes were friends with the owner of the clinic. The owner eventually found out and fired Jenny, who now works on another clinic here in my city, and apparently is doing fine.

I still didn't talk about it with Jenny, but today she told me her she was very unhappy in her previous marriage, her husband was explosive, treated her family poorly and was making Jenny turn into someone different than herself, just to make him happy. This unfulfilment on the marriage paired with the fact that she worked on an environment filled with wealthy man could have lead her to do those things.

I really want to believe that since she recently divorced, it's like a reset button on her life. She is seriously one of the best person I've ever met, we conected right of the bat, my friends also liked her. I met her younger sister (19F), and the way they treat each other and her parents is so lovely. I really really can't wrap my head around Jenny doing those things in the past.

I don't know how to conduct this situation. I'm still trying to digest the information, but my main plan is to make her open up about it eventualy, I really want to hear that full story from her mouth.
