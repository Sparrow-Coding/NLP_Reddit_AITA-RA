We had an argument over something trivial and stupid but it became huge unexpectedly. I think she was frustrated that we argue a lot and also because the relationship became a bit stale, so it kind of tipped her over the edge.

After this, we didn't talk for 2 days (she usually freaked out if I didn't send a goodnight message, so this was super unusual). I sent a long message to her apologizing (I probably shouldn't have, because I did nothing wrong lol) and she didn't reply. After this, I went to her apartment.

She allowed me in but she was like ""What do you want?"" and seemed upset and mad. She was yelling at me that ""We are over!"" and saying that she can't handle it anymore. I tried to explain things to her and convince her, but it didn't work. She said that she was done and that she never has/never will get back together with an ex.

This is the strange part. I started talking about our memories, like ""I will never forget our first kiss, attending your graduation etc"" and she started to look sad and soften up. She then let me hold her and hug her very closely, and we started to make out for a few minutes. I said ""I love you so much and I will really miss you"" She said ""I'll miss you too"". And then I went home

When I got home, I send her a message saying that I will never forget her and she said ""I'll never forget you either"". That was 5 days ago and we haven't talked at all since. She hasn't blocked me on social media but she has deleted our pictures together.

She's a very sensitive, stubborn and emotional type of girl. I think she has trouble controlling her emotions. I remember 2 weeks ago she said ""I still love you I think, because I would feel lost if we broke up and I wouldn't even know what to do with myself"".

What do you think going full no contact will do? I think she expected me to text her, because when she was breaking up with me I said ""I want to come to your house on Sunday"" and she said ""Just text me, I don't want you to come to my apartment ever again"".

I'm unsure of whether I even want her to text me back. But do you think she will text me back based on what I've written? How do you think she's feeling if you had to guess?

Or maybe just to vent. I recently got married two months ago to my now husband. We started our relationship a year and a half ago, fell in love and moved in with eachother and etc.

At first, as with most new relationships, things were great. Sex was frequent and amazing. We were so connected. Within just a few short months though, I noticed he started to disconnect from me sexually. I would say three months in? And I chalked it up to the fall of the honeymoon stage for him. I thought with time, we would get to know eachother better, fall in love, and things would improve. Well, they didn’t. Sex got rare. Touching was almost never initiated on his behalf. There were times he swatted my hands away from him. Sex became him just staring blankly into my eyes. This went on for months until I finally confronted him. Of course, nothing was wrong. I would search the internet for reasons this would drop off so fast. I was still so crazily attracted to him, I was so confused as to why he was so cold. 

A year later, we got married. Things would get better for a week, then go back to him Completely checking out the sexual aspect of our relationship. We have had many arguments about this Issue, and when I finally confronted him about porn being the problem he denied everything. It wasn’t until another argument two days ago in the early morning, where I was left crying And feeling so tired of being undesired by my own husband, That he finally Admitted he had a problem. And this was after I saw an email from Twitter with nudes of another female Open in front of me on his phone. I texted him later in the day about it and told him that I think that he has a problem and it’s affecting our sex life greatly. It was then that he finally said He was very addicted to porn and it was “so embarrassing how addicted” he is. 

Part of me is angry that he could never tell me out right before marriage. Part of me feels like I can’t really trust him. I have no problem with him expressing his sexuality or discovering things he may like, but it’s drove a wedge between us and now I’m newly married and stuck trying to navigate an addiction that he has had since his teenage years.

In more recent years, my mother worked on her codependency issues, and during a long stretch of her being single, managed to rebuild broken relationships with her children and grandkids. 

Recently she got married to a 4th husband, and ""her from 2002"" showed back up. Codependent to the point that she only seeks to make the new man happy, and she neglects her family.  Her grandchildren have complained to my siblings that when she is babysitting, she just waits on her husband hand and foot, and they go without attention. She is mean and belittling to the ones he doesn't like, and favors the ones he does. 

I live out of state and was in town for a very short while, but actually left my trip early after her husband attacked my character and said some pretty terrible things because I refused to agree with him about a political topic. It was completely out of left field and intended to cut deep. 

 This triggered a gtfo reflex in me, so I drove home across state lines that night. When I tried to call and hash it out later, he refused to talk to me, and she told me to ""take it up with him"" when I called her.  He told me it was silly to try to resolve this "" especially over the phone"" (literally the only option),  but texted that I was ""welcome any time"" and to ""stay in touch *with mom*."" It felt phony and passive agressive. 

I tried to pretend like I was fine and that I could get over it.  I kept calling her, keeping tabs on her health and things-- until one day I realized we were basically talking about the weather and trying to get off the phone ASAP every time. At this point, for the first time in my life, I was like, ""Screw it, I am not talking to her until she calls me for a change.""  

*I am glad I didn't hold my breathe.* Maybe 2 months later she sent me a text that said, ""hope all is well just thinking of u""-- but never picked up the phone to call. I just said ""fine-- hope all is well with you!"" because I didn't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with it. About a month later she texted again-- but this time actually asked ""how r u?"" and I said, ""fine thanks- Hope all is well with you!""

Then, a day later, she texted back: ""no u r not. What is wrong with you?""

I realized at that point that she just only wanted to have a text relationship-- so I texted that I was fine,  but I felt abandoned by what had happened and that I loved her and I hope that she was doing well. ---&gt; I got no response.  I told my sister about it, and she sent me a screenshot of a post my mother had made on facebook a few hours after I texted that basically said *“ when people tell you that you are not enough for them, maybe THEY aren’t enough for YOU.”* 

This devastated me, because I am, you know, her child,  but also made me furious, like she was playing the victim for the world to see. 

Two weeks later, two or three whole weeks before my birthday, and unmarked box came in the mail from Amazon. It was a hideous sweater that was three sizes too large for me.  No note. No card. I literally thought Amazon had made a mistake.  I emailed them and let them know that I got a package that was probably for somebody else. They just said no worries and that they would reimburse whoever bought it. Two days later, it occurred to me that it was probably from her, but just stuffed down that thought/feeling out of self-preservation. 

Then, two weeks later,  the evening before my birthday, I got a text from my mother telling me that she hoped I would enjoy my day and “hopefully got a gift of a sweater.” --- At this point, I basically lost my s\*\*\*. --- I sent her a river of a text message  telling her that it made me feel really lousy that she would send such a thoughtless gift, almost as if she was checking it off her to-do list. I also brought reciepts: I sent her the screenshot of what she had posted on Facebook the few weeks prior, and told her that too was hurtful. I basically told her I wasn't going to have a fake text relationship with her, but if she wanted a real one, should could always call me on the phone. 

After that point, I've heard nothing from her. 

I think I just have to let it go but it's really hard for me.  I guess I want advice from people who have experienced this type of complex abandonment. How do I move on from this? I feel like I'm grieving the death of my mother before she's gone. Please help if you have any insight.

The insecurities only grew in the past few months and I started developing some insecurities too because of some friends she had sex with before and even had relationships with them in the past and she still talked to them.

Finally we get to an agreement, I don't talk to my friend and she didn't talked to her friends.

I agreed because I couldn't stand her laughing at the phone while talking with those friends. But deep inside I hated it, so I kept talking with my friend and deleting the conversation everytime. 

One day my friend sent a pic of her going into the bathroom to take a bath, nothing was visible, only her face. My reply said to the Pic said:

some weird things happened after that like running into him in a town 30mins away in the middle of a crowded bar. A LOT of synchronicities. 

we went on a couple dates, and everything was amazing, ethereal, I felt like I was in a movie it was so special. the connection was unmatched. 

he just recently gotten out of a long serious relationship though. 
we texted everyday, hung out at least once a week, and liked the same stuff and always had fun and easy conversations. we got each other on a different level. 
I felt like I wasn’t getting enough validation about what was going on, I didn’t want to just be a situationship, I wanted more. I caught a lot of feelings. 
so I brought it up a couple times, then i eventually ended things because he wasn’t ready for anything serious and said that he needs to be at “110% before being able to take on a responsibility like that again”
it was a really mature and kind and amicable ending. 
the weekend after ending, he saw me out, tried to come up to me twice, and eventually got a convo w me, and said “he knew he would see me here”. we talked and went home together. then never spoke after. 

my point is, is that it’s been a few weeks and I can’t seem to get him out of my head. it’s clouding my mind so badly. I miss him so much. and I KNOW I don’t need him, he just adds so much to my life, so much joy and energy. he is just the first guy i’ve ever met that genuinely made me feel like me and added to me in positive ways. 

&amp; I saw him at a festival this weekend out of thousands of people &amp; made eye contact for a solid minute.

I need help approaching a guy that I can't return his feelings because I just don't feel the spark between us after reflecting on it fully. I think it is best to know the backstory of this. He has a crush on me for four years and I felt the same way, but more like a happy crush. He finally asked me out a few months ago but I feel indecisive about it because I'm just not ready to be in a relationship. I want to finish my academics in college first and get a stable job, and that's when I can freely start dating because I'm not relying on my parent's pocket money for me. I have also talked to my mom about this and she said to finish my studies first and agrees with me which is comforting for some reason because I really don't want to be in a relationship in college right now. Nursing is already a hectic course. I have told him about these things and he agrees into waiting for me which gives me a new problem because I don't want to give him hope that things will go his way. At that point I like him but I still do not know how long I will like him so I agreed that he could wait for me because I have thought that maybe my feelings will grow for him after some time. So we began seeing each other. I met his friends and family, and he often drives me home after Uni. But as days go by, I feel obligated to chat him whenever he messages me. I don't miss him after days of not talking to each other because of our busy schedule. I don't feel like going out with him or get to know him. I honestly find him a tad bit boring. The turning point where I decided that I want to end whatever we had now is when I feel irritated when he jokes around in the ways that isn't even cute (e.g. you're on a diet because you want to be sexy for someone right?) . And then I realized that he's not even cute. I honestly feel like an asshole. He is trying his best. He is a thoughtful person. He respects my boundaries like when I don't feel like talking to anyone and he gives me gifts that I highly appreciate such as giving me food and offering to give me a ride home. He always reassures me that he's just a call away if I need anything and that is really kind of him. That's why breaking things off is hard for me because it feels like I am an ungrateful asshole. But I just don't feel anything for him. I don't want him to hope that there is an Us soon because I just don't want to be in a relationship right now. I don't know how to say it without offending him and feel resentful at me. It concerns me how his friends and family will think of me. I just feel anxiety because of what will happen to me after.

For the next 6 months we couldn’t get enough of each other. We went on get always, we’d sneak over to each other houses mid work day, we’d hike, watch tv. I learned how to cook vegan recipes, and I’ve never been so head over heels in love. 

From the beginning my whole heart and body and head was like “she’s the one”. But I was 6 months into a separation and about 1 month into my divorce filings.

Over the next 3 months she became distant, upset I wasn’t divorced, and exhausted by her life as a single mom. She stopped wanting to meet, no longer showed interest in intertwining our live, meeting my friends, ect. 

She said she felt guilty I was the only one trying to make it work, and that I deserved someone better who would meet me where I am and could be as kind and caring as I was for her. At the time I agreed with her. I do deserve someone who can love me back fully. 

But it’s been four months 2 of trying to “date” but I realized I’m so far from over her. She truly is a sweet caring beautiful person who when we were both in love an amazing partner. 

We broke up and neither one of us has reached out since. I was sick I’ve always reaching out and keeping the thing going but also hoping she’d come back on her own but she suffers from anxiety and depression and tends to believe the worst in herself.

Everyone knows Tinder is an app for something casual, so I wasn't expecting to foot the bill for any dates. But I did foot the bill for our first dinner just to be nice, and then she was really cute so I asked her to meet again. I didn't say it was a date nor mention I was taking her out the second time, just asked her to meet and it was HER idea to go to a restaurant.

This time, when the bill came, she smiled casually and said, ""You wanna get that?"" I looked her in the eye and said no. ""Equality"".

She then suddenly looked uncomfortable and literally burst into tears. It was nuts. She said it made her feel like she was worthless and that this has never happened to her before and that she hates cheap guys. She then said she spent a lot of time and effort getting ready and that I made her feel unattractive/unappreciated.

I was not going to be manipulated, so instead of sitting there listening to her rant/cry, I threatened to get up and leave. I also reminded her that I had lots of other girls who were interested in me. She panicked and pleaded with me to stay and put her card in.

I put in my card too to pretend I was splitting it, but it was HER turn to pay so I secretly locked my card to ensure I wouldn't have to.

Then when her card got charged the whole thing, her sadness changed to anger and she looked at me, then huffed out of the restaurant and seemed extremely furious.

I again told her she NEVER communicated she expected me to pay the second time. Her reply was that ""no answer is an answer"" as she had originally ignored me when I first asked her out/asked her if she expected guys to pay and only agreed to the first date once I offered to pay. I then said I always split the bills on second dates and she said ""that's why you don't have a GF"", which I thought was ridiculous.

Just wondering, why would a girl cry about being asked to pay? I mean, it just seems so bizarre.

One such hurtle is when we’re watching shows together, she tends to talk a decent amount about sleeping with other guys in the shows, movies or books she reads. It can be a little uncomfortable. She recently joked about if I were a shapeshifter, I could turn into one of them and do things to her like that.

But long story short my dad passed away when I was 16. When I was 17 or 18 (can’t remember) I started working minimum wage jobs. I remember one time I was leaving to get a haircut and my mom stopped me and asked “really? You’re supposed to be using that money to help ME.” To which I was like wtf, it’s not like we live in some dump where you need money from my minimum wage job. 

Earlier this year I found out that I was supposed to receive $160k of inheritance money. Somehow my mom cashed the check in her name. Apparently the $500k she got was not enough for her.

After months of UGLY arguing she offered to give me $50k of it now, and $80k later. 


Literally 2 or 3 weeks after giving me $50k, she asked to borrow $30k, and now she wants to borrow $15k more. Before giving me $50k I was able to see that she has at least $300k in assets. 

I feel like she has always seen herself as more important than me. If I don’t have my own family and I’m not even done with school yet, no shit you have more “responsibilities” than me. But it’s not fair. I wouldn’t have even found out about this money had I not snooped around and confronted her about it.

My current bf, I will call Texas. Texas and I have known each other for three years now. We started dating very soon after meeting each other, it was my first relationship irl and we gave each other our virginity. He's a great guy and I do love him, but I believe I only love him as a friend. Our relationship has been rocky, it has been on again and off again for three years. I feel a lot of it is my fault due to my poor mental health and slue of conditions. We are bad at communicating. My biggest problem is physical. I never want to have sex, I am not attracted to him in that way and even recently kissing him has become a challenge. This may seem obvious to others but I am unhappy in this relationship, however whenever things end with him I always feel so alone and come crawling back to him. He's one of my only friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my ex, we'll call Paul. We dated for 11 months, but this was a long distance relationship. That is why I ended things with him. I felt with him being 6 hours ahead I was always online just to be with him and this was cutting into my real life, I wasn't taking care of myself. Paul made it worth it though, I never wanted to be without him, we'd sleep on calls together and text constantly and I never felt smothered. I never felt so intensely for someone, I did everything a good girlfriend would do. I felt he also understood me in a way no one else could because he also had mental issues like I did, it helped so much to have someone finally understand. He provided and cared for me in ways no one had before. I still think about him every day and do all the things I used to do with him, I miss him so bad and regret ending things. Physically I find him very attractive and often think of him when I pleasure myself. It hurts me so badly now to think he could be giving his love to someone else instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the right thing to do is to end things with Texas. I just don't know how. How do I tell him I've lost interest after telling him nothing has been going on and everything is fine? How do I break his heart for the upteenth time and lose my best friend? Even if I do all this I'm not guaranteed to get Paul back, he's told me he doesn't love me anymore but I feel that if we loved each other as much as we promised then there's a chance it would still work out. I know this may sound crazy to others, I'm planning to go to a therapist that specializes in relationships. Sometimes getting an outsider's perspective also helps, or maybe someone else has been in my shoes and can help me.

In middle school I was relentlessly bullied and hurt, because of my 6th grade gf. So believe it or not I was a edgy 6th grader who wanted attention and I said some dumb things for attention, and eventually after like a year she left me, admitted she had been having sex with a high schooler. So I was sad, and mad, and in my anger I said I could tell everyone she had sex with a high schooler. She took it horribly as you would guess and she told everyone all the stupid lies I said and I was horribly bullied for the rest of middle school, dont get me wrong I deserved it for a bit, but halfway through 7th I was a different person and realized what I did and I felt bad. But I was in a horribly cringey ""nerd"" group for the rest of middle school and I hated almost all of them. On the last day of 8th as i was walking home i cried tears of joy realizing I'm out of that friend group. It wasn't until I was out of middle school when i realized i have severe social anxiety, and for the first few months of freshman, I didnt care. It has ruined my relationship with my family, whenever they say something I  mumble and shrug, say idk and its not just them, its everyone but my friends I do this to. My grades are bad because of it, I dont ask for help and I have no motivation to do work, I just hate my life and myself for being such a social reject, people talk to me and they will say something funny, and I feel like I know what to say back but I just cant and I mumble or just smile and shrug. I hate it. So st the start of freshman, this girl I looked at in class all the time came up to me at the end of class and nervously walked up to me and asked for my snap, I typed it in and she walked out. I was so nervous and excited because that was the first time a girl has asked for my snap since 6th grade. Another thing to add, my friends target me and bully me, and they gave me shit for being nervous when that happened. When I got on the bus she texted me and we texted all the time and it was nice. Homecoming was coming up and she really wanted me to go but I was too nervous and just tried to brush her off even though I liked her. I just too anxious to commit and I kept trying to brush her off. Her and her friend would come up and talk to me and flirt with me and obviously I would just shrug and mumble. But my friend said if I went with her he would go with her friend so I went, she looked so good in her dress, and we had a good time, although of course I said almost nothing to her. We danced together at the end ,and then I left. For more weeks, her and her friend would sit down with me and talk to me, and yup I still mumbled and shrugged and idked. Now on the text side of things with her, she was opening up to me and talked about things that have happned in her life, and I'm pretty good at helping people, so I comforted her over text and let her talk about it. I'm not going to say anything about her problems. So we were becoming closer and closer over text, yet in person I just couldn't speak still. Eventually she stopped talking to me in person and said if I dont talk, she wont talk, and i said that's fair, I've told her about why i mumble and shrug and she understands and promises that she wont lose interest and stay until I'm able to talk to her. I want to let you all know, she is very attractive and alot of guys and even good looking ones like her and they all actually are able to talk to her and make her laugh, and it makes me jealous but we wrent dating so I try not to let it affect me. To Me, she has way better options and I still dont understand why, but she still chooses me, she still wants me and she promises she wont give up on me. Well recently her older sister said that until I can talk to her, we should just be friends, and that made her sad but thought it was reasonable, and I just agreed. More and more she responds less over text, never looks at me in class, talks and laughs with other guys. It makes me feel like shes losing interest but she is promising she isnt, and to let you know because of a suicide of one of her very close friends, she is very serious about promises and they mean alot to her so I know she is serious. Also, her friends have left her recently over something stupid. So now she lost her friend group. The past few days she responds very 30 mins to an hour and has been acting kinda different, and I think it's because her sister tried to kill herself, her friends left her, and her mom isnt that nice to her, I've been helping her through it but idk if I'm helping. I started taking ashwagandha ksm anxiety medicine so I can be able to talk to her, but it's been a week of 2 pills every morning and I'm noticing no changes in my social anxiety, and my grades are horrible and idk what to do. I just want to be able to talk to her so so bad. I want to be able to have a good relationship with her one day, I just want to be comfortable around her. Someone help me because if this anxiety medince doesn't work then i dont know what I'm gonna do.

a) If I seem like I have been out getting lots of attention from women, lots of sex, etc, or

b) That I am selective, and haven’t found a good girlfriend yet.


Basically— would she see me as pathetic if she knew I haven’t had anyone since her, or would she find it attractive that she’s the only one I’ve ever had still? I know for certain she has dated someone briefly in between our relationship, if that matters.

My mom babied us both all of our lives. I always fought against it and for my independence while he took advantage of it. My mom has huge insecurity issues so of course she has a soft spot for him because he “needs her more” (cooks and cleans for him, does his laundry, everything). 

He’s nice and a good brother when things are calm but then he expects me to do those things for him too. He and I live together and share a bathroom but he gives himself priority. He takes forever in there and gets annoyed if I’m using it when he wants to use it. We just fought bc he said he expects me to wait till he showers before I go, which is beyond insane to me. He sets standards for others that he doesn’t uphold himself (leaves dishes in sink, laundry in dryer for days, etc but gets extremely angry if others do it).

He’s always accusing me of gaslighting him while he calls me a child and berates me. I’m known as the responsible one between the two of us so idk where he gets off calling me a child. He gets defensive whenever I calmly try to talk to him.

Last night she messaged me out of the blue after not talking for months, and asked if I wanted to come to her apartment. At the time we worked together she had a boyfriend, but she told me that she secretly wanted to hook up with me the entire time we worked together. I said yes.

She is 21, and I am 27(m). She was pretty open about the fact that after her breakup about 10 months ago, she's just been sleeping with a bunch of guys and girls. She also added me to a list of people she's slept with. The strange thing to me was that she was super intimate after the sex. Cuddling, touching, talking about our pasts and personal traumas etc etc. It was really nice after not dating for a very long time.

Long story short, it feels like my heart hurts. Idk if it was just those brief intimate moments we had, or if it's some sort of jealousy with her sleeping with other people. I just don't know why I care so much after only sleeping with her once. She has a crazy past, and a messed up family life, but even so, I still want to spend time with her and get to know her. 

After our hookup, I went home and texted her, pretty much saying how I appreciated our time together and that I would like to see her again, but to go on a date instead of just a hookup. She said she was open to it, but that she gets nervous when people pursue her, and that she's a very bad communicator, but she would try her best.

My baby brother deals with a lot of mental issues and has a mentality of a child. He’s always wanted to get a place of his own, but we were always really skeptical. Finally, earlier this year, we decided to compromise and let him move into a facility that specializes in helping people with mental issues integrate into society. He got a job, basically lived on his own with check-ins, and was doing well there.

During his stay at the facility, he met his girlfriend. She suffers from a great deal of problems as well, and it causes her to get pretty violent. My brother came to us a couple of months ago and asked us if he could move in with her at her place because at the facility, they don’t allow overnight stays. We said no, and he ended up forging my dad’s signature to get out of the facility. We found out about this, but we were told that nothing could be done because my brother didn’t show enough signs of dependency issues (aka he looks “normal” so he must be fine!). A little while after, we found out his girlfriend was pregnant. We all honestly just tried out best to stay calm despite the circumstances. 

My brother and his girlfriend came to stay with me this week. I just wanted to ease the tension, because ever since we found out she was pregnant, I feel like it's just been really off. As I mentioned before, my brother has child-like mannerisms, and when he annoys her, he thinks it’s very hilarious, just as a little boy would. We were at home, and I was cooking. I left the food to boil on the stove while we were all in the dining room. His girlfriend was talking, and he kept repeating after her. She kept telling him to stop, but it only made him want to do it more. After a few times of telling him to stop, she became extremely angry, grabbed the boiling food from the stove, and chucked it at him. He got out of the way in time, started dying laughing and goes “you missed just like last time”. I’m thinking…last time? I’m very scared for them, because I fear that someone will get seriously hurt. Not only that, but there is a baby coming in this situation, and I would do anything to protect this child if I can. These two are not equipped to raise a child, this is not me being judgy, this is just me being real. I don't know if I want to call the help services because last time I called them (when he moved out the facility), they told me that my brother was fine. The thing about it is becaus emy brother physically looks ""normal"", they're not will to help.

But I want to get this off my chest anyway. We're already seeing couples counselling again so we're getting professional help already.  

Anyway, if you would read my last post you'd see that the experience of my partner wanting to open up the relationship in some way was rather devastating to me, to say the least. The last year has been very rough, it got a lot better at first after the few months where I was just unable to cope, I started to try and look into her way of seeing things.  

I thought to myself.. if I really care about this 8 year marriage, and her, what's stopping me from just accepting these things? See what it's like to talk to other people myself and see how that feels. There's no way going back anyway any more, so I might as well try to understand her side more. Even though I still find it extremely utopian. (I write this as if it was easy, it was absolutely NOT easy. Not in the slightest)

My idea of monogamy in this particular relationship is dead anyway, and I definitely mourned the future I had in my head. But.. I definitely still very much love my partner despite the difficult communication problems we face.  

But alas, here we are. In the end I am now in contact with a wonderful person and now my partner can't handle me having feelings. I have... an easy time having people be interested in me, I don't know why. I've talked to four people total over the last year for various amounts of time. And declined advances three times. And three ended up no contact, but it was an interesting experience (Purely online talking, no sexual contact whatsoever, just sharing their lives and experiences). And yes, all people were 100% informed about my situation of ''exploration'', nobody was used. Everyone was consenting and I was 100% transparent.  

But now, the fourth person? Well, she's just amazing. I warned my partner early and said ''She's dangerous, I will like her more fast. I don't think this is a good idea at all''. But she pressed on, guiding me, encouraging me to look more into it. So I did.  

Me and my partner ended up in a three-way chat with her and me and the woman clicked fast. And matched my way of communication a 100%. We talked a lot and frequently. Still, this was encouraged. But my partner quickly realized that we talked 100x more than she could ever write, she doesn't talk the same way I do anyway. I can talk forever with the right person, she can't. 

Eventually I was even encouraged to think about meeting, hugging and even cuddling (she lives a few hours away) which is a sensitive and awkward topic for me due to my past. But alas, she pushed and I caved and wondered, thought about it. And now I'd probably like it.  

Several (4-5?) months later and I am here. I basically have deep feelings for another person, as well as my partner but obviously VERY different people, she reciprocated everything I felt about her. Communication is on point, humour is exactly like mine and her way of expressing appeals greatly to me. What can I say, I like her a lot and I care a lot.  

We haven't met, and our communication is limited at the moment due to my partner freaking out. Apparently can't handle my/our intensity of talking/playing games and what I am feeling. What can I say? I didn't even want this in the first place and I warned her several times about it. I was *so clear* that this is risky and that she should be aware feelings develop no matter what if you stay in frequent contact with someone you really connect with. You can't just at some point say ''nope, not going to feel more now'' the only thing you can do is take distance and be aware of it early.  

But no, she pressed more. And now it's too much for her, and I am in this horrible position of having to decide to break contact completely with this other person, who did *everything* right. She is the most respectful person I've ever met and is extremely respectful towards my partner. And I am 100% transparent and open about everything and anything. There's nothing sexual, we don't even talk about doing anything together any more, we're just laughing about dumb stuff together and playing games. (Which my wife is also invited to)  

How is this fair? Why do I have to go through this hell of opening it up and only to end up having feelings for someone, and then be denied having this. While at the same time STILL saying she WISHES it were possible, but she can't get over her feelings.  

My feelings feel completely played with, and now I involved another innocent person who didn't know what she got herself into. I will never have enough space to talk about all the nuances that are at play.. it's frustrating. And I pity the nice person I met, she doesn't deserve this. 

I feel like I am going crazy, and I am likely just a weak person. But I just.. I just cared about my partner and tried to understand the why's.  

Is this fair to me? Am I just naïve? Am I being unfair? I feel so guilty for causing this problem now in our relationship despite feeling like I was told to do this...

Last year I ended a very long term relationship and took on a work contract across the country. I met a great group of 3 ladies and quickly developed a friendship with them. I have very few female friend. I generally relate better with men because they’re more easygoing. I enjoyed myself so much during that time that I ended up buying a home there. 
After I moved across the country by myself, I ended up getting very sick and was hospitalized for the first time in my life with anaphylaxis. While in hospital, I was the most scared and alone I’ve ever felt and these ladies were basically the only support system I had. A friend outside of the group of ladies is an experienced physician and while in hospital I asked if he should maybe be included in our group text. One of the ladies response was basically not to bother him because I was admitted to hospital anyway. For some reason, the way she responded felt so dismissive at a time when I was so sick and terrified, it made me feel even more alone and like I was a burden. After coming out of hospital, I basically withdrew from them. I didn’t want to bother them. I hung out with them once several weeks later when I was still recovering and felt insecure and disconnected. 
A couple of weeks later, the one who came across as dismissive called me and told me that I was passive aggressive towards her (there was one day that I didn’t respond to her text) and that I was a terrible friend because I wasn’t more grateful for “everything she’s done for me” (she had me over for Christmas dinner last year because I was alone and she introduced me to two people- I can assure you that I’ve expressed gratitude for these things). She also told me that she was “against” me having a friendship with the physician “from the beginning” and told me that basically I was being selfish for reaching out when I was sick because “everyone has a lot on their plate”. The only things I asked of them was if someone could drive me home from the hospital because it was Canada Day and I couldn’t get a cab (they couldn’t so I eventually got myself home), and I asked if they’d stop in for a glass of wine the following day because it was one of the ladies birthdays. Even though I wasn’t well enough to celebrate, I just wanted to see some friendly faces and feel included. They didn’t come by. 
Since having the ugly blowout phone conversation, she ended it by saying that she isn’t interested in a friendship. I’ve literally never been unfriended so swiftly and harshly in my life. It bothered me immensely.
A couple of days ago she texted me to see if we could have a fresh start because we have friends in common and she doesn’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable. 
As far as I’m concerned, I want nothing to do with her, but I care about the other two ladies that were in our group. I don’t know how to respond. I feel like whether I respond or not, I will come across as being petty.

Hi yall I would greatly appreciate some advice on my relationship. I (22f) am dating a (22m) we have been dating for two years and since the very beginning, we have had the same fight about sex. At the beginning of our relationship, we both had a talk about our sex drives he has a high sex drive while I have the very opposite. We thought we could figure it out but as of late no matter how hard I work or what I do I can't raise or meet in the middle I love him so very much. Also, he has recently said that sex is a condition for our relationship. Update I had a very long talk with my boyfriend and he apologized for saying that sex is a condition and says he is going to do better on his side. I also can't help but still think about him saying that among other things. He is trying very hard but I am worried will he resent me and that I will never be able to meet his needs and vice versus. Update Update another fight I told him that I didn't want to have sex after we talked about it the other day and he told me that I never consider his feelings among many other things. I got defensive and I asked him to leave because I was not in a state to be talking I was far too emotional. He left and I broke down to my mom about everything he later texted saying he was having a panic attack so we face time to calm him down but I can't tell if he manipulated me with his emotions or if he is just being open.

I told him at the start of our friendship I didn’t want to be in a relationship and he said that’s okay we can try.

I loved his company. It’s when we were apart he just wasn’t there enough. It’s not that I wanted constant contact 24/7 but definitely something a bit more regular. 

I told him I didn’t want to continue being his friend and he said he’d compromise and change. I mean I believed him, he’s never lied to me before but it didn’t come from him. 

Our needs didn’t match up so I called it quits. I’m open to men that are more available and I’ve realised I do want a relationship.

I am 19 years old and I have been dating this girl (19) for almost 2 years. We do long distance and see each other a lot throughout the year. We have been going extremely strong and have very minor problems. 

Last weekend I was drinking at a party with a large group of guys from my college. There was women who were friends of guys that had been invited over. Probably a total of 80 people. We had been drinking pretty heavily throughout the night. Around 12am I had a girl come up to me and ask me if I wanted to have sex with her friend. Immediately I replied “no I have a girlfriend” all my boys know this and keep women away aswell from me.  The night had continued and I was getting more and more intoxicated. I had informed this lady about 4 times more that I still did not want to sleep with her. It was probably 4 am at this point when I decided to smoke weed for the first time in a while. Keep in mind I’m already a case and half of beer deep. This fucked me. I was so gone that boys had to carry me to my buddies bed. This is where I thought my night ended.

At approximately 5-6am this lady had made her way to my room. This is when I assume what happened, happened. I wokeup the next morning at 10am (alone keep in mind) to go throw up. I was still pretty drunk. A buddy of mine comes up and starts asking why I would cheat and yelling at me. I was so utterly confused I thought he was just pulling my leg. Turns out she left at 8am and told everyone we had sex. I was devastated. Not remembering what had happened I talked to a couple friends who told me to let the air calm down. I now have girls telling me I’m such a terrible person and they will tell my gf if I don’t. 

I just want to know what I should do. I never consented to this woman unless I did while utterly drunk. My buddies are giving terrible advice so I thought I would ask here. Do I tell my girlfriend ? Will this ruin all the trust we have ? I honestly don’t even know  if I even had sex or if she’s lying. I’m just worried another girl will tell her first and then she will never believe me.

It isn't an update per se, I just have more questions.

I am 19 years old and I have been dating this girl for almost 2 years. We do long distance and see each other a lot throughout the year. We have been going extremely strong and have very minor problems. 

Last weekend I was drinking at a party with a large group of guys from my college. There was women who were friends of guys that had been invited over. Probably a total of 80 people. We had been drinking pretty heavily throughout the night. Around 12am I had a girl come up to me and ask me if I wanted to have sex with her friend. Immediately I replied “no I have a girlfriend” all my boys know this and keep women away aswell from me.  The night had continued and I was getting more and more intoxicated. I had informed this lady about 4 times more that I still did not want to sleep with her. It was probably 4 am at this point when I decided to smoke weed for the first time in a while. Keep in mind I’m already a case and half of beer deep. This fucked me. I was so gone that boys had to carry me to my buddies bed. This is where I thought my night ended.

At approximately 5-6am this lady had made her way to my room. This is when I assume what happened, happened. I wokeup the next morning at 10am (alone keep in mind) to go throw up. I was still pretty drunk. A buddy of mine comes up and starts asking why I would cheat and yelling at me. I was so utterly confused I thought he was just pulling my leg. Turns out she left at 8am and told everyone we had sex. I was devastated. Not remembering what had happened I talked to a couple friends who told me to let the air calm down. I now have girls telling me I’m such a terrible person and they will tell my gf if I don’t. 

I just want to know what I should do. I never consented to this woman unless I did while utterly drunk. My buddies are giving terrible advice so I thought I would ask here. Do I tell my girlfriend ? Will this ruin all the trust we have ? I honestly don’t even know  if I even had sex or if she’s lying.

I decided to take a break from trying to date and started getting into casual. All of my friends think it’s weird and it’s strange to sleep with a guy/guys I don’t know that well. All I need is to like the guy just a little bit and be attracted.

I tried talking to her directly on Facebook because i still don't want to see her. I need my space.

 But I told her I'm not cut out for the high drama life and that I want to know I don't need to worry about her drinking, but with how she behaves with her family and how she behaved with my family when she drinks, I have cause for concern.

I told her that I want her to work on her anger issues. That I get she says she's an angry person in general but I don't think she is, when she is good she's an amazing person.

I also said that I want us to work and build a future but I also want growth, I know she may not be used to a man asking for this because men suck but this is something important to me and I need her to work on it.

All she said was ""I'm not interested in this conversation so all I'm going to say is that I hear you and leave it at that"". 

I'm upset about this response. I keep debating whether to stay or leave. Family is important to me and I don't want to have to worry she's going to misconstrue something during like, Christmas dinner and try to fist-fight my sister.

I know it sounds petty but hear me out, I moved away from home and live abroad, and almost every year my mom sent me homemade sweets which I really like during the festive season. But this year citing high shipping costs etc she didn’t.

I tried to be understanding of this but I felt hurt. I spent over $5000 to visit them earlier this year, stayed for over 3 weeks with them, and bought them presents &amp; gifts when I visited but the fact that she can’t even spend $150 to send me sweets during the festive time of the year is really bothersome to me.

I haven’t been picking up her phone or responding to her messages since then. I spoke to my sister who lives with my mom and both my sister and my mom did think this was the reason I wasn’t talking to her.

I would like to talk to my mom and acknowledge the reason for me ignoring and being upset with her but I feel like she should’ve known better. I can carry a grudge to my grave and my mom is aware of this. I don’t plan on talking to her unless she makes things right. My ego stops me from being upfront and asking her to send me sweets. I don't know how to approach this topic with her or give her the hint to make things right. Should I talk to my sister and have her tell my mom or is there a better way for me to convey the message?
