he has stayed gone for 8-12 hours a day without telling me where he’s at and told me today that he was thinking of staying at his grandmas since we first talked about this a few days ago. i think he’s trying to get me to break up with him so enlisting will be easier. i asked him if he talked with his daughters mom about this decision and he said he wasn’t planning on telling her anytime soon. i feel that’s unfair to his daughter.

This is going to be a long post.

&amp;#x200B;

My college started in mid-2018 and I had a crush on this one girl in my class. We talked and texted a little bit but mostly for class-related stuff. The next year I plucked up the courage to ask her on a date and she said yes (although I did not use the word ""date"", I just said we should hang out) and it went great. We started talking some more but then we hit a rough patch and stopped talking for a while for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2020 at the start of the COVID lockdown, we started talking again and it felt great. Eventually, after a few months, she confessed that she also had feelings for me and so our relationship began. From this point until the start of 2022 things were going great, obviously, we had tiny arguments here and there but I still loved her to death. Now since the lockdown began we hadn't seen each other so this was a long-distance relationship. In early 2022 our college started with offline classes so I could finally meet her for the first time after the start of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

When we first met (coincidentally it was on her birthday) I felt like the happiest man on Earth. The first hug was worth the pain of being in a long-distance relationship for more than a year. The first week went great, however, in the second week, she said that she wanted to talk to me privately about something. As I had guessed from the tone of her voice, the worst was about to happen. She said that she had lost feelings for me. When I asked why she lost feelings, she did not have an answer (and to this day she still doesn't have it). I was obviously very hurt but I accepted it and we broke up. We were still very good friends, I would even say we were best friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time passed but I still had strong feelings for her. We talked about it and she agreed that we would give the relationship another try. It was going well, we went on multiple dates, and had our first kiss. However, we had a small argument and that was enough for her to break up with me again. I again accepted it and continued to be friends with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I should mention that she was very close to her best friend, who was also in our class. During the course of our relationship I often felt that she spent way more time with her than me, I talked about this with my girlfriend and she agreed and promised that she would try to spend more time with me and to her credit she really did. I would have had no problem with her spending so much time with her friend but it got to a point where she did not let me join them for lunch. I was also not allowed to sit with them during class. Her excuse for this was that her friend was going through some mental health issues and thus needed someone to spend time with them. Fair enough, this was a genuine reason but why could I not get involved with them!? It's not like her friend did not like me, we had hung out together before and she seemed to be cool with me. I confronted my girlfriend about this and she said that she does not want to be seen with me in college. This was such a bullshit excuse because everyone knew that we were in a relationship. Worst of all, to her, even sitting for class together was a type of PDA. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I had lost all hope of ever getting back together and remained friends with her. I thought things would get better once we graduated and all of us went our separate ways. But during our final exams, things got messy. We were study partners and had been for a long time. She ignored my texts and calls for the entire weekend. When she finally replied, she said that her friend was visiting her house for the weekend so she did not get time to reply back. I LOST IT. I sent a long text criticizing her and blaming her for being an asshole and wasting literal years of my life. Was it justified? I don't know. Did it feel right at the time? Hell yeah. Needless to say, we broke contact after this.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I know that to me my actions were justified, I still regretted them.  She was my best friend, my only TRUE friend. So I tried contacting her a few weeks later to talk over things. We agreed that we would gradually start talking again and give each other time to heal. And so we did. Fast forward to last week, and things were good. Not how I would like them to be, but good. We talk regularly but she does not seem as interested in talking with me as she used to be. I talk about anything I can think of, just to keep the conversation going but she does not put in any effort. Now I understand that we are not as close as we were but she should at least put in some effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

So last weekend I told this to her and she said that she does not feel we are close enough to even talk about her day. This doesn't make sense to me, last week she said that she misses me and wants me to visit her and now she feels that I'm not good enough to even talk about how her day was?! I broke down and told her that I still had feelings for her. I asked if she felt that we could ever get back together. She declined by saying that we are incompatible. It hurt me so much. I've done nothing but good things for her and then she thinks we're incompatible just because of our past. I will agree that I have not been a perfect boyfriend but I will say I was pretty close to it. I always put her over me, always helped her in her time of need, never let her down, never swore at her, and never physically hurt her. Then why am I being treated like this? I did nothing wrong to deserve this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an introvert, I am not that close to my family, I only have very few REAL friends, and I have anxiety. It is difficult for me to make friends so when I do make one I try my best to keep them close. So even the thought of losing a friend makes me sad, now imagine what losing a girlfriend / best friend would feel like to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am confused about how to tackle this situation. Even though our past has not been the best, I do not want to lose her. Ideally, I would want us to get back together but that will likely never happen and I have to accept this. It's not fair for her to be forced to stay with me, she has a choice and I respect that. However we can still be friends, right? I just want her to treat me like a genuine friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am confused about what to do here. My life is already in shambles, I probably will have to quit my job in a few days, and my parents are having serious medical problems. I just want things to be better. Any advice would be helpful.

So I’m(22M) am horrible at reading signs. 
I’ve been talking with my classmate in one of my classes (23F) throughout the semester (around 3 months)and we have some good chemistry. Issue is, sometimes I feel like things are more than friendly and then other times I’m sure it’s just friendly. So I’ll go down a list of interactions and see what y’all think.

She always chooses to sit next to me and we can easily strike a conversation. This is in class, lab, or just when im chilling in the lobby.

She told me im “not allowed” to miss the classes and labs we have together. This is in regards to when I talk about how I might skip class to work on something else.

Similarly whenever I have to miss class she gives a slight teasing insult and messes with me with the response “that’s for missing class”

Regularly in class if lecture is slow, she’ll mess with me (she sits next to me). Generally by prodding me or moving my papers or wires a little. Mainly seems because she just wants a reaction out of me.

She asked for my number recently, but she doesn’t really text. For context my other classmate asked for mine for a study session later and she then asked for my number as well (after saying she couldn’t join us because she had work). 
She doesn’t ever text though even when she has my number. Whenever I text her though she responds in a few minutes at most, but it’s only ever been about school stuff. 
If neither of us have something to do between class she likes to stick around and chat about anything.

Today, when we found out our class we share was canceled during lab I made a passing comment of “oh I can finally eat lunch at my apartment”, to which she responded “no we should eat lunch together! Even though she told me she was planning on studying after lab. (Which she did eventually go to do, but she went from going to study for an hour and a half to 30 minutes due to us having lunch). She said the reason was because she doesn’t like to eat alone though. Which is where the friendly thing might be.

She often will playfully tap or rub my shoulder as well (usually if she’s excited or laughing), along with lots of teasing. 
When asked about the teasing she responded with “well I’d hug you but I don’t hug guys.” (no she’s not gay)

Lastly one time when we were talking she got uncomfortable and asked if we could move elsewhere to talk. She told me when asked it was because someone she went on one date with in the past was in the room. Then she proceeded to tell me how bad the date went and asked if I would do some of the things the guy would do on a first date.

Might also be worth noting that I’m generally a quiet guy and she is more extroverted. Some classmates have noticed I talk more when she is around and she responded to this comment with “I make him talk to me” in a happy tone.
She does talk to other classmates but talks to me most.

So after that long list is this the behavior of someone that is just super friendly or someone looking for more?

TLDR: classmate teases a lot, asked for my number(but never initiates a text convo), asked me to have lunch with them (spur of the moment not preplanned), and chooses to hangout in between classes we both share.

I'm 30m. I'm living at home and working remotely. My parents are 57f and 60m. If anyone has advice it would be good though.

My dad is in a routine that he does everyday. He's been retired for about a year. He hangs out on his laptop in the morining reading the news and watching YouTube. Then goes outside to do stuff in his shed, around the yard or in his workshop. At the end of the day, he has dinner and then watches a couple of hours of tv while drinking a few glasses of scotch. Every. Day. Maybe once a week, he, my mom and myself have dinner together.

My mom works from as a lead nurse practictioner, sometimes working well into the evening. Sometimes my mom sits on the couch with him and does stuff on her phone. She's not really interested in the things he watches. When he goes to bed, she puts on a Hallmark movie about a love story or something. Part of me thinks she might be trying to live vicariously through these movies/shows.

When it was warmer, they used to go for the occasional walk or sit outside by the fire on the patio. But it never really goes past that unless someone else plans it.

I honestly think he doesn't realize what is going on with the people around him and he thinks that's normal. He understands things but not so much interacting with people in his family. With his friends he's fine. I think he thinks this is a normal relationship, but I know my mom is looking for something more. But she doesn't push it becuase he gets stressed over stupid things. When he and my mom started dating he actually wrote her poetry.

My mom has worked for over two decades to help him manage his anger. Now that he's retired, it's subsided a bit. She worked really hard to get him a therapist he liked, who he talks to once a week. On the emotion human side of things, it's a one way street of my mom giving and him taking. Granted, if anyone needs help getting something fixed or preparing for a storm, he knows how to do that.

I asked things like, ""would you date me if we didnt meet irl? would you date me if x?"" ik thats childish but I had to know if these factors played a role.

He gave his honest opinion, which I wasn't very satisfied with. Paraphrased, the main advantage I had over his friends (who are also romantic material), was distance. We live in the same town, his friends don't. This makes me feel easily replaceable, that i was only chosen because i can see him irl.

He asked how I feel about his opinion, and I told him I want the kind of love that transcends everything, that I feel truly special to that person, like a rarity. That they'd choose me in other universes, they'd choose me even if we lived 2000 miles apart. I admit maybe it sounds naive, but I feel that this kind of love still exists.

I need to vent because I feel dumb. I recently got out of a relationship 2 months ago. So, I am moving on (or at the very least am trying to.) I contacted an old flame from earlier this year, this man was my first everything and I’m always going to have feelings for him. (I’m 22, he’s 30.) Long story short, me and him end up hooking up. It was great, and I thought I was numb…. But old feelings resurfaced the second time we hooked up yesterday. He said that I made him feel “uncomfortable” because he could probably feel that I still had feelings for him and said we should stop. I told him that I wanted the chance to date the healthy him. He then proceeded to tell me that he doesn’t see me like “that” and NEVER really liked me. He was just going through a breakup when we met, and I was there so he used me. 

When I first met this man, he was a weed addict, hurtful, jaded, the list goes on. It was intense when we started dating. He told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, he’s never felt the way he felt about me for anyone else, I was mesmerizing, and he didn’t feel good enough for me and was LITERALLY obsessed with me!!!!!! He even got me flowers this Valentine’s Day and I met his aunt. He also told someone close to him in his life that they didn’t “deserve” to meet me 

So, I’m really confused as to why he said he never liked me, not even then. Because how can someone say all that and not mean it? I don’t know, and it’s been really hurting me on top of my breakup. Does anyone have an advice on what the fuck is going on? I feel like he’s lying so I can just get over him but I don’t know, that shit cut DEEP. 

TLDR: I was the rebound girl and am very confused and feel very saddened by it.

 Being in a relationship with him never crossed my mind until recently, once I realized his feelings for me. He is a really great guy and I think he would be a great partner, but I'm not sure how to proceed. 
He is the owner of a small local business and I am the manager, so we spend a fair amount of time together and right from the beginning he was always very sweet and courteous. Over time as our working relationship grew, we became good friends, hanging out on our off time, getting lunch or coffee together etc. More recently though his actions and words have been different. He calls me beautiful, tells me how important I am to him, in and outside the company, will brush my arm or give me hugs. Never anything inappropriate and always makes sure I'm comfortable with the interactions. 
I think I might be starting to have feelings for him as well, but I don't want to jepridice what we have.

We haven't had sex. For a long time, it was due to me being afraid of it due to a past with an abusive ex on my end. My bf was exceptionally patient with me, and waited till I was ready. We finally agreed to do it a couple months ago. I bought condoms, but when he came over, he got really anxious, and couldn't stay hard with it on. He was getting frustrated, and I was trying to assure him. He then asked if we could try without a condom, and I take plan b later. I didn't want him feeling worse, so I agreed. Still couldn't stay hard. I comforted him, said we'd try another time, cuddled, etc.   


I took the pill later. It fucked with my period, I had a pregnancy scare, I would bleed at random times in the month, etc etc.   


Soon after, I sublet my apartment for 2 months (condoms left at my apartment). I was living outside our city, and I'd come to stay at his place once a week. Now, inevitably, every time I would visit, things would get hot and heavy, and he'd ask if we could have sex. the catch; he wouldn't have condoms. I would tell him no, and he would keep repeatedly asking, saying we could get the pill later. I would have to really stand my ground to not succumb to his asking. I was kind of hurt by this, because he knew how much the pill affected me, how much pregnancy scares me etc. I must have made like 8 trips, and none of those times, he had bought the condoms, and this happened. He is an extreme homebody and lazy / forgetful / doesn't take extra initiative easily. But to go out to buy condoms seems pretty basic.   


Why didn't I just buy the condoms? Because I just wanted him to do it. I wanted to see if he would remember that minimum. The fact that I had to repeatedly explain why I wasn't okay with popping plan b, and turn him down is affecting me. The fact that he would always forget to buy them makes me feel like my health is a non-priority.

We became good friends in middle school through a class, I developed feelings for her pretty early on and they stayed that way throughout middle and high school. 

95% of our friendship took place on social media, mainly Snapchat. We talked every day for almost two years. I didn’t make a lot of advances towards pursing a relationship partially because I didn’t see her much outside of school or even in for that matter, and because I wasn’t very forward with my feelings. Eventually I think she assumed I lost interest/ got mad that I was not making any progress because she started dating other people. The first time was a stab in the chest because I was under the impression we were both interested in each other. I ended up completely removing her from my life (just by blocking her, not that difficult when it’s solely over the internet). I still saw her at school obviously, but the age/grade difference meant we didn’t really cross paths much. 

Nearing the end of my senior year, she reached out to me to apologize for her actions (I think it happened more than once, just trying to consolidate the post). I accepted her apology, unblocked her on things, however we didn’t talk regularly like before. We planned to make time to see each other, but this didn’t happen for over a year. We met up, caught up, got a drink, and had a nice time. I didn’t want to label it as a date, but maybe it was. The next week I tried to set something else up, and she got very distant and started ignoring my messages. This upset me just like before so I once again blocked her and moved on. 

She reached out another year later through a fake Snapchat she made solely for this to apologize, said she missed me and she loved me, and wanted to see me again. This time she was in the middle of a long relationship. Initially I don’t think this bothered me as I was seeing other people, but I was quickly reminded of her past actions and blocked her after a week after telling her to “never fucking speak to me again.” 

It’s been a year since this happened and I haven’t been super happy with what I said. I have thought about contacting her and apologizing to her in person as it is just more genuine. I never ended up doing this, it just comes and goes in my mind because I do think about her a lot. To my surprise this past week she added me on a new social media (BeReal). This was quite surprising to me knowing what my last words to her were, is she just ignoring that? There’s no direct communication on this app, but just having her even just a little bit back in my life already has me feeling upset about our entire relationship from the beginning. 

Part of me wants to just let her in to my life as long as we have clarity in where we stand so she is happy, but part of me is still latching on to those old feelings for her and just wants real closure for once if I’m just going to end up getting hurt again. I’m under the impression she may be somewhat emotionally immature as to how she approaches me every time she wanted to patch things up, and it’s to the point where I actually don’t know what she wants at all now. I can’t say that I haven’t been totally mature throughout this whole thing either, but I’m trying to improve by going to talk to her in person to apologize and see what she is looking for. 

If anything needs elaboration please ask, I feel like I’m not seeing major holes in my description.

So it’s been a few months and I figured I’d update you all on the situation, if you’re still curious.


So a week or so after the original post I realized things weren’t improving. I went to some friends about the situation and it was unanimously time for a break up. I knew it was my decision to make ultimately and I read through all of the comments from the original post and decided that I deserved to figure out how I wanted to live life. So I broke up with her and told her all the reasons why. I told her all of the things I didn’t like and would need to change if there was even any hope of ever considering getting back together. She cried and we talked (over the phone because she was never home when I was home so we couldn’t talk in person). She seemed to understand my reasoning and was saying she was going to work on herself. It was getting close to the end of the lease and I had found a new place with my roommate and she was under the impression she was going to move in with me. I considered letting her move with me but ultimately decided it was a bad idea, especially because she went on a rant about my friends and how she wanted to hurt them because she found out that they agreed that I should break up with her. 

So finally I told her she couldn’t move with me, she went to live with the dude she had been seeing and she kept in contact. She never put forth any effort to improve. She constantly gave me updates of how shitty the guy is and offered me sex on occasions. Her situation with him started to mirror how she treated me and immediately she realized that how he treated her was abusive and toxic. I explained all the parallels between her situation and our situation and she gave a half-hearted apology. 

I got back into therapy and I’ve been doing great ever since. My finances are more stable than they’ve been in years and I’m not dating the girl I was seeing before. This has been the easiest relationship I’ve had in my life. Our styles of communication are similar and how we show affection and care are the same. It was jarring at first because I’ve been so used to chaos and abuse even in relationships before my ex. Dating this girl feels like finally having someone on the same team as me. Someone dependable and consistent. Took a while to break habits of co-dependency and realize that I’m allowed my own space and freedoms with her. 

I had to get back into my hobbies and I started going back to the gym because I had started thinking back over the last 6 years of my life and all of the shit I put up with and sacrificed for my ex and I kept blowing up on her and my therapist told me it wasn’t healthy for me to channel my frustrations out like that. So I’ve been a lot more productive and creative these days. 

TLDR: I broke up with my gf, started dating the girl from the open relationship. I’ve been genuinely happy for the first time in a long time if not the happiest I’ve ever been. I have a new apartment and I’m in therapy working through everything.

I would think about her and smile but if I interact with her at all I want to leave within the hour. We recently hung out to meet up at a park for lunch and at the end of it we got into a deep conversation about how she wants to get back together with me but I couldn’t go through what I went through while in the relationship. I told her that and the one thing I really remember and thing about is how she said/blamed me for breaking up with her a month after her father passed away. I know I was always there for her when she wanted or needed someone and tried my vet very best when it came to that. It felt like she guilt tripped me about her dad and it felt like shit.

I (18f) have been friends with M (18f) since we were in middle school. We hang out in the same group of friends but have gotten a lot closer since we both went to the same college. (Gosh I hope she never finds this).

Over the years, most of the friend group has come out as identifying with the LGBTQ+ community. We are all very supportive of one another, but none of us are out to our families for various reasons. Around the time everyone else was coming out, I realized I was bisexual. 

M and I frequently discuss the subject of our identities because we were kind of figuring it out at the same time. We both like women, and often send each other movie characters we have “crushes” on. Lately there has been a lot of jokingly flirting between us, but it’s getting really hard to tell how much of it is a joke and how much of it is real. 

Here’s where things get complicated… I have a boyfriend back home whom I really do love. But unfortunately since I moved away to college, there has been a lot more emotional distance. We have different schedules and don’t talk nearly often enough. 

And M is right there. All the time. We are always hanging out and doing everything together. Everything with her feels so natural. 

But there are many reasons why we shouldn’t be together. Neither of us are out to our parents. Mine aren’t homophobic, but I wouldn’t necessarily call them incredible allies either. It’s just scary. 
She’s one of the only friends I have here and I really need her friendship more than anything. We’re probably going to be roommates next year, which complicates things further. 

But it’s getting very hard to ignore whatever is between us.

There were other things we discussed in LENGTH afterward. We processed the breakup together. There was no cheating or abuse but a total lack of communication/emotional maturity. Looking back, it makes sense that this happened as we were both ignoring our mental health throughout the pandemic. We struggled with codependency and I’m in therapy now which is helping a lot with healing my childhood trauma. Attachment style: I’d say he’s avoidant while I’m anxious, both due to narcissistic abuse in our separate pasts.

A few months later (when we moved away from each other) he tells me he regrets breaking up and since being on the right medication, he understands himself and what he wants, and is willing to put in the work (like I am) to move forward together. We have not gotten back together but stayed friends and I’ve placed boundaries as my trust has obviously been broken. We discuss possibly getting back together one day. Every few weeks, I get anxiety about us and we talk things through. I do see changes in him already. We are absolute best friends and actively work on communication. 

This last weekend, I decided I needed time to myself and am taking 2 weeks no-contact to process/heal. It’s the lack of commitment/abandonment of the relationship in the past that continues to make my anxious attachment go in circles and I finally decided to do something different. I am not anxious about taking this time, in fact I feel very secure in this decision.

So me (f20) and my boyfriend (m20) of about 4 years have been living together at my parents home for a little over a year due to some sucky circumstances. We have been happy together with our big and small arguments like any couple, but yesterday he put of the blue told me that he's been thinking of moving out.... On his own. 

He's not had a great start in life and one thing he always wanted was a place of his own to try and be an adult in with his own rules and no one to nag about a mess here or there. I'm a clean person with a ""sense of urgency for cleaning"" as he calls it and always nag him to tidy his desk and put away his dirty clothes and such but he really dislikes this. He told me that even tho he would like to follow our plan and buy a house in a few years time he feels like he would be missing out on something big that others get (and for the record I've never lived alone or gone off to uni myself so I wouldn't ""get to experience"" that stuff either) and that on one hand he doesn't want to sacrifice expiriencing freedom and learning all the household life skills on his own but on the other he knows it would damage our relationship because I don't want him to throw our progress away and move out.

Tldr: my boyfriend of 4 years told me he wants to experience the rest of his early adulthood living on his own

Also there is no way he would be cheating, we have access to all our passwords/devices and he practically spends all his free time at home or with me. He's simply impulsive and has some issues with the word ""no""

(Gender neutral) (this is about one person they/them/their ect.) I’ve had feelings for my married coworker for 3+ years. Every chance I had to take an opportunity ‘away’ I took it. I tried to focus on work and we mutually would find excuses to see each other. Some necessary for work. There are a lot of qualities that I admire and respect about them. Their morality and integrity is the biggest part. If they ever tried anything I would loose this. I’ve tried being rude, call them out when they said something dumb. Overall just trying to push this person away and myself. I would think of this person or our conversations almost always. I was very riddled with it and other issues in my life so I took up drinking a lot for a few months at one point over the 3 years, I was dying inside with anxiety and self hate for my feelings for a married person. Granted I’ve never acted on them but I’m sure I’m no good at hiding them. And my morals have always been the only thing Ive ever been able to rely on, MY character. This absolutely became an emotional affair. I had the opportunity to be completely removed so I took it for a lot of reasons but this situation added to it. I started my new job and was focused and renewed, sad, but feeling like these feelings could finally die like it needs to. 

This is where it gets tricky. This person reached out to see how my new job was and since, we keep talking/texting. Sometimes I have initiated, sometimes they do. For 3 weeks I’ve stopped initiating and the person still does me just not daily. I find myself wanting to tell this person everything. When they message I feel excited. I fucking hate it. It’s eating my guts, I can’t sleep, I can’t focus, I bury myself in other things. I hate myself. I feel like a child. I feel weak, and like a fucking idiot. I’ve had one person I’ve shared/confided in and almost all interactions with this married coworker with, this third party thinks I should tell the married coworker of my feelings. I disagree, we’ve fought about it for awhile since I left the old job. On the other hand now I do feel I need to move forward since the interactions have continued.

Chatted and hung out the whole time. He was in the middle of asking for my social media when I drunkenly asked for his and cut him off. I was trying to get a bit of attention (if you know what I mean) the whole night and he was nothing more than extremely polite and hands off. I figured not interested. But he went out of his way to say goodbye after it ended and text me immediately after.

We have talked nearly every day since, sometimes a lot sometimes a little as we're both busy.

The thing is I ask all the questions. He does answer them all and in big long essays. I know all about his goals and fears and family etc etc. He talks about everything. But doesnt ask me any questions. The few times I've answered my own questions he doesnt really take too much notice of my answers.

I mildly flirt with him and he politely just 'awww,' and moves on. He very rarely compliments me but did call me hot when drunk once and if I make any joke talking down on myself he gets worked up making sure I dont actually think that.

If the conversation dies out he has been the one to restart it each time BUT only if I post on my social media and he can start a conversation building off whatever i posted. Once i didnt post for a few days just to see if he could start a conversation on his own. He did not. Within minutes of me posting he did.

He says he is the biggest 'ho,' of his friend group and sleeps around far more than anyone else. Yet never brings sex or anything into the conversation or talks about anyone hes seeing. The closest was him telling a small story here or there about someone he was seeing at some point.

I drunkenly directly hit on him one night and he was very 'oh you can paw at me anytime you want you're hot,' but that was the most I've gotten from him.

I've tried asking or making comments about him dating or 'oh I bet you find someone super cute at that event tonight wearing that,' like youd talk to friends and he actively avoids the parts of the conversation that have anything to do with his dating life. But when I've mentioned other people, like when I'm at a bar, etc he supports and gives advice and talks it up.

Any other time I'd say hes not actually interested and just label him a friend but he was homeschooled his whole life in a religious household and is in his early 20s so part of me isnt sure if hes just quiet and kinda awkward or whatever because hes freshly out of that homelife and doesnt exactly know how to socialize. Hes extremely confident though.

In person hes just very quiet. In messages he talks a lot the conversation is just one sided and very platonic most of the time.

I'm use to loud people but even the quiet people I know arent so hard to read. 

A friend of mine who is married says her husband is the same way and just labels it 'calm,' by our standards. 

So I guess I'm asking if you've been involved or whatever with someone from such a sheltered upbringing were they more awkward conversationally? Have you as a very out going person dated someone more reserved?

Part of me wonders if, because he is extremely hot, hes just use to others doing all the talking or just kinda hopping into bed real fast without much work because he looks like he does.

I'm having a hard time I guess with him saying he sleeps around so much, etc with how little direct interest he shows. It makes me assume that he is either thinking he does when he really doesnt by normal standards OR he does but just isnt into me.

But then he outright told me to go for it when I see him.

I and Anna used to be very close. We used to tell each other about every little detail of our lives. We used to always go out on dates. Almost two or three days a week. 

We however started to slowly drift away. She got promoted on her job now she makes 6 figures a year and I’m truly happy for her maybe a little envious but nonetheless I’m happy for her. The only problem was that we started talking less. Her long work hours and very unorganized  schedule makes it very hard to plan on anything. At first we started hanging out less, then we started talking less, and now we barely talk to each other apart from good mornings and goodnights. On the rare occasion we would eat breakfast together we would talk and that’s all. Our sex life has disappeared entirely. 

I complained to my best friend about this and he planned that all the boys gather and go to the bar. We did yesterday. I was drunk for the first time in two years. 

Things happened so fast. As I met this girl we talked a little. I don’t even remember what we talked about or her name. I however remember that I went to her apartment and we hooked up. 


I threw the most important thing in my life that moment. I truly regret what I did. I wasn’t able to talk nor look in Anna’s ayes. I just tried to keep myself occupied. And I know that this is wrong. I want to apologize and to tell her what I did I want to be judged by her and I want her to know the truth. I however don’t know if I’m able to talk about it. I just don’t know how to prepare for that conversation, how bring it up, or How to deliver it. 

I never was a player. I only dated two girls in my entire life and I don’t know how this act came from me. 

I’d be absolutely grateful if anyone would give me advice.

I am aware this is an issue, I am still learning how to deal with it.

Recently we moved and neither of us have many friends in our new location so have spent a lot of time together. Some codependency has developed, more so on my end due to some attachment issues I developed from childhood which I need to go back to therapy for, I recognise this.

We have both been struggling for the last decade or so from poor mental health. There has been a decline recently which in turn made financial stress worse as we both had trouble making it into work. I have recently gotten a new job and have made it in most days, with exception of the last couple of weeks due to some personal issues and now have covid.

My boyfriends mental state has severely declined in the last few months and I am no longer sure what to do. We both have quite fluctuating mood swings, mine have mellowed out more since medication, no medication has yet proved effective for him. 
I have helped book him a psychiatrist appointment which he is not hopeful for and is worried of the financial cost. It will be a financial strain but it is important and in my opinion, worth it. Especially when all other options are becoming exhausted. I believe the help is needed. 

He is typically a pessimist, myself an optimist. I struggle to maintain my optimism when it is often shut down with negative comments. Some of them have seemed rude, but most of the comments are similar to “why would it work out? Nothing ever good works out for me” 

I struggle to be assertive in our relationship as I do believe he is trying, I know how hard it is to try to live when you only want to give up, I've been there. but I'm feeling so alone. i cant make anything better but i cant do nothing. we are about to hit a rougher period financially and will be going through withdrawals soon, this will likely severely impact our mental health. it has in the past.

I also don't share this stuff with anyone, so I figured why not post on Reddit 😂. 

I (29M) haven't had a serious girlfriend for roughly 8 years. That relationship ended kinda fucked up so that affected me for a while. After that I had some short relationships, but nothing serious. The last few years I've went on some dates that didn't make it to a second. This entire time I've had low self esteem when it came to dating mainly because of how that original relationship ended. (Yes I am over it, but it still has had lasting effects.) Plus I've had my own internal battles with depression and addiction (working on those for multiple reasons) so that doesn't help my confidence either. So I've never really tried very hard at dating. Now I'm out of college and the majority of my friends are married. Plus my family is always on me about finding someone to have in my life, so I'm feeling the pressure.

On to the reason for this post. I have a really great friend who I've known since college. We've kept in touch and hung out often during those 10 years. She's a great person and we are good combination of similar and different. She has a similar relationship history actually, so we've both learned to be pretty independent. Throughout our friendship I never had any thought of her more than a great friend, until the last year or two.  Recently when we've hung out I've enjoyed it more than before. The last couple times we hung out with friends it even kinda felt like a double date. I care more about what she's doing and when she makes it home safe from going out than I used to and much more than other girl friends. There have been a few situations where guys have hit on her and I've gotten jealous (dumb I know). I've also thought about what if she ends up with Person A or Person B, and although I'd be happy for her I'd be pissed at myself for never trying. On the other hand we've never talked about relationships, or much about anything super personal. I chalk that up to the fact that we are both really good at hiding emotions. 

My problem is I can't figure out if my feelings towards her are simply as a good friend that I care alot about, or something more. Many of my friends and family members have told me I should ask her out. How do I know if I actually have feelings and I'm not just being influenced from those people? Is the pressure of being almost 30 and still single affecting this? Even though I still have work to do on myself, I can't put this off forever. If I decide I have feelings, how do I tell her? I feel like it's gotta be subtle atleast to start with. She's never given me any signs of her feelings (that me as a guy have noticed lol). If she doesn't feel the same, I'll honestly be fine and able to continue as friends. Even though it may make it weird because she's friends with all my friends wives, and we're basically the only single ones left lol. I know if I do decide I want something more, I know I have to try or I'll regret it forever. 

I do truly want to find someone to spend the rest of my life with, I don't want to continue being alone. And it would be really cool if it was her.

I feel rightfully like a piece of shit and dont know what to do now.

As stated my partner recently had a stroke, this is not the reason why i am cheating. I take care of my father who has also had a stroke and in the past i have offered to fully take care of partner if they ever got sick (full package, baths, poos, anything). Why this matters is I am hesitant to actually talk to them. I dont want to add to their worsened mental state as they have been put back on anti-depressants and is open about their struggles.

This started a long time and i have no idea what to do. The main issue is intimacy. While we had strong relationship in the beginning, despite my own health problems as a woman, we were physical and affectionate despite this. But after their first use of anti-depressants the intimacy decreased. Which i wasn't upset about at first but it went down a slippery slope. They isn't arent a affectionate person, hugs and kisses are few in-between (even more so during covid) but hand holding is always favorable. Aside from 'i love yous' theres no other romantic talk. They're also a bit /weird/ when it comes to affection (but i like it, its endearing or im used to it) where they react completely confused when im affectionate and tell me im being the weird one (which usually makes me limit my affections more). 
But with my best friend, she calls all the endearing pet names, showers me in affection and i guess you can say bombards me with love and support (my partner supports me more quietly). It makes me happy and i reciprocate. 
I enjoy all the gushy texts and affections, and wish my partner would do the same but I'm nervous to ask since they brag to everyone how me and them dont require intimacy, how we can be alone silent together and have fun. While yes, its come down to only that. We're in a room together as two people, not a couple.

Another thing that started this was my venting of frustrations. My home life has been incredibly hectic from daily abuse to sheer yelling and throwing objects around. Im unhappy in my life at home and vent to clear my mind or my depression turns everything inwards and i hate everything about me.
While my partner has stuck by me through nearly 10 years of this horrid cycle, things have gotten even worse in the last 4 years. I vent to them and let out all my frustrations, only to get a few word replies and be brushed off to something else. Its unsatisfying as i need that reassurance and get nothing back. I know why they do this, they have said they're not good dealing with problems, and they are just trying to get my mind off of the issue. But even still, it makes me not want to vent and spend the time talking to them when i can just vent privately on twitter and at least get scandalous bots that have an intrest in me. The whole process just makes me feel like a burden when i go out of my way to listen to their own issues. 
And with my best friend, she engages with me. Helps me cry it out and break my walls down then comforts me. She's helped so much that I've told her things I've never told my partner and helps me through them (I know my partner would help too but again its like im a burden, despite them disagreeing the fact that theres no lasting comfort remains). 

During a rough patch in my life, my past therapist had me think of examples to like myself and raise my self esteem. I chose my relationship with my partner since its a long distance relationship by 45 minutes away, because i was proud to have kept someone around me that long since i dont have any more friends. They were my first relationship after being ridiculed in all my school life about romantic venues. I've never had anyone before but they were immediate in calling me wife and wanting to marry when we're older (i was 17-18 they were 18) after constant backlash and problems, my walls came down and i agreed to be promised to them. When we met i knew nothing about online or movies, intrest, fandoms and they brought me along with everything they liked and i enjoyed it. Till our intrest started to drift apart and i ventured out online and met my best friend who shared in all the things i liked too (who had /technically/ known me since highschool same as my partner). Who lives all the way in Europe, and despite the time differences always texts me daily. During the rough patch, my partner introduced me to new people, help start a art job and tried to get me into their likes just how it always was before. But things slowly fizzled out as my toxic home life basically stripped me of anything defining. I had no money of my own again, losing and ignoring new people from the stress of it all and had no outlet for any new stresses and health problems steadily and suddenly appearing.

Just recently following my 27th birthday, things went completely wrong and i was shutting everyone out. I told both my partner and best friend, and who decided was more more beneficial to my mental health was my best friend as my partner had had their stroke 2 months before my birthday. And just about 4 weeks to now my best friend has been comforting me and keeping me sane till the recent 3 days since we've talked romantically. A bunch of confessions came out from my side and hers, and it makes me happy and i while i dont regret it im rightfully disgusted with myself. 

We talked about it and with my partners stroke, i decided not to tell them about any issues till they're in a better/comfortable position in the illness. But i dont want to lie and pretend everything is okay when it isn't, i hate myself immensely for this. I don't know if i should tell them if we can fix this or that i want to be single for a while.

After matching we got to talking and the conversations were easy flowing, she seemed funny and smart. After a while we exchanged numbers and we started talking on the phone on a regular basis. 
On one of our talks I asked her what her intentions are on Tinder. She said she got on it after she ended things with a guy she was casually seeing... for 2 years and how the situationship was very toxic and how she's using Tinder to get over him by talking to other guys.
I saw that as a red flag as I am the type of guy who gets emotionally attached real quick.

(I am writing this post with mutual consent)

To start off, I am a 20M and my partner is a 22F. We are both currently in university and typically play games with one another daily to stay connected. However, we initiated our relationship when I was 12, and she was 14. There is a lot to go over, so I will break this down into sections.

History of meetups:

I have been unable to see her since I was 13, and unfortunately the last couple of times caused me to have major anxiety to where I had to leave. We used to live in the same state back then, so things were easy. It has been seven years since this happened, and it is like this because I moved to Arkansas. Right now I am in Kentucky, and she is in California. Presently, I do have a way to secure a flight now to her state now in summer or during our mutual winter break in 2023. There is a clear plan, essentially.

The now:

We are currently at a turning point that determines whether we stay together. She met a guy in real life who claimed to be aromantic and asexual. He added us both on Discord, and we talked for months including playing games together. However, it did not stay that way. They kept going out to eat and going to each other’s houses which led to them catching feelings unintentionally. She is starting to dread the feeling of distance but really loves me and just wishes I was there with her; but I cannot get a job right now. Furthermore, she has said that if both me and the other guy were in front of her that she would choose me. I have been saying that it is not worth it to act on those feelings because we have something that is eight years long, no major issues, and theoretically the worst that can happen is a three-year wait until we close the distance. Her current proposition is that she tests having a physical relationship and breaks away from me. This would be to see if she really wants to have that.

What we have in common:

We are extremely compatible emotionally and never argue. By that I mean arguments are typically months apart. Furthermore, we have the same video game interests, similar sleep schedule (despite time zone), and check all the boxes we want to check. We both love each other’s appearance and have the same rare kinks as well as quirks. It is like an impossibly perfect match. We are compatible even with food preferences and minor things like cleanliness.

What should my girlfriend do in this situation and why? We really do not want to lose each other, but she is torn between the two options.

(I work in a art/hobby as a side career that relies on community reach through social media.)

Me and my gf were very open about what was going on. She assured me she believed me and was on my side. I truthfully was being wronged.

Her friend was trying to manipulate my gf by making stuff up about me to get us to split. She wrote text after text, and sent voice message after voice message, to the point it frustrated my gf. They did converse a bit, but overall the friend was being over whelming with her attempts.

My gf showed me the conversation and I saw she was playing the middle man. I didn’t really care about the bullshit the friend was saying, but I was hurt that my gf wasn’t defending me. 

My gf told me she was trying to be friendly to get more information “like a spy…” but that turned out to be a lie when she later came out and told me she was just trying to protect her own image and didnt want to tell her friend off. She said she didn’t like being confrontational.

She is popular online and she figured if she told her friend off by defending me outwardly, it would affect her image. (Reality was, it wouldn’t affect her at all other than the friend backing off from their private conversation.)

A little over two weeks ago he had a friend over and we were drinking. I had stopped a few hours before the incident so I remember this clearly. He was talking about how an ex texted him out of the blue. He had brought it up a couple of times and each time his story was different. Once he said she asked him out, then later said she didn't, stuff like that. The next time I saw him I asked if I needed to be worried because his stories were conflicting and I asked him what was actually true. He was very vague and it still wasn't adding up. Eventually it got to the point where he was saying that there's no way he said any of that and I was remembering wrong. I said ""are you seriously trying to gaslight me right now?"" he flipped out and kicked me out of his house. The next night we had a talk about it and he told me that by me saying he was gaslighting me reminded him of past trauma and he was scared of what I was capable of and had put up walls because of it. He told me that he was going to be different because of it. Well over the past two weeks he has stopped reaching out, doesn't make plans like he used to and is generally being distant. He said he was going to treat me differently because he's scared. I don't believe him treating me differently is going to protect him or answer any of his questions about me, all its doing is pushing me away.

I can't address anything with him without him turning it around and punishing me. I told him tonight that I don't deserve for him to treat me differently and that we should talk about ending things because this ""new relationship"" we have is not something I want.

My aunt passed away this summer and it was an incredibly difficult experience for me. On top of that, I've been struggling with academic pressures, a few other traumatic events that I'd rather not discuss on the internet, and was recently diagnosed with depression. 

Then, a couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend of 1.5 years dumped me. He was my first serious boyfriend. He said that he ""wasn't strong enough"" to support me, that he dreaded talking to me because of how angry I'd become, and essentially blamed me for ""changing"" after my aunt died. He said he missed the old me and that we could've had a perfect life together if I wasn't like this. He had no empathy for my situation; he said he never wanted to see me again because of the person I am now. 

He didn't try to make the breakup amicable. Our conversation was relatively short because I had somewhere to be, so he promised to speak with me again to give me closure. Instead, he ghosted me, leaving me with all this shit I never got to say to him. 

I would've understood if he'd just wanted a break from me because I know how unpleasant my situation is -- I'm the one who has to fucking live with it. But he's cut me out of his life permanently because he believes that I've become a horrible person who's never going to change. And he said he wants nothing to do with me even if I do get better. 

I just don't understand how he could do this to me. If you truly love someone, you don't just give up on them like this. He has depression too, and no matter how shitty it got for me, I always forgave him and I always supported him. I didn't equate him to his mental illness but saw it as something we had to overcome together. He's done the opposite: he thinks that my grief and depression are who I am, not struggles I'm dealing with, so rather than attempting to work through the problem with me, he withdrew until he felt comfortable breaking up. 

The worst part is, when he dumped me, I let him convince me that this was all my fault and that he'd done everything he could. But he's the one who gave up on us. He always talked about how he'd love me forever, how he wanted to grow old with me, but if he really loved me that much he would've tried to understand what I'm going through. It's just so frustrating. He would treat me like shit when he was in a depressed state and I willingly put up with it because I loved him. As soon as he experienced that same behaviour from me, as soon as he had to be the one providing support, he left and blamed me for everything. 

I've been reading a lot about grief and relationships, and I've realized that the way I've been acting is perfectly in line with how most people react to tragedy. All these articles talk about how the grieving partner will change for some time and that the other should be understanding, communicative, and supportive. I just have the urge to send them to him, to show him that what I'm going through is normal and he's the one who needed to be a better partner. I mean, is his plan to leave whenever his partner experiences something difficult? 

Some part of me still believes that we had something special and wants to salvage that before it's too late, if that's even possible. I do believe that he loved me, and if I could just change his perspective, wouldn't he at least give me another chance somewhere down the line? How could he not want to fix things? I know it's naive, but he always said we were meant to be. How could he throw away everything we had? 

But at the same time, I'm upset by how he treated me during our relationship and how he handled the breakup. I'm angry that he's walked out of this believing he's the good guy, without even acknowledging everything I've done for him. I just wish I could make him confront his mistakes and apologize.

For the most part, I'm done with him, and I regret putting in so much effort for someone who ultimately couldn't do the same for me. But those two polarizing desires are making it difficult to fully move on and I don't know how to handle it. I wish I had gotten to talk it out with him when we broke up. I'm just at a loss right now. What do I do? 

Thanks to everyone who read this far. 

tl;dr: My first serious boyfriend dumped and ghosted me because I ""changed"" after I watched my aunt die, experienced trauma, and was diagnosed with depression -- after I spent 1.5 years helping him deal with his depression.

There’s been a few things bothering me. I should preface this by saying I tend to overthink a lot and it can cloud my judgement. 

I feel like I’m putting too much effort into the relationship, or maybe it’s because she doesn’t put a lot of effort in, (in my opinion at least). She never really asks me to hang out (I think only 1 time) I’m always making the plans. We only ever hangout at my place, we hang out for like 2 hours when we do, and we hang maybe once or twice a week if that. 

She is super independent and likes her alone time but she also spends a lot of time with her friends. She told me that I would never be invited out to a girls night (which I am okay with and understand) but I haven’t met any of her friends yet. She has met all of mine. It’s hard to make plans with her especially on the weekends. There’s been countless times when we would have plans then she says she forgot she already has plans or something along the lines. 

She can never keep her word which is pretty important too me. I think she is super passive and scared to hurt my feelings by being honest in certain circumstances. 

For example: invited her to my parents house for dinner last weekend (she has met my whole family already) she would say yes in person but then over text say she would let me know about it. I told her she can be straight up with me. Her reply to this was that she wasn’t ready for that yet, which I completely understand I just wish she could be honest with me.

I’m super introverted and don’t like to go out, where she is really social and extroverted and likes to go out and drink etc. She gets defensive when people say she’s extroverted because she thinks she isn’t. 

I guess I’m too clingy maybe? I think I fell to hard for her, I want a long term committed relationship but seems like she wants something super casual as far as I know. 

I’m at the age where when I date someone I’m considering them as a lifelong partner / spouse as I’m getting older and want to settle down. Obviously this still takes time and I’m not expecting to get married or have kids this early in a relationship; although it just doesn’t feel like I’m in a committed relationship. 

She’s never been in a serious relationship and told me early on she doesn’t know what she wants. She also told me that usually she will see a guy for a couple months. 

I’m not really sure where to go from here? If I should talk to her about it, I’m not really sure what I would say even. It’s been stressing me out and makes me anxious although I have bad anxiety already. 

I just feel like she’s not really into me or something. Would appreciate your help / advice Reddit!

Though, in hopes to keep it semi short, my partner (m24) and I (f22) have had a pretty rocky relationship. We have broken up and gotten back together what I believe is three times now, most recently a few months ago. The last time we broke up it lasted 3-4 months before we ran into each other again and got back together shortly after. I had slept with one person while we were broken up, and he claims he was not with anyone. Now, since we have gotten back together we have really begun to communicate and pay attention to each others needs, all which has made for the best relationship I could have asked for. I love this man with my entire heart, and we have finally made our way out of woods. Realizing what we both really want is to be together, and make it work. 

So of course, I head into the doctors office for a check-in after starting up a new birth control, get my routine std test done and am on my merry way. None the wiser, I get a phone call the following week from my doctor, to inform me my std test came back positive for chlamydia (me and my partner both do not have any symptoms). So, you could imagine my shock, the doctor tells me to pick up the medication in the morning, no sex for a week and im good as new, great. No. 

I had no clue how to approach this, so i tell my partner he needs to be tested because my doctor recommends it, and that we should take a break from sex until we get the results back, again what my doctor told me. Now, obviously there was probably better ways to go about this, but when i reached out to a friend they told me (they have known my partner for a number of years) they believed my partner would take the news better if it was coming from a doctor. 

Then comes the anxiety, my partner was tested a few days ago and we are now still waiting on the results. I cannot gauge what his responses may be, and i am terrified of losing him again, after we have finally learnt to juggle our differences and love each other how we deserve. Will he leave me? Blow up in my face? I am sure another thing to note here, is that I was tested before entering back into this relationship with my current partner and it was negative (this was a few months ago) and my partner has not been tested in over 4 years (and was with various partners since his negative result, and never used condoms). I do not care where it came from, I do not think he cheated on me, I just want us to be able to hurdle this and move forward.

I’m (21 F) now a senior and I live with my freshman roommate/best friend, Cece (22F) in an apartment with 2 other friends. Cece and I are a three person friend group with another person let’s call her Jess (23F) since freshman year. Jess, Cece and I are friends. 

Cece is dating Winston 23M and he’s over ALL THE TIME. He has his plants in our apartment and asked me not to open windows so they don’t get cold and die (despite the fact that he has his own apartment and we’ve never discussed him keeping his plants here). Winston, Cece, Jess and I are friends. 
This year I’ve been branching out becauseI felt like Cece, I and Jess could get toxic. i’m an English major and they’re all STEM majors and sometimes when I want to discuss things from class I feel looked down on. I’ve made about new friends from class who I hang out with. 

For the incident in question : I have a 7 pm class that goes till 10 pm and is a fucking pain and my (new) friends and I pregame it at my house. When I say pregame, I don’t mean a party I mean 2 people coming over taking 4 shots in a span of 30 minutes and leaving. It’s once a week &amp; I clean every glass before I leave. 

Two weeks ago, on one of these pregames I could see that Cece didn’t seem like she was having the best time and I texted her after to ask and she said she was hungry so she wasn’t super interactive but it’s all good. 

Keeping this in mind, I messaged her before this week’s pregame word for word me: Is it alright if 3 people come over before class? Cece : yes Me : are you absolutely sure? Cece : yes don’t worry. 
they arrive half an hour before class and we’re standing in the kitchen and Cece is making dinner for herself and her boyfriend and honestly, I’m not looking at her. The next day, I just get a feeling something’s off and I text her asking if she’s mad. She says yes

The next day she says she felt like it got a loud and crowded and they were standing in her way to the fridge and Winston had an exam and she had to cook for him so he could eat fast. I said sorry that was that.

In my mind, I should’ve asked my friends to move she should’ve asked them to move (she didn’t). I do genuinely feel bad. THE SECOND PART: Respectfully, I don’t give a fuck : He is a guest and this is my home. His needs or wants don’t take ANY precedence over mine. Her guests don’t take precedence over mine. Go fucking cook at his house (which is his alone). This happened a week ago but I find out from Jess that she went to hers after I left to rant about me and Jess told me she told Cece she thought I was an alcoholic. 
Now I’m starting to get a little upset a week later because I feel like they’ve been talking behind my back. I feel like it stems from slight jealousy that they’re not my only friends anymore like they’ve been for three years

I'vive said that this is a potential deal breaker if he doesnt and he says he has to think about it (minimum of a week as he's leaving for a week at work). I feel like this is kind of a deal breaker because I don't want to be in a relationship  where my partner will allow the nasty comments and lies to continue and not stand up for me. I'm now clouded in what is the right thing to do and if I am being unreasonable, and what I should do moving forward.

We’ve been relatively close since but never dated because I had girlfriend up until I was 18. She then got a boyfriend shortly after I turned 18. Well after being at college for a little bit I met this girl in March. We got along great and talked all through summer while I still hung out with my other friend. In august, me and this new girl started dating. She’s great. Funny, smart, athletic, what’s not to like. Well, shortly after getting to college again, my old friend breaks up with her boyfriend and confesses her love for me. I can’t really do anything but I also spilled my heart to her. So now we both know how we feel for each other. Now it’s November and the only thing in the way is this innocent sweet girl who’s done nothing wrong. I don’t resent her for it but I also want out of the relationship. I’m just too scared to wait because I don’t want this other girl to find someone else.
