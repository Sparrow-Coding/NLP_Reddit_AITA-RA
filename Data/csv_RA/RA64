I am not the type of person that finds it necessary to mention someone's background as it doesn't necessarily indicate anything about one's personality, but for the sake of giving context I do need to mention a few bits of who we are and where we come from as I believe that's what ruined the relationship.

My ex-boyfriend was born in London but both of his parents are from Pakistan, and I was born in Portugal and only moved to London with my family when I was 18. It was in London that I met him when I was 20 years old, and we started dating after a while. Despite him being raised on a Muslim household and me on a Christian one, we're both atheists but we obviously do not have anything against anyone's religion.

Regardless of the different backgrounds we grew up with, my parents were always extremely acceptive of me dating him, and there was literally 0 issues from their side when they met my ex. To be quite frank, sometimes I would even get a little jealous with how much they loved my him. He was like a second son to them, no incest intended.

However, from my ex's side, his parents and his 5 siblings were extremely vocal on how much they didn't accept me. In the 5 years we dated they refused to learn my name, and whenever they wanted to mention me they would just call me ""the pork eater"" (I don't even like pork lol) or other offensive terms. It's impossible to even describe 1% of what they did to try to separate us, but believe me... they really tried everything.

On the night that I met his family, I was in their house for 4 hours and all they did was trying to convert me as they insulted my entire existence. It was absolutely crazy the fact that I even stayed there for more than 10 minutes. Since then I refused to ever meet them again, and as we both lived with our parents my boyfriend would have to come to my house to be with me. His parents hated having him in my house, scared that my Christian family would pressure him to live an haram lifestyle, so they would just call him every 15 minutes telling him to go back home otherwise they would kick him out. It was a living hell.

As he started hanging out with my family more, that's when he first noticed how problematic his family was. He was constantly shocked with the kindness and love that me and my family had for each other. But regardless of the toxic family he was raised with, we was simply the sweetest person I've ever met. It's hard to explain, but in the middle of that messy family, I just can't understand how they raised someone so pure and full with love as my ex. None of his siblings were like him, they were younger versions of their parents.

The first years of our relationship were a constant fight between us and his family, but in November 2021 something really, really bad happened that changed everything. 

For a couple of months, his parents started acting ""nice"" to us. Nothing extraordinary, but now we could at least be together for a few hours without them annoying us too much. It might be silly thinking back now, but we genuinely believe that they simply started accepting... us.

It was a few weeks after this change of behaviour that his family asked my ex to go with them to Pakistan to visit family. He was only there when he was a little kid, so he got convinced that this trip was for him to meet his cousins, uncles and aunties... in a way, they were not wrong. 

My ex, bless his sweet heart, accepts the offer, and in November 2021 he flights with them for a 3-weeks-trip to Pakistan. It was right on the second day of him being there that he learns exactly what his parents' intentions were, and how he fell straight into their trap. 

While visiting some family members, his parents took him to his uncle's house and quickly close him in a room with his second-cousin (F21). Before they leave the room for the two of them to be alone, they simply said ""Introduce yourselves, you're going to get married"".

This is when the situation gets absolutely messy, and me being in the UK trying to help him but not knowing were he was, we went through the hardest week of our lives. 

The long story short was that the UK police was involved, the UK Embassy in Pakistan was involved, and my ex had to literally ran away only carrying the clothes we was wearing to 3 different hotels because his family and the Pakistani police (friends with the family) kept on tracking him down. He could not leave the country because his parents destroyed ALL his documents, so he had no passport, no visa, no citizenship card, no nothing that he could use to flight back home. He now had to prove to the UK and to Pakistan that he was a British citizen and he had to escape Pakistan for his own safety (his parents became violent, having assaulted him with rocks and knifes, and much more).

It took us one week of many, many stories to finally get him back to London, but after some terribly unreal days he was finally with me and away from his own family. Me and my dad picked him up from the airport and went straight to his house in London, as his parents were still in Pakistan trying to locate him, and grabbed everything we could so he could stay with us. 

That day he had to say goodbye to everything he knew: his parents, his siblings, his house. He left the vast majority of his clothes in Pakistan too as he had to run away while his parents were having breakfast, so he couldn't risk losing that opportunity to escape by attempting to pack his things. He had to start his life from 0.

My parents house was small for all of us, so we ended up getting our first apartment not too far from where I lived. In the beginning, despite the reasons why we had to move in together, he were so excited to finally have a place of our own and I knew we were meant to be.

Months go by and I always tried to check up on his mental health. Even though he left a toxic environment, losing that much in such a short period of time could only be devastating for him. But surprisingly enough, he always acted ""fine"" with this story. He didn't cry about losing his family, he didn't seem to care too much with what had happened to him, and I didn't see any grieving sings from his side. In fact, he seemed to be thriving, as he got 3 new jobs in the space of one year and his career was going great now.

There was plenty of moments that I truly believed that I was more bothered with this story than him, and me and my family knew this was no normal behaviour. I don't want to dive into stereotypes, but we just accepted that men tend to struggle when it comes to emotions. Maybe he had a different way to process everything that had happened, but I knew deep down that when the emotions we was suppressing would come out, they would come in a very damaging way. I just didn't know how.

But for a while, life was ""good"". We decorated our house as we wanted, we saw each other more than ever, we had our little routines together, our jobs were going great, I started going therapy and managed to adapt better to these changes, and now that it is coming close to 1 year since the whole Pakistan story happened, I thought that we were finally becoming ready to let this whole thing go. 

However, during these past few months, there was changes from his side.

The sweet, caring boyfriend that I fell in love with was now gradually becoming emotionless. Or worst, he was becoming mad with the world, and consequently, me. He still did plenty of things for me, but now the little actions he did to show that he cared seemed to be happening because it had become an habit for him, not because he actually cared. Little things in the day to day life would be a huge problem for him as well: me leaving the corridor light on by accident, for example, would result in a huge argument, and it seemed that he would freak out over things that are not worth more than a simple comment.

I interpreted this behaviour as a reaction from him losing everything. He lost control of his life, and these tiny insignificant things would give him a sense of control back. Concerned, I urged him to seek therapy like me and finally start processing in a healthy way the trauma he was a victim of. He never did.

The arguments became daily, rude comments were made to each other, and 3 days ago he confessed that he wanted to break up with me. I was in absolute shock to hear ""I want space from you"" from the same guy that up until recently couldn't supposedly live without me.

The break up wasn't a messy one, we weren't fighting at all, and it was simply a very hurtful conversation for me to hear. We both cried a lot (well, I cried more, obviously), and it was simply just sad seeing ourselves saying goodbye to everything we went through together.

 I don't want to sound selfish, but my life also went through lots of changes so I could be with him, and now it seemed that it was all for nothing in a way. I care so, so much about this sweet precious guy, and I truly believe that his feelings for me have changed because he never processed the Pakistan story correctly. It was always the elephant in the room.

I have since moved back to my parents house, and he's staying in our apartment until he moves back to his parent's house this week. Yes, he's moving back to the family that did these to him. The family that one year ago literally tried to kill him over love. It hurts me so much seeing him ""choosing"" them over me, the only help he had and the only constant in his life.

He's starting a new job again next week. I don't know where it is, but I know I won't be seeing him anymore. I still consider him my best friend, I crave his presence, and I still want to help him. I want to be there for him, but he now ""pushes back"" my attempts to be there for him. Not in a rude way, but in a this-is-a-break-up-so-we-can't-act-like-before way. He wants space, and I need to respect that.

I've opened up with my friends, but I don't like when they say ""His loss"" because I still love him a lot and I truly believe he's simply a victim of a huge mess. It is his decision, but it is not his fault. I blame his family for everything. 

This past few days have been all so weird, not seeing is face is killing me and I'm so scared of losing him forever. I understand I need to respect is wishes, but when you live this much with someone, you really get to know the person. I know this is not him, it simply isn't natural. He loved me so much and always made sure to show me. I know deep down the cause of this change, and I can't seem to make him realise how much him ignoring his feelings can affect his perception of life, relationships, love and growth.

I don't really know how to finish this post, but I guess what I'm trying to understand is: how can I still be there for him when he doesn't want to have a relationship with me? Is it my place to try to take him out of this rabbit hole? I understand I can't force someone to get help if they don't want, but I don't want to see his life getting ruined over this. It's like the world is losing the best man in here and I feel like it is my paper to ""save"" him from falling again into his parents traps. Again, he's smart enough to be independent, but sometimes people do need other's help and there's nothing wrong with that. It's literally how humans are wired to be.

Any advice right now would be kindly accepted. I want to make this right, and I'm scared I can't do it alone. Thank you to everyone in advance, and please do tell your partners that you loved them because you really never know when it can be the last time you get to say it. I didn't know a few days ago it would be my last time, and this will forever mark my hear.

I’ve been almost successful (I meet someone, we hit it off and things seem great then out of nowhere they ghost me).

We started talking a little bit and he seemed sweet. In the morning he asked for my snap. We kept talking about what we wanted from the app and both agreed that we wanted something real and lasting. I told him about my trust issues and some of the problems I’d had in the past and he agreed that he wouldn’t ghost. We'd talk a lot throughout the day and we agreed to go slow not say anything too deep for a while etc. It is also important to note that I have a rule that if someone wants to officially date me, they have to ask formally and in person. X also mentioned that he was okay if I talked to other people but I told him it wasn’t an issue because I tend to be a loyal person. X and I would talk whenever we could (mostly dirty admittedly). He started telling me things I was his girl, his soulmate, love of his life, etc. He told his family about me. Keep in mind this is day 2 of me knowing him. The next night. X and I are messing around over snap and he suddenly goes awol. I later found out he was helping his family with something. I told him I was feeling like an object. He reassured me that he wanted me for more than physical things and he would be better at communicating. Yesterday, he finally gets home. He messages me in the afternoon and we call, fool around, then he says he has to go. I didn’t hear from him much the rest of the day. I went to his dating profile to look at photos of him (something I often did) and noticed our chat wasn’t there anymore. I immediately texted him asking about it and how I felt he might ghost me because alarm bells were going off in my gut. He got very upset. Saying no he didn’t unmatch me, why was I on there anyways if we were talking, and how he had just gotten out of a bad relationship and wanted something healthy. He trusted me but I didn’t trust him and that wasn’t healthy. I had told him previously that my trust comes when we are in person but I didn’t get a chance to explain. He blocked and ghosted me after he said that. I’m just confused. I don’t know if I should have trusted him more or not. How could I have handled this situation differently?

My wife (27F) and I (28M) have been together for 7 years. We have a very strong and committed relationship, and I’m extremely happy with our relationship outside of the bedroom. That said, our sex life is very vanilla and (after all these years) is starting to get very repetitive. I feel awful but I find myself being very bored and unsatisfied sexually. I had a handful of sexual partners before my wife, and none of them could ever compare to
my wife. She’s my world and my inspiration everyday, but my sex life with these other partners was much more fulfilling. 

My wife was raised in an extremely traditional religious family that basically taught her to believe that sex outside of attempting to get pregnant was unnecessary. Her family also followed most stereotypical gender roles (wife = dishes &amp; laundry; husband = money earner, etc). I have helped her come to understand that some of her family’s views were not entirely healthy. 

My wife and I have a fairly healthy sex life. We have sex once every week or two, but it’s always the same routine. I go down on her to warm her up, and then we have PIV sex. 

About every week I’ll also do things like go down on my wife to have her cum just so that she has a great time. Or stimulate her clit with my fingers until she cums, but she never offers these types of things to me. I don’t ask for anything “in return” for these types of one way sex acts, but I’ve always hoped that one day she would start offering these same types of things to me. 

Occasionally my wife will give me a HJ/BJ, but I always have to ask for this and it’s never offered. when she does give me a BJ she always (unintentionally, I think) ruins my orgasm because she doesn’t want me to cum in her mouth. I’ve explained that it’s very frustrating to have her stop suddenly just as I’m about to cum, but she says it’s disgusting to think about me cumming on her mouth/face. 

I feel like our sex life is very one sided. I have to initiate basically everything related to sex. I honestly can’t remember the last time that my wife approached me while “in the mood” and initiated sex. 

It’s getting to the point that this is really weighing on me mentally. When I’ve talked to her about our sex life in the past she says that she’s very happy and content. I know I don’t feel the same way, but I feel like it will crush her if I tell her I’m not happy/satisfied with our sex life. 

I have a number of kinks that I’d like to explore further with my wife, but when I bring them up she’s not interested. She just says that she doesn’t see how they’re necessary, and she’s very content to just continue to have standard vanilla sex and doesn’t see herself wanting anything more.

What can I do to help my wife feel more empowered in the bedroom? I’d love for her to embrace her sexuality and I feel like she’s ashamed to explore kinks or things in the bedroom that aren’t just vanilla PIV sex. 

Should I consider a sex therapist for us? Are there any books I could buy her about embracing her sexual desires and kinks? 

I don’t want something like sex to weigh on my marriage, but it’s gotten to that point. I appreciate the help.

I really need some advise and I'll give you a little back story. This is my first real girlfriend so i have nothing to compare to so it's very hard for me to know what the right thing to do is. 

I've been with quite a few girls before but i never really liked any of them. They were okey, but i didnt really care that much for them. I was 18 when i met my girlfriend and from the first night i met her i was in love. We couldn't stop talking to each other and felt like we had known each other for 50 years. We pretty much hanged out every day and after 3 months she moved in with me hehe. She is the prettiest girl I've ever seen and i love her above everything. She is like my best friend. Even going to the store with her i a looot of fun, even after 2 years. Our sex life was great and we did it pretty much every day.

To this day we cant go more than 2 minutes without talking to each other. We kiss and hug a lot. I truly believe she is the love of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem is around 1,5 years ago she started having some problems with sex. It went from every day, to once a week, to once a month to once every 2-3 months. The reason why it started came from some sexual trauma she had from the past. I was completly fine with this and helped her through it over 1 year. For 1 year we only had sex once every 2-3 months beacuse i wanted to help her. Around half a year ago she told me she felt better and had come to peace. It didnt bother her anymore. So i thought great, now we can have a healthy sex life again. But after all this to this day we only have sex every 2-3 months. We are both pretty good looking, fit, healhty and we have great sex togheter! But she still dosent want to do it. I cant count how many times I have told her how much it bothers me. Probaly 100 times. It affects me in a lot of ways. But it dosen't really seem like she cares. She dosen't work on herself to become better, even though she knows it hurts me and puts our relationship in danger. I told her some time ago i was afraid over time i was going to become resentfull towards her. That has begun building up, a lot. Before i was never never tired of her. Now i wake up and i just want to be alone. I become grumpy and mad at her for no reason. I hate myself for this but i cant really control it. I've read a lot about it and sex is essential for a relationship beacuse of some biological psychology. It's the same every month. She does it once, i get all my hope up, she tells me that she is going to work on it and boom, we dont do it for another 2-3 months. This has happend 1000 times and it's killing my feeling for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if she is ever going to become better and i dont want to be with a person that i dont have a healthy sex life with for 40 years. I dont know if i should break up beacuse it would break my heart, or if i should wait more. I just really really want to be in a relationship that is free and where we can have sex often. It's really really frustrating beacuse she knows i cant take it much longer, but still she dosent seem to care enough and work on herself. I know for a fact that she loves me extremely much so i just dont understand why she dosent care more. 

Quite often i only do things to her, vibrator etc. And i make her orgasm, but she neeever does the same for me, i mean not once. 

Please give me some advice!

We are 5 years deep and have been discussing marriage prior to this happening. 

Back in June 22' my boyfriend, we'll call him, Joe, he got a job opportunity out of state and I happily supported him with money, love, and buying him whatever he needed. We didn't see each other since then but we texted and facetimed every single day.. About 2 weeks ago I received messages/pictures from a girl that he was sleeping with out there. She told me all about how they were in a relationship which truly just shattered my heart; until I found out she was telling me lies just to ""steal"" him, they were in fact sleeping together on multiple occasions however he claims it meant ""NoThInG To HiM"".

I visited his parents yesterday and finally spoke with Joe via phone. He begged me to stay, he would never do it again, cried his eyes out, he ""loves"" me. I could hear in his voice how broken he was and it didn't help with me degrading him the whole time... Its been a few days now and I'm thinking maybe I was too harsh on him? Or do I really want to throw away all these years together? Could this actually go back to what we once had? Can I love him the same? So many questions...

We are both music majors and we are the top players of our instruments. College is busy and stressful, and having the responsibility of being one of the top players means that a lot of people rely on your musicianship. I play the flute, so its not all that much that my abilities are needs. However, my boyfriend is a percussionist. And every ensemble needs a percussionist for something at one time or another. He is also in the percussion section of one of the top brass bands in the country. AND on top of this he is teaching lessons, working, and still trying to get a degree in music.
Im also crazy busy, but not near as busy as he is.
Recently tho, we haven’t been the same since we came back to classes in August. He has a past of mental issues and has been in and out of the mental hospital for years. And he told me recently that he has wanted to “disappear”.
This scares me a lot, because I love this man more than I can put into words. 
He brought up thought of going out separate ways because he said that because of his high level of stress and his mental struggles he is currently working through, he’s voiced to me that he doesn’t have the energy to put a lot into our relationship anymore. He told me he really didn’t want to break up, but felt that he would hurt me if we stayed together.
I responded instantly and told him that I would love him at his lows and highs, because he will always be the man I fell in love with. He was relieved and apologized over and over again.
But since that talk, we have only gotten worse. When he gets depressed, he stays in a practice room all night and practices. And he was right, he doesn’t put back anything into our relationship anymore. I thought I would be okay and he would get back on his feet and we would return to normal. But that was two months ago, and it’s only making me more upset. I talked with him last night about this and shared how I was feeling and he told me that right now he feels like he needs to choose between his music career and me. He told me he loves me so much but he is just so busy.
What do I do? Should I wait for him? Or am I just hurting myself.

But after this insane weekend, I talked to my girlfriend and asked her to apologize to my sister for trying to fight my niece in front of her.

My girlfriend immediately started arguing with me that she did nothing wrong and doesn't feel like she should apologize but she eventually conceded and apologized.

After I took her and her kids home. Right now she had to move into her dad's because of financial issues and how expensive rent is in California. 

But it turns out the dad had basically kicked her out and was nowhere to be found. I stayed with them, and tried to call him to no avail. At this point I'm thinking what are the kids going to do, they need to go to school the next day and all their stuff is at the dad's place.

I eventually decide to take them back to my house, even though this weekend I felt done with my girlfriend and didn't really want to spend more time with her that day, but you know. The kids aren't at fault for that. 

Then the dad texted me back and he was complaining about how when my girlfriend drinks she gets disrespectful and mean and he doesn't want to deal with it. I tell him I'm going to talk to her and he agrees to let them back in.

I again talk to my girlfriend about her drinking problem and her father but she tried deflecting. She eventually admitted she's holding onto a lot of anger cause life hasn't been that kind to her. 

But idk. I'm not sure I want to continue this anymore. All I keep thinking is this who I want to have a family with. While she said she would try therapy if I thought it was best, I don't think she's going to follow through with anything. And then there's the issue of her kids. I adore them. Ive already been picking out things for Christmas for them. 

And its like, Im breaking up with her AND them. So a lot of emotions are going through my mind. A part of me wants to give her another chance, but another part wants to just leave.

Just a really. nice guy who is kind of socially obtuse BUT hes super kind, considerate, hard working, and knows that he shouldnt settle. I respect him for that.

We love confidence and its not event like he sits around with his nose in the air and pretends he is better than everyone but he just doesnt have as much introspection for someone at 28??

Anyway, he started seeing my best friend and kept me completely out of it (which is the way I wanted it to be if this was going to happen) so I appreciate that he respected my boundaries. I am kinda mad at my friend for seeing him bc she is being toxic about it and using him for entertainment while he thinks they are gonna get married. I told her to fix her shit and leave me out of it. However, now he thinks that I (and others tbh) are his best friends and is always desperate for plans and wants to show off to my friend and basically just makes shit up??

No offense I have a bf of 3 years its weird if I hang out with him alone while hes seeing my best friend and my bf is very close with his older siblings who dont want to hang with him which is odd to me but not my problem to challenge that dynamic). I think that both of them think that I am avoiding them which I am but its too toxic for me and im just pissed they toxified it for me even though I did nothing to get them together. he says he goes to the gym everyday (he does not and doesnt look like it and neither do a lot of others, and that is FINE but why lie??). Also talks about his new raise and wanting all this stuff for himself (new furniture, new house, blah blah) then got fired from his job for having personality and character issues that didnt fit with the company (talk about a new personality)… he works in a field where its easy to find new work and high paying so he basically was able to get a new job before the old one gave him his deadline to get out. 

Now this mess is coming across and uncomfortable, loosening boundaries, and making tons of assumptions while gassing himself up to be someone he is not?

One one hand, my partner is a night owl (with early morning classes too) so when we spend our nights together, she wants to talk and do things all night. And after falling asleep very late, she has to be up at like 6AM, and insists I wake up with her to promote a healthy lifestyle. 

Me on the other hand, I simply don’t stay up as late as I use to, due to working mornings or graveyard shifts. Almost weekly basis I am sleep deprived from either work or from her or combo of both. The argument will go along the lines of her protesting that me going to bed early neglects the time I get to be with her, “you’d rather sleep than talk to your girlfriend”, and that she brings up the times I’ve said I wanna be better about waking up in the mornings. 

I, on the other hand, have brought up points being that the irregular sleep schedule and being deprived of quality sleep is leading to negative health outcomes. When I try to repay my sleep debt, i end up sleeping 10-13 hours at a time, waking up feeling exhausted and cloudy. I felt it has worsened my mood regulation, leading to increased appetite and weight gain, increased difficulty tending to my health (going to the gym less frequently, less reading/self-care, etc).

Not only that, I’ve also tried to support her in recognizing that neglecting her sleep, even for a noble cause like studying/school, has been effecting her and thus our relationship negatively, but she rebuttals that the assignments still got due dates, she still gotta pay bills, and I’m just “not being very empathetic”. 

One remedy I’ve been encouraging her to explore is spending quality time with herself when she does get days off or time to spare. That relying on me or the world for validation isn’t doing her much good and rather to build upon a sense of “inner fortitude” and stoic principles of being able to “ride the storm” of emotions and have coping strategies or means of self-soothing in the event I’m unavailable or timing is inconvenient. “We all should strive to feel we are in good company when by ourself.” Is that point inconsiderate for someone who is more extroverted than me? Or when she brings up the point that, “what if I’m sad or feeling down and that keeps me up at night?”

So I (20F) have been dating Sam (20M) for 3 years and he has a friend called Richard (21M) who he as known since early secondary school. Now the problem is, i hate Richard so much that just the mention of his name makes me seethe. Now i did not start off hating this guy but i will outline some of the reasons why i perceive him as a bad person.

If you have ever seen the Talented Mr Ripley, this friend is exactly like Dickie Greenleaf. I actually had to stop watching the film halfway through due to this association. Now i'm not in my BF's friendship group and i'm happy that he has friends outside of me, I am friends with a lot of girls who were in this group during their younger years and they report similar feelings of dislike toward richard. He will act like the person he is with is the only one that matters in the world to manipulate them into following in his lead.

In the early days of our relationship i'd often be invited to hang out with this group of friends but i found that whenever i would try and make conversation with Richard he would outright ignore me, not only that but my BF would also follow suit and i'd end up sitting on my own and feeling left out. Like i'd genuinely ask either of them a question and they'd pretend they didn't hear me. Then came the news from a few of the girls im friends with that he has cheated on almost every girlfriend he has had and used to bully a lot of people in the group. I personally have stopped being friends with some people due to cheating. There have been reports that he basically bullied Sam into having an eating disorder by calling him a 'Fatty' and taking him to the gym to humiliate him. Another friend of theirs who i am close to (lets call him James) says that he was bullied by Richard in yr 7.

Now on top of that, he never shows up for anyone if it doesnt benefit him. He repeatedly didnt turn up either Sam or James' birthday parties by giving fake excuses. The one time he did show up he was 4 hours late and we had all been waiting for him. So when he arrived i asked him to apologise to Sam for being so late and making us all wait for him. But Sam ended up livid that night claiming that i had embarrassed him and ruined his birthday. He will also show up empty handed and will expect them to turn up to his party with gifts.

My problem with this is the way my bf acts when he is around Richard, it's like his personality switches entirely and he can't see anyone but richard who i believe he idolises. I have had many conversations with Sam about this friend and how it makes me feel when i'm around them and Sam said that i shouldn't talk about his 'Best Friend' like that.

Richard has also been disrespectful to my mother when they interacted and i've wanted to talk to richard about it but Sam says that i shouldn't as I will embarrass him. I've blocked Richard on all of my social media as i just dont want to see him on my timelines and Sam took great offence to this saying ' why do i have to make things difficult between him and richard' to which i just said 'i dont like him and I don't want to see him on my feed'.

So about what I do next. I obviously love Sam a lot but i can't get over how much i hate this friend of his. Now i can't tell him to not be his friend anymore because that would be abusive but i also can't be associated with this person at all. Sam wants to invite this person to our wedding but i just can't even fathom it, especially with my mum there.

I (30F) believe him (33M) to be somewhat abusive but I don’t feel like I can end the relationship, so I’m trying to avoid p*ssing him off as much as possible. 

Today we were discussing plans for when I move to his home country (in 6 weeks) and he explained he is having his friends (a couple) and another friend (one guy alone) come to the airport with him to pick me up because I will have a lot of luggage. I am terrified at the thought of 3 random people I haven’t met also being there for our reunion. I am autistic and I find social situations overwhelming; after 30 hours of travel I just won’t want to have a bunch of strangers in my face having to perform for them in a friendly social way. 

So I gently asked “Oh, I think that might be overwhelming for me, could we arrange for just the one friend and then an Uber, or cab for the luggage so I can meet all of the new people a few at a time?” I also wanted to have a reunion of just he and I after a really tough year in our relationship. I would have been okay with him saying no to my request, I just thought I should at least help him understand I might feel overwhelmed. 

However, he responded in a cold, sarcastic, rude manner. He made it clear he wanted this couple at the airport because he had done the hard work to get them to come and I should be grateful. I now feel incredibly stupid and like I made a bad suggestion by asking to limit people being at the airport. He ended the conversation after stating I should be proud of him for finding us transport from the airport (his one friend and an Uber would suffice surely?) and hung up on me. He is now not speaking to me and my anxiety is driving me insane with overthinking. He is constantly making me doubt my judgement and I don’t know how to stop doing things that make him decide I’m an idiot. 

Am I crazy? How do I avoid making him angry at me about this sort of thing? I don’t want to upset him constantly by asking him to accommodate my ASD traits and needs, but I also want to feel heard. I have been shaking like a leaf and feel so nauseous I can’t eat, I can’t focus. I just want to make him happy. How do I stop doing things that make him angry? &lt;\3 

Some additional context: this couple has a bit of a tricky history with me, as I had concerns he was interested in the female half of the couple. My concern was totally out of line, and I have apologised. I feel like maybe my partner wants to test me and make me accept this favour - and if I refuse it, he will claim I still think he cheated with the woman in question. Which I don’t at all!

Some time ago, I ended a relationship because of a habit the other person had of posting extremely sexual memes or jokes on their social media, things that would describe their kinks and fetishes in ways that I tough should be more private, I communicated to this person how those posts made me feel exposed and that I didn't like seeing other people comment about my partner's sexual preferences or habits even if it was supposed to be all jokes, they tried to tone it down, but ended up telling me that they didn't like feeling restricted and that they where constantly stressing over posting something that I would think was inappropriate, and so they went back to posting like usual, I decided to end the relationship shortly after since I saw no good on fighting over this, if they can't live without being overly sexual publicly and I can't handle that, I gathered that breaking up was the best way forward.  


Well, fast-forward to today, I recently met someone, I like them a lot, we hit it off instantly and we've been talking regularly, getting to know each other, I get the feeling they really like me as well and are waiting for me to make the first move.   
Yeah, you probably guessed it, after adding each other on social media I noticed that they tend to share the same kind of overly sexual memes, describing their disposition and the kind of sex they like, and while they're always dressed as jokes, pretty much advertises their sexuality.   
I'm at a point where it would be easy to take this as a red flag and just stay friends with this person, but at the same time I'm wondering if I'm being overly prudish, this is where I'd like some advice, I know I shouldn't ignore how I feel about this, but is there a way to deal with it and still give this person a chance?

A few years go by and it comes up again i dont remember how and the answer is the same.... I was a little hurt at that point but I can't control how he feels. 

Ten years in now and it has come up again and now im above his mom but below his sister and still i can't control how he feels but his reasoning isn't helping. The reasoning is that his sister is always going to be around no matter what and I can go away, and if I died tomorrow he would be more sad in the begining but in the same scenario with his sister he would be sad much longer since im ""replacable"" and she is real family. However her opinion would not take priority over mine.

I can see his logic in she is irreplaceble and im not, it hurts to hear but i get it from a logical stand point.
My point is that he is my ""real"" family and I still love my brothers and sister a lot but however much i do love them I still love him more. 

This is a small issue over all but it kind of feels off balance.

We regained contact in august and got talking again and made it official in September.

I'll start by saying:  my wife is an absolute treasure, helped me through some awful mental health scenarios, is up for anything I want to do, takes genuine interest in me, always brings little surprises into our life, and in many ways, is too good for me.  I would be lost without her, and she is a joy to be around.

That said:  I don't know if ""optimizer"" is a personality type, but I think it would describe me.  My job is all about process improvements, and that leaks into my everyday life.  I'm always trying to find ways to automate things, whether that's by subscribing to certain things we always buy so we don't have to remember them, setting up spreadsheets any time we go on vacation so we know exactly what's booked, etc etc.  My wife is kind of that way as well, she runs an office and by all accounts is incredible at her job.

At home:  there have been some times recently where she's done something without thinking it through, and it's either had or nearly had a negative impact.  Some examples:

- Having 4+ bags that she regularly moves things like her wallet and keys between, meaning they're always getting lost
- Throwing out a $350 certificate her parents gave us for a spa weekend right after booking it, so I had to chase up the company the day before to beg for a re-print (took like 4 hours on the phone)
- Making a cake for a dinner party, and just randomly not following the way we've always done it, which meant the cake didn't turn out how she wanted &amp; we had to scrap it
- Having her laptop on the counter while cooking and spilling liquids &amp; flour on it (thankfully, not in the keyboard)
- Booking for someone to come and do work on the house, without telling me they were coming or what they were supposed to be doing, so they only did half of what she wanted, for the full price. 

These are all small things in hindsight, and I should just not think about them.  But I see how much stress they cause her when they happen, so either I take care of them without telling her (like with the certificate) or trying to get her to laugh it off (like walking pressed up against the wall when the laptop is in the kitchen).

Any time one of these things happens though, I always think, I should mention the outcome this had/could have had, and how we can avoid it next time.  Usually I say nothing, because my mom is a perfectionist, and that's definitely rubbed off on me.  I tell myself, this isn't a big deal, you're just acting like mom, don't say anything.

But then the thing happens again, or something similar, and I wish I said something.  So I do say something, thinking I'm just giving good advice, but I can tell she doesn't like it when I do.  We've never fought over it, but I always get the sense that she feels like I'm treating her like a child.  And when I give the advice, I often FEEL like I'm not handling it well.  I try to change my tone, but I feel like I always come across as either talking down to her (""You should really be more careful next time you're doing X, this could have gone really badly""), or patronizing her (""You see, if you have one place where your keys will always be, then they'll never get lost!"")

I feel like if I was talking to a child my approach would be right, but not when I'm speaking to my wife &amp; equal.

The opposite of this is:  I really appreciate when she tells ME that I'm doing something in an inefficient way, and always make a point to thank her for setting me straight.  I find it so helpful when people give me a new perspective on how to handle a situation.  I just wish I was coming across the same way to her.

Anyone have any advice for me?  Should I just keep any advice to myself, and help her resolve these issues as they come?

I want to accept it but I am also very hurt by his actions.  


Our sex life is great, sadly we are only able to see each other once a week. We get along very well and we do not have any other issues.

In the beginning of our relationship, we have talked about our sexualities, selfpleasure, porn, etc..  
After that talked I thought that he USED to consume different kinds of porn (visual, audio,..) but that he does not do it anymore. I told him that I do pleasure myself but usually without porn since I can not watch porn with people, especially men, in it (idk i just dont like it).  


Yesterday we talked about porn again and I found out since our last talk he has been actively watching porn and pleasuring himself to it. That fact changed my view on him majorly.  I am confused and hurt because I feel like I have been living with that fake image of him in my head for the last two years. We talked about it and I just feel numb. I have been struggling with my self esteem so much and this did not help at all.   
On the internet are mainly advices about people with a porn addiction and we are both sure it is not the case for him.   


On the one hand, I do not want to be that gf that forbids her bf to watch porn. It is not an addiction and it does not affect our sex life. For now we only meet once a week and I can completely understand that once a week is not enough pleasure for him.  
But on the other hand, I can not fight my deep down emotions: that I am not attractive, satisfying enough, ugly, dumb for building and believing that image of him, lonely, sad, hurt, devastated. I feel guilty and dumb for feeling the way I do. My bf tells me that my feelings are valid and he also feels guilty about the whole situation that was created due to miscommunication. He feels like a bad bf and wants to stop but I feel like that he would force himself upon it since he sees it as a separate pleasure from us and he is learning things about himself and for me by self pleasure (total valid opinion).  
He stated that he seperates our pleasure with what he does by himself.  


I also do not know how to feel about the fact that he watches a variety of woman (ethnicity-wise) but he is especially into asian women (I am asian).

A few days ago he went on a school trip with classmates and one of his friends who is a girl, let’s call her D. I was never really comfortable with D as within the first two weeks of meeting her they went out alone to practice baseball essentially, in which I told my bf he should’ve told me before they went out (even though we were in a argument about her actually at that time.) 

fast forward to a few days ago when they went to the school trip. My bf and D were sitting together on school bus they’re friends so ofc it’s fine, but she just leans against him when there’s space on the other side of her seat. I just don’t understand why would you sit touching someone when you don’t have to? My bf saw nothing wrong with it so I got angry and we argued.

We were not on good terms, then the following day, they had to sit in a small golf cart to go somewhere on the trip. There was no space for D to sit so the girl driving basically told her to sit on my bfs lap. She sat with no hesitation. Someone took a video of them and sent it to me. Obviously I got mad but someone he sees nothing wrong with it either?

Went they were taking the plane back, he fell asleep sitting next to D, in which he fell onto D’s shoulder and D rested her head on him instead of waking him up. 

The thing is my bf never seemed like a cheater to me, he has always been loyal and never has anything happened during our relationship in the past few years anything remotely close to this.

Her rejection really wasn't that deep to me and I most definitely don't want it to ruin our friendship.

My girlfriend and i are both in our 20s. we've lived together for about 6 months. we both work early mornings (me a little earlier) so we typically go to sleep at 10pm. last night i told her i was going to sleep and she told me she was going to stay up a little later because she needed some alone time. she just started a new job in september and im always home during the weekdays before she gets off work so its understandable that she would want some time to herself. plus we live in a small apartment so theres not really anywhere in the apartment to be alone except if one of us stays in the bedroom.

after laying in bed for about a half hour trying to sleep i got up and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. realising i didnt hear any noise coming from the living room i assumed she must have her earbuds in. i turned the corner to make sure everything was ok and she was sleeping on the couch. from my perspective she had decidied to sleep on the couch instead of sleeping in bed with me. why would she decide to do this? do some people consider this alone time? i cant seem to figure out why she'd want to sleep on the couch by herself rather than in bed knowing she'd fall asleep pretty fast (she's one of those people who have no trouble sleeping at all). am i over thinking this? it made me feel not so great tbh.

So, generally, I would always be opposed to this as I'm pretty competitive and if you're playing a game competitively, then the aim is to win. That's just part of the fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little wary on this one, though. My girlfriend's father (FIL from here on, as he will be soon enough) is \*big\* into tennis. He's been playing for many, many years and has presented himself as being a pretty good player - he spends a lot of time watching YouTube tutorials, taking private lessons, and is a member of a damn nice club here in Italy. He's a very fit man - tennis and/or 5k running 3-4 times a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not big into tennis. I've taken it up a bit with my GF over the past few months. I've never had lessons or whatever and I really am not very good. I am big into many other sports and I am quite fit - I do plenty of running, gym, football, cricket, and obviously very recently a bit of tennis here and there. When I was younger I played a lot of table tennis somewhat competitively. I guess because of this I maybe have decent natural hand-eye coordination. The point I'm getting at, is that I'm probably a little better at tennis at this stage of ""getting into it"" vs someone who hasn't played any other sport in their life. I'm reasonably fast, I have good stamina, decent hand-eye coordination, and experience in other somewhat related sports makes me able to actually get around the court reasonably well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to toot my own trumpet - I am genuinely shit at tennis. My mates who are tennis players annihilate me for their own personal fun. I'm just giving context for the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, is that I recently had a 1-2 hour casual rally session with my FIL and, honestly, I am fairly certain I would beat him quite comfortably in a proper match. My FIL was pleasantly surprised with how I played, thinking it would just be a relaxed mess about and I'd be pretty crap. I was very pleased as we have very little in common, normally. We get on fine, but he's a very serious, traditional roman catholic Italian man with somewhat broken English. I'm a bit of a bumbling Brit (and I speak no Italian). So, it's nice to potentially have an activity we can share. Something to be able to do together, rather than me sort of tagging along with my gf and her parents.

&amp;#x200B;

My FIL said that when I return to Italy in the New Year, we should go to the club and play an actual match. I said sure. And I would really like to. My dad and I do this stuff all the time - we are hyper competitive with each other with literally everything - beating each other to a pulp is never an issue whatsoever. However, I'm wary of how my FIL might take it if I do beat him (which I am fairly certain I would, if I played to win). He's a very proud man and with my gf being an only child and not something they have ever done, I don't know whether this is a dynamic he would enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like this to be an activity we can enjoy together into the future as it was great fun engaging in an activity and chatting away for once. We bonded a bit further afterwards, talking about this and that, which is quite rare.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I would go out there like fuckin' Federer and smash him to bits. But even just me taking it seriously enough to actually win. I feel like it could quite easily dent his ego, knowing him as the very proud man he is - knowing that I am a relative beginner with no formal knowledge of tennis, and him being a veritable student of the sport. However, perhaps it would actually be even more damaging and offensive if he realised I was taking it easy on him to let him win.

As with everyone, finances have been a on and off issue for us. Some background, my spouse grew up with wealthy parents and grandparents so never had issues with just buying whatever they wanted + no school loans/debt, etc. I on the other hand grew up in a family with an extremely tight budget. We were comfortable, but I was never able to own a cell phone, gaming consoles, new clothes and those types of “luxuries”.

This has unfortunately manifested itself to my spouse having awful impulse control for spending and shopping in adulthood. Not only will they buy whatever it is that seems like a need in the moment, it’s also never the cheap option, has to be the best of whatever product. As a result, we’ve battled credit card debt throughout our time together.

My spouse has struggled to maintain any sort of regular work, they take care of our child full-time now, but even before we were parents they didn’t make much of an effort to add income to our home. We spent nearly two years while I worked for my company abroad and they just didn’t do anything during that time while I frustratingly worked quite a lot at a job I didn’t like. 

Fast forward to the present and we are at our worse point in terms of unsecured debt. I feel completely crushed and hopeless about it all.

So me and my boyfriend had a rough patch recently where we broke up and decided to try dating again, so now we got back together. 

It’s his birthday this week, and I asked him beforehand what he wants to do for his birthday. He said he wants to cook dinner for his friends like he did last year. He decided this year it’s just going to be his flatmates.

As to me he said “I need to ask my flatmates if you can come, because I told them that we broke up”. At first I didn’t really feel any type of way about this, cause I’m a bit slow in general lmao. However, after some other things happened and a bit of retrospection, I realised that I don’t like that he has to ask his flatmates if I can come to HIS house to HIS birthday dinner? 2 of them he knows even less time than me, why are they so much more important ? 

On a side note, me and him did “celebrate” his birthday 3 days before his actual birthday. I took him to a expensive restaurant for lunch, and after lunch he decided he’s gonna go home. I asked him if we can hang out more, eg play video games, and he said no, he needs to go. I then asked him if he wants to have sex and he said yeah he can stay only if we have sex. 

I don’t know if I’m being “extra” thinking that he’s Being very disrespectful to me, and cares more about his flatmates feelings rather than mine? I know it’s his birthday, not mine.

I was with my ex for two years on and off. We broke up a lot as I am a recovering addict, every time I would relapse we would go through the same shit. She would leave me and call me the scum of the earth, I would get deep into my addiction for a couple of weeks, she would come back acting like I was nothing without her, I needed her and she was the only person who could help me. I believed her. This happened so often that towards the end I hated going back to her but I thought I loved her and I kept letting it happen. She fell pregnant, we were broken up at the time she found out and she didn't tell me till she was two months pregnant. She wouldn't consider an abortion despite her frequently saying ""I can't believe you did this"" ""I don't want this baby"" ""I can't be a single mum with two kids"" (she has a 3 year old from a past relationship). So we decided to give it one last shot. I got sober, stayed sober and have been sober for 9 months now. That was her only condition, be sober and we can make this work. 

Well it didn't work and we broke up after 6 months. Our daughter was 3 weeks premature. I went to the hospital for the birth and stayed with her when I was allowed. I went home with her when she was discharged. I stayed at hers for two weeks sleeping on the sofa to help with both kids. One day she just lost it and we had a huge argument, she kicked me out and said I was useless, could never be a dad, she didnt want me around her kids, so on and so forth. So I left and moved back into my flat. Since that day two months ago she has made it impossible for me to see my daughter. She was replying to my messages with constant excuses and reasons as to why I couldn't see my child. I started seeing someone a couple of weeks ago (f19) who is quite a bit younger than me. We're nothing serious, she knows I have a kid and knows I'm a recovering addict. My ex somehow found out about f19 and messaged her on Facebook to tell her I'm a junkie, I'll steal from her, I have no money, I'm a low life, she told her I had a kid who I chose to ignore and my personal favourite was she called me a pedo for being interested in teenage girls. F19 told me what had been said and I literally cried. I don't know what I have done to make my ex hate me and speak about me this way I would never say anything bad about her to a new partner. We have moved on. yes f19 is young, yeah I guess there might be a power imbalance, but she's an adult there's nothing sneaky or secretive about it. 

Anyway my ex now has a new excuse that she doesn't want f19 around my kid. Even though I wouldn't think of introducing them till I knew f19 wanted a serious relationship and was capable of being around a baby. My ex has also been constantly messaging f19 telling her ill turn her into a drug addict and that I'm using her for sex. The funny part is f19 pursued me and my ex is acting like I'm some kind of predator that hunts down teenage girls. It makes me sick. I don't know what to do anymore as nothing I have done seems to be right. The stress this is causing me to want throw away my longest sobriety stint since 2019. I have very a very small support system with most of my ""friends"" still in active addiction both of my parents have passed, I have no siblings. I have nowhere to turn so I was hoping for some advice here.

Tldr; my ex won't let me see my daughter and finds reasons to withhold her from me in everything I do.

She fell for me first, quickly and deeply yet I was a little slower to the start because I wanted to make sure. Throughout it all, we've seen ups and downs like everyone else and in MY head, I thought as long as I kept my promise to her to show her love and affection and take care of her and our kids, that opportunities would come along and help us achieve the goals we want. I moved in with her, we built our relationship up, had a child together and aimed for higher goals like a new home, new place, everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the years, especially here in the last year, everything has changed. I was waiting for my chance to come knowing that sometimes... patience will give rewards especially when you can't readily make a drastic change in your life, whereas she already wanted more, wanted change faster. 

I helped her out of her shell (severe social anxiety, depression, so on) to where her true personality shone like a light. This is where it really starts changing. During this time she was diagnosed with Diabetes, our oldest had to change schools.. then through a MMO we both started together, she emotionally cheats on me with two separate people, expecting me to understand. She admits her faults but seems to not want to change.. recently, after the second time, she tells me she is no longer sexually or emotionally attracted to me, she feels no connection to me, but has a connection with a stranger on the other side of the States who she has never met in person, or known  for more than 3 months, that even upon writing this post she STILL is talking to and carrying on with despite knowing full well how I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm competing for her heart, and that I'm not good enough and also like she takes me for granted and expects me to stay despite it all because ""The fact I say I love you means I still do love you"". I want to leave and live somewhere else but I don't want to leave my son. She also does not work despite the fact she now has a vehicle

I'm 18f, never dated or been in a relationship before. Met 20m on a dating app, we hit it off and called almost every night and met up 4 times (at the mall first, at a museum second, and at my house the last two times). I told him I wasn't into hookups/casual stuff and he jokingly asked if I was looking for ""love"", I just laughed and said idk I'm looking for a connection with someone. 
He said cool, same here. He got me a rose on our first date + paid for our food at two places, so I promised to pay for us to go mini golfing (which never happened btw since he ghosted me).

He later admitted that he downloaded the app over 6 months ago after seeing his ex post a pic with her new bf, but he told me he was completely over it now. He knew I was completely inexperienced and said he found it ""adorable"", and when we got physical on our last two dates (my first ever time kissing + other stuff, but I said no sex), he admitted me being a virgin was what turned him on the most. My friends said this was apparently a red/orange flag but idk. He said he was inexperienced himself since he only had one gf before.

He acted like he wanted to be with me. He did and said a lot of things, saying it didn't matter to him what we were doing as long as he was with me. He said this more than once, and he genuinely seemed like a good guy who respected my boundaries. He said he wanted to spend as much time with me as possible before uni started and we had to move back (our unis are 5 hours away from each other, but we met up in our hometown which we visit frequently and stayed for the summer). We also made plans to hang out next month (which was October) and he kept bringing this up, saying he'd love to spend Halloween with me. He even remembered the exact date I said I'd be back, despite me bringing it up a while ago.

We cuddled on our last two dates and he gave me goodbye kisses, but at the end of our 4th I brought up the topic of relationships while we were cuddling, and he got really uncomfortable and said he was not ready (gave a lot of reasons, saying he ""just"" got out of a relationship, hates LDR, etc.), but MAYYYBE in the future. I said I understand but got kind of upset which he noticed, and texted me about after leaving. We talked about it and I said I felt led on to which he got defensive, but we agreed that we should've talked about it earlier.. which we already had. But we dropped the topic and things were good. Btw he said he wasn't talking to anyone else right now, and I told him earlier that I wasn't either.

We texted as normal and I noticed he was texting less often but he wrote a lot when he did, I understood since he needed to pack. He said he wanted to keep talking and hanging out with me and he enjoyed being with me even when we weren't physical. 

I asked if he wanted to call sometime this week (he usually initiated) and... no reply. I keep thinking it's something I did towards the end since he really seemed like he wanted to be with me. I was super shy and awkward around him at times and even though he tried to please me when we got physical, I denied a lot of things he wanted, including a blowjob (I said I'd do it next time if he brought a condom, since he forgot one. He ghosted me, so what next time?). I regret not doing more. I really really wish I could go back in time and do those things for him. Idk if it'd stop me from getting ghosted but. I don't know. I just think, why ghost me after so long? Why not ghost me after meeting up once or twice? 

For the first date, he wanted to come over to my house but I was definitely not comfortable with that. He didn't imply it to be sexual and even said we'd head to the mall after meeting at my house, and just wanted to meet there if it'd be ""easier"" for me. At the end of our second, he basically invited himself over to my place for our third date and started asking what snacks to bring, and I trusted him enough at that point tbh. He also asked if I'm waiting until marriage to have sex, to which I'm just not ready for sex yet. He asked why and I just said it makes me nervous/anxious.

After the third, I told him that I wish we took things a bit slower when I got physical for the first time (I was randomly feeling super overwhelmed the next day), and he said we could just cuddle the whole day or take things super slowly and only get physical again when I was ready. I could hear him hitting his bottle against his table over the call and he said he has to fiddle with things when the conversation turns serious (he has adhd), and ofc I took this as a sign that he really cared about me/my wellbeing. Later on, after some other random convos, he said it probably wouldn't be a good idea to be physical at all for our fourth date which I was fine with. 

The day before our fourth, we originally planned to go out and then come back to my place, but we had to change plans since I had a lot of packing to do, so I was busy later in the day and couldn't commute further away so I said it'd be better to just hang out at my place. He was reluctant to come to my place again (I'm assuming since he thought we wouldn't be physical anyway) and wanted to go out somewhere wayy further than my house, plus it's a long journey for him to my place, so I paid for his uber fees since he paid for me earlier. We were just cuddling but ended up getting physical anyway, at a slower pace this time. He initiated, but he was much slower with it this time.

// As a side note: since I told him I'd much prefer it if he just came over instead, since it'd be easier for me, I feel like he took it as a sign that I just wanted to be physical with him again. I did tell him my reasoning but I still don't know what he presumed. I wish I could've cleared this up with him. //

I really, really expected a reply from him. I genuinely couldn't fathom him ghosting me since he seemed so SO sweet and caring whenever we were together. I understand now that he said a lot of sweet nothings but it still hurt so much that HE brought up the topic of us hanging out again, he even talked about me visiting his dorm and made me a plan to tell my family. And then he just ghosted me. It's been 2 1/2 months and it still kills me. I've downloaded dating apps again and I can't help but compare everyone to him, and realizing I'll never find someone like him again.

We clicked on everything, we had the same interests, and he sent me trailers for games and told me we would play everything together once we moved back to our unis and I got a part-time job. I sound pathetic but I just wanted to hear his voice one more time. If he just straight up told me we weren't going to work out, I'd definitely move on faster. Instead he got my hopes up the whole time we were together, always saying he wanted to keep doing things and how he liked spending time with me unprompted, and then just disappeared.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7554591,public,self,Ghosted after 4 dates.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvurnt/ghosted_after_4_dates/,all_ads,6,,,

TW: SA 

I have another post on another subreddit if you'd like the full story so I'll link it, but I'll give you the necessary details: 

- My ex SAed me when I was 16
- I was abused emotionally 
- I am still in therapy, working through it
- No, I am not over it, and not sure if I will ever be 



Yes, I (F19) stalk my ex (M20) sometimes. I unfollowed him a while ago on his socials, but I do get curious sometimes. Curious in an ""I hope he's miserable"" way, because I am spiteful. That man has traumatised me and now I am left with a plethora of issues, on top of my mental health struggles. My girlfriend (F19) is fully aware of this. 

His Instagram account is private, but sometimes I just have to look him up and just look at his profile for one second, and then I will go back to doing whatever I was doing. Nothing less, and nothing more. 

As you may (or may not) know, the profiles that you have recently visited will pop up on your search page. His was on top, and my girlfriend asked if I had recently gone to his profile. I said yes, and she got quiet and is now giving me the cold shoulder. 

Personally, I think I was not in the wrong. I have explained this issue to her so many times that I genuinely don't have the energy to explain myself to her. 

I simply don't understand why she's giving me the silent treatment right now, when she knows what happened. Is it a healthy coping mechanism? No, and I am actively working through it. But I rarely check his profile, and I just happen to do so today.

It feels unfair, like she's upset at me for trying to cope with my trauma. How do I fix this situation? I don’t know whether I should just leave it or try and explain myself, or to just apologise.

We had been dating since we were both 15. We dated for a solid one year and then had some rough times, through which we dated on and off for another 3 years. 

We eventually started living together as we went into university. All that was cut short by Covid as we had to move back to our respective towns. 

After 6 or so months of lockdowns, I moved out of the country. Everything became harder in terms of the relationship and my personal life as I was in a new university, in a new country. 

I went back to my country on and off. While I was out of country, I started speaking to this girl with a considerable number of followers etc. This infatuation lead me to talk to her more and more. When I went back to my country, I had planned to spend the weekend with my girlfriend. For one night I asked my girlfriend to go to her parents place while I had a night out with the boys. 

I got very drunk as I wanted to “live my life” that I felt I had been missing while away in another country. I met this girl at the nightclub there and she was “somewhat” drunk. She came and kissed me. We made out for a while and I got too drunk to even stand. She took me back to my hotel and purposefully stayed the night. We didn’t have sex. 

The next morning she left and my girlfriend came back. I was overwhelmed with guilt and I was trying to find the right words to tell her. That night she took me to a surprise dinner and she was really happy. It broke my heart. 

The next day, she found out. Before I could say anything, she found out. I guess university is a small place. She was broken and devastated. The next morning I dropped her off to Uni and left. That’s the last time I met her. It’s been 3 months since and I’ve been drowning in guilt, thinking about how happy she was and how hurt she must’ve been. 

We are still in contact and she tells me when she’s hurt over what happened. 
I can’t seem to let her go and she can’t let me go. I am trashy for what I did under the guise of missing out on life. 
Now I don’t know what to do.  I won’t go back to her if I think I am not ready for a relationship but what if I never am again? What if I am this bad person? What if I do it again?

My wife and I moved into a new town. Finding new jobs, raising our kid, and balancing our private life wasn't easy. After weeks of not finding work, my wife finally got a job at a local nightclub. Her old high school friend worked there, so she recommended her to the owner of the club, a man in his 40s named Mark. The friend is called Linda. After a few weeks of working there, my wife told me her boss, Mark, is making her uncomfortable. He keeps flirting with her, gives her way too much attention, and keeps calling her ""babe"". She told him she is married, but he didn't care. My wife told me Mark is an arrogant, sexist prick, and she wants to quit her job. I told her we are in no position to do that, and after some arguing, she agreed. My wife often complained about Mark, how she can't tell him to back off, because he is her boss, and how her coworkers are not taking her seriously.

Then came Mark's birthday party. They closed the club that day for Mark's private party. My wife didn't want to go, but didn't want to offend her boss by missing his birthday either. The plan was the following: She stays a bit, gives him her present, then excuses herself and leaves. She left at 8 pm. We texted each other, she told me Mark is insufferable, as always. I told her to be nice, she didn't want to offend him on his birthday, she told me she knows. She told me she's going to say goodbye to everyone, and leave. Then around 9 pm. she texted me again. She told me the party is actually pretty good, she is going to stay for a bit longer. At 11 pm. she told me she is going to sleep at Linda's place, because she got drunk, and Linda lives near the club. I texted her good night, and went to sleep.

Next day, she arrived in the morning, told me her head is about to explode, and went straight into the shower. I asked her about the party, she said she doesn't remember most of it. She vomited that day. Ever since then, she became a lot more withdrawn and cold. She never mentioned Mark again. Finally, on our anniversary, she broke out in tears, told me Mark had raped her on his birthday. I asked her what happened, she told her story.

She went to the party, everyone was really happy to see her. She talked with Linda and the others, and gave Mark her present. She remembers texting me that Mark is insufferable, then Linda gave her a drink. She remembers that Mark was really hitting on her, and then nothing. She woke up next to Mark, who told her she was amazing. She ran away. The idea that someone drugged my wife unconscious, then raped her made me lose my head. I went to the club, and demanded to speak with Mark. Linda approached me, asked me what's wrong, and I told her. Annoyed, she said it wasn't rape, my wife wanted it too. Another girl said they've been flirting with each other, all night. Linda said Mark asked her to film his dance moves, then showed me her phone. Mark dances, then starts groping my wife on the dance floor. She let's him do it a bit, then slaps him. He kisses her, she resists, but then gives in and starts returning the kiss. Linda says ""Oh shit!"" and the video ends. Mark came down, I told him who I was, and he told me we should speak in private. We went into his private room. He told me my wife is crazy, he didn't rape her. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, and showed me a video of my wife. They were in the same room we were, the lights were dimmed though. My wife was singing happy birthday in a sultry tone, while stripping down. She is slurring her words, and her eyes are really weird. Like they are staring into the distance. Mark asks her what's his present, she laughs and lays down on the bed. He told me he was drunk, and he is sorry, but my wife basically seduced him. She regreted it in the morning, and ran away. Now I don't know who to believe. The video is clear evidence, but when I told my wife, she cried, and said she doesn't remember, she was drugged, she wasn't herself. I told her drugs knock you out, not make you sing Happy Birthday. She said she wasn't herself, she would never have done that, if she wasn't under the influence of the drug.

JUST A HEADS UP: ENGLISH IS \*\*\*NOT\*\*\* MY FIRST LANGUAGE

okay this may be a long read. i have posted on this sub quite a handful of times in the past using a different account (which i deleted recently) and this is just my throwaway account.

okay, i'll go back to where it all started. my ex (m18) and i (f19) broke up about 5 months ago, but we chose to stay connected on social media since we ended our relationship in good terms. he's had his fun, he even entered a talking stage with someone which didn't really work out.

i'd say that we're really REALLY good friends. there are times when we'll just not talk with each other for long periods of time, but the moment we start talking again, it's like we never actually stopped talking. our chemistry is crazy and we enjoy each other's company a lot.

anyway, around a week ago, him and i randomly talked with each other, just a random catching up yada yada, him telling me that he's happy with his life and enjoying his youth, meanwhile i told him i was busy with school and i was trying to look for a job. he was so excited for me, and he was wishing me well. while we were on facetime, he was playing with his hair in which i said ""hey can you pretty please put your hair up?"" (for context: he likes keeping his hair down low and it covers all of his forehead) and he was really hesitant to put his hair up. after the day we called, he has started to post pictures of himself on social media and his hair was up.

throughout the whole 8 months of us being in a relationship, he never, NOT EVEN ONCE styled his hair the way i requested him to even if i would ask him every once in a while. mind you, i find him ultimately attractive either way and i was trying to boost his confidence because seeing him with his hair up makes me go crazy and he knows it.

anyway, those pictures he posted made me go insane. he looked like a completely different person and i'm happy that he finally decided to give that a try.

there's probably some of you who have read this story before, but now there's an update, he called me last night. like HE messaged me FIRST. we were talking about something random and we were blabbering about anything and everything again. he kept on making me blush with what he was saying but i tried to be stern. i asked him if i should post some pictures of myself in which he said ""you look really good here. you should definitely post these."" and he even said ""can i be the one to post your pictures instead?"" in a ""joking"" way. 

i talked to him about his hair. i said ""i told you that hairstyle suited you, you look like a totally different person."" in which he immediately put his hair down. i argued ""hey why are you putting it back down? i really like how the other one looked."" in which he replied with ""you said i looked different. i don't want you to see me different."".

there's more that happened but i won't make this post any longer. earlier, he posted another photo with the hairstyle i liked for him, in which he captioned with ""do you like my hair?"" and here i am thinking, is he asking me that? i can provide more context with anything, but i just need advice does this boy like me T-T

TLDR: my ex started posting pictures of himself (a day after our call) with the hairstyle i have always wanted him to try. he never gave that hairstyle a try while we were dating. he contacted me last night and blabbered about any topic. he said that i looked really good in the photos i sent him, and even ""jokingly"" asked me if he can post them instead. i told him that his hair really suited him and that he looked different, in which he changed his hairstyle again and said ""you said i looked different. i don't want you to see me different."". he later on posted a picture earlier in which he captioned with ""do you like my hair?""",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7554557,public,self,could it be that my ex is trying to get my attention?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvumia/could_it_be_that_my_ex_is_trying_to_get_my/,all_ads,6,,,

We broke up on a special night because we weren't on the same page and had an emotional outbreak that ultimately resulted into a break-up over text at 1 am. He was being very aggressive with his words and I believed I had gaslighted him back then which led to that demise.

Moving forward, I took a break and told him talking as friends would be okay. Time progresses, we end up being fuck buddies for the entire summer before we head off to college again. At first, they were just sessions of pleasure, however as we met up more frequently and hung out alone outside of our friend group, we realized how we had both fallen deeply in love again. We had intimate, deep conversations about what went wrong with our relationship, how much we changed since then, and how everything seemed to be falling in the right place. However, college was coming up again, so the last time we saw each other before splitting off again came fast. We both broke down in front of each other and realize that we broke up due to stupid reasons. That we wished we never broke up, and now that college was starting up it would be harder to maintain. However, we decided that we wanted to go for a LDR because our relationship felt so connected, and there we proceeded.

In September,  we both headed off and there began our LDR. This was my first relationship and first LDR relationship, whereas this is his second LDR. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, we made sure we spent time with each other through games, video calling, and texting throughout the day. We would tell each other we miss each other and love each other a lot, however it wasn't until a few weeks ago where a lot of contemplation hit my boyfriend.

One week before we were going to meet up for Halloween, he asked if I had time to call that night. He told me he had been struggling with the relationship because he didnt realize how much physical touch meant to him and how he misses my presence. I told him it's alright, I understand and that in a few days when we see each other Ill make sure to give you all the love you want because you deserve it. However, he said he wasn't sure if he could last 4 years doing a long distance and told me he needed time to think about it. Hence, I gave him the time to think, and in the end after gathering thoughts from his friends, we said we would continue trying. We met up during Halloween break, I rented a room for us to make sure we had proper alone time together and made sure his stay at my place waa comfortable as well. Everything went perfectly, and after he left I was ecstatic about the next time we would meet.

Fast forward, its the 2nd week of November and we planned on meeting up Thanksgiving break. Just a few hours ago, I was talking about how I was upset because I was planning on visiting him early, but things ended up not working out. As we talked, he mentioned the same worry again, but this time he was saying realistically with out situation, it will be hard to see each other in the future. Of course I was devastated and told him I can make time for him, however he said with how far we are, he's struggling with the fact that I can't be there physically to comfort him. Things led to the next, and after all the remarks I made, he decided to end things off. 

Im struggling with how to cope, as he said he loves me so much and can see a future with me as do I, however we ended things because he can't handle it. He told me things like ""You are perfect for me,"" ""Lets be together after college,"" and its taking a mental toll on me. He said no matter what I say, his decision won't change. What's done is done, and we are now broken up. It hurts me to think that my feelings didn't have any impact, and he says I would understand after being in an LDR. I don't get his reasonings and how sudden the break-up was over text and without any say of my feelings.

Let's call her Judy. When I was a freshman, I didn't know a lot of people and it just so happened that I showed a little interest in her. I would talk  to her every now and then about college assignments and stuff. It was all going fine. Until one day i decided to hang out with her in her dorm room. By the time I came out, I knew all the random details about her life including all of her family gossip among other things. You see, she is the kind of person who just talks and talks and talks without keeping track of things and randomly infodumps on you with no regard to the person listening.

I don't blame her though. That's just how some people are. But I soon realized that she requires a different level engagement from her friends. Being an introvert, I feel very overwhelmed by the fact that she needs to be around me ALL THE TIME. She would make plans with me everyday and  sometimes even invite herself over to my place despite the fact that I told her I don't have much tolerance for being around people and it exhausts me. There are a lot of things that are weird about her that violate my boundaries.

For instance, when I leisurely walk to and fro, she walks with me. Always at a close distance. She always has to sit next to me. Sometimes so close that our knees are touching. When I move the chair a little to leave some space between us she would also move her chair so our knees are touching again. During the start of the friendship she would hug me for an awkwardly long amount of time when I see her off. I've told her that  I'm not okay with so much physical contact from a stranger (because of past trauma). But the fact that she has to stay so physically close to me in general makes me very uncomfortable. Judy just tries to force a level closeness that you are supposed to develop over the time right away. I have friends I deeply care for but they're my friends because they understand I need time and space in order to come around and hang out with them.

I am now distancing myself from her. I decline whenever she makes plans or invites me over to her place. I just think it's for the best. I have nothing against her personally. I just can't respond to her overwhelming needs. I even suggested she make other friends but she simply says ""but it's easier to  talk to you!! uwu"". I do admit I feel kind of bad for her and don't want to hurt her. But I hate holding the reigns to her emotional state at the same time. When me simply being my introvert self hurts her, it puts me in a very stressful situation and I really don't know what to do at this point other than slowly back away because she just can't take a hint/is oblivious to my discomfort and vocal protests.

I left eventually and when she was walking back with her friends she confessed she had a crush on me for 2 years. We meet the next day and for 4 days we’re hugging a lot and opening up loads to each other about really personal stuff. We end up kissing and for a month we’re having sex every 2 or 3 days and seeing each other everyday. I was her first kiss and I took her virginity. She was very attracted to me and I do believe her when she said “There’s no way I’ll end this relationship you have to breakup with me.” And “I like you so much you don’t fucking understand.” She also said she felt the same way about me in sixth form. However one Saturday we’re hanging out with our friend group and I made a joke while drunk. This joke really upset her and she was drunk as well and she stormed off crying. The next day she said she wanted to end things but still had feelings for me. She said she wanted to be friends but I couldn’t do that. She starts crying talking about how much I understand her and she really values me. then within 10 mins we’re back together again. 2 weeks go by and within that she says she does not care about the alcohol anymore. I got too drunk one night and almost got into a fight and she had to break it up. She’s very agreeable, contentious and intelligent so that conflict for her was very stressful. She also suffers from OCD. The next day she decided she wanted to break things off for good. She was crying saying she still had very strong feelings for me and that this is very hard for her. For the next 1 or so we would still talk and flirt with each other. I would also have some moments where I would beg and plead with her. I did this about 3 times.  We also hooked up one night. One night we all went out as a group again. She was almost blackout drunk again. At the club she started with some guy in front of me and I texted her saying I didn’t wanna be her friend anymore. The next morning we spoke about it and she said what I did was such a cunt move and she said she lost feelings for me because of that. Which I find very unfair as what she did was far worst and I think it was an appropriate reaction as I can’t see her flirting with someone else already. She also seemed really confident about having no feelings and agreed we can’t be friends. She said she something where if someone does a cunt thing, she just won’t like them anymore instantly. Apparently her and dad have it. This may be related to her OCD? She’s now in a rebound thing with this new guy she met and flirted with. She has not texted me however she did once after a week to tell me this new guy was gonna come to one of our friend group meet-ups? Do you think she still has feelings for me, moved on with this other guy or is using this guy as a rebound?

My boyfriend (20m) and I (19f) have been best friends for almost a year, but have known each other for years prior. We recently reconnected on social about a year and a half ago, and have been talking ever since. We have been dating for almost 7 months since we made it official after I came home from getting discharged at basic training. 

Here’s the fuck up: the entire time we were talking as friends, I had another guy friend I was talking to, with absolutely no intention of a relationship, but he and I would trade nudes sometimes just like with my current boyfriend. I had been trading nudes with both of them for a few months when we started dating. The first week we made it official (we were/are long distance for school) I hadn’t fully wrapped my head around the fact that I was actually in a relationship with my best friend and had sent a few pictures still to the other guy. 

Last night, my boyfriend and I were talking and I don’t know what happened or why I did it but I told him everything that happened. That it was a few pictures, one time, and nothing had happened since then and the other guy isn’t really around anymore. My bf understandably got really upset and shut off his phone for about 2 hours and then came back. We kinda talked/argued for a bit afterwards and I feel like absolute shit because I never meant to do it and never meant to hurt him, he is the kindest person I know and I really love him with my whole heart. He told me he isn’t sure is he loves me now and that there is a chance our relationship coukd be over because of this one mistake. 

Do you think there’s any chance we could fix this? Is there anything I can do to make things right?

Side note: He did say for what it’s worth he’s glad I told the truth. We also had multiple trips planned and paid for over the next year and I’m not sure what to do about them.

I've been with my girlfriend for just over 2 years and the first year and half of that was perfect. So much so that we moved into together relatively quickly.

The issues started 4 months ago when she and a few friends she runs her business with wanted to launch a product. Our sex life and intimacy as whole just took a nose dive due to the insane hours she was working. I'd initiate but would constantly get brushed off. There were times when work absolutely consumed me, I'm talking 12hrs days for 6 days a week, but I'd still made time for our relationship.

I stopped imitating sex after the first month and just threw myself into work, friends, lifting and even went back to my old boxing gym. She tries to initiate sex now that work is less demanding but I don't want her even touch me, which is of course is devastating for her. But the constant rejection during that first month really rocked my self esteem and I spent the subsequent 3months getting over it.

 Whenever she initiates and I push myself to have sex with her, all those feelings of rejection, anger and humiliation come bubbling back to the surface and I don't her near me. Much less get an erection.    Do I just call it quits? Because even if we get through it this time, who's to say it wouldn't happen again the next time work gets a little too much for her? And even if we do talk to someone and work through it, it'll just feel like having sex with me when she's busy is a chore that she needs do to keep the relationship alive and that's not something I'm willing to live with. 

But I can't exactly jump ship because I still have 10months left on the lease.

Since I was a good church boy, and she was a good church girl we decided to get married. In hindsight it wasn’t the best decision, but it was the only one we thought we had. Now we have a beautiful daughter and that’s great but our relationship is lackluster to say the least. I’ve turned into a robot because after many conversations about the things that I would like indeed there has been no change on her end. While on the other side, every time she has told me that she needs more or less of something I have made the change because That’s what I’m supposed to do.

Now we get to the part where it’s been almost 5 years and I’m the only one who’s made any changes. How is that fair? It’s not in my opinion and I’m done trying to pretend that everything will be fine now.

Tonight everything came into a clear picture. When I got home from work, I ate some dinner, but some of the food wasn’t good. Like made me sick not good. So I went upstairs to lay in bed. That way I would be near a bathroom in case I need it. at some point, I fell asleep, and I was only awoken when my wife checked on me because I had been unusually silent. After that, I fell back to sleep and she only woke me when it was time for her to come to bed. She didn’t wake me up on purpose when she was coming to bed. It was just something that happened. Either way she does her nightly routine and then comes to bed after doom scrolling. She grabs her “massager” and starts looking for that special spot. Now I’m sitting less than 3 feet away from her checking my notifications to see what I missed. I hear that unique sound start behind me and give it a second. When I look back, she avoids my gaze. So I get up and go in the other room so at least if I’m going to feel lonely, I can do it by myself.

I wait till I hear the deed is done, then come back and lay down on my side of the bed. Mind you not a word has been said, and I’m not going to say anything because I’ve said it all a few times. The more I think about it, the less this relationship makes sense. If we wanna go out on a date, I’m the one that has the plan it. I’m the one that has to pay for it. Our sex life is underwhelming as she takes great pleasure in me pleasuring her, but approaches pleasuring me like an unwanted necessity. Outside of sexuality there is no intimacy between us. She likes being kissed and touched a lot. And I like being touched as well (not sexually) by people I trust and a wife should be someone I trust but I don’t anymore. She doesn’t touch me unless it’s a slight passing moment. She doesn’t express sexuality at all, it’s just another task for her. I just found out that her finances are all wacky and she’s (which means we are) $3k in debt while I pay 80% of our bills. 

We are saving for a house and that last part just seemed like a great disregard. Not even sure how she spent that money. 

Point is I don’t want to destroy this family but I’m not going to be alone and unhappy in my own home for the next 15 years and would like some advice to get through to her.

It started when she went with my family to London, and was disapponted that I was discussing the possibilites to attend a football match with my brother (i did not go, or tried to convince my GF and mother to go). Then she was mad I wanted a burger for breakfast, told me I did not care what the others wanted, but I could just grab a takeaway burger and did not think that would be a problem at all?

Afterwards I went to a family dinner for my birthday while she went home, I left my birthday party early to bring her food and cake from the birthday. This was in august, and a couple of days ago she brought it up. She said that when I could even consider going back to sleep it meant I did not truly loved her the way she loved me. I get upset when she tells me this, and I think i show her everyday how much I care. Her mother has serious cancer, and is living in a different part of the country. My Gf is also having a stressful time finishing her PhD and feeling depressed and having trouble eating, so I make her dinner every day. I really try my best to be a loving partner and that makes it so hard when she says she does not feel my love is genuine. Last week she was having a bad day, and I had a really important business trip, maybe my most imporant business dinner this year and said that if she needed me I would call in sick and cancel the dinner. She refused, and I went away wednesday- thursday, when I was away I suprised her by ordering sushi. Her mother having cancer is a heavy burden for her, and I have also said that I love my gf so much that if she wants a baby (in case her mother passes before she has kids) i would totally be up for it. I just feel I give her all the love I have, and that breaks my heart when she says I dont love her the same way she loves me, and she feels i dont meet her at her emotional needs when she is worried about something, like my behaviour (wanted to go back to sleep on my birthday, considering a football match etc. ) and I feel that i get too much criticism and being judged as a person, but also i really try to listen to her and improve. So yesterday we were talking about me wanting to go back to sleep ( i stayed up, and left my birthday party early later) and she could never to that. In March it was 10 years since my sister died, and I wanted my gf with me the whole day before meeting my family the evening, and she didnt stay with me during the day, only for dinner. And when I brought that up yesterday she snapped and asked me to move out. I see her frustration as she has really been good with me and my family, and I regret bringning ut up.

It was late, around 1 AM. He became agitated and started barking at a shadowy figure right outside of my front yard. The person waved at me, but I live in a bad neighborhood, and I didn't recognize them, so I got us back inside and got my husband out of bed to check it out. When he got to the door to check, the person was messing with our mailbox. He went outside and said a few words, and then came in and told me it was my old friend. I'll just call her ""Janice"".

I hadn't seen Janice in 5 years. I had seen her mugshots come up a few times in our local database over the years for getting in trouble with drugs. I knew her for about a year previously, we hung out a few times and she was a sweet, kind, good friend back in the day, but things got complicated on her end and she kinda just fell away from contact. I was concerned that if she was showing up at my house randomly after all this time she might be in danger and I would feel so guilty if something happened and I didn't even talk to her.

So, I ran outside and called out for her, apologizing for not recognizing her. It is freezing cold outside and she was carrying a backpack. I didn't want to stay out where it was so cold, so I invited her into our enclosed porch to see what was going on. Even in layers of jackets, I could see that see was painfully thin. Very quickly I also realized she was really bad on drugs. I have children and I feel a need to protect them by not having them around people on drugs, I don't really trust people on drugs no matter who they are, plus my dog doesn't take kindly to strangers, so needless to say, I never invited her in our actual house.

She was so far gone. I have no idea what she was on, but she rambled on non stop and only made a tiny bit of sense for very short periods of times, then went right back into rambling drug psychosis talking. It was heartbreaking to see. I had known her to be such a smart, kind, wonderful person. I did get a few coherent things out of her. She was hungry, and so I gave her some leftover takeout pizza and a drink. At some point she said she was safe and had a place to stay. I was concerned about her, and I was trying to show I cared and not be a total jerk because she wasn't acting bad at all and she never had treated me badly in the past. I regrettably said something about that I was here for her, and she could drop by any time. I guess I was also afraid of setting her off somehow because I didn't know how she'd react since she was clearly out of her mind.

I literally sat there and let her ramble on about nonsense for hours. 97% of it made absolutely no sense or I couldn't even make out what was being said. However, when she was leaving, she gave me a big hug and thanked me and did not want to let go of the hug, so I let her hug me for the longest time. I could tell the hug meant a lot to her, and I am really concerned and sad about her state. The whole experience was really tragic and heart-breaking.

So, now I feel like a jerk because the truth is I don't want to be around anyone on drugs, I don't want anyone on drugs coming around, and I don't want my family around anyone on drugs, no matter what.

At the same time, I feel so bad, I feel like she needs someone, she needs help, I feel bad saying anything like this and turning her away.

I need advice on what to say and do if she shows back up, please.

I suppose a desired outcome would be to not come off as a jerk or uncaring, but still not have to deal with this issue.

tl;dr : old friend I hadn't seen for several years showed up at my house completely out of her mind on drugs. Don't want to seem uncaring, but don't want this sort of thing around my family, and don't know what to do / say if / when she comes back 

Also, I would ask my husband, but he's asleep, and I won't see him until he gets off work tomorrow. I'm afraid she's gonna show up again before I even have a chance to talk to him about it.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7554390,public,self,What should I (40f) do if my old friend (42f) with a current drug problem returns?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yvtv6m/what_should_i_40f_do_if_my_old_friend_42f_with_a/,all_ads,6,,,
