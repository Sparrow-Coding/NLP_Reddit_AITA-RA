I'm a bit concerned I'm being a selfish asshole and maybe I just need confirmation of this.

Basically I have just hit the big 30. I am married and my wife's family is extremely traditional and I think there is pressure there for us to have kids ASAP etc and they don't do much beyond going caravanning and have never been abroad so I guess we are the polar opposites of each other in terms of this.

However, before we got married, I made my intentions known that there are various countries I'd like to visit before I settle down, because when I have kids, I want to be there to support them in every way possible, and not be spending time away from them. I really feel that life is about experiences and travelling has really peaked my interest and helped me develop as a person. I'm also learning Mandarin Chinese so my dream goal is to travel China and use this. Doesn't seem likely any time soon though.

I went to Korea this year and my mother in law is now not speaking to me as she says I 'abandoned my wife'. My wife has no interest in travelling as such, especially not to the far East. My point of view is that we should support each other to do the things we want to do. She has no interest so why would she waste her money in joining me?

I'm intending to go to the Far East next year too, then the year after we are planning a big holiday together before planning to settle down and start a family together. We are also planning to have our delayed honeymoon next year too.

Am I being an asshole here? I just feel that life is too short, so much has been taken away by COVID in the past years and I don't want to have any regrets, I mean we never know what could happen soon. Several people my age that I knew from school have died recently, and it's a bit of a reality check.

&amp;#x200B;

Also a bit frustrated as I've been learning Mandarin to go to China for maybe 2 weeks and meet my friends I've made and really experience the culture, then I'd be finished in terms of places I'd like to visit. Is it an asshole move to go on 1 last hurrah as such when there's a child in the family? I think so, but at the same time, I don't want to have any regrets and I've learned so much Chinese now and I don't want it to go to waste and it's my biggest interest at the moment.

I guess I'm kind of scared that having kids is the end of enjoyment lol.

I went to my parents with him to give him a few days rest as I am very isolated from family where I live and have no friends there. He came and joined us two days ago and has been beyond stressed the entire time.

A year prior to us getting married I found our she had been sending nudes and videos to some guy.  I confronted her at the time and we worked through it and we got married the following year as planned.  Jump forward to during lockdown i found out that a few months prior to our wedding she was messaging/sexting her ex and met up with him for sex telling him i was clueless and she would say she was staying at a friends.  I was completely devestated and I have tried to work through things.   Since this though i have tried to continue on but I have struggled and every time her phone goes, she hides it if i am near and its making me increasingly paranoid.  We have fairly recently had our child and when lying in bed last i woke up after being asleep for a few hours and she was still awake on her phone.  The way I was lying I could see what she was doing and i seen her messaging multiple other men on different apps.  There was 2 men on snapchat she was messaging that I couldnt see what was being said but she was also messaging on an app i didnt recognise (i think it was tumblr) and she had been sending them pictures of her underwear on our bed, pictures of her in a costume lifting it to show her butt and seen her send a message saying she couldnt take a picture without waking me and the baby but she had lots of pictures on her blog.

In short: I grew up completely neglected. My parents used to be travelljng musicians and carried me around like a piece of luggage for the first 10 years of my life. I never had friends in that time, nor did I go to school that often. I have absolute 0 connection to my family today and we have no mutual understanding. There is no common ground to move forward on, so we don't talk. I survived most of my adult life because I was in a very fulfilling relationship, but that has ended about 1,5 years ago. 

I am self-improving a lot, but obviously I can't deny that my childhood causes me to feel extremely lonely. I would trade literally everything I could for a support network. I am lucky to have good friends, but no friends in the world can truly replace a family. They obviously got their own life's to live and families to take care off, so I obviously can't expect them to give me the love a real family could. 

Today, all I want is to be in a relationship again, because my last relationship made me live happily despite all that trauma. It was the bandage that kept my life together. 

I have met a girl I like, but she is extremely attached and what most people call 'clingy'. I am attracted to her and there are lots of aspects about her personality that resonate with me, but I can't deny that her being clingy, kinda gives me the warm feeling of a relationship again and I really don't know if I should let my trauma influence my life like that.

There's the main guy, Z (28M), and his girlfriend, C(?F). Z owns a local shop that all of his friends enjoy. He makes a lot of connections with people/artists. I feel like people pay him through his shop to give them opportunities. He just threw a big Halloween party and expected everyone to pay him for it. I also hooked up with this man over 2 years ago twice. I do not like him that much, but tolerate him, because he brings everyone together.

Another guy, G (38M), I started hanging out with over the past few months. He took me under his wing when we hang out with this group. He told me he has feelings for me and I had to decline and we agreed to be friends. He has a date set up with another girl he brought to that Halloween party (she was really nice, and I'd like to be friends with her).

The other night Z, C, two other guy friends, G, and I went to a concert together. We smoked some weed in the car, I only had two hits and I was sent. We had to find something to eat and ordering something made me freeze so I just asked G to order a meal and I'd eat the fries.

We park at the venue and wanted some alcohol. We all walked to a nearby store. Again it was hard for me to decide on something because they didn't have many single cans. So we all had to share a pack. This was so weird to me, it was juggling who was going to pay for it. G ended up paying for it. When we got back to the car, everyone got a beer but no one gave one to me so I had to ask. I felt bad doing this.

G covered my ticket. I did buy my own beer at the venue (so I had one small can and one small, tall can all night). I also should have bought more food because later on in the set I almost fainted. G caught me and dragged me out of the pit. I don't know what happened but I went to the bathroom then we sat on the floor for the rest of the show. 

I don't know, I just didn't like the dynamic going on here. It's like the women needed to be covered by one of the men in the group. I tried to bond with the other girl, C, but it's like she straight up ignored me or didn't take up any of my conversation. I just want to be my own person, but if G wasn't there I don't know who would have helped me. I also feel like it's my duty to go buy something from Z's shop.

He mentioned how it’ll be great when Im alone with my dead elderly mother. I lost my whole family besides her last year. I snapped and while he was sitting on the floor blocking me, I took his hat and hit him on the head with the back of it. Then I don’t know what happened except he grabbed me, threw me so hard on the bed I went flying and fell on the ground, then when I got up, he pushed me back down, held me down so hard that I screamed in fear and said “You psychotic bitch, if you ever touch me again I will FUCKING FUCK YOU THE FUCK UP!!!” Then cussed me out the whole drive home (an hour) saying I had fake crocodile tears. This was a week ago. My arm is bruised and my neck is still injured. I had a scratches on my leg from his callouses and my nail broke in half when I fell on the floor. He told me later that he didn’t mean to throw me so hard and barely used any force, but that during the fight realized I’m as fragile as glass. Although for over a year he’s seen me be unable to lift more than 6lbs. 

We’re still talking, he still says he loves me but doesn’t want to get back with me, but asked me not to add more trauma aka sleep with anybody else or lie while he’s around still. I asked him not to sleep with anyone else. I feel that this is my fault, and that I deserved it.

I tell him I’m uncomfortable and to take me home. He refuses to, leaving me trapped and continues touching me. I eventually start kissing him back and say yes to and then ask for sex. Something I would not have done if he listened to me when I wanted to leave or if I had a way out. He takes me home once he’s done 5 hours later. Is this just a regretful learning experience or something bigger?

When I(f) was 17 I had a sexual encounter that ended up being traumatizing. My ex at the time begged me for nudes one night and I refused. After he sobered up he apologized and said he owned me one. Being the goody two shoes I always wanted to “rebel” a bit and so he offered to let me drink at his place and then drive me home. So I could try it out safely. That night, he drive me to his house, put on a movie and I drank enough to get tipsy but not drunk. He had one alcoholic popsicle and then started acting drunk. Which confused me because that defeated the purpose of him driving me home. 

Anyways he started touching me even after I told him stuff like “we’re going to regret this” “this isn’t a good idea etc.”. I was so uncomfortable I got up and walked to the door and asked him to take me home. He grabbed my hand and lead me back to the bed. I tried again to get up and again asked to go home. But he tightened his grip so I couldn’t walk to the door. I asked him to take me home again but gave up after that. I had no way out, as he touched me I thought about who I could call to pick me up from his house but I had no one to call. 

I don’t remember much else but I’m assuming that I was receptive to what he was doing. Like kissing him back when he kissed me. Letting him take me hands and do whatever. I even gave him a BJ after protesting because he wouldn’t stop asking. By that point I had very little strength to argue. I had learned that if I don’t give in he will not stop begging, that he wanted to cut himself when I told him no, and one time I asked him not to do something again but he did so anyways. Then immediately started crying and apologizing when he saw I was uncomfortable. That only happened once that I can remember. Eventually he asks to have sex and I consent with the thought of “might as well get it over with”. By that point I had been there for 3 hours. Complications happened and when he realized that he couldn’t penetrate me. He stopped but then I felt like a failure as a women and asked him to try again. It didn’t work (because I was not turned on in the slightest) he drove me home around 4am. We started drinking around 11.

He said that it was because our goals don't align. 

He wants to be a dad. I never took those conversations seriously because we didn't even live together. I also felt like if I wanted to have kids with him he'd have to put in a lot more work such as learning how to cook, changing his work / sleep schedule, improving his self-care, etc. He also hasn't started a career and makes a lot less money than me. I don't feel like the division of labor would be equal if we had kids anytime soon.

Another reason for breaking up was because of my job. When we first met I had a position that required me to travel a lot. He stayed with me for 3 months while I was away in another state. Then I got a new position that would allow me to stay home most of the time. I work in emergency management so that's not always possible. Recently, my boss asked me if I wanted to deploy for 30 days and help out with the situation in Florida. I knew he wasn't thrilled with the idea of me leaving again but he never discussed it with. I wish we communicated about it a bit more but I figured if it really bothered him he'd talk to me. 

I was asked if I wanted to extend another 30 days. I told him I was considering it. I think it really freaked him out because a few days later he called me to break up. I'm not even taking the extension now because I'm so heartbroken my performance is slipping. 

He kept saying he thought my new job would be different and that I would be home more. It's exceptionally rare for me to deploy in my new position it's just they needed a lot of extra support in Florida so I volunteered. I could always say no and stay home. I thought he understood my job because he stayed with me for so long in the beginning.

I'm flying home next week. I haven't talked to him since that phone call. Is it worth it to talk to him in person? I left a lot of my feelings unsaid.

Hello denizens of relationship\_advice,

Background: so my GF works at a hospital, and two days ago one of her patients apparently bled buckets over her and ended up dying, so she was pretty shook up. Around 6 PM she called me (and I picked up), telling me this and asking if she could come over to clean up and have some care and cuddles. I say absolutely she can (and I'm looking forward to caring for me and being there for her, as a BF should) and say I can't wait to see you.

Her clock-off time is 8 PM, and usually takes her about an hour to get back - 1:20 to 1:30 if the traffic is bad. Since I do not know when she is getting back (and I had already prepared my room and had ingredients for a meal I was planning to cook her - all was ready), I text her just before 8 PM saying ""Just at the \[University society meet-up\], ***let me know when you are going to be back in town.*** The \[meet-up\] finishes at 10 PM, so I can dash back to mine straight after or a bit earlier to give you some TLC.""

In hindsight my wording should have been cleared (and I have said that to her, but I don't think it's made much difference, but we will get to that later). I would have left the meet-up as soon as she text me, as the location was 3 minutes walk from my place, and I would have made sure to be there before she got there. She was the priority that night, and I asked her to text me when she was going to be back so I would not keep her waiting when she needed me.

So 9:45 PM rolls around and I've had no missed call or written reply, and so I figured that a) before this time she must have just gotten stuck in traffic as she has been in the past, no big deal, she'll make it eventually and we can see each other, and b) that I'll call her now to check on her and see what her ETA is going to be (again, so I won't be late).

She picks up and tells me a few things. 1) She had seen my text around 8:20 PM, 2) *She saw it and chose not to reply to me*, 3) She had been back in town since 8:45 PM, 4) She had already showered, eaten and done everything she was supposed to do at my place and let me do for her. Of course this has my feelings sink into the floor, and I ask her why she didn't just text me as I asked. The exact reasons I cannot recall (it was over a phone call two days ago now), but *at the time* she said it was not wanting to disrupt my plans (but over text later she says she did not feel like a priority to me - except of course she was, is, and threw our plans into a blender because she refused to write a quick text saying 'Hey I'm almost back in the city'). Over our later texting exchange I state that I should not have assumed and should have clarified with her when she'd be back, but again, this is a two way street here folks.

My disappointment was clearly audible, and I voice out that that whilst I certainly could have communicated more clearly, she also did not message me letting me know about the above. I also say that I still have the whole night to see her if that works, and she replies saying she has an early start for work, so she can't. I then say that I don't have any plans for Thursday (last night) and Friday (tonight) that I cannot cancel or rearrange to spend the time with her, and she brushes me off on both counts. I'm clearly not getting anywhere so I end the call by saying I wish I'd been able to be there for you, and that we'll avoid such situations in the future.

Move to 7:30 PM last night, and we haven't called or texted the whole day. I had no idea if it would be better to say something or give her some space to clear the air, and went for the latter. At 7:30 PM I get a very angry text message giving the bloody situation in detail, berating me for not being bothered to contact her today asking about how she is - *or apologising for last night* (as if it is entirely my fault) - and sarcastically wishing me to enjoy the other society/club meet-up that I usually go to that night. Except I'm not going to it, I told her I did not have plans, and that I was doing a remote distance-learning package for an online course at that time.

Cue a long and messy string of texts, that I will spare all of you, aside from some highlights (*my notes or comments are in italics*):

* ""It is not a feeling of comfort knowing that if I run into a problem or need to see you, the chances would be I would find a switched off phone or you with a full calendar."" - I turn off my phone at night so I don't get my sleep disrupted, not a huge ask. I also have a busy life and lots to balance, but always make time to schedule in time with her so I don't a) forget and b) so it means more, it's set in stone as *our* time.
* She sort of mocked me about planning things out and having a schedule - ""That's all you want, to have it written in a schedule, and the plan re-discussed to make sure we both understand, and we leave according to the planned timings. Because this is work not a relationship. That **should** *(see that word will recur)* be according to emotions and needs and not the clock \[...\]. Great *(sarcasm)*, so I will book a time slot every time I want to see you, and call ahead to confirm it. \[...\] You spend time with me due to a plan not because you want to (more sarcasm, that's not how it's like, I plan because I want to explicitly reserve the time for us).""
* ""I was sad and anxious but not crying \[...\]. You **should** be able to read that.""
* ""We are not married and in our 70s that you feel so comfortable with like let me look at my schedule and decide when I can see you next."" (*OP's note: see above. It's not like this)*
* How do you expect a relationship to work when you cannot even say to me once that you want to see me now and \[that I\] will have just have to make it work."" - *I'm not the sort of person who imposes myself on people like that. She gave me excuses and reasons why seeing her yesterday would not work - yet that same day one of her friends, upon calling her and realising she was upset, did what I wanted to do - met up with her, took her for food and let her vent. I said I wanted to see her that day, and made it clear I could, but she said one thing and* ***expected*** *something else of me. I cannot read minds. I want to be there for her damn it, but I can't when she does not communicate*
* ""No take your time to run over what has happened while I will get some air, and that will make me feel loads better. And when we meet again we can pretend nothing happened. And next time I am drowning in someone else's blood, I will not tell you and nothing will go wrong."" - *now reading this damn well hurt people. I was wanting to see her that night, had the time, and she was a priority. A communication breakdown led to this whole sorry mess. This message was dripping with sarcasm, as she is taking my words (e.g. I said that I had not contacted her as I had (wrongly) assumed she'd want some space so that we could 'both run over what had happened' and to 'clear the air') and twisting them against me.*
* The friend she saw yesterday... she told me that ""\[He\] took me to dinner and forced me to eat **without even me asking**. He was waiting and g**ave me no choice**. He held my hand and walked me to a restaurant even though I said I feel like throwing up, and then put food on my plate."" - *I had no idea that's what she wanted. Maybe she did not know she needed that. All I knew was I'd explicitly expressed a want to put things right by seeing her that night, and she'd turned me down. Not giving someone a choice? I'd not want to impose on anyone like that.*
* When I said that ""I didn’t know if you’d want that or want to be left alone and that me calling you would be bothering you; I didn’t know. I could not guess"" she replied with ""Oh yeah that is great emotional intelligence. When someone had somebody die, let's leave them alone tonight and not call them tomorrow."" (*OP: again, awful sarcasm from her, and to reiterate one of the main reasons she was alone that night was because I had no idea she had been back in the city for just over an hour - because there was no communication from her to me, as I asked, to avoid this happening*).
* She also brought up a past mistake of mine where I entirely forgot we had made plans to hang out a second day (see my post history for that), which was 100% on me and my fault, which I apologised for. We both came to the conclusion that we needed to communicate specifically what the arrangements were when we would see each other and when things would wrap up, so neither of us would be disappointed. As you can see above, that was used against me.
* ""I **expected** you to call me today this morning apologize for last night and make sure I was doing okay."" (*OP: FYI I tried calling three times as this texting exchange was taking place, but she either declined the call or let it time out. I also tried her about 15 minutes ago when she was online on WhatsApp, but again, she did not pick up).*

The exchange concluded last night with me saying the following (and no reply from her):

&gt;""I should be able to \[notice your feelings\], and sometimes I’ll detect it. Other times I’ll miss it - all I can do is get better at noticing it. If I know you’re upset, the last thing I would ever want is for you to remain like that and not feel that I’m there for you. Regarding the phone thing (*she brought up how I keep my phone off at night)*, I’ll keep it on at night from tonight onward in case you need to call. And if you are ever in trouble or need me when something happens, I’ll drop whatever it is I am doing or plan to do if I can. I promise. Now, that aside, I hope you have a better day tomorrow. You have an incredibly tough job but a huge heart and incredible fortitude and courage to do it, and your colleagues/patients are unbelievably fortunate to have you - as I am. Sleep as best you.""

That's all for now. Pretty burned out typing this, but thank you in advance kind people. I really don't know what to do here. I'm trying my best here, and it still doesn't seem to be enough. Because she communicated all of the above to me (with some points being perfectly pertinent and valid), I know now more about what she wants and needs - some of it being perfectly reasonable. I know now to be absolutely clear in my communication, and to be more flexible with my schedule (again, I also explicitly said this - that this is something I need to work on, and she's right to point it out). I'm also being somewhat mocked for wanting to talk things out, clear the air, and she seemed to get angry or annoyed when I said we'd miscommunicated - that 'this is what you always say'. She is saying that she does not feel like a priority, except she forgets every single time I made her a priority and she knew it. Anyhow, I'm rambling at this point, but thank you so much to those posters who take the time to reply.

Really torn on this situation. My ex of 28 years is (supposedly) moving out of the country. 

After a bumpy break up that resulted in several times of one of us halting communication, me blocking him, him blocking me, we had finally come to a point of where we weren't doing that anymore but, communication was very one sided. I was the one always initiating contact. 

So, I stopped. Didn't see the point in communicating if it was always one sided. And I can take a hint. 

So it's been quite awhile since we've communicated. 

I feel he's going to leave the country without saying a word to me. No goodbyes. No last conversations. 

Which, it is what it is. I can't force him to want to communicate with me. But it's not going to change the fact, this will leave me heartbroken. I fear I may never hear from him again or see him again. And I would like to know that he's ok.

Perhaps someone can shed some light on why he's being like this? Or, perhaps it's me that needs to just let it be?

We all got along like a house on fire and quickly became a little friend group, which included my boyfriend who is also very friendly with everybody in the apartment. 

It was such a lovely atmosphere - no tension, we made the kitchen and living room all homely with fairy lights and ornaments, and we would all hang out together to study, cook each other meals and even go forced shopping together sometimes. People from other apartments in the vicinity actually tell us that they love hanging out in our apartment specifically because we've made it feel like a home, rather than just an empty student flat. 

Herein lies the beginning of the issue - one of my female housemates, 'Tia', was becoming incredibly flirty with our only male housemate, 'Mike'. Tia is very outspoken about her sexual preferences, which include light BDSM - to the point where it was becoming very annoying to listen to her coming back from Tinder dates, complaining about how she was 'horny' but these guys weren't her type. Everyone in the apartment is pretty open - my housemates have teased my boyfriend and I when we look like we have just had sex - but ger comsgsnt comments seemed irrelevant and aimed at Mike. 

They became increasingly flirty, to the point where THEY looked more like a couple than my boyfriend and I did. I and the other housemates, including the one who became closest friends with Tia (we will call her Rachel) gently warned Tia that getting involved with a housemate was a bad idea. 

At this point, they were even openly sharing a bed a few nights a week, but Tia said she would never date somebody 3 years younger than her, and she was 'touchy and like this with all her friends, male or female'. However, it was getting uncomfortable to witness. We all had a bad feeling, as Mike is a bit of a player (3 one night stands in a week kinda player) and Tia is very co-dependant due to severe mental health problems, which she somewhat hides well. 

Today, Tia officially told the whole apartment that she and Mike are 'dating'. It turned out they had sex a week ago, after Tia had a particularly shit Tinder date and Mike brought her for a drink to cheer her up. 

The vibe in the apartment is already changing, as the whole apartment disagrees with this relationship and knows they will end terribly, with us forced to watch. They are already acting weird in the puic kitchen and living room, with Mike grabbing Tia and feeling her up like a piece of meat while we try to eat dinner. We all ended up eating in our rooms today, which upset Tia a lot because we always eat together. 

On Tia's end, we don't think Mike is good for her because he is a heavy drinker and regular-ish drug user, and she has ended up taking care of his debilitated self a few times after nights out. Sure, they get on well,but them beginning to date after Tia having a long string of bad Tinder dates seems like convenience more than anything, imo. 

On Mike's end, we don't think Tia is good for him because I don't think he realises the severity of her neediness and mental health issues. I think he just wants some regular sex that he doesn't need to work for or even leave his house for, but he seems to be going along with this 'dating' idea to get that. He knows that Tia has mental health issues, but I don't think he knows how severe they are, as she has been putting the print of that weight on Rachel, and became very needy with her. 

This is a total disaster waiting to happen, and it's like watching a car crash in my own home. It's only been a day and it's already starting to ruin the amazing relationship everyone in the apartment had, and I can already tell that our dinner outings and craft nights will become less and less if they are acting like wild animals trying to mount each other in the common areas. 

I'll give it a few months, until the excitement of sneaking around and the taboo wears off. How the hell do my housemates and I survive until then? Do we say something? Do we distance ourselves from this car crash in motion?

Burner. I have a problem.

I've known I'm a lesbian for years now, pretty much since I was 14. Men never really attracted me, and I've always been treated better by girls than by men, and since I've been aware about my lesbianism for the longest time, I've started noticing how different it is to be around women who love men than around lesbians.

With lesbians, I can always be sure I'm in a safe space. No men around, and it's always guaranteed I won't have men forced into my life ib any capacity. Lesbians treat women as people, and can separate us from men, which many straight, bi and pan girlies unfortunately tend to have a problem doing. (If you're het, bi or pan and you don't, congratulations. I'm not talking about you.)

In one of these safe spaces, I've found a girl I've gradually shifted closer to. We've bonded mostly through mutual respect and separation from men, through our shared worldviews and love for deconstructing the world around us. I've always found safety in knowing she would never put me in potential danger of bringing a man into our lives and that comforted me immensely.

We got together 2 and half years ago. A week ago, she came out to me as bisexual.

Now, let me just explain something really quick to people who aren't lesbians and aren't familiar with the lesbian experience.
The LGBTQIA community is meant to be a safe space from homophobia which comes from homophobic straight people. But lesbian community is at even higher risk - not only are we threated by homophobia, we tend to also be threatened by men. And by extension, very often we're also victims of people attracted to them, often because these people suffer from internalized misogyny. And even though that makes them victims too, that changes nothing at how poorly it causes them to treat lesbians, since we're the only sexuality that doesn't effectively prioretize men in this patriarchal society.

This, among other identities, includes bisexuals. And bi women in the area where I live aren't particularly friendly, so forgive me if my experience is different from those of other gay people.

So, picture this. After years of constant support and safety within lesbian spaces, you suddenly lose all of that. Suddenly you can't bond over lesbianism with your girlfriend because she's busy thinking about men. Suddenly your safe space is no longer a safe space for people who separate themselves from homophobic men - *suddenly, you learn that years of love and praise from your girlfriend were a lie, and she actually puts you -a lesbian- on the exact same level she'd put a man on. Suddenly you're no better than a man in her eyes.* It probably doesn't sound bad to most people, but to me as a lesbian separatist, it's absolutely dehumanizing.

This is how I felt the first two or three days after she came out to me. So I started browsing various subreddits on my main to find anyone who might have had a similar problem before I go to my therapist with this. I didn't find a lot, and most posts were from people who either came out as bi afterwards, or suffered some prior issues with abuse from men. I'd prefer answers from lesbians - any lesbian, with or without prior experience with bi women in relationships.

To clarify, I haven't been abused by men OUTWARDLY. But as years went, I've watched my lesbian friends constantly be harassed by men, belittled by them and discriminated against in favor of men or people who are attracted to them. And knowing I live in a world where I can start being treated like shit by anyone who puts them on a pedestal has not been easy for me.

To sum it up, I'm angry. I'm heartbroken, I feel lied to, I feel like my own girlfriend is putting me in danger of being treated like shit by men. I feel like I've wasted two years trying to bond over my experiences with someone who secretly never agreed with them. And I want to sort my feelings out and get an outside perspective from people who have had this problem before.

What do I do about this?

I have been married for almost 20 years and met my wife at 16. This is the only relationship I have ever had, and despite feeling miserable and invisible most of the time, I just can’t leave. When I am level headed I see that my wife is not in love with me, and doesn’t even like me (she hasn’t slept in the same bed as me for 10 years, the most attention she will pay me is a kiss on the cheek goodbye, doesn’t compliment me and argues/patronises me if I have any opinion different to hers). However, when I decide it’s clearly over, my brain reminds me of the good times (admittedly many years ago) and I convince myself that it’s salvageable and I need to work harder. I feel that she won’t leave because she doesn’t want to be the bad guy, so it’s up to me to either stay and be the doormat or leave and try to remember what being happy is

The problem is, I’ve been working hard on the relationship for years- but one person can’t do it alone. I work full time, while she works part time a couple of days a week, I do all the cooking, shopping, most of the cleaning and my fair share of kid-wrangling. I buy her gifts and flowers, compliment her, look after myself and do everything she wants. However nothing works to have her show any interest in me, so I don’t know why I just can’t leave.

So, has anyone been in my situation? How can you tell your brain it’s being completely irrational and that there is nothing you can do to convince her to love you. And despite having nowhere to go and no money for a second residence; for your own sanity you need to get out.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Firstly,the country is extremely racist and give all the government jobs to blacks first because they claim that blacks were were disadvantaged during apartheid and should get the opportunity now. So my chances are not much. I wrote an exam for a job in the government and never got an interview. My black friends all got the interview and they claimed they never studied or barely studied.

I am a woman, with absolutely no family or parents to help me when times are tough. We currently stay on free housing. I am dying to work and make it in life and buy my own house out of the horrible neighbourhood I stay in. My mother doesn't help much as she is dependent on me completely and doesn't make any effort to work. It would be nice to have a mother who works for herself than rely on me for food and expenses. It's weighs me down because I could have used the money for a car installment or even save. I'm thinking about when I do get a decent job then my mom will always be there and me taking care of her as if she's my child. However I'm also jobless and I hook up with men for money in order to survive. 

When I do get a job then it's sales call centre and I'm really bad at it that I end up being miserable and also the salary is ALWAYS entry level salaries. The last job I worked at was very far and i got home after 8 including Saturdays and couldn't study so I left because they only offered R4000. I never get a job based on my experience. I always get the school leaver jobs my whole life. I have stayed only for the money but now I'm jobless and cannot find work. Its very hard to find work in my country and even to find transport money to go to work. There is NOBODY to help me so I do hookups.  Its my only way of surviving out there. Not a family member will help me just to get on my feet. They assume I'm lazy like my mother mother wants freebies. I am not. I am travelled through the dark to go to work, took many forms of transport and still studied. I'm so tired now of life not being kind to me. 

I now need an internship but I'm still doing hookups which I feel really bad about. Retail won't hire me because I have no retail reference except for working in my own little shop. That also failed. I'm a failure. Everything I do and try is a fail. The only thing succeeding is me being a prostit*te but I always ditch the men and delete my profile because I feel disgusted to meet with complete strangers but when I am desperate then I create a new profile and start posting ads again. I have probably ditched and avoided meeting like 3 times but when it comes to having no food then I meet and go thru with it. I feel I have no future. My job requires me to have a car because of meetings. How am I suppose to be able to afford a car if I'm on free housing....

What can I do.... I'm very down about my life and feel that I just need to end it because after many years of studying, I now need a car. How does one even get a car when you're in a ghetto neighbourhood with no garage. My whole life there are extreme obstacles and no way out. I thought studying for a degree would help me. My mom is waiting for me to be rich because she always talks about how rich I will be one day but i won't be rich. I'll be OK and have enough for myself. I am 28 with NOTHING. People always tell me to get married ASAP but nobody wants me because they see I'm on free housing, have no father and no job. A father is very important in the muslim culture. Without a father, men only try to take advantage of u and sleep with you and leave u.  It happened many times where men only wasted my time instead of getting married to me. One man left me because my mom was so dependent on me and he knew if he married me then his money would go to her. Another man always complained about my mom not wanting to work and the last man just became distant because i always needed financial help.

Please advise me how I can change my life. My resume even looks great but still there are no jobs. My mother applied for places but she claims she can't find find yet she got interviews which she showed up late to and failed the training so my mom's even doing better than me but because she wants to sit home and let me work for her while she don't take baths and don't even cook food...yes my mom never cooks. I have to do that too. No matter how many talks we have,she won't change.

I don’t know what to think. He did other things but these two were the worst. Besides this, our relationship has been perfect, I just don’t understand why he did this.

My boyfriend suddenly told me that he was going to Germany to work for six months in October. He did not ask for my opinion, but informed me what decision he had made, even though I was against the separation. He complains a lot about working in Germany and said that he feels worse without me. He even got a job offer in Poland from January. Therefore, I encouraged him to come back to Poland, which would enable us to meet every day, and we would live together in spring. I know that in January it would be too early to move in together, because we are still arguing, so I don't want to move until I find out that we are fine and that he cares about me, and the apartment I want to live in is still rented. On the other hand, he said that as long as I did not live with him in Poland, he would not come back from Germany. Another problem is that in December he intends to visit his family in Poland, but he does not intend to visit me. There is no way about joint trips, too, because when he offered me a joint trip, I told him that this date was too expensive for me (I earn 4 times less than him) and I offered a different date, which he was indignant about and he would buy himself a ticket in the more expensive one time limit. After these behaviors, I feel that he does not care about me and that he does not need me for anything, and certainly not for meetings, unless to charge me for the cost of housing, because he said that if I paid 1000 zlotys, I would have a boyfriend.

Background: so my GF works at a hospital, and two days ago one of her patients apparently bled buckets over her and ended up dying, so she was pretty shook up. Around 6 PM she called me (and I picked up), telling me this and asking if she could come over to clean up and have some care and cuddles. I say absolutely she can (and I'm looking forward to caring for me and being there for her, as a BF should) and say I can't wait to see you.

Her clock-off time is 8 PM, and usually takes her about an hour to get back - 1:20 to 1:30 if the traffic is bad. Since I do not know when she is getting back (and I had already prepared my room and had ingredients for a meal I was planning to cook her - all was ready), I text her just before 8 PM saying ""Just at the \[University society meet-up\], ***let me know when you are going to be back in town.*** The \[meet-up\] finishes at 10 PM, so I can dash back to mine straight after or a bit earlier to give you some TLC."" 

In hindsight my wording should have been cleared (and I have said that to her, but I don't think it's made much difference, but we will get to that later). I would have left the meet-up as soon as she text me, as the location was 3 minutes walk from my place, and I would have made sure to be there before she got there. She was the priority that night, and I asked her to text me when she was going to be back so I would not keep her waiting when she needed me.

So 9:45 PM rolls around and I've had no missed call or written reply, and so I figured that a) before this time she must have just gotten stuck in traffic as she has been in the past, no big deal, she'll make it eventually and we can see each other, and b) that I'll call her now to check on her and see what her ETA is going to be (again, so I won't be late). 

She picks up and tells me a few things. 1) She had seen my text around 8:20 PM, 2) *She saw it and chose not to reply to me*, 3) She had been back in town since 8:45 PM, 4) She had already showered, eaten and done everything she was supposed to do at my place and let me do for her. Of course this has my feelings sink into the floor, and I ask her why she didn't just text me as I asked. The exact reasons I cannot recall (it was over a phone call two days ago now), but *at the time* she said it was not wanting to disrupt my plans (but over text later she says she did not feel like a priority to me - except of course she was, is, and threw our plans into a blender because she refused to write a quick text saying 'Hey I'm almost back in the city'). 

My disappointment was clearly audible, and I voice out that that whilst I certainly could have communicated more clearly, she also did not message me letting me know about the above. I also say that I still have the whole night to see her if that works, and she replies saying she has an early start for work, so she can't. I then say that I don't have any plans for Thursday (last night) and Friday (tonight) that I cannot cancel or rearrange to spend the time with her, and she brushes me off on both counts. I'm clearly not getting anywhere so I end the call by saying I wish I'd been able to be there for you, and that we'll avoid such situations in the future.

Move to 7:30 PM last night, and we haven't called or texted the whole day. I had no idea if it would be better to say something or give her some space to clear the air, and went for the latter. At 7:30 PM I get a very angry text message giving the bloody situation in detail, berating me for not being bothered to contact her today asking about how she is - *or apologising for last night* (as if it is entirely my fault) - and sarcastically wishing me to enjoy the other society/club meet-up that I usually go to that night. Except I'm not going to it, I told her I did not have plans, and I was doing a remote distance-learning package for an online course at that time.

Cue a long and messy string of texts, that I will spare all of you, aside from some highlights:

* ""It is not a feeling of comfort knowing that if I run into a problem or need to see you, the chances would be I would find a switched off phone or you with a full calendar."" - I turn off my phone at night so I don't get my sleep disrupted, not a huge ask. I also have a busy life and lots to balance, but always make time to schedule in time with her so I don't a) forget and b) so it means more, it's set in stone as *our* time.
* She sort of mocked me about planning things out and having a schedule - ""That's all you want, to have it written in a schedule, and the plan re-discussed to make sure we both understand, and we leave according to the planned timings. Because this is work not a relationship. That **should** *(see that word will recur)* be according to emotions and needs and not the clock \[...\]. Great *(sarcasm)*, so I will book a time slot every time I want to see you, and call ahead to confirm it. \[...\] You spend time with me due to a plan not because you want to (more sarcasm, that's not how it's like, I plan because I want to explicitly reserve the time for us).""
* ""I was sad and anxious but not crying \[...\]. You **should** be able to read that."" 
* ""We are not married and in our 70s that you feel so comfortable with like let me look at my schedule and decide when I can see you next."" (*OP's note: see above. It's not like this)*
* How do you expect a relationship to work when you cannot even say to me once that you want to see me now and \[that I\] will have just have to make it work."" - *I'm not the sort of person who imposes myself on people like that. She gave me excuses and reasons why seeing her yesterday would not work - yet that same day one of her friends, upon calling her and realising she was upset, did what I wanted to do - met up with her, took her for food and let her vent. I said I wanted to see her that day, and made it clear I could, but she said one thing and* ***expected*** *something else of me. I cannot read minds. I want to be there for her damn it, but I can't when she does not communicate*
* ""No take your time to run over what has happened while I will get some air, and that will make me feel loads better. And when we meet again we can pretend nothing happened. And next time I am drowning in someone else's blood, I will not tell you and nothing will go wrong."" - *now reading this damn well hurt people. I was wanting to see her that night, had the time, and she was a priority. A communication breakdown led to this whole sorry mess. This message was dripping with sarcasm, as she is taking my words (e.g. I said that I had not contacted her as I had (wrongly) assumed she'd want some space so that we could 'both run over what had happened' and to 'clear the air') and twisting them against me.*
* The friend she saw yesterday... she told me that ""\[He\] took me to dinner and forced me to eat **without even me asking**. He was waiting and g**ave me no choice**. He held my hand and walked me to a restaurant even though I said I feel like throwing up, and then put food on my plate."" - *I had no idea that's what she wanted. Maybe she did not know she needed that. All I knew was I'd explicitly expressed a want to put things right by seeing her that night, and she'd turned me down. Not giving someone a choice? I'd not want to impose on anyone like that.*
* When I said that ""I didn’t know if you’d want that or want to be left alone and that me calling you would be bothering you; I didn’t know. I could not guess"" she replied with ""Oh yeah that is great emotional intelligence. When someone had somebody die, let's leave them alone tonight and not call them tomorrow."" (*OP: again, awful sarcasm from her, and to reiterate one of the main reasons she was alone that night was because I had no idea she had been back in the city for just over an hour - because there was no communication from her to me, as I asked, to avoid this happening*).
* She also brought up a past mistake of mine where I entirely forgot we had made plans to hang out a second day (see my post history for that), which was 100% on me and my fault, which I apologised for. We both came to the conclusion that we needed to communicate specifically what the arrangements were when we would see each other and when things would wrap up, so neither of us would be disappointed. As you can see above, that was used against me.
* ""I **expected** you to call me today this morning apologize for last night and make sure I was doing okay.""

we talked a bit about it and I even suggested he make a private account to do this, as I can dissect my own insecurity at him viewing them from my feelings about him engaging so publicly. it’s low-key humiliating (someone else actually noticed &amp; told me). he uses this account professionally, it has his full name…. we’re an industry couple of sorts so we already deal with enough stupid gossip.

But this one actually bothers me, and I know everyone is diff about this, there’s no right answer. I usually steer clear of every man who does this but I didn’t realize until recently. I feel like it’s tainted some kind of sanctity of our bond. 

all that aside, it’s a huge turn off for me, and even though our chemistry has been able to (mostly) prevail over this, it definitely holds back our potential.

I have asked him questions before like, is there anything in particular you’re into sexually? and he doesn’t say much…. why doesn’t he want photos of me in lingerie? I find this hot and enjoy doing this, but I feel uncomfortable to send them while he still engages with these girls so publicly, and sends me no signals that he even wants this from me. (mind you, I have a slim, fit body with a relatively pretty face. I could probably be one of these girls if I wanted to be, but I like to keep my sexuality more private for my lovers.)

also I should add, I’m really referring to the photos sharing nothing but lizard-brained sex appeal. not beautiful models sharing artistic photos, or interesting fashion, or even really intricate BDSM—like give me SOMETHING beyond flesh to justify engaging with these women publicly.

I was previously in a LTR and we were due to get married this year but we broke up and called it off.

My mum is super caring and does a lot for me but she can also be intrusive and annoying. We've always had a difficult relationship as our personalities clash... we get in to arguments over the dumbest things. She's like my best friend 50% of the time, the other 50% we are arguing. The arguments currently centre around guys, her telling me I should go see a shrink, and then other random stuff. 

I work 4 days a week in a school but I also have 3 jobs on the side. This week I've been feeling burnt out - I've been up at 4am every morning to fit in my exercise regime as I'm training for a marathon. I was so looking forward to today (day off) as it gives me a chance to rest &amp; catch up on things I've been putting off through the week. I went for my run early this morning, was on cloud 9, got home and said good morning to my mum as usual... she proceeds to ask me what time I want a lift to a job tomorrow - I told her I don't know yet and that I'd let her know when my boss tells me. This is like the fifth time I've told her this. She just repeats herself constantly and it winds me up.

She could tell I was annoyed by my tone of voice. Then she said 'OK, well let me know then once you know' in a bitchy tone. I thought... I have to leave this room or she is gonna ruin my mood on the one day that I can't afford to have it ruined. As I'm walking out the room she says 'someone's in a bad mood'. Wtf. I was perfectly fine... she put me in a mood. 

I completely lashed out at her for this. I told her there was no need for her to say that while I'm removing myself from the situation to calm down. I left the room, and went back in shortly after and ended up throwing a few things around because I was so angry. It just sucked to have my mood go from such a high to such a low. I HATE it when people annoy me  a run.  She knows this too but couldn't help herself. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. The rare occasions we get on it's fine, but I'm tired of her meddling and making me feel this way. She still treats me like a kid. The Job I have through the week is temporary but I'm going to apply for permanent jobs so I can hopefully get a place of my own. I have £25k saved up. It's 10.50am here and I'm currently drinking a Gin &amp; tonic to try to make myself better to get on with my jobs... it's not working. I hardly ever drink so I know this has really affected me.

Today I wanna see about getting some advice on something that's haunted me for my wife and I's 6 year relationship. 5 of those married. 

When we first started dating, I was going through a divorce. I was just looking to get back into dating and met my wife online. We went on our first date and hit it off. It was easily the best date I've ever had in my life. 8 hours of dinner, ice cream, walking. We really hit it off and I think we both knew this was gonna become something. Flash forward of non stop dates and bonding, and 3 months later I'm sitting on her bed while she's showering and we are getting ready to head out and spend the day together. 

Well, her phone vibrates on the night stand a few times. I looked over to see because if someone's calling her. I see some dudes name pop up and instantly have this really concerned feeling take over. I would never usually do this, but we were pretty serious already at this point so I opened the messages. I had to look through and see that a few months ago she was sending him pics. The dates were really close to when we met and a few were during that first week or so. However, he kept messaging her the past 3 month togehter. At this point we are dating officially so I'm on her social media with a few pics of us and her having it set to us dating. 

Now the fact she sent him pics crushed me for a few different reasons, but the fact she didn't cut ties once we got serious hurt a shit ton too. But the worst? The fact he was talking such shit about me and she wasn't stopping him. She was responding to him and letting him go off about how much I suck, I'm useless, so many things about me. I sat the phone back down and confronted her when she got out of the shower. It lead to the biggest fight ever. She instantly fully broke down and began apologizing like crazy. Telling me how much I mean to her and everything. I tried to leave at this point and she physically wouldn't let me. I eventually got out, her sister called me to talk while I sat in the parking lot of a local burger joint and cried. She convinced me to go back and work it out. Saying how her sister has never been so into a guy before and this isn't her. I eventually went back and we worked it out. 

6 years later we are married and life is perfect. Two kids, and couldn't be happier. But my question here is this.... I think about those messages..the things he said, what she sent him, how she never stopped him and just laughed when he'd say those things about me. I use those messages to motivate me all the time. I use it to drive me to be the best thing ever to her, kill her with perfection so she knows she'd never do better. I'm 15 years ahead of promotions at work, I win top awards every year for my performance. I use that moment to absolutely drive my life. 

How do I forget? Am I crazy for this? Why can't I just let it go.

I love him with all my heart, but right now I also hate him.
On and off I had been finding the odd bottle or can hidden in his sock drawer or in the car. We've talked about it and he says he doesn't know why he does it, he puts it down to his (undiagnosed) adhd.
I haven't been out in the car with him in almost 2 weeks, but popped in to find some rolling papers quickly, I found the entire footwell in the passengers side full of empty cans and bottles, to the point that had I opened the passengers door it would have spilled out onto the pavement. 
We're getting close to Xmas and I haven't been able to buy the kids anything yet, I've not been able to get ahold of the finances and always finding myself short each month and having to borrow money from family to make ends meet, now I know why.
He's finally made an appointment to see someone about his adhd, and in turn the alcohol.

I'm just at a loss, the way I see it is he's been stealing money from our kids to further his addiction (he has 1 or 2 beers on a weeknight and weekends drinks what he wants, also does bongs and microdoses on psychedelic mushrooms)

We’ve been together about 4.5 years at this point, the love has almost always been one-sided (something I’m only realising now, because red flags can look green if you’re stupid enough). We moved across the country back in November of 2020 to a state where we only have each other, I was trying to salvage the relationship, make it work.. but now, I don’t want it. 

For context; He works away on the oil rigs for 3 weeks at a time and is home for maybe 10 days before leaving again. I stay at home and work fulltime and care for our pets (2 dogs and a cat). Because of this, I am incredibly isolated and lonely, and I don’t think this is the life I want for myself and I also don’t think it’s what I deserve. — the week or so we have at home together I have to work during the week and then as soon as I get home he wants dinner cooked and laundry done with the house kept spotless. On our weekend together I often have to wash all of his work clothes or do his food shopping or clean up after him. …I’m exhausted. He doesn’t want to go out for lunch or do anything together to make memories with me, even when I say “hey there’s a farmers market on Sunday let’s go?” I just get lectured about what it means to be a hard worker. When I ask, beg, plead for him to help me out even just a little bit around the house so that we have time to watch a movie together, he lectures me about how he’s worked away and deserves to come home and do nothing. (Mind you he has from 6:30am till 3:30pm every day he’s home to himself)

I’ve put up with this long enough, I’m exhausted. I think he has the best situation, cash in the bank, pets looked after, laundry done etc. meanwhile my life feels like it’s on hold, if I want to work an extra weekend to get paid a big bonus to try and build my savings he says that I’m wasting his time and he should’ve just stayed at work. — what about my time? What about everything I sacrificed for us to be here? I know we both left our family and friends but he’s made all his friends over here and he’s not in touch with immediate family. 

I’m so exhausted trying to be a housewife for someone that I don’t think has any true intention of making me his other half, and why would he, I already do everything for him.. he refuses to celebrate any event with me, birthday, Christmas, valentines, because “I don’t care”. But I do. My love languages are acts of service and gift giving, and family is so important to me, it pains me that he doesn’t want to compromise for me, not even a little bit. 

My continued question is this, I’ve just started a job I love in April of this year and it pays so well and the company isn’t back home so I can’t transfer. I also feel incredibly guilty that I want to leave and then our pets would be caught in the middle and he couldn’t look after them while he’s at work. 

So what, do we become roommates? How would we even navigate that? What do I even do?

He noticed that I had said something, so he took off the headphones and asked what I had said. i can't remember how it escalated so quickly (like it mostly does), i just wanted to tell him that the conversation from the kitchen wasn't necessarily over for me as we entered the living room. and that his behavior (instantly sitting down behind his computer and putting his headphones on) signals me that the conversation is over for him, which just felt a bit too abrupt and it would have helped if he just said something like „i would like to watch a film now“, instead of just „leaving the situation“ without saying something. He was immediately annoyed and said that it wasn't his intention to „leave the situation“ and end the conversation. I said again that it just looks like that to me and asked him if he could at least understand that. He responded very annoyed and in a louder tone: ""I understand that it looks like that to YOU!"". In the course of the argument he also said that he doesn't understand why i inflate a topic that wasn't worth it and that i have delusions. he said several times ""You just don't get it, do you?!"" in a REALLY annoyed tone. unfortunately I don't remember in which context, but it felt as if he wanted to tell me how stupid he thinks I am. He also said he didn't understand why i don't just draw attention to myself if i want to say something. Then he would pause the film he is watching. we often do it that way in everyday life and it's no problem for me, because everyone is doing their own thing then and we aren't in a conversation in these moments anyway. It seems he didn't get that there is a difference for me. I said multiple times that he could have just communicated that he wanted to do something else now, and that it would have been perfectly fine. I still don't understand why he couldn't just say ""I see your point, let's do it like this in the future"". instead we had this forever long discussion ..     
the whole time he was talking in a very annoyed and upset tone. at one point he said again ""I understand that you feel this way!"", but his tone of voice didn't sound like it at all. when i pointed this out to him, he said it wasn't about the tone of voice, it was about the words and whether i would even listen to him. (is it like this? Am i delusional for thinking that the tone should match the words??) he suddenly switched to a super nice tone, which i found very weird. when I said that this seemed strange to me, he said that this is was what I wanted and why I wasn't satisfied with it now. after an eternity of this annoying back and forth he said at some point he would make a note now so he could remember how he would have to deal with me in the future. he then showed me the text. The note says: ""After the conversation has flattened out, ask if there is still a need to talk. do not withdraw attention in these moments, except for small things like eating or rolling cigarettes. Announce if something else is done or watched or heard alongside.“ I find it totally weird that someone (my husband!) makes a note like that, it feels completely wrong. i didn't want to and couldn't discuss it any more so i said that it would be ok and that was the end of the conversation.

We’ve had our bumps in the relationship but have always seemed pretty solid. 

Since the beginning of our relationship he has always told me he only wanted me and only was attracted to me- he went out of his way to convince me of it. Now I understand if a guy wants to watch porn, I get it. But he always told me it was something he didn’t watch and acted very uninterested.

I recently found out that was a complete lie. He has multiple accounts on porn sites and has a Reddit account that is just for him to look at things like that. Like I said above, I understand wanting to watch porn but the fact that he lied for so long hurts. 

Not only that but he even commented things about not knowing how long a guy could last with the girl in the video cause he’d finish so quick. He also liked comments that said similar things as well as comments saying “those are the most perfect tits” and “you have the sexiest blowjob face”. It just hurts to see things like that especially when he doesn’t even talk to me like I’m sexy. 

On top of that, I found out he was talking to his ex the first few months of our relationship. He was telling her that he was still in love with her and was thinking of leaving me for her. He also messaged her while we were going through a bumpy patch in 2018- nearly 2019. 

I also found a Reddit post from a month after we got engaged (little over a year ago) and the post said he wasn’t in love with me anymore. In the post he mentioned still thinking about the same ex a lot. He also has a Facebook account he’s been using just to check her Facebook profile. 

There’s more that I have found than I have mentioned, I just don’t wanna rant forever. I’m just feeling very confused. He told me he doesn’t feel that way anymore and doesn’t feel any type of way toward his ex but has checked her profile as recent as July (that I know of).

But once when I was on her phone I noticed she used to send videos and messages to her ex, exactly like what she sends to me. Calling him her best friend and wanting the rest of her life with him. To make it clear this was before we got together. 

I have brought it up with her, and she says she never meant any of those things, because it was an unhappy relationship and was just saying and sending them to make the relationship feel real and have value because she didn't want to give up. Which I mean makes sense as they had a life together and rented a house together I imagine it's hard to give up, but she says she was so miserable.

My massive issue with the entire thing and what plays on my mind because I'm a massive over-thinker is does she actually care if it's with me or does she just want the life she dreams of with the first guy that will give it to her.

And was scared. I watched the videos she sent and was in shock at some of the things my son had said to her. He sent videos of her admitting she would be doing it alone and he wanted nothing to do with them and to just get rid of it. 
  She blocked my account after sending me this 


My son told her in the messages he basically was gonna be a dead beat  dad she was going to do it alone numerous times.

Everyday after school A would tell me about what G has done to him today, like throw out his jacket out of the classroom's window, push him and other not okey to do stuff. A didn't let G do all that, he claims he called her names, acted very rude so she stops because it's passing him off. And G eventually stopped. Back to nowdays, A has been communicating a little with another boy from the class K. K is involved with G, they sit together in class, walked together after school, not dating but K likes G. And whenever A talks with K when they play games or they're in school, the main topic is always G and her friend T. Those talks about G and T's personal lives and random stuff about them. I can understand why K is interested in that because he likes G, I don't understand why does my boyfriend take so much interest in listening about the personal stuff about these girls.
He says the stuff he hears and talks about with K are interesting to him and they are funny. And he always comes back with a positive expression after talking with K about G and T. Is it just because he had a good time with his friend or the information he receives is nice to him.

We felt the same on a lot of things, we have a love for a show that is how we met, we liked all the same things, and I felt like I could trust her. I don't have a lot of friends, I struggle a lot with meeting people, and it's very, very rare for me to click with someone so quickly. They were so sweet to me and I think I began to develop feelings along the way, and I honestly felt like they might feel the way back. It was nice - I haven't had a crush in a long time, and it was nice to them about them. 

Then out of nowhere, they began to stop responding to my messages. I was worried I had said or done something, as I had a minor lapse with alcohol not too long ago, but I went through our messages and I didn't say anything or do anything to hurt them. As far as I knew, they didn't even know I'd lapsed. I got the help I need and am doing better, but I still hadn't heard from them, and I began to worry all the time and doubt how I felt. Was it all just nothing? Was I fooling myself?

Then they messaged explaining shit was happening in their life and they needed time. I was fine with that, tho I did send funny things they might like, but I still worried constantly about them. Eventually it got to a point I heard from them maybe once a fortnight and I realised I had to start moving on. We did talk one last time, but something on their end pissed them off and they ended the hangout without any warning and I was left confused and very hurt. I didn't know what had happened. If I had done anything wrong.

We went pretty much no contact for ages. I don't know how long. I was already feeling terrible due to no contact with my siblings (we're fine, just all needed space to deal with shit in our own lives) and I was worried I had lost someone else bc of something dumb I had done, even though I was sober.

They finally messaged me and explained that they were mad at their own life and themselves, but I was the person they took it out on and ghosted. Someone they knew was trying to support them and care about them and they just left me behind after getting angry at me for nothing. In their words, I had done nothing wrong, and they hoped I would forgive them. I said I did, but I was so hurt and confused, and messaged the situation to another friend finally after never talking about it. that friend told me to get out now.

I don't know what to do. I feel so hurt and confused. I really thought we had something, then... nothing. They were gone, and made me think it was my fault, I had done something wrong. a fresh perspective might help with this on whether or not to forgive them and let them back in my life.

They exchanged old intimate videos, pictures, and made plans to hook up. Even though they never did, it still broke me knowing she would betray me like that so I walked away. But now my main issue is how I found out. I snooped through her phone. I admit I’ve done this in the past too. I usually just feel something is off and feel an impulse to look. She brought this to my attention while we were breaking up. 

I feel like I have an issue due to trauma and broken trust in the past. When I was 11/12 my dad was cheating on my mum and I found out.

I (22f) am having a hard time considering marriage or engagement to my partner of about 2yrs (35m) for a few reasons- including but not limited to him still having photos of his wedding and ex wife on his social media &amp; computer 

I'll start this off by apologizing for any formatting/issues as this is my first time ever posting in an advice subreddit of any kind-

 I grew up being taught that marriage was a lifetime commitment (a one time thing) between 2 people- something thats supposed to be a special (and one time thing) for both involved- before now, I'd never had a serious relationship with a previously married individual-  in fact, before now I'd never even considered marriage as an option because, quite frankly, I'd have no one there for me, no bridesmaids, no mom to help me pick out a dress, no one to support me on my side, and, his friends, just, are not my friends-

My boyfriend has brought up the subject of marriage/engagement on multiple occasions now- and, I haven't given him a concrete answer to whether I'd consider it or not because ( he doesn't necessarily know that Im aware of this) I've seen that he still has pictures of his first wedding and his ex wife on his computer still after us being together for about 2yrs- and, I can't shake the feeling that he may still have feelings for her... I know that some people keep photos/videos to recall the good times- but, I couldn't imagine having photos/videos of any of my exes, I don't want to have pictures of my ex when I've moved on from that-

He's been an amazing partner, he's absolutely someone I'd like to spend the rest of my life with, but, I'm having a hard time with the idea of being his second marriage, when I haven't even had a first marriage- I feel that if we were to get married, I'd be under pressure to make it better than the first; that it would just be going through the motions for him; that it's not as special because he's already had that experience with someone else- and, I feel that, I wouldn't be able to shake the thought of his first marriage while going through my first, and, I think that would just ruin it all for me-

So, I guess my big question is; Should I tell him about my reservations about him having photos of his previous wedding? Should I just leave it alone and pretend I never saw them?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7517261,public,self,I (22f) don't know whether or not to consider marriage with my partner (35m),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ys6sz1/i_22f_dont_know_whether_or_not_to_consider/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Also sorry for gramatical errors, English is not my native language.

Ok so I (22NB) saw that my ex (23f) liked me on tinder. I dont have the premium version, but it told me someone with her name liked my profile, for context we live in a rlly small country and her name is pretty unique here. As far as the public government records show there doesnt seem to be anyone else in the country named the same (she and I looked this up together while dating). Also her profile did come up various times on my tinder feed(?) and i just closed it everytime because i was not sure i should swipe left, but now when I open the app I swipe once (doesn't matter which way) and then her profile shows up again. 

In our relationship she was very jealous and possesive during the most of it and abusive towards the end (because she believed rumors that I had cheated, but she never brought said rumours up to me while we dated). We ended without much closure since we were in a weird ex limbo (in which we kept seeing each other but she had a kinda-gf) until I moved out of my parents' and even further away from her. (When I was living with my parents I already had to travel on bus for like 2 hours to her place).

She then ended up being in the same town I lived for a night out (its like a uni town, or the closest thing there is to it here)  and she called me asking to see me bc she knew I lived rlly close to where she was, but it was 3am and she was drunk af. I was with my situationship at the time (now gf)(21f) so I told her  no and didn't contact her again except a few months later to ask if she had cheated on me as I had my suspicions. This is when she told me about the rumours, up until then I was unaware this was the reason her attitude towards me had changed so much. I also have the theory the rumours are a lie but no way to know for sure since she supposedly deleted the SS that ""proved"" it and said a profile she couldn't recognize sent them to her. Its been almost 3 years since this happened.

Then like a couple weeks ago she messaged me on FB messenger, but deleted the message and I sent her a '?' and she told me it was an accident but while I was figuring out what to respond she was typing and it took me like a three to four mins to decide to just send her 'ok (I was bit high and shocked)', which I think was too dry for her and she ended up not sending what she was typing. I kind of regretted that because a lot of shit went unsaid between us due to how we ended and tbh I do think back to our relationship a lot and I'm wondering if I should take the chance to clear the air (if it can even be cleared). This is the reason idk which way to swipe.

Should I swipe right to see if I can try to get closure or should I swipe left and just not reach back out to her and try to find closure on my own? 

PS. Its been three years going on four since we cut contact. Also my current gf doesn't mind me using tinder as we have an open relationship.

I have told them that they should stop talking about her like that because it's disrespectful and it's my person and my person wasn't comfortable with her . So I cut her off . The guy stopped . 
After a while the group separated cause of various reasons  . I have always defended her behind her back . And even now that we are in different unis I always talk highly of her . 
Couple months back when we were in the same uni . At multiple times she was hanging out with some guys that were just ""acquaintances"" . And at multiple occasions I got disrespected and she didn't say anything and just continued talking to them . Btw I was not there where it happened and those guys would never say anything in front of me . 
I have let her know many times that it hurts so much yet it keeps happening . 
Whenever she is not comfortable with someone or anything in general I don't even ask anything I just cut the person because she is a priority and so is her comfort not only with me but with my surroundings also .
On the other hand when I am not comfortable with stuff or a person there is always a reason or an excuse or smth similar and  nothing ever goes towards my comfort but again I always closed my eyes on it .

He texted her today and she just went along talking to him and stuff . 
She says she cannot stop talking to someone just like that because she doesn't wanna be mean and hurt their feelings and she is like that and that we are different . 
I don't know what to do anymore guys . I constantly feel like other people's feelings are put over mine and that she lets everyone disrespect me and then talk to them normally . Along other stuff in the same lines .  Communication clearly didn't help and I don't want to be hurt like this anymore . I really lover her from all my heart and I don't know what to do anymore .

Studies have shown that women have a sexual preference for men with a dark triad personality. High extraversion, low agreeableness, narcissism and emotional unavailability are the common traits that women find desirable in men. Kindness, thoughtfulness, and modesty are signs of weakness to them. They will, of course, deny this with every fibre of their being, because it's not socially acceptable to admit you want to date a psycho, but the fact remains that women have, and always, will find badboys irresistible. 

Even if you don't want to trust the science, you only have to look at modern films that were popular with female audiences: *Fifty Shades of Grey* and *365 Days.* Both of them are about women becoming fucktoys for rich, good-looking badboys. Then we have the highly successful harlequin novel industry where 90% of the books are about women taming dark and dangerous hunks. 

Am I claiming that every woman is dating a badboy? No, of course not. But let's not pretend that the rugged, hypermasculine male archetype is not a woman's ultimate desire. Women will only date niceguys if they have money.

The other day, my BF (30) asked me (30) if it was ok for his friend to use his login if she paid him a small amount, to access a lecture package for his studies. The lecture package was thousands $$ and this girl (she and her partner are both in this very well-paying career) doesn’t want to pay. He said he’s not comfortable giving her the password but he feels he needs to because she wants it, and if not maybe she could come over for the lectures on his laptop which happen twice a week. I’ve never met this girl. He said he doesn’t feel comfortable telling her no because he wants to help her cos she doesn’t want to pay (even though it’s private content and you pay for the leg up with your studies)

I told him I didn’t think it was appropriate because the people hosting the content and lectures have helped him privately with a few things to further his achievements (they reached out to him to help) and he would be effectively stealing intellectual property for this girl. Furthermore, I didn’t think it was appropriate for this girl to be in our home twice a week when we both work shift work and would be an extra two nights where we wouldn’t have time together.

Last night, he was due to have dinner with another friend and had messaged said friend the night before to confirm if the friend liked this place to eat and asked what time, sent multiple messages and no answer (left on read). He said he would call him on top of all the messages and I told him not to, because that would be bombarding the guy when he clearly didn’t want to reply. 

The friend was posting multiple instagram stories so I said I guess it’s not happening? The friend ended up messaging at 4pm the next day (the day of the supposed plan) saying he was “waiting all day” to hear from my bf and asking where he had booked for dinner. 

I pointed out that this guy may have been waiting for a better offer before confirming a time or place (which he never did), so anyone with self respect would make other plans if it’s 4pm on the day you’re meant to go for dinner without any response from the other party.

My BF ended up having a tantrum and silent treatment episode for 20 hours now, being quite rude to me and ended up telling me I “don’t want him to have friends”, and that I “told him to cut contact with all his friends”!! He also claimed that he had friends before me and now he has none!
All I said was, don’t chase the guy who you’ve texted so many times and has left you on read. Make other plans and wait for that person to come to you, once you’ve already messaged him multiple times. I’ve introduced me to all his friends and they drop by and we make plans together, but he doesn’t really have the same kind of people. 

He’s angry at me because I’m supposedly cutting him off from his mates and it’s my fault he didn’t go out. Never mind getting mad at people who ignore his attempts at friendship!
 I was very patient and supportive while he was suffering, but little did I know he was actually angry at *me* and blaming me for this.

Neither of us are irritable and we are really good about opening up when we feel hurt or just need to talk. He's very caring for me and I feel the same way back. 

I feel a bit tmi saying this, but when we got together one of the main factors was our very like-minded sexual feelings. Basically, we are both experimental and more open to ""fun"" things than our previous partners and this was exciting for both of us. My boyfriend and I still put most emphasis on romance and just having a good relationship outside of that, but I would say he is more sexual than I am. This is nothing new to me and we've acknowledged this, I find my male partners usually are more sexual than me. However, recently I think my energy and excitement has turned to being overwhelmed.

He will usually bring up something sexual at least once a day, if it's not asking for sex it's asking for nudes, talking about the porn he has seen or asking for me to wear something exciting. He never forces me to any of it and I have been able to say no (which he respects), but I guess I just feel like no matter what I talk about it turns into a sexual topic. Sometimes I just want to talk about my day or his day, he just likes sprinkling in the nsfw topics for fun. It happens again and again, enough where genuinely any mention of sexual things now makes me a bit upset, and as a result even just sex or getting into the mindset for it is hard for me. I feel overwhelmed and a bit burnt out I guess? 

Like I said, we usually have good communication and he really is a caring and sensitive guy. I just know for him sexual things are also very important and a big aspect of a fun relationship. I really thought I was the same way and I really do feel open to things, I guess just not on the same level as he is. I tried to express my feelings already before, but I think I felt too bad for him and no progress was made. I would hate to ruin our otherwise happy relationship over something like this, so I wonder how can I word myself in a way that doesn't guilt him or upset him, but makes it clear I feel overwhelmed? I haven't been able to find the words.
