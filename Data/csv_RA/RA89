We have had some bumps along the way but always pushed through. But last night we had a big fight which led us to taking a “break”. By break i mean she wanted time alone to think about our relationship. She said it will only last a week. We have both been very stressed out for the last two months or so (work related) and i guess we just vented out on each other. The “break” idea wasn’t mine, i usually like to talk and solve our problems but my girlfriend couldn’t handle seeing me. The fight wasn’t my fault not was it hers. It was just something that happened. Im not one to easily panic but something about yesterday just made me collapse. The thought of us not being together anymore, wondering if she was ok, wondering if she was coping well etc. it just broke me completely and i cant concentrate on anything since. Going into details would take up way too much time but to put it shortly, everything i do is for her. I know that sounds way to cliche but it’s the truth. I changed everything about my life so she could have a better one. It’s not something she ever demanded, it was just something i wanted to do for her. I still love her and want to do better. I want to contact her but i know doing that will just make her more stressed. I cant work properly because my mind is way too stressed right now.

I know that sounds like nothing but she usually never interacts with any of my friends post on social media. Recently she has and my friend notice how she spiked in *only* liking the photos with me in it. 

She then answered one of my drunk calls and asked me what I wanted. Okay stupid, I get it, get over her it’s been a year. But what fucks with me is I’m trying to continue move on but she seems to be reaching out suddenly trying to get my attention. 

Am I crazy? She rightfully blocked me on that drunk call. Didn’t contact her since cause once I sobered up I realize how STUPID I felt. I’ve contacted her 3x in the year we haven’t talked and she’s responded 2 out of the 3. 

One where her new boyfriend was present. We were together for 5 years and she and I were HS sweethearts. 3mo later she moved on with this new kid she met online.

We both made mistakes but I’ve been alone for a whole year and a half trying to soul search I guess. But it’s so weird cause I drunkenly almost texted her tonight. 

I guess I just want to know if I’m doing the right thing by ignoring these and just continuing to think she’s just liking them cause’ they’re finally showing up on her feed.

I have just not always been aware of it because I was a child and, even now, my family won’t tell me certain details.

When I was in middle school my dad would ask me for my birthday money and any money my grandparents gave me.

I always got a bad feeling from it, like I couldn’t say no ‘cause he’s my dad and I don’t want him to be angry with me. At the same time I never really understood what was going on. 

Recently, my dad qualified for disability which meant I qualified for a stipend. This has been incredibly useful to me as I am in nursing school and it’s been difficult to work and have good grades. I just now got it (so there’s backpay) paid bills and whatnot and my dad calls and asks for $100. He also says not to tell my grandma (she manages his money for him). I did give it to him but I feel awful. I feel like Im thirteen again in the parking lot of a casino. I feel awful lying to my grandmother who has expressed that she just wants my dad to be self-sufficient, especially before her and my grandpa die one day.

I'd noticed this behaviour before and asked about this user who they said was ""just a friend they met online"" and I've been cheated on in past relationships so I didn't want to let my paranoia get the best of me so I left it. Anyway later that night we have to leave early as our friend was ill and we were calling users for everyone but my phone was dead and I was staying behind with our friend to make sure they got home safe whilst they went ahead the 1st car. So they passed me their phone and told me to call an uber on their phone which I did. Whilst we were sat in the uber this user messages and I read the message and it felt off to me so I opened up the chat and went through the last couple of days. My partner dated this person let's say his name is mike for a couple years before me and even after they broke up and stopped communicating apparently before me they would frequently pop up when one of them was bored and flirt and send nudes etc. And on their chat I saw messages that were mostly harmless. No nudes or obviously flirtatious texts but still they were talking everyday. And I saw that when they were telling me they were having an early night they were going on call with him. And then I stopped looking when I saw a message from my partner saying they would always love him and him reciprocating and that message happened a couple days after my birthday whilst I was with them. We have since talked and they said they didn't mean it but couldn't give me a reason but they said I was their everything and he was nothing and blocked him in front of me. Its been over a week since and I've been feeling a lot better for the most part. But when I'm on my own I feel so awful and shit about the whole thing and like maybe I should dump them and try and move on.

At first, he was so helpful. We were taking shifts throughout the night. He'd let me take a nap in the day while he'd watch the baby, then I'd watch the baby for a few hours so he could do whatever, and so on. It was perfect.

...then he went back to work two weeks later, and he wanted to not be woken up in the night to change / feed the baby (formula fed), so I had to do all of that, all while recovering from a c-section. (I had trouble lifting myself up from the bed.) He'd also make me do the night shifts alone on non-work nights too. Then when he'd go to work, I'd stay home and watch the baby. I was becoming so sleep-deprived watching the baby day and night that I started having frequent panic attacks and had to get on anti-anxiety medication.

Anyways, about three weeks ago, he bought a $1,200 gaming laptop. From the moment he gets home to the moment he goes to bed, he games with his friends. It's been like that every single day, and now, he acts annoyed when the baby cries, tells the baby that he's trying to game...

My biggest issue with this is that now I'm back to work and wake up around the same time he does for work, and he still doesn't help me with the night-time care. To top it off, I take my baby to work, and I also partially work from home (self-employed), so I'm literally taking care of the baby almost completely on my own 24/7. And it's very hard to get work done when I'm working from home when I'm caring for the baby. (My fiance initially told me that when he gets home from work, I can work on my laptop while he cares for the baby, which doesn't happen anymore since he started gaming.)

He complains that his job is more important than mine since he makes more money so that I shouldn't complain about not being able to concentrate on my work while taking care of the baby. I even made a comment to him today that my work is more important than his gaming and said, ""So you want me to take care of the baby 24/7?"" He said, ""That'd be nice.""

I told my crush about it because she was also my friend and asked for some advice, she did give me advice but i felt something odd about her replies like it felt cold though its similar how we talked before but i could tell shes somewhat pushing me away? (We talked before she got a new bf) i didn't really thought about it too much but i still asked if she was okay, she said she was fine so thats how the convo ended, then after a month i got news she got a bf, i told her congrats and wished her to be happy, but somehow it still ends up with cold friendly replies that i cant talk back, so our talk ended like that.

After 2 years me and my gf broke up because of our career paths splitting apart and i understood her point but i still loved her, but i completely let go when she told me she doesnt love me back anymore, it was soul crushing and since she was popular too so our broke up spread like wildfire and guys flocked like flies, i felt powerless and deleted all my socials for a month to stop seeing her pics with other guys i knew that it would be painful but id rather not see than be curious and get hurt in the end.

A month after the break up and after solely focused on my acads i redownloaded my socials and found my crush texting me if i was okay, i replied back that i was but i didnt show much of an interest continuing the convo, but she then kept talking to me, i didnt really mind it and it kept going in some days, though im not the one who tries to talk to her first anymore, but i know shes someone who doesnt talk if she doesnt want to or if she needs to, but time to time we talk but i dismiss talks about my life because i was still hurt then and was recuperating, and still depressed, but she showed genuine care, but thats the only time when she can talk, sometimes she doesnt message me at all or our convo suddenly ends, i dont really understand why, we used to have nicknames in our names in the messenger app we use, but she suddenly removed it, i have a guess its because of her bf? She didn't really explain why but instead she messaged me through twitter instead, i couldnt really understand though.

After a few months, she invited me to a samgyup with some old friends of ours, we met and theres still some distance between us but i could tell she was staring at me a whole lot, i am taller than her, so sometimes when i talk to her i completely lower my head to her head level so i could hear her talk, but at times when i do that she stops talking and just stares at me, i dont really understand why, and when we were eating she would stare at me still i ask her why, but she dismisses and says its nothing, i thought theres something wrong with my face i asked another friend if there was they said it was nothing, (the story here gets even more confusing) i know about her jokes a lot they are like a trap then says some cheesy joke after, so she was making a joke and i told my friend to not fall for it because i know what shes going to say after, but then she asked me what she was going to say, i got flustered because she was smiling and looking at me, so i felt like its another trap, i looked away and she just started laughing and smiled after while still staring at me, i couldnt help but look away, i really dont understand, i wanted to tease her back but i remembered that she has a bf and i wanted to respect that, and since there was a distance between us i just guessed that it was a sign that i cant be overly friendly.

After we ate, our friends wanted to take some pictures on a park like place on the mall, while we were walking with our friend group she stayed close to me our shoulders touching time to time and at this point i am really confused  so i tried to move away, but then she caught me why im a bit far and told me to come back, so i had no choice to get close to her instead, while we were walking, some of our friends left to get some desert, and when the two of us were together, she stayed apart from me a few feet, at this point im so confused like im going crazy, neither of us talked, she was staring at her phone for a while, but when i look away i could tell she was some what checking on me? Like when i was on my phone i could see her turning towards me in the corner of my eye but then going back to her phone, i really dont get it, im having trouble understanding her actions, when our friends came back she stayed close to me again unlike earlier she was a few feet apart from me.

 When we were done after taking pictures, since it was still  in the afternoon noon and the sun is up, she used my height as a cover from the sun and joked about it, and when i tried to move away she grabbed my arm and said to cover her, and since her head is just below my shoulder line i could smell her, (not in a creepy way but naturally i could smell her scent) but i have vague guess she knew that, and i was standing really close to her. 

After that, she got a call from her bf that hes going to pick her up, her attitude changed to being distant, and when i tried to talk to her it didnt really last long like shes avoiding to talk to me, but i guess she doesnt want her bf to have a misunderstanding when i was close to her?

I also learned recently she has a problem with her relationship.

And before when i was still in a relationship everytime i post something about my ex or a pic of us, she ""retaliates"" back by posting one too after a few minutes? It was not consistent but it happens way too frequently before, and when i got broken up, she also posted less and less.

     I (22M) am currently in a dispute with my girlfriend (22F). I've been with her since we were 17 and as we're getting older we've been discussing children. 

     It first started with the talk of quinceañera vs sweet sixteen. She is latin while I am white and it came up that part of her dance was that she had to grind against her current boyfriend. I immediately said it was gross that they would have a child grinding against someone else part of a dance regardless of them being the same age and she disagreed. It eventually led to us talking about how we're gonna treat our children's sexual lives. I've been raised Christian and I believe that children should be kept innocent but when they're in their teens we should make sure they know everything about sexual safety and how it should only be done with someone you're in a relationship. I said I believe we should shun and extremely discourage sleeping around while rewarding them for doing it while in a relationship (I know they're gonna do it anyway so I'd prefer to give them the ability to do it safely with the right person, not with randos) while she was almost the complete opposite feeling.

     I have only been with my partner while she has been with another man. It was a dumb fling where there was nothing to it but the sexual stuff. The thing is was that I had a huge crush on her and she did as well and pushed me away for him just for him to dump her when she wouldn't put out. It's always hurt me, and it didn't make it better when two months later she did the same thing but for a digital relationship. At that point I made two attempts on my life, once trying to drink myself to death and the other was with a gun but I chickened out. But her actions always hurt me, and it's hard to look at her and not feel my heart hurt. It's almost like a curse to be with the one I love. I know how much hookup culture hurts both the person and the people who care for them ( my sister was kind of a sl*t during college and it's severely affected her relationship).

-He almost ALWAYS wears hats

-He HATES having his hair touched and the few times I’ve actually touched it he right away asks me to stop. One time i jokingly asked if i could braid his hair and he said no way and when I asked why he said he just doesn’t like having his hair touched

-He gets sensitive/upset about bald jokes.

-Never seen him shower

My(21f) mom(45f) is in an abusive marriage since 20+years with my father(46m). My mom's been a victim of domestic violence in the past(my father stopped it now after he was arrested for it but got out of the case with his money) . Ever since I was a kid my father was violent towards my mom every time they had any disagreements. But as of now even though he isn't physically abusive, he still verbally abuses her. He never respects my mom would be an understatement.

My mom was a working woman (full time) and used to take care of household chores as well all on own. It's been 4years since she stopped working cuz she couldn't manage both anymore but the main reason was my father who was always suspicious of her (if she comes home late by even half an hour he used to throw a tantrum, calling her names and she wasn't allowed to take work calls bcz he thinks that is inappropriate and cheating in his head.) Heck, he even didn't allow her to take lunch to office, bcz according to him she's making lunch for her coworkers and that's cheating for him! 

And I can't even put in words how abusive he was physically towards my mom. She now(and always has been) does everything for him, from cooking his meals to doing his laundry, he won't even clean up after eating his meals. Even after going through all this shit(still going through it) she still treats him nice. 

I've never seen my father appreciate my mom for the things she does for him. He always complains. And recently she wanted to get back to work. And my father accused her of wanting to cheat again(even though she never did, she couldn't even have friends bcz of his possessiveness). 

I always suggested her to get a divorce and live her life according to her choice but she's scared as none of her family supports her and she doesn't have any friends and also that I was a kid back then. But now she seems to want it (divorce)  but doesn't know where to start. She doesn't want any alimony, she just wants to go far away from this man which I want as well. But my father is an obsessive person he won't make it easy for her to leave.

We started this relationship knowing I was going to move away at the end of the summer and we were both okay with it at the beginning. As months went by, we slowly grew more and more interested in each other but in the end, we decided to breakup when I moved away.

It only took a few weeks until we were back together and we swore to not really bring up anything we did with others during that period and decided to do long distance until she moved here. I was really happy and it stayed that way for two months until we had a talk the other day. 

I had asked her before she moved here if she had any dirty laundry she wanted to air out before we started this new stage and apparently she did. A week after we broke up, she went to talk to my best friend and they drank together. In the end, they eventually made out and he gave her oral. I was honestly shocked as it didn't feel like he would do something like that especially with my ex, but I guess it happened. 

I am still really overwhelmed by all of this and I know she wasn't dating me at the time but its like she did it with my brother as I have known him for my whole life. 

To give more context, I live with him and a few of my other friends. She was supposed to room with me soon but I'm honestly just so disturbed and sad right now I don't know what to do. Both of them swore it off the day after and they are both really sorry but I just don't know if its something I should work past.

What do you think? Should I continue this? Is this something I could work past healthily? Is it just my trust issues coming out?

This is really bizarre because we have hung out basically every day for the past 3 years. I have a few theories but I could use some advice on how to approach the situation.

So for what’s happened in the two weeks:

* He left the gas stove on overnight without a flame for probably 6-7 hours. We would not have noticed if I didn’t wake up because of the smell.
* He was late for rent for the third month in a row.
* He asked me to kiss him and I said no.

Obviously, these are big things in a friendship and in general, but he’s the type of person to gloss over everything. I like to address things immediately and as directly as possible so figuring out problems can involve a lot of miscommunication. For example with the gas, I talked to him the next morning about how we could have died and he didn’t apologize. He just said okay and that he didn’t realize the danger. 

Our lease is only for another month before we probably never see each other again. I want to at least clear the air before we say goodbye. Even if he’s not the greatest friend, he’s a good person. It would make me sad to leave a long friendship on such a weird note.

We have three kids. We are both educated professionals. I work full time, she works part time. 

For a while, it has felt like my wife had been drifting away from our relationship. She has become very serious about her sport in the past few years, which has her spending on average every second weekend away from home while I look after the kids. She also has a very busy schedule of activities during the week. 

It means that I spend much of my life working, caring for kids, cooking, cleaning etc. I rarely get to pursue my hobbies or see friends as I’m tied up with kids much of the time. I am up at 6am each day getting the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps in. The main me time I get is the gym 3-4 hours a week, which only became possible because I work from home and go in my lunch break. 

Truly none of this would overly worry me, but I’ve begun to feel like she’s checking out. She doesn’t really ask me how I’m going very much. When she’s home she’s often on her phone arranging next weekend’s sport activities. And emotionally she has been drifting away. We had a heart to heart and some counselling about 4 months ago, and things got a bit better, but most of it seemed to require me to do stuff (which I’ve been doing - more regular texts, more hugs and kisses. etc). She hasn’t really done much different. 

Lately it’s gotten harder to just go along with things. Her affection has been dropping. We rarely had sex more than 1-2 times a month over the past few years, but now it’s maybe half that. Even that I would be able to contend with, but the tone has changed. Most of our relationship I’ve always made sure she got off and was satisfied. But lately she’s just after like she wants me to hurry up, saying “don’t worry about me, you can come”. Like it was some chore she wanted to get over and done with. I give her oral most times, and she’s maybe given me that three times this year. I’ve had to initiate sex every single time in the last year. 

And then she said something that really put me off. I joked that our cat would like to sleep in our bed and she said “well at least he’s not expecting anything”. It really sounds like she’s just having sex for me, not for herself too. That’s not enthusiastic consent and it’s made me very reluctant to initiate because it feels like she’s just going through the motions.

I met her on the first day of school when I was 13 after I had moved states. We bonded instantly. By January we entered a relationship. It was small town, so we both decided to keep it a secret.

We have been together for 11 years. Married for 2.

What tears me up the most is that she wasn't there for one of the most important moments in my life, and now I understand why. 

I currently serve in the Air Force. 

When I graduated from AFA, I expected my wife (girlfriend at the time) to be there to tap me out. But she wasn't. I was extremely worried, she had promised me she'd be there. Not much of my family could attend other than my sister (F 27) and best friend (M 26), my sister ended up tapping me out which still was an amazing experience that I would love to do again. 

Although I graduated from AFA about 3 years ago now, this still brought me to tears when I found out. The girl had found my social media and had sent me proof of the cheating. She said that she had no idea about me until finding my wife's main social media accounts. She said that she had a military father who struggled after her mother cheated on him as well and did not want me to be unaware of the situation.

I thanked her. 

I don't know much about the process of divorce. I come from divorced parents myself and did sign a prenuptial agreement when getting married. We live off base in a very nice condo. I make a lot of money due to my position and I am very grateful for my current job in life.

So, at the school I go to, I'm in the marching band. I play the trombone, she plays the clarinet. This is a pretty big university marching band too - about 250 members. For some reason, I have my eyes on this clarinet girl ever since the first years were fitted for uniforms during summer band camp. She just so happens to be on uniform crew, and so she was the one that fitted me for my uniform. We have talked about 2-3 days a week since then and it's all just been pretty casual conversation and no real major advancements have been made in taking things up a notch. I would most definitely like to ask her on a real date besides just talk to her in the band environment, I just literally have had 0 chances to do it because there is always so many people around and my snapchat to her was left on delivered. As such, I just talk to her in a friendly way when I can, not trying too hard to come across as needy at all, just a chill dude talking to a chill girl. However, the thing is, I know for a fact she knows I like her, so as of lately I've been trying to just present myself in a really cool manner and subtly flirt with her whenever I get the chance. At a band party I went to recently that had around 200+ members squeezed into one little house, I was basically flirting with her the entire time - we even took shots together. And I straight up just commented on how attractive and how cool of a personality she has, and she said something along the lines of ""Awww, thanks for boosting my ego, I really appreciate it!"" But the thing is, I can't really develop anything further with her if I can't really talk to her outside of band and she doesn't wanna respond over snap. Even though, I know for a fact she loves talking to me and we end up having a great time whenever we interact in person. It's just kind of a confusing dynamic and it's tripping me up if I should put any effort into developing this further or just let it go and talk to her as a friend. If I do develop this further, how do I even start with someone like her and what would I need to do/say to get her to want to hang out with me more outside of band - or hell, even respond on her phone. We are both pretty busy since I am a network administration major and she is a dual major in business analytics and finance, as well as being band members. Also, I know she is an active member of a sorority. When I was 19, I used to be in a fraternity so I could always relate to her about being a Greek life member.

Another thing, to be honest, I really don't know much about her outside of band besides the things I've mentioned and being friends with her on a couple socials. I don't really know her fashion interests, music tastes, food tastes, hobbies and interests, how good of a student she is. But I would love to change that and get to know her better before our time is up. Because being a student literally only lasts for so long before you move on and get a job. There's a ton of other members in the band I could choose to talk to but I choose to talk to her. And at the same time, it's a dilemma in my head because I always hear stuff along the lines of ""Bro, you never wanna trip over one girl. It's not worth it because they got hella connections and can get dick anytime they need it."" And I know in my heart of hearts that's true, especially with a girl as attractive as her. I'd also like to mention I am an extremely handsome and good-looking guy myself. I make sure to take care of my personal hygiene almost religiously and make an effort to get some running and lifting in at least 3 times a week. So I'm not sure if that intimidates her. Because I have noticed she has tripped over her words a couple times when talking to me haha.

About the ""not tripping over one girl thing"", I feel like that seriously screws people up when they are in the single/dating phase, and I just don't know if I'm the type of person to ""fall madly in love or fall head over heels for"". It just hasn't happened yet and I'm 24 and I really don't know why. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not letting people in that close to my personal life or what. It's really too hard to tell imo. Anyways, I'm not just talking to this one clarinet girt for that reason and am also on dating apps and have a few other connections with people I see in person occasionally, but more so on the text/snap. BUTTTT, I would still love to keep talking to this one clarinet girl when I can and make the most of our time together. She is extremely intelligent, attractive, musically-gifted, humble, kind, and just an overall pleasure to be around! And I'm all of those things as well! It would just be so great if we could develop something between us that's special to give both of us an excuse to hop off the snap, dating apps, inst, etc for once and just be truly happy in each other's presence :)",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7524544,public,self,"So I (24M) am confused on what me and a girl (21F) have going on right now, and it's messing with my head",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ysxuqy/so_i_24m_am_confused_on_what_me_and_a_girl_21f/,all_ads,6,,,

Long time reader, first time poster.

My (30M) relationship (29F) seems to be at a real crossroads and I just need somewhere to vent and get some feedback. I’m also going to try and talk about my own flaws and make sure this isn’t just a one sided thing. 

We’ve been together for about 12 years. We had issues early as we did long distance for a little while. (About 1000 miles). Things also weren’t the most serious early on, it was more of a fling and messing around that turned into something more. 

We’ve kind of been at a stagnant state. I’ve never found a real legit career as I was chasing a new industry in an expensive state. It brought along a lot of challenges just for myself and progressing forward. She went to college and got a good job and has done well for herself as well as helping me along the way. She’s wanted a ring for years, understandably, but my money has  always held me back. We haven’t been able to afford a larger apartment which she’s so desperately wanted, but it has allowed us to do alot of traveling and going to national parks which is one of the things we really connect on. 

We’ve always had a good physical relationship but emotionally, I haven’t been there for awhile I don’t think. While doing distance (8 years ago) she got drunk and cheated on me, it sent her down a dark and sad path. She just started telling me all these things and feelings she had for other people, things she wanted. She was really messed up and had a bad chemical imbalance. I still think about that and think we should’ve just broken up then. I was in a new place, I think I could’ve just lived and learned about myself but we didn’t, we tried to make things work even after. (She was very attractive to me and with my rough childhood growing up, I didn’t think I’d find anyone better to be honest). 

Now we’re 12 years in, been in this small apartment for about 5 years and the last 3-6 months have been bad. My affection has really gone away; she tells me time and time again she wants more and I feel I try to do little things but it’s never enough and the way she gets onto me brings up old feelings of how my parents used to be. It feels like nagging. I get annoyed and very short quickly when I just feel like she won’t stop and even take a breather. She just hammers her thoughts and feelings over and over. She has bad anxiety, and we’ve talked and think she may have undiagnosed like ADHD or something because she hyper-fixates on things and has a short fuse. I’m much more relaxed and don’t know as well how to deal with the anxiety when it starts to show. It just feels like complaints about everything and I just don’t want her to like let every little thing bother her to where she can’t even enjoy anything. 

At the same time of this she has put on weight and I’m not as attracted to her as I used to be. I know that sounds shallow, but physical attraction for me has always been a big thing. Also being together for so long, I find myself yearning for other women. We live somewhere that there is no shortage of attractive women so it makes it hard for me to just focus on her. And like I’ve been with her for so long I just i don’t know, I feel im missing out on experiencing other women in this one life. (I have not been cheating or anything like that). 

The fighting recently has drained us but I think we’re so comfortable with one another as well as being together for so long, we are too scared to maybe end it. Even though it’s been miserable recently.  She doesn’t have a ton of friends and I’ve always been there through the worst, and I may not be financially able to stay here by myself. I’m not just staying for that, I still hold my own, I just wouldn’t be able to do as much without her and I recognize that. 

I’m not sure if we’re in love like I think we used to be. I’ve changed as I’ve grown into thinking like how do you just find one person and stay with them forever? It seems so unrealistic. But I see friends that date for a few months, a year and they are sure they want to be with this one person forever. But like I don’t want to be alone when I’m older, as well as I realize being 30, not sure how many people are just trying to have fun and flings and not be ready to settle down. I just feel I missed out on that being in a relationship this long during my 20s. 

Maybe im the asshole and because of how I’m feeling, maybe that should tell me. I just don’t know. If you want to call me an ass, that’s fine. This is Reddit, the internet, I don’t ask for everyone to be super nice in the replies but maybe just try and give me constructive criticism or something. I’d love to hear from people

My mother has never been in the picture, I don’t even know where she is.

My father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer several years back. He had a 1 in a million of beating it, and he did! Up until 2 months ago, the cancer returned. His physical health is rapidly deteriorating and his mental health is deteriorating as well, but at a slower rate. On a daily basis I am tasked with driving him to hospital appointments, making sure he’s eating, doing his laundry, etc, while juggling finding a job and juggling my relationship with my girlfriend (both 25 years old). The situation sucks on so many different levels and is so painful and depressing to experience.

I am tend to be reserved with my emotions, but last week I opened up to my girlfriend a little about the situation and the hard time I’ve been having. She was helpful and gave me some solid advice. But the last 2 days she has been complaining so much about her social life, how she didn’t have any plans today and how she’s so unhappy. I feel like I’ve always been there for her, and the one time I need her to be strong for me, she’s telling me how bad her life is and how I have not spent time with her (I’ve made an effort to see her every week, but that’s just not enough). It feels selfish because the one time I don’t give her all my attention she’s spiraling downwards.

Today, we were speaking on the phone and she kept complaining about how hard it’s been for her. How none of her friends wanted to make plans, how I only saw her one time this week and overall just making me feel bad. Guys… I snapped. I couldn’t believe that shes really being a Debby downer, complaining about how “I didn’t have plans today and you barely saw me this week,” when my I’m literally watching my father fucking die infront of my eyes. I remained calm for as long as I can on the phone until I snapped and said, “I am so sorry you couldn’t see your friends today. I’m so sorry I have only seen you once per week. It’s not like I’ve been watching my fucking dad die before my eyes.” I hung up and I can’t even speak to her anymore. 

I feel like she is so selfish. I have been there for her at her worse, and dealt with months of her complaining (over pretty dumb shit) and here I am going through something rough for the first time, and her not having plans with her friends today is this massive issue.

Hopefully all of this makes sense.

I (21M) met Sara (fake name, 21F) during our junior year of college. We got along well, not exactly close but also not total strangers, and one night we ended up hooking up. That was supposed to be a one time thing, which we both agreed to beforehand.

Well, she ended up pregnant (and yes, definitely mine). We did everything right but someone's gotta be the 0.01%. I told her I'd fully support any decision she made and she chose to keep the baby. I promised her I'd stick by her no matter what, and I did.

We started spending a ton of time together, and got really close, acting like a couple a lot of the time. I haven't had too many serious relationships, but I slept over at her place more often than I slept at mine, so I saw it as pretty serious. Needless to say, I caught feelings. A lot of them, and it seemed like she had them, too.

Our son was born and that only solidified what I'd already been thinking— that I wanted our little family to be forever, so when he was four months old, I proposed.

Sara started crying and told me that she was sorry, but that she didn't feel the same, and that this ""was never supposed to be a long-term thing,"" which is true, but it hurt to hear. I slept in my own bed for the first time in months, but the next morning, I had to get up and drag myself to her apartment because there is no way in Hell I'm breaking my promise or letting this kid down.

I would do anything for my son, but *damn*, it hurts to walk through her door every morning knowing that I can't spend the rest of my life with her. How can I move on when I have to see her every day?

TL;DR: I hooked up with a girl, she got pregnant, I fell for her, baby was born, I proposed, she turned me down.

I am happy to find my gf(23F) who has been the light of my life for five months together. We have our ups and downs and I was sure she’s the one I want to spend my life with. This is only my second relationship. She has had four prior. I have no idea how to keep holding on to her because I’m always afraid that she would leave. 

Now, I have a few female friends that I talked to on messenger regularly before I dated my gf. They are normal conversation without anything flirty. One girl was messaging me regularly about business and I saw that it upsets my gf a lot. I don’t feel the need to keep close female friends who my gf might misunderstand. So I deleted my past chats and removed most of them as friends. I was paranoid that even daily conversations might upset her since she seems unhappy that I was close with some girls before. I did it without second thought while in the beginning of our relationship. I didn’t think about the repercussions. I deleted chats and removed female friends but I kept one friend who was still a professional connection, although I deleted chats with her. I talked to her previously about memes and K-dramas. She also has a boyfriend and we were never flirting, and she was just a colleague with similar interests. 

Today, I posted me and my gf couple photo on story and the friend love reacted to it. My gf saw that on my phone and she asked to see who she was and found out the chat was empty. Understandably, she got mad and suspicious. It seems like I gave her a reason to doubt me now, and she couldn’t trust me anymore. She said I’m not transparent and she needs her time now. 

I did something not necessary without thoughts out of my insecurity. It backfired and I’m frustrated with myself for it. Is there anything I can say to her to regain her trust? I have not done anything in our relationship to make her doubt me. I did those things with the intention of not making her doubt me and it backfired completely. I’m now giving her space but I’m afraid she might have lost trust in me. I feel so stupid that something like this is affecting my relationship with her. I send a text explaining my actions and my promise to be transparent, honest, and communicate with her, but I don’t get anything back from her.

I loved my ex so much, more than I ever loved anyone else. She loved me more than I could ever imagine, which is why I don’t understand why she did those things.

Okay, so for context, my ex was really a prize, she’s a med student, top in her classes, is pretty popular and smoking hot tbh. i can see why boys and girls go crazy for her. Meanwhile, I’m very lowkey, got a small circle of friends, I’m not as active in a lot of events like her so generally I’m pretty laid back and have more free time than her. I always knew she was out of my league but I never really mind? Like we were best friends and to fall in love with your best friend is really a dream come true because we just have so much chemistry together so i doubt that she would even go for someone else cuz she really gives me all the love i could ever ask for.

However, recently since we both started university, she has been really absent lately, and I didn’t really mind it at first because she was genuinely too busy and could not make time for me, so i really tried to adapt to the situation and make myself occupied while she’s doing her thing.

Here’s where it started going downhill. She started getting close to this friend, who’s a national hockey player. And they’ve been really close friends. Sure, I was fine at first but I admit I have been getting jealous at how much time they’ve been spending with each other. I got a little suspicious when this girl (let’s call her K) was avoiding me for some reason? And getting mad whenever I spent the night with my ex? (we stay at dorms in university). So im like tf? thats my girl wym. And I got even more sus with their friendship. 

And guess what, my suspicion was right. A few weeks ago my ex told me that K had feelings for her apparently, but after K found out that my ex had a girlfriend, she “backed away and moved on”. Me and my ex talked about it and I mentioned that I still felt uncomfortable with how close they are and I asked if she could maybe not be so friendly with her anymore. She agreed, and we continued in our relationship. 

However, it hurts to see that they still went out one-on-one with each other, had a drink together, posted each other on social media. And when I saw it I was pretty bummed and sad and made a big deal about how she disrespected our relationship and my boundaries. What’s worse, my friend, let’s call her C, showed me screenshots of my ex texting C about how K had feelings for her, and she “had never been so flattered before”, “a national hockey player likes me”, “how did i bag??” and telling C to not tell me about it. When I saw those texts I felt like my whole world was falling apart. I felt like I wasn’t enough. 

One more thing, C told me that K was fangirling about a photo she took with some guy that used to have feelings for her and those photos were him putting his hands around her waist. That fucked me up honestly. I decided that I was going to confront my ex about it.

I told my friends about all this, and they confirmed it was cheating. So i went to see my ex a few days ago, confronting all that C told me, even showed the screenshots between C and my ex. She said that she was just joking, and did it to annoy C, she said she “didn’t mean it”, and that i was “enough for her”. Well no, I did not feel like enough, I felt like I was betrayed behind my back. About the photos, she said that he was a family friend, and they’ve always been taking photos like that, she doesen’t have feelings for him. But her excuse felt like she was blaming everyone else but herself. Because she asked me “you rather believe a friend than me?”. 

We broke up. But she is still trying to win me back, she is asking for a chance to change, I love her so much but I’m so hurt. I’m confused if this is considered cheating, and I don’t know if I should give her a second chance. Because honestly, she really did sound like she would put everything aside just to be with me. I’m so confused.

TLDR ; 1. My ex hung out with a girl that has feelings for her, and she said she was flattered that she had feelings for her and hid it behind my back, and she also took photos with a guy who “used to like her” with his hands around her waist, she said she didnt have feelings for him and I’m all that she wants.

Though I know it was hard on my partner when I showed this behaviour, it felt like a subtle jab at me to have this pointed out? I’m not sure. 

Since the trip a friend of my partner’s made a group chat with ex-fwb in it, and when that happened I just didn’t feel comfortable.

I just got out of a very toxic relationship a couple days ago. We were friends for years and I thought I knew her all too good. We started dating at the beginning of this year and looking back on it, it was a train wreck. I remember how she would get mad whenever I brought up my passions and my goals and whenever I wanted my independence and wanted to do my own activities she would get mad at me and try to make me feel bad for them. There was also a lot of double standards too…. I remember she tried to make me feel bad for this girl I was friends with for a while and she thought she liked me and she was claiming she was being mean to her. I never really saw the reasons but I just went with it to make her feel comfortable, but then she had this guy friend who said very questionable things and did some questionable things that made me uncomfortable and when I asked if it would be ok if she was going to see him to have someone else there I was called controlling. I mean why would you want to put yourself in a situation that you said you saw yourself and you said you understood my feelings. It’s like in relationships you should want to make your partner feel comfortable and make sure they are ok. I caught her talking to another dude that she hid from me around the time I left for a wedding. I’ve shared feelings only for them to get turned around on me and somehow my fault? I drove to her for almost a whole two months and whenever I asked her to come to me she didn’t want to and said she didn’t feel like it. It’s weird because I imagined myself to be in tears and in heart break once we parted ways but in reality I’m happier and I’m going back to the things I once loved.  It’s crazy how life works because a couple days ago I just met this beautiful girl while I was working and she is very interested and invested in me and it’s weird because I never got that before and it’s like hard to believe it’s happening and that someone can really give back what you give.

I (24F) started dating a new guy (24M) 3 weeks ago. We met on Bunble, everything seemed fantastic up until yesterday. He’s come over about 3 maybe 4 times and we’ve gone out for 2 dinner dates, 1 walk in the park, with lots of benefits of course. We hit it off right away and I immediately enjoyed talking with him about his job, his experiences in being an EMT/now officer, my childhood/personality, my family and close friends. My friends live down the hall and he’s spent time with us on two occasions for about 30-40 mins each. My married friends really liked him and would have told me if they felt something was off about his character. 

We had a few differences in our likes/dislikes as I felt we are in that “getting to know each other” phase (he expressly dislikes tattoos and I have a few small ones.) He hasn’t invited me over to his place because he told me he lives with his brother and mentioned something along the lines of: he wasn’t sure about me meeting his brother because he’s family. His parents live in the condo above him. The conversation was super brief and I told him I’d meet his brother when he was ready for me to. 

I’ve been second guessing his character when we aren’t spending time together because of: 1 his slow response time through text (anywhere from 2-4 hrs per response) now vs in the beginning of the relationship, 2 i asked if he used social media and told me he “doesn’t use social media a lot, doesn’t post” but has profiles on IG &amp; tik tok with pictures that are recent of him. His phone is always on DND around me and takes it to the bathroom when we are not having sexy time. He’s very stable, caring and seemingly honest in person, but I’ve been feeling the total opposite of energy when we are apart for a few days. he tells me his work schedule, and sometimes he’s on and off weird dates because he’s a police officer. They have night shifts vs day shifts, and I’m struggling to figure out if he’s lying to me/playing with me just enough to keep me on the side, or he’s genuinely interested in me and just a dude who doesn’t communicate well. I’ve always thought that “if a man wanted to, he would.” Each time we see each other he’s genuinely interested in me, asks about my day, asks about my pet, and brought me my favorite snack the last time I saw him.

The last few months I’ve been hanging out with a guy who I found extremely attractive and said I was attractive as well, but was clearly keeping a bit of a distance due to me not legally being divorced yet. Now I’ve been secretly  head over heels in love with a guy for years, but shoved the feelings down since, well I was married. 

So after a couple months of hanging and having sex (it was fantastic, but Oddly only happened a handful of times). At this point it had been building for so long and I figured what the hell so told him that I had feelings for him but wasn’t anticipating anything to happen given my situation, but wanted him to know and see where he stood. He made it very clear that he enjoyed our friendship and the sex but didn’t see me as more than a friend. When I ask him if I have done anything wrong or what it is about me that would make him not want more, he says he has some to do with me and that she wants to be single and figure his life out (also divorced from about a 8 yr relationship, but it’s been about 2 years now).


Couple important things to note: I was staying at his place because of my personal situation but we slept separately fit the most part, we know each other due to the fact that him and my ex used to work together, and he’s moving out of state in a few days.


So yes it seems like there are really no factors in my favor here… But if there is any merit to actions speak louder than words, he has always been there for me through some really rough times and when I talk she always removes all distractions without me asking and seems to listen very intently and always remembers what I tell him and notices intricate details about things I’ve done or said. I feel like he’s not comfortable telling me he has feelings because he’s morally conflicted over the divorce not being final, I also think he’s pretty damaged emotionally from childhood and combat trauma. but what are the chances this is true, that he does have feelings and its just really bad timing and is waiting till I get fully divorced, or wants to see how his life owns out when moves?

The stories he had told me from his childhood are horrific and I barely know anything because he refuses to go into any detail I’m guessing because of how painful it is to talk about. 

We were living with her and his younger brother for about a year until a couple weeks ago. She called him down to “talk” about something and I followed to instigate as she can get very violent with him and I wanted to be there to keep her away. As I suspected she was trying to start some shit, what has been surprising me lately is how he lashed out. He never yells. Ever. I’ve only heard him really yell 3 times. Once after his dad tried to beat him. Another time when his mom went after his older brother, and that night. 

The thing is she didn’t do much to provoke it usually he keeps very calm in these situations. So I’m guessing this triggered something In him. She ended up trying to attack him I got in the middle and stopped her, she then threw a fork at his head it dented their metal fridge and we left and haven’t gone back. 

The other reason I say that something might have triggered him is he has been having a very difficult time with his depression for the past year his parents were getting a divorce so it’s been insane a lot is happening. 

I’m worried about triggering stuff from his childhood I’ve don’t it before he’s only ever lashed out at me once I was pressing him about some things he said during the first months of quarantine in 2020. We were talking a lot then but not together yet. His mom is also a Qanon person and tried to feed us bleach (MMS) last year so that was another break down. But he talked to me about some conspiracy that he said was going to happen and it was pretty outlandish I was skeptical and he said “look I’m not crazy this is going to happen” it didn’t. Anyway I was and am still super curious why did he believe it. What was up with that. He said later it’s something to do with his childhood or something. 

I don’t know I don’t want to bring it up again because he got very angry when I asked. That was over a year ago and I’ve asked many times after because he didn’t say anything until like the 5th time or something then I stopped bringing it up because I figured it was bad but I’m still skeptical honestly. 

How could that have something to do with his childhood. Does he have the same issues as his mom. Maybe he just didn’t want to talk about it because he was wrong.

So long story short (kinda), I’m 22f and my husband is 24m. We’ve been married for about a year and a half and everything has been great with our relationship. We’ve both had a little family drama, but he and I have been fine until recently. I’ve always wanted kids somewhat young, and he wants them too, but he’s not ready yet. We haven’t been trying because I do not want to force him into it- and we have plenty of time.

I had been on the pill- but it really just didn’t take well to my body. I started having early stroke symptoms and I felt horrible all the time- it was so bad that I had to go through 5 doctors to even find one to prescribe it. Hormonal birth control has never been a good fit for me, and I’m allergic to most metals so even non hormonal iud’s aren’t a good idea for me. I had to beg him for months to let me come off birth control and try the NFP method. I’ve been tracking my ovulation super well but a few weeks ago- less than a day after my ovulation peak our condom broke- and now I’m late for my period, it’s not really weird for me to be late, but I haven’t been this late in a really long time. 

That night he asked me if I did anything to the condom- and tbh, it broke my heart that he would even question it. I thought he trusted me and knew where I stand with that. I would never do anything intentional to force a baby onto him. I don’t want a child that way and I love him too much to do that to him. For the last few weeks he has made snarky little comments about me ‘tricking’ him into coming off birth control. Which I didn’t, I just felt horrible and was scared that I was going to have a stroke. 

I took a test and I saw a little shadow line that I had never gotten before (with the red dye first response tests). I tried to show him but he said there was nothing there and got pissed because he thought I just wanted there to be a second line. He said some hurtful things, and I felt like he was accusing me of forcing a baby into him so I went to bed crying while he played his game. 

The next day I was acting funny- because I was very much not okay and I assumed that he knew why, but I was wrong. He thought I was super depressed because the test was negative and just got even more mad. When I said I wanted to test to be negative he called me a liar and didn’t believe me. (Don’t get me wrong, I’d be fine if it was positive- but I wanted it to be negative.) I told him that wasn’t the case but asked why it would be such a big deal if I did want it to be positive- he just got even more mad and I couldn’t understand it. I’ve never seen him that way, he wouldn’t listen to a word I said and kept accusing me of things. 

We ‘made up’ but I still don’t feel right about the situation. I’m still scared that I am pregnant I just can’t talk to him about it. And I really don’t have friends that understand the situation either. I really just don’t know what to do, and I’m pretending to be fine but I’m heartbroken at the lack of trust he has in me. I thought our relationship was stronger than that. For now I’m planning to either not sleep with him at all during the times where there’s even a chance of me being fertile or just going back on birth control once I can truly confirm that I’m not pregnant.

Right now, I’m going through a very stressful time working and going to school (I’m a STEM student) while in a 9 month, serious relationship. It’s been taking a toll on me for sure, in addition to my already existing depression and anxiety. Not the relationship…he is honestly one of the few things/people in my life keeping me happy and sane. 

Lately, he’s been distant. Texting less often when I’m at school/home and sometimes disconnected when I’m with him. The amount of sex we have had slowly gone down over the last few months. I know this can be normal in LTR, but through talking I know it’s due to other things as we both have the same amount of desire. 

He’s expressed that this is a difficult time of year for him for unexplained reasons. I get that as it is for many, even without past specific trauma. But I can’t pretend that it doesn’t get to me.  

I do my absolute best to support and be there for him despite the stress of my life every day. Relationships (esp serious ones) are all about support through tough times and trust after all. 

But he gets quiet. He doesn’t communicate these things much until the last minute. And while I look to our connection for distraction and relief, he will sometimes turn inwards and shut down. 

I truly love him and believe we will work. Can anyone give me some advice as to how I can balance our conflicting moods and sexual needs in times like this?
