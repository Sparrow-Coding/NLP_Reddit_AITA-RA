&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that my boyfriend and I have had a pretty good relationship for the most part but there have been some rocky parts as well. We've been dating for four years with a couple of splits in between due to needing to work on parts of ourselves to better the relationship. We were living together for about two years before this happened. 

Back in 2020 my boyfriend and I were going through a rough spot. We were broke up for a few months during the summer while still agreeing to live together. Obviously, when you still live with someone you've been with for so long and try to act like you're just roommates, it's almost impossible. By the end of the summer, we started getting close. Getting along better and agreed we could work things out but didn't officalize actually being in a relationship again. Now, here's where the issue starts... 

He has a group of friends from his early childhood that he still keeps in contact with and they all planned to have a camping trip to end the summer togther and because one of the girls in the group was moving to another state. We'll call this girl ""Sarah"". Now, mind you, Sarah is really pretty, talented, exactly his body type, flirty, they share the same humor and have all the same music intrests. Sarah was my boyfriends, sisters best friend growing up. So on this camping trip is him, a couple of guys from their friend group, Sarah and his sister. I didn't even think anything of it at the time. I didn't know any of these people and didn't care if he went and hung out or partied with friends. Plus, we aren't offically together still. So, he's gone for a few days on this trip and when he comes back, something seemed instantly off. He was distant and I noticed he would not stop playing all this music that Sarah had shown him and talking about how great it is. I didn't think much of it but then... things got weird. Suddenly, he basically didn't have an interest in wanting to be in a realtionship anymore and getting back together. He stopped taking photos of us. Stopped taking photos of me (which he did on a somewhat regular basis). Then, I start seeing Sarah EVERYWHERE on his social media. Hearting literally anything he'd put up, they made a group chat on snapchat where she was in it and I'd see his phone constantly blowing up from the chat and her individually. His mom posted a picture of him and his dog from a few years prior on FB where she got on and commented ""What a couple of studs"" with a fire emoji. I even changed my profile pic one day to see if he would react to it and he didn't, but he loved hers. Also made it to where I couldn't tag him in any pics from small weekend trip we took in October either. Imagine that. With all this going on, I was beyond uncomfortable and kept asking him why he doesn't want to be in a relationship again and he just gave me the excuse that he's not ready still. While mind you, we clearly are still living together and playing the ""Couple without a title"" roll. This took place from September to November. 

Thanksgiving comes. By now, he knows I'm extrmely uncomfortable and suspicious. I felt like I was going crazy because there was an excuse for everything and they were ""just good friends and he looks at her like family"". Of course I'm crazy and overreacting. I'm paranoid. Well, by now she's moved but still comes up to visit often (I didn't know this yet). He tells me that the gang is having a friendsgiving over in the town they lived in and he's gonna go. I assumed she wouldn't be there. He tells me ""I'll be back at around 10:00 or 11:00PM"". I say okay, sure, and he leaves. 10:00PM comes.... he's not home. 11:00... he's not home and I haven't heard a word from him. I fell asleep and woke up at 1:00AM.... he's not home. My anxiety peaked and I called him. He answred the phone and said he had drank too much and that they're all getting a hotel and then it sounds like he just stuck his phone in his pocket. I could hear girls laughing and guys talking. The phone hangs up and I don't see or hear from him till the next morning at around 9-10. I was pissed but let it go. A couple days go by and guess who tags him in a bunch of photos from that night? Sarah... there's even one where they're laying in a hotel bed right beside each other nearly cuddling. My gut dropped and I felt like something was so wrong. We fought and again... I'm crazy and overreacting. 

December... We kinda stopped fighting. My son and I are cleaning the garage and my son comes to me with a piece of wrapping paper that is one of his (and her) favorite bands. On the paper it says ""Love Sarah"". Instantly, my anxiety hit the roof. She sent him a gift and he had hid it in the back of the closet. It was just a tshirt of that same bad but I didn't get why he'd hide it. I asked him about it and he said he didn't want to tell me because I'd get mad. Which, understandable to a degree but it still... she's just a friend right? Why not try to ease my mind with transparency vs acting shady about everything? So, I still have a million thoughts going through my head. A couple weeks later I ended up going through his snapchat messages with her and of course, everything is delted but there was a pic she had posted of her new tattoo. It's got her with her dress hacked up and she clearly looks cute af in it. He replies with a ton of fire emojis and she saves it in the chat. 

By now, I am a mess and I messaged her. She tells me there's noting sexual between them and I don't have to worry. He runs to his sister and tells her how much I'm freaking out about it and she messages me that I'm overreacting and that they're just good friends. To me though, it's like a mental torture of being told one thing and feeling deep down like there's more to it. I understand having friends, I understand people can have friends of the opposite sex but none of it made sense to me why any of it would be this way if they were just friends. 

We eventually ended up back together, things fizzled after I laid down my boundaries. I broke up with him a year after and made him move out of the house from the built up resentment I had still and I knew he had resentments from the fighting. I allowed them to keep in contact but idk... It never sat right with me. 2 months after he moved, he held a xmas party at his house that she was at. She posted an entire post of nothing but photos of them together. Even looks like they're holding each other in a couple of them. One where she's sitting on him and his friends lap.

It's been almost one year since that party and here we are again seeing each other and she's still around. He said he refuses to break off contact with her ever but he won't see her anymore unless I'm there and that he won't text her outside of their group chat. I still don't feel right about it. I'm still bothered by it and now she's basically in the same scene as him. Raves, EDM.... she's a traveling artist and they go to all the big shows. I don't know how to let the past go and ever believe he didn't or doesn't have some sort of feeling for her. Maybe I'm completely insecure? Idk... but I've never in my life seen anything like it between people who are ""just homies"", meanwhile you've got a SO at home. 

It's been a long time since any of it but it honesly has never and probably never will sit right with me.

1. I was working for a small start up where I was managing a not-for-profit business and I was making about $150k/year. One day my mom asked me if she felt like I was learning anything in that job and I honestly told her no, I wasa just utilizing my instincts and what I had learned at school to keep the business afloat and doing well. Since then she convinced me to leave that job where I had the respect of my peers (some of the country's leading scientists), my clients, and my government counterparts. She ended up convincing me to change jobs to one of my vendors who was in the tech industry for about half the pay ($75k/year). 
2. The second betrayal was how much pressure my wife and mom put on my to buy a house despite knowing that they wanted me to change jobs to one that paid less. I stupidly went along with them and bought an extremely expensive house that I've kept as an investment property but I still have to fork over an extra $2k a month to take a decent chunk out of the principal loan. My family seems convinced that the current interest rate hikes (in Canada) are only temporary and that they'll start coming down again late next year and that I have to weather the storm. 
3. Finally when I took the $75k job, I got an offer to manage some radiology clinics for about $125k (+ benefits + retirement matching) per year and the employer was willing to match my old salary if I had a year of good performance. Once again my family discouraged me from taking that job because it was further away and that job would require similar hours to my old one (\~60-90hrs / week).

Now I'm miserable, at the bottom rung of a new industry (healthcare tech) where I am the dumbest person in a room of smart people, making half the money I could, more debt on my shoulders than I needed during the worst time to be a new home owner because my family's been making stupid decisions for me and I want to rip my hair out and scream.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7623637,public,self,I feel betrayed by my family for convincing me to make 3 bad financial decisions in a row.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2w830/i_feel_betrayed_by_my_family_for_convincing_me_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Our child is 6 months old and in Canada Maternity leave is 1 year. so in 6 months she will need to go back to work.

That leaves us short 48K/year from our household income.  


not to mention we are talking about moving to a bigger house and soon there will be additional daycare costs on top of our existing bills.  


Is it selfish of me to want her to continue working at her old job until she finds something better than a part-time deli worker?

This was my (27M) first long term relationship, the first woman (27F) I loved, and still do. We had a great relationship, we had emotional connection, we supported each other, we had some great exciting and funny times together, as well as romantic. But we've also settled into a routine. Looking back, I think the first signs started 2 years ago, with a slow erosion of our sex life, which was great in the first 2 years (some of the highest highs of my life, physically and emotionally), followed by 2 years of more stability, comfort and a satisfying plateau, and then started this imperceptible decline 2 years ago, as I've said, totaling 6 years. Knowing what we know now, we already knew something was off deep down, but we swept the problem under the rug because everything else was great and we didn't put much effort nor communicated much about this thing, the few times that we did we were excited about the future perspective of solving it but then we returned back to our routine. We magically thought that things would get better, that it was the stress, the changes in our work lives etc. I now know that this is a myth and that we required intention, some healthy sense of entitlement, of owning our wanting. Fast forward to the last few months, we are having a dead bedroom pretty much, we are focusing on our individual problems, but we know that any of us is about to start THE conversation sooner or later. 

Then it happens, first Sunday of this month, she starts it, no surprise, I could have too. Sex life was part of the topic at some point, but it was a consequence. She felt irritable, stressed, anxious about me, tired also. The reason was me not progressing in life, not having a plan to overcome my problems, and never changing or applying some of her advice to unstuck myself. That was true, in the last 2 years I felt stuck in my university studies, losing motivation, becoming apathetic, having anxiety (which culminated to a panic attack in August), and not putting in the work to finish my degree. Meanwhile she finished her degree last year and started working, always cheering me up and supporting me with advices at the beginning until her enthusiasm dwindled slowly. I now see how my personal problems were affecting our intimacy. For me, on the other hand, there were also things of her that bothered me, and it was a vicious cycle because I resented her sometimes, I felt lonely and not loved or supported enough ( even though she was in the beginning of my 2 year old problems), so I didn't put much effort in the relationship, asking myself what's the point, I have to unstuck myself first, I'm putting in the bare minimum, we still have dates, holydays and good times, it's good enough anyway, we'll solve this, sometimes resenting her for not initiating sex even though she was more energized than me at that point in life. I now see that my self-esteem was so low that I couldn't properly love and be loved back, or inspire curiosity, admiration, proudness as I used to. But I still think that she didn't put enough effort at some point and wasn't open enough with me, as I've always tried to be with her, even about my problems. Back to that Sunday, we open up about these bottled-up emotions, I ask her if she still loves me, she says 'I don't know', I reply that idk equals 'No' to me (I will change my mind about that later), the whole thing finishes when I tell her that I need time and space (NC) to think because I'm not sure about anything, the only thing I know is that I don't want to feel anymore trapped and stuck in my shitty swamp, I want to change something about my life, in any way. So, I leave and go to my friend, because we moved in together since September of last year (good times, hoped that the then little problems would vanish).

It was like a dam had failed, a last straw for me, all the apathy and lack of energy disappeared, I now was aware of how much time I had wasted and what I did wrong on my part. I felt bad and sad in the beginning, then up and downs, but soon after I felt in control, motivated, energized for the first time in ages, wanting to pick up again habits that made me feel good and proud, to rebuild my self-worth: meditation, training, trying to study and having a healthy routine, joining the waiting list for free therapy offered by the university (something that I postponed too much). I wasn't putting the effort to impress her, I wanted to genuinely work on myself, on my problems. And I still wanted our relationship, not because I needed, but because I WANTED. I didn't care about her not knowing if she still loves me, I owned my will and wanted to transfer this newfound energy, the renovated mindset, the will to grow, to build something new, a 2.0, an evolution, not naively hoping for the good old times, nor obviously for the recent times, but something exciting, more open, continuously growing, putting the effort to solve our problems and rediscover ourselves and each other, to become even stronger as lovers. 

We meet up last week, pretty much told her the above, the changed perspective, my intention. I didn't regret anything I've done during NC, and especially what I was saying during our meeting. I was in full control, confident and at peace, knowing full well that I had to come to terms with reality if she didn't match my newfound energy and intention to work together to build something new. She was crying, she regretted having the conversation that Sunday but then felt a little bit lighter as days passed. She also started therapy because she also felt wrong, negative thoughts and lack of self-esteem, and things I still don't know. She felt weak and not ready for my words, she couldn't understand if she needed me for the companionship or because she also wanted to start again, I was still the most important person in her life. But things hadn't changed for her since that Sunday, she still felt tired and stressed, anxious at the thought of working together or our future. We talked again about physical attraction, she confesses about when she realized she wasn't thinking about me sexually but in her imagination could see herself with others. I knew it deep down but still hurts. I also regret and resent her for not talking about that before. But I also experienced something similar, where the attraction was overridden by apathy and anger, and could think more easily about others of the opposite sex, but deep down always returned to her and whished with all my heart to fix things and experience higher highs with her, I could still see her sexually when I wasn't worried and anxious. I don't know if she felt the same, maybe we both saw each other through this deformed and complicated psychological lens made of entangled negative feelings and problems, and couldn't retrieve that buried attraction. We still loved each other for that time, but these last months she surely questioned herself. We finish our meeting at home, she clearly is too weak right now and she doesn't feel it, she doesn't want to lose contact with me forever but understands if I do, I see that there is not that same energy and willingness to try something new, there wouldn't be the same effort, I'm not okay with it but I accept it. We remember the fantastic times with sweetness, we confess with bitterness the what ifs, the regrets, how could have it gone differently. We laugh, we cry, I kiss her one last time and say goodbye.

This isn't a horror story, maybe that's why it hurts so much now. I'm left with regrets and things I would have done differently if I could go back in time with my newfound 'third eye', the energy, the perspective, the things I learned. I took her for granted and learnt that attraction is something to keep alive with intention and effort in a long term relationship, and sometimes it just needs some self-esteem and autonomy, keeping up with your personal goals and projects to create that healthy distance and spark curiosity and inspiration in your partner. Three days after our last meeting I move my stuff, because I wanted her to keep the apartment, as a worker she needs it more than I do, I can stay at my friend and finish my studies. One day later (3 days ago) she contacts me, a friendly text sharing something she knows I'm interested in, I reply normally and a little dryly to let her implicitly understand that it's too soon, I need my time and I need to work on myself in order to create better memories with the people around me, present and future. Right now I'm hurting, I'm full of regrets, sorrow and anger sometimes, some of these feelings have already become lessons, some not and I don't know if they'll ever be. Sometimes I question whose fault was for certain episodes, maybe mine, maybe hers, maybe both, maybe neither. Rationally I know that I must keep going forward with the same mindset and energy I've built from that Sunday until last week, to grow and be a better person for myself foremost, I don't want to hope for anything, we'll meet up again in a better place if destiny wants it. Irrationally, I still hope, I wish we could immediately get back together and live at our fullest, I wish she contacts me again as she did but with a message about us, I wish to comfort her for her personal problems. I'm sure she is also hurting but I have to work on myself.

I got things off my chest to internet strangers, I don't know what I want to hear, or what I need to hear. Maybe my experience will help someone. What do you think about all of this? Were the problems really insurmountable? Any advice to keep that retrieved energy going even after our last meeting? Should I give her space and keep no contact (I already know the answer to this, but anyway) ? Should I leave a letter at home when I'll leave the keys expressing some of my regrets and realizations about myself? I think that our last meeting sufficed and I'll have to only act from now on...

I got fired from my job in September, and eversince that I'm on sick leave for my mental illness (BPD and PTSD)
My husband has a company that provides care for sick people at home. When he couldn't find staff I offered to help out every once in a while. He's helped me with my car when it was broken, so I thought I'd do him a favour in return.

That was a few months ago. Right now I'm the only employee still. Helping out once in a while has turned into working about 20hrs a week for no financial compensation, where I clean peoples houses. He keeps all the money, even though his regular income is about twice of what I make. I still pay rent and half of all other expenses like groceries, gass ect. 

He's not actively looking for payed employees, and he keeps making more appointments with clients for me. I'm not doing well at all at the moment, my mental health is getting worse by the day. He doesn't seem to care, he's just annoyed by my mood swings. 
I don't wanna do this job anymore. I'm on sick leave for a reason, it's physically and emotionally draining for me. Yesterday a lady called and complained about my work. I heard it and got upset, so I said I don't wanna go to her place anymore. My bf got upset with me and spontaneously cancelled the plans we had made for the day. He was very disappointed with me, but he still scheduled the appointment with the lady. 

Do you think what he's doing is ok?
I really don't know what to do right now. I'm scared to tell him that it's to much on me. Maybe I'm just ungrateful and should help him like a loving partner.

I ignored every single one of these things and compiled a list of things that my ex said to me that really should have sent off alarm bells off in my head. I feel pity for her in life.

1. She hates her father/ ""I wish my mom would divorce my dad""

Not a healthy foundation for understanding what a good man is.

2. Her mom has no friends/ ""My mom is my best friend""

It's awfully strange for an adult to not have any friends. Parents are there to raise and support you, not to be your best friend.

3. Brother committed suicide

Well, this would be hard for anyone. It would mess anybody up. However, if you say "" I would have died for him "" then there is a severe lack of internal locus of control.

4. Prone to extreme irrational outbursts of anger.

When I made a mistake, which I did, instead of communicating about it, I would get gaslit and made to believe every problem that was surfacing in our relationship was my fault. Yelling and screaming. Really ugly, childish behaviour.

5. Female hysteria diagnosis

A bit weird,because it is a victorian diagnosis, but nevertheless it was from a doctor.

6. Constant bodily pain

Stress comes out in strange ways in our bodies, often characterized by joint pain. Knees and neck.

7. ""I have commitment issues""

Pretty self explanatory.

8. ""People have told me I have a godlike personality""

Again pretty straightforward and self explanatory. 

9. ""I'm tired of all the weak men coming to me with their problems.""

Doesn't have a healthy outlook on what a good man is. So ties back in to the fatherly side of things.

10. Zero boundaries

When arguing I would get the, ""Give me some space"" So I would. Ten days go by, I would call, and get an answer from her that went like "" I said give me space!""

11. Victim mentality

Nothing she did was ever any of her wrongdoing. Friendships that fell apart? ""It was that bitches fault."" Zero accountability in anything.

12.Nothing good to say about any of her exes.

It's really not that hard to find something good to say about someone. Even if they wronged you. Or you wronged them.

13. I didn't want to talk about past sexual experiences.

When she brought up people she had fucked in the past I would calmly say ""I don't really want to talk about this"" and proceed to be beaten into submission with words about how she was not""smitten about her past"".

How is it hiding away from the everyone?

Keeping those who care about you only at arms length.

You play with other’s feelings,

Saying it’s them who’ve gone cold and weird.

Because you didn’t have the emotional maturity or 
strength.

You prefer leaving,

Instead of communicating to make things clearer.

You push people away.

Expecting them to still act normal.

With thoughts, emotions and trauma.

My wife and I have been living together for almost three years in Europe. We constructed a plan.. that she suggested.. about moving back to the US. That was for me to go back for 2 months work and set up the foundation while she closed the business here in Europe, take care of of some final medical and court appointments (Nothing major or serious but she needs to be where we’re at now to complete before leaving the country) then I would fly back to get her and go back to the US together..  the day before I had to leave she get cold feet and was hysterical.. like mental breakdown, hyperventilating, begging me to not go… saying she can’t live without me… the whole nine yards. Before bed, the night before the flight, we came to the conclusion that we both knew this had to be done and I had to go work and get things in order for her to arrive in the states. I even texted my best friends (my ride from the airport) the night before saying how I don’t know if I’ll make it because my wife isn’t mentally and emotionally ready for me to leave… Now, the same day as my flight, hours before, literally after we woke up she’s still hysterical..

I even had a little tear come down my face.. i couldn’t stand seeing my wife like that..

When the war in Ukraine started, we immediately invited his family (a brother with his wife and toddler son and his parents) to move to America and in with us. They did. 

I love my family very much and would do anything for them, and I have. Since they came, I have been their chauffeur, translator, found them work, completed all their legal documents, organized all their appointments, changed my life to accommodate their wants and needs, got my nephew into preschool and changed my work schedule to be able to pick him up and drop him off everyday, organized supply drives for them which has gotten them almost everything they need to live independently, and I've picked up a second job to take care of added expenses. My husband and I moved into our office to give them the bedrooms; now we've moved houses (x2 rent) to accommodate extra space needs. 

In return, they treat me like trash. For example, I once ""interrupted"" a conversation my brother in law was having with my husband (though actually the conversation started out as the brother in law and I only and I was never removed from the conversation) and my brother in law spent the next 5 consecutive hours yelling angrily horrible things about me to my husband in front of my bedroom door while I was in my room having panic attacks and crying. For. Five. Hours. This has become my new normal. They are extremely misogynistic and disregard and disrespect me almost everytime I communicate with them. My brother in law hates that I'm involved in the decision making in my home and blatantly tries to cut me out of everything possible. I think he hates that someone has more influence than he does over his brother... he's quite controlling. Once, we went with them to help them check out an apartment for themselves (we have to sign the lease on their behalf), and they yelled at me for at least 5 minutes in front of the house we had come to see because they didn't want me to come see 'their house' with them and wanted me to wait in the car. My brother-in-law has explicitly said in front of my husband and I that I am ""not a part of his family."" Another example: we were moving yesterday and I told them ""it's stupid [they heard ""you're stupid""] not to use the appliance dolly we paid for to move the washer and dryer."" This resulted in them mocking me, yelling and screaming at me for the rest of the evening and they threatened to leave (literally the day we move into a much larger home to accommodate them, and they know it). The yelling and screaming at me and threats of abandonment are at least a weekly occurrence. But if one of them had done the same thing, they probably would have fought for a few minutes, laughed it off, and moved on. They treat me completely different than they treat each other. These examples perhaps sound extreme but reflect at a minimum weekly occurrences. It's been 7 months. My husband and I generally are very calm, reasonable people and their behaviors are unprovoked. It is impossible to have any sort of reasonable conversation with them if it's goes against the grain at all of what they want. For multiple reasons, kicking them out is not really an option. 

One more thing. My husband - who is generally a very wonderful man - does not stand up to them for me when they are mistreating me. We've talked about it several times and he agrees to do better at that but in the moment when I tell him I'm hurting and he needs to stand up for me, he almost never does and instead argues with me about why I'm hurting and if it's valid or not from his perspective, which makes the hurt worse. Basically, I'm generally a really good, considerate, and peaceable person who does not fight, has never yelled at my family,  and self sacrifices immensely on behalf of my family who are in a difficult position and we are all they have, but they treat me like dirt and my husband is basically silent about it. I don't know what to do and feel trapped in a cyclic situation where the hurt keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper. 

What should we do next?

Please consider: We can't have any kind of calm, reasonable discussion with them of any kind (trust me we've tried). We can't really kick them out either (we literally are legally bound to support them and are financially extremely tight as is). No kids of our own to be involved yet but I'm newly pregnant.

BF has made remarks in the past when I object to him starting to watch porn again (I feared he’d return to his previous state and i slightly feel hurt he’d rather look at other women) and he stated that he may just want to see big boobs for once.

About 8 months ago, she asked me out if I thought of her more than as a friend, which lead to us dating and starting a relationship about a month later. 

Ever since our relationship started, I've been really struggling with getting affection. I initiate being affectionate all the time, and I don't do it to get something back, but it feels like a struggle when you get minimal effort from the other side. I've kept excusing her behaviour as it's her first relationship but things are improving at an ant's pace.

Whenever we're together, I'm the only one to initiate a kiss. If I don't, days can pass without it. I don't get to hear any words of affection, be it as simple as ""I miss you"". Morover, whenever I would use such phrases, majority of the times I won't get a response back saying ""I miss you too"" or ""I love you too"". I only get that back in rare occasions. Instead, she would say ""Thanks"". I cook for her all the time but she doesn't do that. When she's over at my place and I ask her if she wants coffee, I'll make it for her. When I'm at her place, and the situation is reversed, she would tell me where the tools are and tell me to make it myself. She's never bought a gift for me while I do it here and there all the time with well thought out personalized gifts. Sexually as well, I would do everything to make her feel the best, but I don't feel fulfilled or get much of that back. Even when we're just holding hands anywhere, it would be like I'm holding her hand and she not holding back mine. While I take interest in learning her native language, she takes interest in learning another foreign language. 

I've tried communicating my needs with her at different points of time. She gets very defensive and has sometimes responded with that she's doing the best she can. I've seen her improve, but like I said before, it's at an ant's pace. I sometimes reach a point (like right now), where I realize I'm doing too much and so I mostly stop doing those things. She would start to feel I'm getting a little distant and would get worried and become very affectionate in no time. I don't like when I get affection at that point, because it doesn't feel genuine even though it might be. You might say that's just her personality, that she doesn't show affection, but I've seen her interact with her family, she shows all signs of affection with them. 

I just want to feel wanted and loved. She's a very nice person in general. I do love her a lot. I love talking to her and we can go wild into long conversations. We both love exploring nature.

So basically my girlfriend and I have been official for a month but seeing each other for 2. This story starts right when we became official. 

We decided to get STD tests before becoming sexually actively, and when we did that, she came back with gonorrhea. Naturally, I was shocked, but that is when she told me she slept with her ex who cheated on her 2 months before we met one another. That Was a bit of a concern considering they broke up over a year ago and 2 months is kind of recent, but I decided to stay and just have her get the STD resolved. I tested negative and am still negative.

   Anyways, she told me before that ever since they broke up, they had a Hi and Bye Relationship. but after she got this STD, i clearly pushed back on that and said that was not the truth. she said she was sorry and we continued from there.

   Fast forward to today, we were together and I realized I never got her exes name. She said his name was Anthony, and I realized that Anthony is the same name of a “friend” who bought her food at 9pm one night while we were in a relationship. I asked if this was the same anthony and she said yes. Also the same Anthony she shares a hulu account with. I was Really uncomfortable because she told me her relationship was hi and bye with him, they were civil, etc. But then she slept with him right before we were together and he brings her food late at night sometimes. apparently she also emotionally vented to him before meeting me.  

 I now don’t know how to proceed. I feel i love her, but this is a lot for me. I also told her this and that i was considering leaving, and she started breaking down and crying. She also said she doesn’t want to be alive but sincerely apologized right after for that because she said it was manipulative of her to say that. She said she will block him or any other ex she has as well. Does anyone have any thoughts?

He has these two friends who are married (Ty 33m and Kit 30f). Rye has been friends with Ty for more than 15 years and has also known his now wife Kit for about 9 years. They are Ryes best friends and he adores them. 

I like them both a lot, we get a long good. They are very nice and humble people but they live 2.5 hours away from Rye and I so we don’t see them very much. Rye moved away from their hometown to go to college and never went back after graduating. 

First time I meet his best friends was at a concert. Had a super fun time but I felt like an outsider a bit because they had all these inside jokes and told stories from years ago so I can’t contribute I just laugh and smile and ask questions. I started to notice how often Kit touches Ryes arms when she talks which started to bother me. Calls him “Rye Patrick” which is his middle name. Then she got a little more alcohol in her and started talking about how alike her husband Ty is to Rye, personality wise, looks wise and then went on to say her husband has a huge dick and their sex life is off the charts. As is mine and Ryes relationship… Rye often tells me he exchanges sex stories with them about us bc they are all very open with each over. She then tells me that rye is the best second husband she could ever ask for and that I have a good one. Concert is over, im not mad at this point just a little cautious. 

A couple months later we go to a brewery. We have some beers and then she starts to get handsy again with Rye. Still with the inside jokes, feeling a little secluded with the stories still. Touching his arm, but this time squeezing his cheeks and telling him how much she loves him and his handsome face . And then slaps his ass as he’s getting up to get another beer. Rye doesn’t think anything weird of this, doesn’t pay it much attention he tells me it’s just how she is, she’s very lovey, touchy and also married to his best friend. Im still pretty okay at this point, not thrilled but not pissed. Rye kisses me, holds my hand, puts his hands on my thighs, plays with my hair… is always somehow showing me affection so im pretty content. But she does watch us very intently when we show PDA. And maybe bc she isn’t use to seeing Rye with someone. (Ryes ex of 6 years was in California for a long time, they did long distance) 

Months later we go to his hometown, visit their house they are remodeling. My man and her man are both engineers so theyre very handy and mechanically inclined. She’s showing him around the house with her hands over his eyes saying “don’t peak don’t peak you’re going to love this room” being handsy as usual. And me feeling like an outsider again. And it’s getting old. 

In between these months there is a group text that I find called “throuple” including rye, kit and Ty. Rye tells me they have this inside joke where they call themselves that. I read the texts and it’s constantly her asking “when are you coming to see us we miss you ?” And I ask rye “why doesn’t she ever ask when are you and I going to see them, it’s always just you?” He tells me.. word for word.. “she means you too.” “no she doesn’t” I say, “otherwise she would say me as well.” She also tells rye she loves him more times than I’ve seen a girl best friend tell a guy 

One night he gets a call from kit and she’s hysterically crying because she is fighting with her husband and wants someone to talk to. So he steps out and talks with her to calm her down. I ask him why is she calling her husbands best friend for comfort, doesn’t she have some friends of her own or a mom? He tells me she really doesn’t. It’s important to note Kit and Ty are fighting because Ty feels like Kit always takes the light and out shines him, it was his bday weeekend and he felt like she was making it all about her and taking the spotlight off him. Which sounds really petty but rye said she does that to her husband a lot. She’s almost too bubbly and extroverted. 

Just last week she texted Rye about how bad her migraines have been lately and he was apologetic and her last text to him 
was “I’m so happy you are in my life you have no idea how thankful I am for you. You are the best second husband and throuple I could ever ask for I love you so much, I can’t wait to see you soon” 

Rye and I have open access to each other’s phones, so I’m not doing this sneakily. I had enough, I’m uncomfortable and so I finally told him how I feel. I pretty much said that I feel like an outsider I’m not invited ever by her to come see them it’s always just you by yourself and I don’t like seeing another woman touch you, tell you how much she loves you call you her second husband and a throuple. I said I need her to cool it i’m not asking you to not hang out with her but I need to hang out with you guys all more so I can become more comfortable. 

We had probably three or four beers with this conversation so it was a little heated and he immediately got defensive. He told me that this is how it was before I came around so I need to get used to it but we will also all hang out more so I can get to know her more. I responded and told him absolutely not, he needs to get used to my boundaries and I don’t care how it was before this is how it needs to be now. I said I am not asking for them to not be friends but if he can’t politely tell her to cool it because I’m uncomfortable then I will. He agreed. 

Three days later we are in the car and I grab his phone to put a song on and he put a go passcode on it.

He has been telling me that he likes me and invites me to sleepover at his house often- regardless of him knowing I don’t want to have sex until we get to know each other more. Just a few days ago he invited me to thanksgiving with his family as well. 
He’s piercer and works with this women he’s mentioned to me a couple times. He told me that he talked to her about me when we first started talking, he said he wasn’t sure if I was into him at first. He said that he let her read our texts to determine if I was into him or not. The first day I met her she was really sweet and seemed cool. He invited me over the other night to smoke at her apartment with the both of them and watch some show. I came over and everything was fine until I started realizing he was kinda ignoring me. I then started to observe a lot because of that. He was sitting on the couch to the side of her and I, while we were sitting on the same couch together opposite sides. He then moved and sat in the middle of us saying it would be easier to pass the blunt this way. Usually he is very affectionate with me. He told me his love language is physical touch. Yet, when he sat in the middle of us he was more on her side, her feet were touching his legs ( she had a blanket on top). I put my leg snuggled up next to his and he moved his leg away from me. So I moved to the very end of the couch so that he wouldn’t have to touch me. I don’t like making people feel uncomfortable haha. I noticed that he was leaning towards her as well. I end up getting annoyed because this treatment was weird, and I say I’m leaving to get some sleep since it was already late around 11pm. He hugs me on the couch and I hug him back, but he subtly pushed me off him. Weird. He asks if I wanted to be walked to my car, I say yes. He walks me out to my car and says “ I know you wish we were cuddling and kissing and stuff like that I’m sorry we couldn’t”. He then gave me a kiss goodbye then walked back to her apartment. I have shown signs of BPD, I have adhd so emotional dysregulation is a thing I have to pay attention to in order to have healthy relationships. I don’t know if I’m over analyzing or what. If I should say something to him or ask him anything or just not talk to him anymore. Any advice is welcome.

Backstory: I was on a trip for business and went out with my (male) boss for a drink one night. He called while I was out and I did not tell him the details of the outing for fear of him making a scene while I was sitting with my boss. I told him after the fact that I was out with my (male) boss alone and he hung up on me. He then texted and said that we were over and that we could work out splitting everything up when I returned home. It destroyed me and ruined the rest of my trip.

Before I got home, he gave me the chance to explain everything and his demeanor changed and was now willing to work on it with me. When I got home we talked it out and he made a comment that you don’t just give up on people when they do something that hurts you. You talk it out and try to make it work. He also said that he had planned on proposing soon and that that was why he reacted so intensely. 

The back of my mind keeps telling me that this is not right. I do not want the relationship to end because we have been together for 4 years and has become my best friend, but now that I think about it, more signs are appearing.

He has been sort of controlling in the past about me not texting when I’m out (because he worries something has happened to me). He has tried to casually restrict me from hanging out with friends and family and says I go out too much and he’s worried I don’t want to spend time with him. He jokingly threatens to hurt me (which I have never taken seriously until now). He yells at me in arguments. He makes me feel self conscious about my body by regularly telling me that I need to get back in shape (I may be 10lbs overweight max) and has never called me beautiful until I talked about leaving. There are others but that it what keeps racing through my mind.

I now wonder if this is me overreacting and reading too much into things or if I really should be concerned. I have an anxiety disorder which causes me to dwell on things, so it could just be that. 

I told him the other day that I was considering leaving and he told me that he would do anything to keep me around, even if it meant going to therapy. I’m worried that this might just me to get me to stay until I’m used to it again and forget. Does anyone have any insight?

He is not good at showing emotions. Saying I love you and compliments do not come easy to him. In fact, he's never said I love you first. 

He does not initiate sex. He agrees I am the only active one. He does not turn me down but honestly at this point it is hurting my self esteem. 

Lately, I feel like I am tagging along to what he wants to do. Something I wanted to do and which was planned for weeks for both of us was turned down by him last minute. 

I want children, he is at the very least unsure, maybe does not want them, or at least not now.

I've been upfront about wanting them from early on. He's been less transparent.

I also recently underwent a small surgery and saw all these other people with their partner supporting them and felt very alone and sad. He followed up with quite a delay. I felt very lonely but didn't want to have to tell him that I wanted more support. I feel like that is somehow...something you should not have to explain.

We had a trip planned soon and I am not sure I want to do this together. It feels very wrong at the moment. Seeing my engaged friend while I feel we are struggling. I told him I would prefer to go alone which he accepted and now feel horrible that I've ""done this to him"".

We've spoken but I feel like nothing is happening. I am not sure what I can do - these feel like very big topics. I feel like I have nothing left to give but I do not want to make him sad. He could be such a great partner but I feel like I cannot explain any more what I would need.

He has started saying things like “I feel like our relationship will change.” To me, that sounds like insecurity about the fact that he knows I stayed with my family to help me get out of my last relationship, which was abusive. He has mentioned being worried about that before. But this is a holiday.

However, last night my boyfriend left his phone open and charging next to him this morning (I don't think he has screen inactivity turned on), and when I woke up I was greeted by a folder of photos on the screen.

Against my better judgment, I hit the back page and saw that along with a large folder, there's two sub folders labelled with the name of his ex and the name of a girl he used to f*ck around with.

The  problem is that I'm afraid I won't be able to deal with that in future  since sex is really important for me, and eventually I might cheat on  them regardless me loving them so much. Also it's not really helping  that I'm suspecting myself of being polyamorous meanwhile my partner is  monogamous.

Wish there was some  kind of easy way out of this but I don't think there is one, still it  seems wrong to end relationship that I'm really happy with only for sex  reasons.

She says he just annoys her. She said nothing has ever happened between them since we met, and that it’s normally just snapchats of cats and dumb shit like that. But I can’t help but feel like there’s more to it. Like he’s her backup or something.

Anyways the thing is two months ago i went through his phone and found out he was texting other girls.But just empty texts.Calling them hot and shit like that.It was self sabotage from his side which i get.He has depression and doesn’t feel worthy of anything.I know it’s wrong to project it on me because it’s absolutely not my fault,but me understanding is not me forgiving and i made it clear to him and we worked through it.I couldn’t trust him again after that though,it left a deep wound.I went through his phone a month later and same shit but not as bad.But i lashed out on him and it turned into a bigger argument.Anyways again we move on and now i’m trying to trust him,but still the urge to check his phone again is too strong so i do and same shit.It’s literally all empty texts like even i can see that.It’s the type where he just texts and ghosts after,just to fill an empty hole.
Apparently two years ago he was truly depressed and i know about that,he told me he would send over 60 texts per day and never follow up or with the intention of it going anywhere physical,even when he was single.He was just lonely and wanted to fill the loneliness,again I get it,no excuses but i understand.I used to do the same to some extent but not as bad.
Now after getting with me he stopped all that,he said it would literally be 60 plus texts per day and obviously he completely stopped.But it’s like an addiction,just like with alcohol or nicotine or porn addiction,he was addicted and stopped completely and he told me it’s like an urge that happens and he’s genuinely trying his best which i do believe.
Now thing is i don’t know what to do or what to make out of it,I’ve never seen someone like this.And please don’t start telling me he’s just making shit up and he’s an asshole,obviously he fucked up big time and i made it clear i don’t trust him or forgive him for it yet,I’m just so confused.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7623504,public,self,My boyfriend[21] seems addicted to texting other girls.I’m 20.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2vnqv/my_boyfriend21_seems_addicted_to_texting_other/,all_ads,6,,,,,

We have awful fights about once every 1-2 weeks, more than that around the holidays. I believe we both have trauma coming up from childhood abuse and/or emotional abuse from past relationships. On my end I feel that my insecurities and fears about infidelity get triggered too easily. He feels accused of such things sometimes even when I do my best to state that I’m only expressing my fears, not accusing him. I believe he is loyal and usually we can resolve our misunderstandings…Usually. I also have abandonment trauma from my Dad being an alcoholic who died recently. Most of the time my bf and I both make assumptions and get defensive and we have fights/arguments that can go for hours. We’ve both made efforts to communicate better and with more respect when there’s yelling and a lot of stress or drama. Generally he is a sweet person who makes a lot of effort to show he is loyal and loves me. He calls a lot, texts a lot, makes visits to come see me, and vice versa.

I was supposed to go visit him for this holiday weekend, however, he came down with covid. I had to cancel my trip last minute which we both are bummed about. Last night we decided to watch a movie together over the phone, as we often do watch movies or shows as a way of spending time together while in a LDR.

This will initially sound trivial but please hear me out. We got into a little argument about which movie to watch. I honestly didn’t think it was a big deal. I actually thought it was kind of funny like we were acting like two little toddlers about it, he folded and said we could watch the movie I wanted. But halfway through the movie I sensed his boredom over the phone and asked him if he was ok. He revealed to me that he wasn’t enjoying the movie and he was upset that he felt he couldn’t be honest with me because he was afraid I’d get angry at him, and that he feels this way with me a lot. This was news to me, and in turn triggered me to think he is afraid of being honest with me about everything, like big things, like fidelity. I got frustrated. Mostly with myself but projected onto him unintentionally which made him more upset. He said he needed to get some sleep and I begrudgingly let him go to sleep. This is where it gets ugly- I’ve known for some time now that my depression that comes about after we fight like this- is a red flag for me. Sometimes, more often lately, I have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of hurting myself. I have tried to find a therapist that will take my insurance- I’m unemployed and not on the world’s greatest insurance- and not a single therapist out of like 10 that I’ve contacted have even bothered to RESPOND to my request for an appointment. Maybe 2, ok 2 out of 10. My friends and family are all so overwhelmed by their own issues or codependent with me I don’t feel like reaching out to them would help me. So aside from calling a crisis hotline which often feels so awkward and impersonal, I end up calling my bf back when I’m in a state of being triggered, emotionally exhausted, extremely sensitive, and desperate for reassurance.  I *know* there are self soothing things I can try, but in a freeze state I feel my body won’t let me.

He obviously doesn’t appreciate being woken up any more than I appreciate feeling abandoned. So I called him back last night in that aforementioned bad state, and I started yelling at him about how I will need to take a step back in the relationship because I can’t handle feeling like crap and being suicidal anymore, and that’s when he yells “ARE YOU FUCKING DUMB OR SOMETHING?!?!?! I HAVE COVID!!!!”

This is not the first time he has said something like this. Last week he insinuated that thinking a certain way/how I was thinking would be stupid, and several months ago- like at least 6 months he said it was “stupid of me” to make an assumption I had made about his job.

I’ve called him out on all the above and although he has been apologetic I’m feeling extremely hurt about last night’s incident. I’m terrified of the following possibilities: 1) that I’m seeing the beginning of an abuser and ignorant of the red flags (done it before with 3 past partners), 2) that I am abusive and being a survivor of trauma makes it hard for me to see it, 3) we are both abusive and wasting our time, don’t/can’t truly love each other it’s too late, too much damage done, or 4) we do have some instances of inappropriate behavior between us, but it could be resolved with counseling and consistent efforts to change but one of us would give up too soon due to being unable to find counseling in time, and it would end in heartbreak anyway.

I do love him, dearly. But I have no freaking clue wtf to do.

I’ve been clean and sober for 13 years. I have Dx of ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD from a psychiatrist. In the past two and a half years I’ve lost a total of 7 fairly significant to extremely significant people in my life. Some friends, some family. Deaths ranging from everything from addiction issues, to cancer, to murder.

BTW, I had the aforementioned diagnoses BEFORE 2020/before those 7 people died.

my ex boyfriend and I broke up this Saturday. We were only together for three months but we meet four times every week and nothing seemed to be wrong. He told me he loved me, wanted me to meet his family and move in with him.

But this saturday he was acting weird and was pretty rude to me. I contronted him and after a few minutes he guiltily admitted to me he just saw me as a friend. I was shocked because there were no signs and I am really certain he was willing to deceive me until March next year, when he'd leave to another country for work. I left his apartment heart broken. He messaged me a few hours later and told me if he could bring by my stuff he left at his apartment. I told him my friend would pick it up. Afterwards he asked me if I wanted to talk still. I didn't reply, I was too angry at that moment.

Fast forward to today, my friend picked up my stuff. During the exchange he asked my friend how I was feeling and to take care of me. Now at home I discovered a letter from him. But it just said ""Hey I wanted to give you this at Christmas but as I can't give it personally to you so it will be through your friend. I wish you all the best for the future."" 
He wrote the message in his mother tongue, which was weird because we only communicate in English. Then he signed the letter. Under that small paragraph he then impersonated his cat and wrote ""meow meow meooow meow"" and signed the name of his cat.

The present still had the price tag and is a small Christmas house you can glue together yourself. There was no apology or some insights he gave me in that letter on why he lost his feelings. And to be honest I don't know what to make of it.

I really want to get closure from this relationship but the letter is so weird and the present  does not make sense. I really liked him but I am questioning everything at the moment.

He doesn’t initiate conversations most of the time, but he’s good about scheduling dates. He answers my text messages, but never promptly. I told him that I appreciate phone calls and that I would like to increase communication, but he still hasn’t put in any effort in this area. My gut tells me that he’s not into me, but my “gut” might be the echo of my own insecurities. How can I tell the difference and when is it a good time to have a through conversation about my needs?

To put you in context, we have been together for more than 6 months, i stay over at her place up to 2 or 3 days a week, i talk with her mom, and her aunt and uncle; her mom has a business on the flea market and we help her put the stand with all the product, and i do it gladly, as you can see i have an actual relationship with her family members, however when she is at my house she is like a different person, honestly i don't get  how can this relationship work on the long term because its not reciprocal,  I stay over at her house 2 or 3 days, and we sleep on the same bed, and everyone know this, to me this is a serious enough relationship, but i don't its going to last, she comes to my house maybe once a month, and she doesn't seems interested in forming a relationship with my family. I'm convinced she is simply not interested in them, and i don't what to think. I know she had a great relationship with her ex family, was friends with her ex's sister, and got along great with his parents, my point is, she really was committed to that relationship but i do not see that commitment with me.  How is it possible having a relationship without reciprocity. And before you ask, yes, i have talked with her about this, and  i have made abundantly clear that this is a big deal to me, and  I told her , you don't have to be  best buddies with my family members, just have a cordial relationship with the parents of the person you  supposedly  love and want to marry, just talk with them, get to know them, make an effort, she says she never has time to go, and she is always late.

I (&lt;18M) am currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (&lt;18M). I am so scared that when/if we meet up that he’ll think I am ugly and regret dating me. I already worry he finds me annoying or ugly and just hasn’t said anything.

He has never been anything but kind and supportive but I still worry. I worry that when he sees me in person he will be so repulsed he dumps me. I am scared he will be upset and disappointed because maybe I looked better on camera. And even now I worry that he thinks the photos of me and the video calls we’ve had are ugly.

On top of that I am worried I am too clingy and talkative. That I am too annoying, what if he is growing tired of me?

I guess I am scared that I am not good enough and that he will hate me and leave physically or emotionally because of that.

He is so handsome and pretty and he is perfect, and I look at myself and feel so ugly and embarrassing.

To start off, me and my boyfriend broke up a few months ago because things got overwhelming, and I talked to guys very shortly after we broke up and sent *pictures* to somebody he really hated. this has caused a majority of issues now that we’re back together, and now he doesn’t trust me because I was untruthful when we started talking again and because of the fact I called a bunch of guys cute in hopes to forget about him (was still broken up when i was untruthful). 

fast forward to now, 6 months after the breakup we are still together, and it seems like he’s trusting me less. I’ve never been disloyal during our relationship over the past 3 years we’ve been together. a few weeks ago i went over my friends house and 2 of her male friends were there (one being her ex, and the other being her best friend. the bestfriend’s girlfriend was present, and the ex has a gf). 

I happened to have a few shots and got tipsy, but still respecting my boyfriend’s boundaries and the relationship all together. I was still aware of my surroundings and the things i was doing, her ex kept trying to talk to me and ask me if i was okay or drunk or whatever. then towards the end of the night he asked my why i unadded him on snapchat, which i said “i never had you added in the first place.” i was super dismissive whenever he would talk to me because my boyfriend didnt want me talking to him at all.

my boyfriend got super upset at me because i got tipsy around him. i had my boyfriend on the phone for the majority of the night, trying to make him comfortable. we were arguing for a few days because i drank around someone he was uncomfortable with. (i didn’t disrespect the relationship at all!!!) 

(sorry for long post) now, a few days ago my friend invited me out to watch a play, eat, and hangout with her and a few other friends who i knew (no drinking or smoking). i asked my boyfriend which he said yes, hes okay with me going, and went on my way. plans ended up changing and my 2 other friends werent going, so it was just me, my friend whos a girl, and the guy she’s interested in. then, his friend asks to be picked up, so my friend picks him up.

at this point, he is mad at me because he saw it as a double date rather than 4 people just hanging out. hes upset that plans changed and is mad the guy is going, so calls me to be on the phone with me for some of it. hes telling me not to talk to these guys at all, which i barely did. i ended up talking about my boyfriend a bunch to them, and they respected it and even was engaged in convo. nothing happened that night and i 100% respected my boyfriend. he is still upset because he says i shouldve found my own way home once i knew the guy was coming.

i asked him to go out tomorrow, seeing if he was comfortable. and he got angry because i asked and didn’t decide for myself. “why are you asking me?! decide for yourself you know im uncomfortable this is so disrespectful to even ask me such a thing” and he tells me that if i want to keep hanging around guys, then find another boyfriend whos okay with that stuff. 

i love my boyfriend but i feel controlled. i dont want to hurt him but i genuinely need some advice here on how to go about the situation.

We met when I was 22 and he was 26. The longest stretch where we were in a real relationship was from Nov 2019 to June 2021. During that time I got pregnant, we were happy and very excited to be parents together, and then we lost the baby at almost 20 weeks. We were so happy before that but we just couldn't look past the grief. Neither of us was perfect, we both had mental struggles and we just didn't know how to support eachother. But in all these years we've never figure out how to let eachother go either. Ultimately, I left but we've stayed in touch. We've never gone more than a couple weeks without contact in all these years. We've always told eachother that the other one holds a special place in their heart. I hate myself because I realize now that he might have been able to find some happiness in his last days if I had been able to let him go. 

Everything with us was always so complicated but I don't know how to explain how much we always loved and cared about eachother. We were always eachother's phone call when things were hard. I called him a month ago and we talked for over an hour and then last Thursday he called me and we talked for an hour again. He told me that he forgives me for everything, and we left it in a good place. Then he died of a heart attack on Saturday. I can't come to terms with that either. It's like he somehow knew, and he was trying to give me peace before it happened. 

I know this is frazzled and disjointed. I'm shocked and stricken with grief. I can't stop thinking about him and going over memories and replaying every little detail and wondering what would have happened if I would have stayed. I look for him everywhere. Yesterday I was driving on the highway and I said ""Where are you?"" out loud to myself, and then I looked at the license plate in front of me and there was a plate with his alma mater on it. I'm not religious but he was, and I felt like I needed a sign. 

We both hurt eachother a lot in the time we've known eachother but we also both supported eachother and we cared about eachother. I think I'll always love him and I feel like I lost the only other person in the world that will ever understand us. I want to go back and time and make sure he knows that he wasn't alone. 

We were always so complicated. I think most people have ""that ex"".

I don't know how to talk to my family about this.

There were FWBs and short situationships that I didn’t care for during this time. I (29F) was focusing on my weight loss (-50 lbs during Covid) and career. I have also been celibate for 3 years. 

Anyways this past month I decided to try dating apps, I met someone and we hit it off. It was a crazy month, he was super romantic and would make a big effort to plan dates and see me during the week. I felt a bit overwhelmed at first but began to open up and really enjoy his (35M) efforts. I loved his enthusiasm and I reciprocated with the same energy. 

However he broke up me after that month because of a new work opportunity. He’s packing up everything and moving in 6 weeks (Toronto to Vancouver). He says he simply doesn’t have the time or energy for a girlfriend but wants us to have fun casually until he goes. I was devastated but I agreed. 

My problem is, I feel like my feelings for him change every day, every hour. I feel like a crazy friend/person always snapping at him. I know he’s busy finalizing his move, selling his home, helping his family before he goes. His job is demanding too. 

Is it because he’s so nonchalant about us, that I’m upset? Is it because I’m at the bottom of his priorities list that’s making me angry? Am I just frustrated because all of this is out of my control?

I’m losing so much sleep. I’m definitely an overthinker. 

He does try to see me once every 1.5 weeks now. But apart of me feels like it’s out of pitty. 

I’m usually really composed. I rarely show my emotions. But lately I’m sad, agitated, annoyed and crying a lot. I can’t seem to manage my emotions and I feel crazy.

I make friends with someone or they specifically are keen to make friends with me and we get on well and then slowly they start becoming cruel to me. At first it’s something that has plausible deniability but then it just gets worse and more direct. 

It started with my childhood best friend, we got on really well for years, then as we grew older he started to make little jabs at things I was insecure about. I was so young and naive that I thought it was just friendship banter until I got to about 16 and realised he was actually just trying to make me feel bad. I distanced myself from him slowly, that one really hurt as we’d been best friends with no issues for years.

This happened again when I was 17 or so. A guy made friends with me and we got on really well, we had the same taste in TV, music, everything. We had such a laugh together. Anyway every so often he’d just get this twisted grin and say something completely designed to hurt my feelings. Again I was young so I literally couldn’t comprehend it. I’d see him at school the next day and he’d come up to me extremely nice again and telling me about a movie he recommends bla bla. It really fucked with my mind - the whole kind 99% of the time and randomly cruel out of nowhere. Again, I distanced myself from him.

Anyway I’m now 26 and I thought I was past all of this. But the same things happened again, a guy at work has become extremely clingy with me, he follows me everywhere, he asks me for help with his work, he tries to engage in social convo. But I’ve noticed every so often he throws in something harsh at me. Say I was insecure about being ginger, he’d just be like ‘you’re looking very… ginger today’. Like something that to most people could be swept aside as not that big a deal but he knows what’s he doing because he’s started doing it once a week, little throwaway comments about an obvious insecurity. I started to distance myself from him and he started telling me things today like ‘we haven’t spoken in ages!’ and ‘you okay? you’ve seemed down recently?’ as if he was genuinely upset that I was distancing myself from him, it’s like he’s obsessed with being my friend but then wants to put me down but honestly I don’t even want to explain that he hurt my feelings because I don’t want him to feel like he succeeded, I want him to fuck off.

Anyway.. my point is.. why does it feel like the people who like me the most at one point or who become slightly obsessed with me end up being the cruelest? It sucks because it makes me feel like my list of true friends is smaller and smaller.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7623438,public,self,Why does it feel like the people who like me the most become the cruelest?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2vd6n/why_does_it_feel_like_the_people_who_like_me_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Sometimes he's pants would be down, other times he had underwear on. A few times he'd have his hand in my underwear or playing with my boobs. I repeatedly told him I hated it, and it made me wonder how many times I didn't wake up and this happened. It was really affecting our sex life to the point that even when I was in the mood, I couldn't bring myself to do it, and when we did have sex I didn't want to do foreplay anymore. Initially my husband argued my points, but eventually he agreed he was wrong. 

We entered couples therapy for this and some other issues, and the therapist didn't really address the issue, other than telling me a lot of men do this. I thought he was maybe building our trust first and then would, but he never came back to it, so I stopped making the appointments. I tried to initiate sex more often, but it didn't make a difference. My husband on and off kept doing this, where there would be month long breaks of it not happening, and he said he was genuinely trying not to do it. 

About 2 weeks ago he did it again (first time in a few months) but this time I pretended to be sleeping and only got out of bed when he went to the bathroom to clean up. He kind of played it off like ""why are you awake?"", but when he realised he's been caught, he said sorry. He had a work trip the next day so I told him we could talk when he gets back. He got back on Sunday, and he hasn't brought it up. But he's made jokes about do I want to shower with him, and should we take a ""nap"" together, and implied that he wants to have sex. I'm so disappointed that he hasn't brought it up, and that he even thinks I'd want to have sex with him right now. It makes me feel like he isn't sorry at all, and he doesn't believe his behavior is wrong, and he thinks he has some sort of claim over my body because we're married. I don't know what to even say that I haven't said before.

Is this really something majority of men are doing? I've seen this debated where some women say they don't mind it, and I've seen it played as a joke in movies. But is it really a case of ""if she's sleeping it's fair game""?

As he and I have been talking about what we want to do with our lives, I'm beginning to realize that it feels like our relationship is on a timer. We both go to the same university, but I'm a graduate student and he's a junior. This summer, he'll be going back to Ohio, while I'll be staying in NY to complete my Masters. This wouldn't be so bad, except he plans on going to Spain for study abroad in the fall (he's worried there's a chance his ROTC program won't let him go, but I feel like the odds are in his favor). This means that if the worst case scenario were realized, he and I would not be able to see each other in person for 7 months (we've discussed me visiting him in Spain and seeing each other over the summer, but obviously for the majority of those 7 months we won't be seeing each other). After he gets back though, it would totally be possible to see him on a regular basis because he'll be back in NY for his last semester and the commute from my hometown in NJ to NY is less than an hour.

There's a few things I'm worried about. First, I'm worried that I'm going to be holding him back. He's very passionate about learning Spanish and really wants to immerse himself in the culture. I want him to have the best time possible there, and I feel like my need for communication will distract him from the trip. 

Secondly, I'm scared for us to lose feelings for each other. Going without seeing each other for so long makes me feel like this may be inevitable. 

And lastly, I'm terrified of being cheated on again. I was cheated on in my last relationship, and it's now my greatest fear. I hope enough trust will have been built between us by the time he leaves, but I feel like the new, exciting environment coupled with the fact that he wouldn't have seen me all summer would make him more likely to cheat. 

All of this really sucks because this is my first healthy, secure relationship, and yet it feels like he and I are going to have to discuss the future of the relationship 6 months from now, which just seems so soon. Not to sound cheesy, but my heart doesn't want break up with him, yet my brain wants to save me from the possible future heartbreak before I get too attached. We spend a lot of time with each other now and I'm trying to stay present in these fun and amazing moments we share, but I can't help but think about how 6 months from now we're going to be having a difficult conversation that could lead to us breaking up.

Now obviously anything could happen between now and the start of summer that causes us to break up before we need to deal with any of these worries, but let's assume that everything goes smoothly and he and I are now at crossroads deciding what to do. Should we break up once the summer comes around? Or before he goes off for his study abroad? Or should we not break up at all and try to stick it out once he goes back to Ohio and see what happens? Or do we break up right now? I know that the state of our relationship will be very different 6 months from now and we may feel that it could survive 7 months apart, but I would like opinions now because I feel like I can't get my mind off this.

I'm 21f, hes 21m, weve been friends since we were 13, we spent over 2 years together, we lived on a sailboat we were restoring to travel the world. We had an overall healthy relationship. We were also in a successful and happy open relationship. 

Issues we faced and were making good progress on: 

Him - was inherently selfish a lot of the times. Had anger issues where he would get frustrated/overwhelmed and took it out on me by projecting his issues onto me. Lost respect for me and my time. 


Me - laziness, wasn't taking care of the household or contributing equally to finances. Was emotionally dependent, clingy, needy, and had too many expectations. 

We broke up about a month ago. The reason for him breaking up with me was he felt trapped, and that he wanted us both to grow as individuals in ways we just couldn't help each other anymore. Also there was another girl involved that he had met. It ended up not working out tho. Since the breakup, I feel like I have made great progress with my physical and emotional health, prioritizing myself and detaching myself from him. We've started up a casual sexual relationship again because we both have needs and the sex between us has always been amazing. I felt like I was ready to have it without having any expectations to where it would lead. 

Problem is tho, I spent the night the first time last week and during it he was insanely loving. Told me he loved me over and over again, that I was the best. Wouldn't stop looking me deep in my eyes and smiling at me. He told me to look him in the eyes and make love to him. He kept nuzzling my nose. I orgasmed like 5 times that night, and we made love for over an hour. Twice haha. It was amazing. The rest of the night he wouldn't leave me alone, he cuddled me all night. Woke me up at like 2am to hug me tight and tell me he loved me. The next morning we had sex again, then ran errands together since we both needed to go grocery shopping. It was a good day. 

Since then hes put more effort into reaching out to me, wishing me a good day and other positive affirmations. 

Theres multiple reasons to why I am wary of this. It took a lot of effort in this month to get to where I'm at, to not care so much abt him and fixating on our togetherness. I felt like I was incomplete without him, and he knows this. It was a big reason why the breakup happened, I suffocated him with my infatuation. So I am confused why he thought it was appropriate to love bomb me when I had just healed from being addicted to it. I've never known him to be a manipulative person, one thing I've admired about him is his complete transparency. Hes the most honest and upfront human I've ever met. Plus I don't see what he had to gain from manipulating me in that moment. I was already willingly there to have sex lol. It seemed cruel almost, to present me with that much affection in that moment. 

Also I don't want to be his backup. The other girl didnt work out, and tbh we were in an open relationship and I'm completely aware of having multiple types of love at once and it not taking away from the love you share with another person. At least in our case that's what we've recognized. She played a big part in him throwing everything we had away, and i cant help but think what would've happened had it worked out. That's cruel to me also. I dont care abt the other dates hes been on, I've stopped dating other people because I dont have the energy for it rn and I'm just focusing on myself. But it doesn't bother me, what bothers me is the uncertainty of his intentions. I'm worth being his first choice in life, I've given a lot to him. 

On the flipside though, we did have an amazing relationship. I presented a list of issues at the top of this post, but I said that progress was being made and I meant that very seriously. We still have an amazing open line of communication and comprehension. We take each others criticisms very well and openly, and we always made sure to actively change our behaviors in order to make ourselves better people as individuals and for each other. We are best friends. We can talk for hours and hours, laughing and learning new things. Or just sit in silence and enjoy each others company. When we're both motivated and on the same page we work great together when it comes to accomplishing whatever we set our minds to. 

In the end, this relationship is worth fighting for to me. Its beautiful, harmonious, and a constant learning experience that has helped me develop into the person I am today. 

I want to take it reaaaal slow. And build it back up. I need an outsider's perspective, what are the best steps to take in doing that and make sure the result is beneficial, fruitful, and better than where we left it? Does it sounds like this is something he wants? I want to present this idea to him in a way that is not overbearing or too stressful. Because I want to remain casual and re build our passion while we continue to work on ourselves in the background. But, I do want to know that we are working towards the same goal.

Here is the story:

My girlfriend (18F) and me (24M) had been together for 1,5 years. It was awesome love. Affection, commitment, everything that would say it makes perfect. She is a naive, and having troubles with a few mental illnesses (like depression, anxiety, body image disturbance, low self-esteem. The are all officially papered problems, not just made up..).  
In the last 5-6 month from till now, we were loosing ground. We get to listen each other's needs less and less. We are both so stubborn, so when someone doesn't want some specific activity or anything, then next time when the situation is reversed, we were both acting dismissive, because ""the last time he/she didn't do what i want"" logic.  
The relationship started to be empty and common, we were starting to became grumpy...  
We both were trying our bests, we tought is the best, but in the end we didn't listen to each other needs. We had good days/weeks, then terrible ones..

This lead to her starting to get to know other guys behind my back, keeping it in secret for a few months. Go on dates, talking with them, but staying behind the borders...

In November she said ""I can't do this, I need a break, I need space, time, to live myself off. I don't want to meet anyone's expectations or be accountable for what I do or anything."" - This hurt me so much, I felt like I did something wrong, I'm not enought.  
After weeks of figuring things out, thinking about my part of problems, I realized all the I have written above and even more. I know what are the things that could improve.

Meanwhile that weeks in November, it was a torture. At first she was like, ""take a break and if we really meant for each other, we will come around"". I was like ""hell no, I couldn't process that"".  
We ended up that it's not a breakup but she needs time to figure it out.  
Our interactions became less and faded. I just found out last week, that meanwhile that she is talking to an other guy.

We met up several times, she always said ""keep calm, it will be okay, i won't leave you like this. I'm terribly sorry, I know I fucked up and I can't see you like this."" These were repeating again and again.

I was like it was enough, I can't continue like this, please make a decision: get on with your life with me by your side or without me. She couldn't make the decision.  
A few days or even a week passed, I was dying inside.  
Last Sunday (20th of Nov.) in the evening, she texted ""We will correct and repair it TOGETHER! Okay?"" She was ready to cut off every guy.  
I was like hell yeah!

The next day (Monday) she was soooo interested, opened up, caring. I loved it.

Yesterday she went to the psychiatrist that convinced her to break up and end it.. I was afraid this will happen, when she wrote she want to talk.  
It was just as hard for her, as for me.. She was like it's better for you without me hurting you.  
And I still can't blame her. It was me who started to be dismissive towards her needs, the things she wanted to do.  


This morning she replied to a tiktok I sent her yesterday, that ""maybe I can fix it"".  
We had a little small talk.  
A little bit later, I found an app on my phone called Desire (its a cool app, where you can set tasks, compliments, anything to your partner), we last used it in April. I was like let's send her a last text here saying ""I miss you"", before I delete the app. Since we don't use it for half a year, I was pretty sure, she won't see it. 15 minutes later she replied: ""the problem is, I miss you too. I replied i was sure you won't see it and she was like: ""i will keep everything that connects to you"". A little bit later I got a new task her asking for a wake up selfie.  
A few minutes ago, while writing this she sent a picture of her painting. I made compliments. She told me it's for some exhibition in school. I was like im so proud of you, so cool.  
Reminded her to what I told her a little ago (when I realized my failures), that I'm up to painting with her anytime. And she loved that, she was amazed of my reaction.

We have awful fights about once every 1-2 weeks, more than that around the holidays. I believe we both have trauma coming up from childhood abuse and/or emotional abuse from past relationships. On my end I feel that my insecurities and fears about infidelity get triggered too easily. He feels accused of such things sometimes even when I do my best to state that I’m only expressing my fears, not accusing him. I believe he is loyal and usually we can resolve our misunderstandings…Usually. I also have abandonment trauma from my Dad being an alcoholic who died recently. Most of the time my bf and I both make assumptions and get defensive and we have fights/arguments that can go for hours. We’ve both made efforts to communicate better and with more respect when there’s yelling and a lot of stress or drama. Generally he is a sweet person who makes a lot of effort to show he is loyal and loves me. He calls a lot, texts a lot, makes visits to come see me, and vice versa.

I was supposed to go visit him for this holiday weekend, however, he came down with covid. I had to cancel my trip last minute which we both are bummed about. Last night we decided to watch a movie together over the phone, as we often do watch movies or shows as a way of spending time together while in a LDR.

This will initially sound trivial but please hear me out. We got into a little argument about which movie to watch. I honestly didn’t think it was a big deal. I actually thought it was kind of funny like we were acting like two little toddlers about it, he folded and said we could watch the movie I wanted. But halfway through the movie I sensed his boredom over the phone and asked him if he was ok. He revealed to me that he wasn’t enjoying the movie and he was upset that he felt he couldn’t be honest with me because he was afraid I’d get angry at him, and that he feels this way with me a lot. This was news to me, and in turn triggered me to think he is afraid of being honest with me about everything, like big things, like fidelity. I got frustrated. Mostly with myself but projected onto him unintentionally which made him more upset. He said he needed to get some sleep and I begrudgingly let him go to sleep. This is where it gets ugly- I’ve known for some time now that my depression that comes about after we fight like this- is a red flag for me. Sometimes, more often lately, I have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of hurting myself. I have tried to find a therapist that will take my insurance- I’m unemployed and not on the world’s greatest insurance- and not a single therapist out of like 10 that I’ve contacted have even bothered to RESPOND to my request for an appointment. Maybe 2, ok 2 out of 10. My friends and family are all so overwhelmed by their own issues or codependent with me I don’t feel like reaching out to them would help me. So aside from calling a crisis hotline which often feels so awkward and impersonal, I end up calling my bf back when I’m in a state of being triggered, emotionally exhausted, extremely sensitive, and desperate for reassurance.  I *know* there are self soothing things I can try, but in a freeze state I feel my body won’t let me.

He obviously doesn’t appreciate being woken up any more than I appreciate feeling abandoned. So I called him back last night in that aforementioned bad state, and I started yelling at him about how I will need to take a step back in the relationship because I can’t handle feeling like crap and being suicidal anymore, and that’s when he yells “ARE YOU FUCKING DUMB OR SOMETHING?!?!?! I HAVE COVID!!!!”

This is not the first time he has said something like this. Last week he insinuated that thinking a certain way/how I was thinking would be stupid, and several months ago- like at least 6 months he said it was “stupid of me” to make an assumption I had made about his job.

I’ve called him out on all the above and although he has been apologetic I’m feeling extremely hurt about last night’s incident. I’m terrified of the following possibilities: 1) that I’m seeing the beginning of an abuser and ignorant of the red flags (done it before with 3 past partners), 2) that I am abusive and being a survivor of trauma makes it hard for me to see it, 3) we are both abusive and wasting our time, don’t/can’t truly love each other it’s too late, too much damage done, or 4) we do have some instances of inappropriate behavior between us, but it could be resolved with counseling and consistent efforts to change but one of us would give up too soon due to being unable to find counseling in time, and it would end in heartbreak anyway.

I do love him, dearly. But I have no freaking clue wtf to do.

I’ve been clean and sober for 13 years. I have Dx of ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD from a psychiatrist.

I'm 23 still with a Vcard and seek advice on how to move forward. For some context, I was always kinda an outcast throughout school, never really bullied but just did not fit in with the normal crowd. The last time I did anything with a girl was in Jnr high when I kiss and dated 2 girls. Since then I moved a couple of times and never really got any more traction. I have always focused more on myself since I was 17 I have just been working full time and never really gone out and have only a couple of close friends, none of them being girls so I don't interact a lot with girls my age. Because of this, I have never gone out of my way to get laid or find a girlfriend. Now, maybe this is too idealistic but I always thought that I will find a GF by just living life and we would just stumble across each other one day. but 5 years have gone by since high school and the average age to lose your virginity is 17. I'm at a point where I don't know if it's damaging to myself to continue to just wait because every day I get more insecure about my own sex life and maybe I'll never lose it if I don't get it done soon. Is this a legitimate concern or not? What would be the best thing for me to do, get it done now or keep waiting for the ""the one""? I know if you wait for the star to align it may never happen. But I also don't really like people my age as I find them immature and not aligning with my beliefs. I have tried tinder a couple of times, I'm not the worst-looking guy and I was never morbidly obese, but I am overweight, so it's difficult to get any traction considering 9% of men get 90% of swipes, and I do get are not too go looking and dry as cardboard for conversation. I also want to understand what you Women think of someone that's a virgin at 23, does that turn you off? does it bother you in anyways? If I get to my mid-late 20s and I'm still a virgin does that continue to give me a bad image in a woman's eyes, or am I just in my head and they don't care?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7623389,public,nsfw,I (23M) looking to gain perspective on virginity and relationship advice.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z2v67o/i_23m_looking_to_gain_perspective_on_virginity/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,
