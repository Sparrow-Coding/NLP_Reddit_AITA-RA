Hi, so I’m gonna try to keep this short. So the basic information is.. 
- Me and my bf have been together for 2 years. 
-We’re both 24 years old. 
-My bf is scared of any form of conflict. 

So, me and my bf is working at the same office. We’ve always been good at keeping work and our private life separated. And the office have no issues with us being a couple etc. 
anyway, for the past months I’ve been working part time. I come 1-3 days a week for 5h ish. (The reason is mental health issues). 
So when I arrive I always walk by my bf to say hi, and every since I started working part time he barely respond to my hi. I brought it up with him but nothing changed. 
I fully understand he is busy but I only say hi and keeps walking. Before when we both worked full time we always made sure to say hi, and generally talking to the other one. But now it feels like I’m his least favorite coworker and I don’t understand why. He will sometimes not even look at me when I say hi. 

He can be cold and not talking to me at all during the day, and the moment he gets home call me and ask about my day like nothing happened.

Also, he is so scared of conflicts and I know if I walk by him without saying hi, he will freak out and think I’m mad at him. He is generally a really nice guy so for him to act this cold is unusual tbh.

It just didn't stick, I guess? I don't know. I'm writing this on a Wednesday morning, having called in, and needing a solution. I pretty much know what's going to be said, but that doesn't mean I don't need to actually hear it. 

Story time.

So, I've worked with my boss (we'll call her Ruby) for a couple of years now. She's a small/medium-sized business owner in a creative field. I'm essentially her assistant. I help on projects while also helping manage her/our schedule. There are a few more labor-focused workers, and a front desk/customer service position, but no one else on my ""level"" in the company.

I should also point out that if you had asked me my sexual orientation a week ago, I would have said I was straight, and *maybe* admitted to a stupid crush on my boss/friend that didn't mean anything. I got out of a long-term relationship with a guy that ended about 8 months ago, and haven't dated at all since. Ruby's also a bit of a flirt, but it's always innocent enough. I never once felt like she was preying on me as someone with power over me. On top of that, I would consider her a friend. We spend a lot of time together, talk about our lives, and occasionally go out just the two of us after a project--dinner, to a bar for drinks, whatever.

I should also point out that Ruby is kind of promiscuous. Which apparently is semi-normal in the lesbian community? She's a bit ""soft butch"" and has a pretty regular rotation of flings. I've seen repeat girls noted in her schedule for dinners, while at the same time having different girls show up to go to lunch with her. It is what it is, but it's important to my issue, so, it's being mentioned.

Anyway. We finished a fairly stressful project on Friday and Ruby wanted to celebrate. She had gotten some bottle of champagne as a gift and figured this was a good excuse to open it, so we went back to her place. (I'd been to her place before, so this wasn't weird or anything.)

We were drinking, and talking, and laughing, and drinking. Neither of us were *drunk* but I was definitely feeling good. And then I leaned in to kiss her. 

And she stopped me. ""I don't get involved with people I work with."" I just sort of sat there for a second, an inch away from her, and my horny, tipsy brain just decided the way to get some action was to ask ""What if I quit?"" She didn't stop me leaning closer, and then I actually landed the kiss.

Kiss led to more kissing led to sex. I was awkward and clumsy. She was anything but. Probably the best sex of my life. She probably wouldn't say the same.

I wobbled out of there at like 3am, making an excuse that I had an appointment in the morning. I didn't talk to her all weekend. And then I went in on Monday like nothing happened. She smiled at me. I blushed, and did my best to avoid giving her an opportunity to talk about what happened. She seemed to get the hint and gave me some space. This continued yesterday, but luckily we had a project that kept us busy.

Today I texted her that I wasn't feeling well, and here I am.

And here's my problem--I don't regret what happened. I want it to happen again. But I also don't want to be just another girl in her rotation? But she hasn't had an actual girlfriend for as long as I've known her. She's talked about having past girlfriends, and those seemed to be monogamous relationships, but she's very definitely not monogamous right now.

TLDR: Slept with my lesbian boss/friend, want to try and do it properly and ask her out, but maybe that's really stupid. Figure I don't have much choice but to quit either way.

Here's how I see my options:

1) I tell her I quit, that it was a mistake, and that I'll be glad to stick around long enough to train a replacement.

2) I do the above, but without the mistake bit. I quit, roll the dice, and ask her out properly.

3) I stick with the job until I can find something else, because maybe that's the more responsible thing to do--but that might take a while if I don't want to wait tables or run a cash register.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563807,public,self,I (27F) slept with my Boss (34F) and I'm not sure what to do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywuun6/i_27f_slept_with_my_boss_34f_and_im_not_sure_what/,all_ads,6,

so it wouldn’t be the best time to have a child with both of us being gone who’s gonna take care of the baby 24/7?

From July-mid October we used to text each other heavy and now she’s kinda distant. I would always tell her I love her, send her good morning/ good night texts and she’s been working a lot of hours as she works from home doing customer service.

I would ask her how her day was but all she would tell me about that “It’s going” or when I ask her how is she she would just say “I’m working.” She’s not telling me what’s wrong.

To sum up my past relationship I (25m) got married to my highschool sweetheart (24f) while I was in the navy. From my point of view the relationship was perfect, but the day I got back from my last deployment (approx 8 months ago) she told me she had cheated on me 4 times. Obviously going from married, to single and depressed messed up my plans, so now I'm living back home with family and waiting for school to start so I can figure out what I really want to do.

I met my friend in highschool a couple years before me and my ex started dating, and a couple months ago he began dating the girl that made the cake for our wedding. She's super nice and super empathetic, but I just learned that she is working with my ex who also moved back in with her family after the divorce, and now being around her makes me extremely uncomfortable. She knows the history of me and my ex's relationship and wants me to heal, but I can't look at her without thinking about my ex and getting very sad and in my head, and I'm worried my discomfort is gonna mess up my friendship

To which he is referring to when I was a single mom and early in our relationship when we had one child and I was able to work. Now, 8 years later, we have a very disabled child that requires my care 24/7. We live together so I'm also in charge of keeping up with everything with our apt. I have a pre-teen in school and I also keep track of every single thing with her. Anyone with you g kids knows it's constantly reminding them and staying on top of what they are supposed to be getting done in and out of school. My disabled son has multiple therapy visits per week as well as extremely important medication and therapy I do with him at home. Plus all of the normal stuff like feed them and make sure they aren't arguing, clean, healthy etc etc etc etc etc. My husband works his job and pays rent. He was expects me to keep track of all the bills too even though I can't really access the accounts bc I'm not on them. And when a bill falls behind or is late then it's stuff I'm not staying on top of. I feel like i manage such a huge amount of stuff now. Definitely way more than I did when I was ""on top of everything and getting everything done"" with one kid and a full time job. I would love to be able to only worry about working a job away from home and have free time to go after work everyday to do an activity of my choice or see friends or family. I feel like I'm trying so hard but I'm only one person and I'm trying to manage a household and 4 people on my own. And apparently I'm not doing a good enough job which makes me really mad. So, has anyone has success getting your partner to realize just how much you have to handle and manage so they can understand better and appreciate more? Bc it's pushing me to the point that I want to leave. I don't think he does it intentionally bc the way he was raised and got praise or felt good enough for his father is by how much he gets done and that's still true to this day. Is there some way I can get him to realize how much I do?

We were friendly, but never started anything romantically. I have a daughter (4F) from a previous relationship.

I was alone for quite some time and had a tinder account where I would try to meet new people. Since I work full-time and have a kid full-time, it was pretty much the only way to start 'dating' again. We, to both our surprise, matched and that evening we had the most wonderfull first date. He told me he had just gotten out of a longterm relationship where his ex cheated on him and they had tried to make it work after, but it only got worse and she did it again with the same guy. He said he was emotionally disconnected from her and ready for something new. I told him I didn't want to go to fast giving this info and that I have a kid. But we were so in love we moved a bit to fast anyways. With him expressing it just feels so right. 

Fast forward some time (half year) and we are happy, he's doing amazing with me and my daughter and for the first time in a long time I feel happy and complete. We can talk about anything and just have so much fun. He claims that me and my daughter are the best thing to ever happen in his life. 

Last weekend I downloaded tinder again just to look at the 'first messages' we sent each other (I am nostalgic like that). I open our conversation get al warm and fuzzy inside and look at his profile. I notice right away that his bio has changed to new info. A few months ago he had went on a longplanned holiday with his dad and after a few days by himself in New York (we are from Europe). And in his bio he states he would be there up until a certain date.

I confronted him and I saw his face turn white. He stated he just wanted to meet people to show him around. I asked that if that was the case, I could see the messages. He did NOT want me to and this made me even more suspicous. After going back and forth, he dowloaded the app, and showed the messages.

It were all messages asking to meet up for sex (in the most discusting ways) not to a few people but I mean... A LOT of girls like I could just keep scrolling and the same discusting message was there. I was shocked and pretty much hysterical. He held me said he was so sorry he did this to me. After a long time of me shouting at him and crying, he told me he was discusted by himself. He deleted the account and he just wanted to never do that again because afterwards he knew what a huge mistake he made. But after his ex he was so insecure about himself that he felt the need to get approval from online strangers. 

I was hurt, but after good talk I expressed that as long as he didn't actually meet up with someone I could forgive him. He stressed that he could never do that as he loves me and is so happy with me. He gave me his IPad as some sort of way for me to see he only texts friends and family and I could see for myself nothing was going on and told me to hold on to it for a while so I could see he was sincere. 

The day after I opened his Ipad and saw he had texts from a foreign number. It was a girl that texted him a month ago that she wasn't getting her period had a positive pregnancy test and that it wasn't cool that he blocked her on WhatsApp. And I read the conversation where they were stressed and afterall it was 'just a scare' and they could go on with their lives. I was so filled with hate. And told him I didn't want anything to do with him anymore.

I am broken and so hurt. I didn't notice a thing. We were so so happy and in love. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I had to get tested for SOA's since they had unprotected sex. It's just horrible. My daughter is constantly talking about him as they have such a good bound. The thing is I am more broken about that I love and miss him rather than the actual betrail. 

Yesterday he came by to talk and explain himself. I listened and understood that eventhough he is happy and loves us so much, he also felt so much pressure to do well by us and make us happy. He told me he had such a low selfasteem because of what is ex did to him. That maybe we moved to fast. 

I hear everything he says and can imagine he felt this way, but can't understand how he could do this to us.  Yet I just can't imagine ever getting over him, I have had such a rough past and was finally happy for the first time. We are SUCH a good match and he seems really sincerely broken abouth what he did. It is also so out of character for him. I've known him for so long and just still can't imagine that he of all people did this. He is the rather shy, pleasing, loving kind if person. 

I guess I just want to know how much of a fool I would be if I would at some point forgive him... I just don't want to let go of him. I love him so much it hurts to even think about it.

So me and my boyfriend of 4 years (20 and 21 respectively) live together and had just got back from going on a walk together, he wanted to go further but I was a little tired. 

Also want to preface this by saying I have ptsd from childhood abuse with a father with anger issues so I get triggered by shouting and anger.

When we got home it was 7:30 pm and he turned on his pc, put his phone down and laid on the bed waiting for his pc to start up.
 I asked him if he was gonna spend another 8 hours on the computer today gaming as he did yesterday, he said ‘no I’m wouldn’t stay up that late’, I said ‘I think that would be around 1Am so it’s possible’ then I counted realized my math was wrong ‘nevermind, 3am’. 

This is when the problems start. He said ‘whats the time now’ to try to do the calculation himself, and I told him ‘it’s okay, I was wrong, it would be 3am not 1’ he got more pissed off ‘just tell me the time’ I’ll admit I was kinda tired my brain was lagging behind so I kept saying ‘8 hours from now is 3am’ was the answer which drove him up the wall because I wasn’t giving him what he wanted. I can’t remember exactly what he said but it pissed him off that I didn’t give it to him immediately, he thinks I did it deliberately to annoy him which I didn’t. After he yelled at me for the time around 4 times my brain started working again and I told him 7:30. I believe this exchange lasted around 10-20 seconds, but he thinks it was about 5 minutes and has that as one of the reasons he got so mad about it. (If it was 5 minutes why not check his phone? Well he said he didn’t want to because I could just tell him aka too lazy)

I left for a bit and came back to see he was sitting at the computer, I look out the window and notice the plants that we have to water everyday (they’re his dads plants but it’s our shared responsibility, we live there for free)

So I asked him to water the plants as it was getting darker, his dad also asked him via messenger, he said no to both of us and said that he’d maybe do it in an hour because he was tired and lazy now, I said ‘please just water them’ he replied with ‘I did it yesterday’ I said ‘I did it 5 days in a row before yesterday, please just do it’ repeatedly asking him because I knew if I didn’t he would just forget. I probably asked 3-5 times to please do it over the span of 5 minutes whilst he ignored me scrolling through facebook and didn’t respond to me or kept saying he was lazy and tired until he snapped and started yelling at me saying I was insufferable and a nag, to which I was kinda shocked but just left to have a shower. It’s kind of a blur how much he was yelling at this point, but I know I asked him to lower his voice multiple times which he did not.

After my shower it settled in a bit more with me how much he had overreacted by yelling at me and telling me I’m insufferable (a nag, sure, I was being one) so I told him that I didn’t think his behavior was okay. I thought he’d have calmed down and second guessed his behavior, but I was wrong.

I messaged him online because I prefer it to speaking out loud, and an argument started where he repeatedly said it was my fault for making him that angry and that I should admit that I riled him up especially with the time thing (the plant thing was less important to him).  When I told him how he yelled at me, he told me he didn’t raise his voice with the intent to trigger me, so it’s not his fault, and that the abuse I suffered when I was a child wasn’t his fault. Excuses after excuses, never apologising. Saying that I was purposefully withholding information (the time) and telling me it’s wrong and invalidating for me to say he overreacted. This repeated behavior drove me to the point of uncontrollable sobbing. I told him how he made me feel and said his behavior was disgusting to me and avoided him the rest of the night.

Now I have no idea what to do. This seems like such a small, stupid thing to be so angry and defensive about. He’s had moments of heartlessness before in heated arguments but this hit different.

Here’s the backstory, we moved in together 4 years ago with his daughter and my son and daughter all now 6,6 and 9 years old. We’ve been a family and settled for quite a while, we have a business together and have blended really well. 

Last week on my birthday our kids came running into our room at like 6.30am to give me my presents on our bed as they couldn’t wait, it was so cute and they helped me unwrap everything. My boyfriend stayed on his “side” of the bed lying down under the doona the whole time and I was low key a little disappointed but then he gave me a card from him which was out of character seeing as we usually just have our kids write out a card each for us. Anyway I opened it up and there was a happy birthday message followed by a “will you marry me” question which caught me very off guard at 6.30am and without him even sitting up or showing me a ring. Our kids yelled at me to look in the envelope and sure enough there was a ring inside. I guess I wasn’t awake properly but I was really shocked and confused about it all. The thing is he never actually asked me the question or put the ring on me or anything, he just asked me and the kids if we wanted pancakes and got up and left the room. We didn’t speak about it at all after that and 5 days later he hasn’t told his family or any of our friends, I mentioned to him the ring also doesn’t fit to which he replied that I would have to have it resized as he got it the night before my birthday 5 minutes before the shop closed. I feel so ungreatful but also like this was a really horrible attempt at a proposal. It’s now been a week since that and I am really humiliated by the whole event and I don’t know how to move forward.

We have two kids together 3, and a baby and honestly we were in a better place than we'd been for a long time....

Until Sunday...

I should start by saying I know he has a crazy stressful week at work, and have known it was coming for a few months, but he seemed to be doing totally fine with it coming up.

On Sunday night, he does bedtime with our toddler while I put the baby down. I usually do both bedtimes but the timing didn't line up. He comes out of bedtime and is super frustrated that it took so long and that she stalls so much. (it was about 15 minutes past when we like to be out) He's all mad and says we have to come up with solutions to make it easier. Now I admit I was a bit flippant and said things like ""she's only 3"" ""this is better than it used to be"" ""I think youre taking it a bit too hard cause you're anxious about this week"". 

He absolutely blew up. ""Oh I guess I'm just a shitty dad then"" ""I'm fucking up then, it's all me"" to which I tried to settle him and say that's not at all what I'm saying! He's an incredible dad and a huge help here and I wouldn't want him to think I was implying that. So I pursued him, following him in the house trying to diffuse. I should say I have a history of pushing him cause I need to deal with conflict immediately and he needs space. In the past it's pushed him to get really angry. So this is what happened. He ended up breaking his computer. At which point I realize holy shit I have to walk away so I did. He proceeded to gather his stuff for work and left, I figured he was going to a hotel for the night. He ended up going to a bar and coming home to sleep in our guest room.

Anyways Monday comes, he goes to work early before I get up so I text him and say ""sorry I pursued, I shouldn't have done that as it pushed you, I love you hope you have a good day"" no response. He comes home that evening and doesn't say a word to me, literally doesn't even look at me. Plays with our toddler and tries to do bedtime with her and reconcile but she wants me. So I do it, come out and go to him and say ""hi"". He didn't even turn around to look at me, just says ""I just want to be alone tonight"". So I said ok and left to the other side of the house. 

Tuesday he goes to work before I wake up, comes home after kids are in bed because of a work event. Doesnt come to see me, goes straight to the guest room. 

This morning up early came in to grab clothes, doesn't look at me, doesn't say a word, and he's gone. Will be out later again tonight. 

What am I supposed to do here? I've already decided not to try. I texted once and tried to talk once and was shut down. I don't feel like getting rejected continually, it hurts. I feel really lonely and unimportant.

His work stress should be over tomorrow, do I just sit tight and get ignored in my own home until then? Do I leave and go to my mom's with the kids? What the hell am I supposed to do?

This move didn't have a lot of planning beforehand, but he really needed to get out of his toxic home environment and my family loves him as much as I do. Before the move, we lived about an hour and a half away from each other, so now he's quite distant from his old friend group.

My partner does have friends, from high school, his old job, and his Minecraft server, but not really anyone he can just casually do stuff with or meet up with regularly. He recently opened up to me about feeling lonely and disconnected because of this. I know we have a solid relationship and that we enjoy each other's company, but I also know he needs friendships outside of me and my family to really express himself and explore his interests. I'd try introducing him to my friends, but I'm not really in touch with anyone I went to high school with and my college friends are scattered all across the country. 

I've started looking for community classes and groups for us to try out, but I was wondering if anyone who's had some similar struggles could offer some advice? How do you make friends after a move? And just as an adult in general? How can I support my partner and help him build his community? Thank you for any and all guidance!

I recently turned 30. Our relationship has always been rocky. Constant fights and break ups but last year we decided to make it work because we didn't want to be apart. Everything was running smoothly until recently. I am not happy with him nor i want to be with him any more. I think i am not able to let go of the past arguements and the fact he has belittled me and hurt me so much in the past. I also dont think i can trust him and be vunreable with him because every time i do so he says hurtful stuff. I tried to stay hoping it will work partially because i loved him and partially because i was seeing small changes. I met someone ans everything changed. It was like a switch.
I had a severely broken nose. I am talking in pieces. Back in 2020 i tried to had it fixed but the surgeon broke it even further so i needed someone expert to fix it so it could look like a normal nose and i could breathe.
I went to a reconstructive surgeon and we immediately clicked off. I have gained a lot of medical knowledge since 2020 so i could tell he was an expert. 
I saw a man that was sweet, mellow, veryyy soft spoken and had this quiet confidence about him that is the biggest turn on for me.
He immediately pin pointed all my issues. I didnt think anything of it.
We arranged the surgery and a second meeting prior to the set date.
I went and i was firm on what i wanted and i think he understood that i knew medicine and liked it. He was letting me know every step of the way and i was explaining on what was going to happen. I also asked for a nosestril change and he said oh it cant be done. I said take a graft from my ear and do it. He looked at me surprised and smiled. 
Btw he knows i am with someone.
On the day of the surgery he was holding my hand as i was going under anesthesia and i was caressing his.
Before i was discharged he came to see me.
I asked him how broken my nose was and he replied lets not talk about it. Lets forget about it.
I told him i knew the surgery would last longer than we had anticipated (it did) but i didnt want to stress him out. He smiled and left.
The following friday i had to have my sutures removed and as he was entering the room he whispered very very silently hello my baby. I heard because i have extremely good ears.
I saw him yesterday and he told me hey little girl in a teasing way and my heart melted. He looks at me with those grey brown eyes and i crumble inside.
I have to see him next week again then next month and then three months after. After that possibly once or twice a year for some filler.
I cant get past him. I have never yearned for a man as much as i have for him. Never lusted over a man as much as him.
I tried to create even more distance between us yesterday by asking when i could pick the baby up just for him to think i have a baby but in reality i meant my godson. Nope didnt work for me. Now my heart is burning even more. 
I also told him we'd be moving to his city and he replied ih so we ll be seeing you more often and smiled.
I am not saying he feels anything he is just being professional and also knows i am with someone. 
Aside the whispered baby thing.
But this is about me. Like i said he is everything i have ever wanted in a man: sweet, humble,intelligent, confident without needing to brag and a master in his craft.

Me and my wife have been together 8 years, and had a wonderful sex life. As can happen with a wonderful sex life, we have been blessed with 3 amazing children within the ages of 1-5. So far so good.

However my wife's sex life has gone down drastically. So has mine to be fair, working a manual job and having three kids, one still a baby, means were often exhausted, but mine is still higher than hers. I can attribute this to multiple things, shes gone on the pill to avoid any more happy accidents which she feels diminished her sex drive. The aforementioned tiredness. And also I think she doesn't feel as sexy these days as she is mainly ""motherhood mode"" these.

When we do have sex, which still happens, so we're not a dead bedroom, it can still be great. Multiple orgasms for her. However, the problem, and what I guess I am looking for advice for is the other times. See my sex drive is higher than my wife's, even with me taking care of myself at times. And my wife is a wonderful woman and is willing to have sex or other things for my benefit alone. But it feels very empty.

This is in no way a post to blame her, as I say she is wonderful and I don't deserve her. I definitely don't blame her for having a lower sex drive. But at times when I put the moves on her, she will reciprocate and I think she's into it, only to find she is just getting me off. And it seems to be a silly thing to complain about, but being used to having passionate sex, it feels underwhelming and dull. 

We have talked about it, where I said its ok if she doesn't feel like sex and just let me know as I prefer her to be into it, otherwise it seems... not forced but something. But I think she feels bad and so will still go ahead.

I love to make her orgasm. I love to eat her out and play with her and listen to the sounds she makes. I don't like humping her whilst I imagine she can't wait for it to be over and go to sleep. I don't want it to be a chore.

Like I say there are still plenty of times when she is into it, so I don't think its an attraction issue because it can be just like old times, but it happens enough that I almost feel wrong after? Like almost dirty? I may just be wierd.

so i have been seeing this girl for about a year now and we have been doing long distance. we are both from canada except she is from Edmonton and i am from toronto. 

Originally when we first started talking, she knew that it wouldn’t make sense for me to move to her since my career is very specialized and i need to be in big business districts instead of the countryside where she is from. she on the other hand work in human resources so it would be easy for her to find a job anywhere. since we knew that one of us had to move to be together she was willing to make a great sacrifice for me and leave her family to be with me.

our relationship is really good and we both know and acknowledge it that we can see each other building a future together. however, after meeting my parents she feels that they are intimidating and makes her think that shes not good enough to be with me. they have never expressed this to either me or her but she thinks that they are just being cordial around her to keep the peace (keep in mind that i am staying at home with them for now and she is staying with her family in edmonton).

now i have no problem putting up a fight for my girlfriend to my parents and have done it before in the past. however, it’s hard to call them out on their toxic behaviours because they’re not doing anything directly malicious but it’s more of a feeling they give off, so i can’t really talk to them about what they’re “doing”. she said that she now feels hesitant to come because her family is so loving and she doesn’t feel like she’s loved by mine which is an issue for her, understandably. i reassured her that she is more than enough for me and that i’m living a life for myself and not my parents, plus i plan to move out soon so this wouldn’t be an issue long term. 

she also brought up the idea of me moving to her instead but i feel that if i do that i’d be abandoning my dreams, career and everything i worked so hard for when things were just starting to pick up. i’d probably have to switch professions and start from zero if i move to the countryside. 

we both talked and cried saying that our relationship is so good and we’d just be throwing something away when it’s still healthy for the most part (except my parents). i feel that if she moves here long term she’d be unhappy because she won’t have the same support system she has back home. i can’t move to her because then i would have to abandon all i’ve worked for when things have just really started to pick up for me in the city. i have brought up the idea of just letting us go due to pure incompatibility when neither of us are doing anything wrong and while we still love each other but neither of us want to let go 

anyone have any advice?

TLDR: Long distance girlfriend was supposed to move to my city. she is intimidated by my family and claims that she doesn’t feel comfortable around them. she is now having second thoughts. due to my career, i can’t move to be with her in the countryside. neither of us want this to be the end because the relationship between us is still so healthy.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563716,public,self,My LDR girlfriend (24F) is having second thoughts about moving to be with me (26M),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywud43/my_ldr_girlfriend_24f_is_having_second_thoughts/,all_ads,6,

After a week she asked me for friends with benefits and i said yes and that went on for a month until December where i totally broke up cuz finals were coming up in March and after exams I would think i said and after exams i told her i can't and we still spoke on text but nothing this time no nudes no being horny and lockdown happened and we continued texting till May and i finally broke up saying i ve to focus on my career and then she finally accepted it and started dating in August and i guess she got a boyfriend in 2021 around April and that she went to USA for one semester for 4 months in 2022 and that guy cheated on her for another girl while she was in usa and i started talking to her normally this Jan 2022 but only after midnight cuz her bf sleeps early and it was night in my country and day in USA so I used to stay awake till 3-4 am to text her but not much cuz she was with someone else and after he cheated i did this almost everyday, staying till late and checking if she's okay if she needs someone to talk to and I forgot to say this to you all i realised what i had lost only after breaking up with her and so now i wanted another chance so i was taking care of her etc and she came back and i was still texting her even when i had exams and in June i asked her out! At first she said yes and next day she said no and after a month we were still texting everyday and she asked me out and wanted an answer within a day and i said yes and we dated for 2 months and we also broke up twice in these 2 months but we got back in a day and it seemed so nice but she broke up with me saying she can't love me cuz of the abusive relationship it was before and she said the same thing for next 5 days and then she went to a club with her friends the next day and she had invited me also but i couldn't cuz my dad got sick and had to get him admitted in a hospital and she told me she kissed a guy in the club and then next day she told me she used me to get over my ex and even after a week she once she texted me saying it's weird we aren't texting or talking like she kept giving me mixed signals and now she finally answered a few questions of mine and she said she used me cuz she was bored, she wanted to hurt me too but she didnt know i would love her soo deeply this time and she's sorry and she feels trash that she did this to me! She also said she didn't even like me in these 2 months and even she doesn't know why she was with me but these 2 months i swear were so beautiful and she also asked me for my fav t shirt, we went for movies, bunked college (different colleges) and  i started torturing her since the day she broke up with me cuz i fell harder this time i kept convincing her that she could love me just like how she kept convincing me in school! But she wouldn't listen! She would be so rude and before she blocked me on i sent her a letter and a poem i wrote for her and then she blocked me cuz i kept asking her questions but guys don't i deserve some answer? Proper answer? And before blocking she also told me that i ve been torturing her a lot and she fucking hates me and she also said i tried being nice to you but you just fucking torture me and she said bye and blocked me! Now i know she didn't like and everything i ve accepted it and i also know she ain't coming back especially after that abusive relationship in school for which i apologised to her a lot of times but i still hope that she comes back cuz i love her way too much and I also know that she aint coming back!

He had a birthday a few months back and we usually take the other out for a nice dinner on their birthday. BF picked a nice place and I called and made reservations. Prior to going, BF’s dad called to wish him a happy birthday and to ask what our plans were for the day and for dinner. BF’s dad offered to pay for dinner, which I politely declined as I wanted to pay for dinner.

We had a lovely (and somewhat expensive) meal and a great time! When the check came, BF asked me the cost and looked the check over while I happily paid.

Fast forward to a week ago and I was cleaning up our shared apartment. I picked up BF’s computer and put it in his backpack (where he keeps it). When I opened his backpack, the first thing inside the large pocket was a check. I know I shouldn’t have looked at it, but I was curious as to what it was + didn’t want to squish it with his computer. 

The check was written from his dad, made out to my BF, dated the day after BF’s birthday, with the memo “birthday dinner” for the exact amount I paid for his birthday dinner (I double checked my cc statement to confirm). I flipped it over and saw that BF had cashed it online. What I’ve gathered is that BF ended up telling his dad the cost of dinner which BF’s dad then wrote him a check for without realizing that it was me who actually paid. It’s been months now and BF never told me about it, so he basically just pocketed the money without telling me.

Big disclaimer that I don’t care about the money - I’m fortunate to have a nice job and some spending money. This is more about me feeling taken advantage of by my BF. 

Context: I work full time, cover the entirety of our rent and utilities, and do most of the cleaning/work around the apartment. BF has been unemployed for 1 year+ but helps out by doing some cooking and occasionally paying for dates when we go out. BF states that looking for jobs makes him very anxious - which I am very sympathetic too as I have an anxiety disorder myself. The whole check situation has just made me start to think more about what each of us contribute to the relationship.

This is my first serious relationship and I’m just looking for some advice about what to do and whether to bring up the check with him. I feel really hurt and taken advantage of right now so I’d really like an outside perspective on what to do.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563626,public,self,My (23F) boyfriend (26M) cashed a check meant for me and didn’t tell me about it.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywtxut/my_23f_boyfriend_26m_cashed_a_check_meant_for_me/,all_ads,6,

When we had that conversation, I was clear that I needed the option to travel for work up to three days a week. That was pre-COVID, and during COVID there's been zero work travel. Now I'm being asked to interview for an amazing opportunity that would require work travel two days a week and he said he needs to give that some thought. What's the best way to have this conversation with him? My career options are very limited and I don't see myself turning this down.

My fiancé and I met in 2017. At the time I was traveling Monday through Thursday every week. I was also looking for global roles that would have required me to move, and already had been put on a few United Nations job rosters making it easy for me to get hired. He was getting ready to launch his own law practice, which is tied to our city. We agreed... 

- Come around 2023, we would be open to living in two different cities (allowing me to take a role in a city like New York or DC). But he made it clear if he couldn't commute he would not be okay with living apart. I don't want that either. 

- I would pull back from the amount of travel I was doing and keep it to three days a week absolute max on a regular basis.

The compromise put me in an odd spot. I continued to get requests to interview for global rules, and have dutifully ignored them. I've also tried to find more satisfying local options but, as I had worried about, these options really haven't materialized.

Then COVID happened. Overnight we went from me on the road four days a week to me having zero work travel. 

After an adjustment, we came to really love it. I never want to go back on the road that much again.

But... I know for me to have satisfied work in my field I'm going to need to travel some.

Now an amazing opportunity has come up. To interview for a major national role with two days of travel per week.

I loved a girl deeply whom I met 4 months ago, we met for the first time in my country, where she spent her exchange semester, she came to visit and i asked if we can meet, we met she seemed quite interested in me on the first date and she was just looking at me while i was a bit shy but we hugged and kissed each other and i booked a hotel where we spent some nights together and had sex. it was more like a dream come true for me as she was so beautiful.

She came to Germany due to her business trip and i went to her country we met continuously and we have had sex every time plus we enjoyed each and every second specially me. i bought her presents, and once flowers and always bought something for her which she likes.

Once she mentioned her therapist told her she needs a good sex, and she thanked me multiple times, things went quite far and i become very attached to her as she was sharing each and everything with me, calling me, and wanted to talk almost everyday even i was busy but i gave her all my availability and time. i thought she loved me as she was always interested to meet me as we stayed quite far but she always wanted me to take the first step, i took paid and unpaid leaves from my work just to meet her and spent time with her.

while i assumed she loves me, but it was more like FWB thing for her she told me which i got to know after some months. she sometimes said you are good friend etc. but every time we went on a date, i paid for the restraunt, grocery and even whenever she bought for herself i paid for it, i don't know probably my stupidity.

I got signs of being used sometimes but i ignored them as i loved her, eg: she asked me to book a theme park which she likes and wanted me to pay for her, until i asked should i sponsor ur ticket too, she said no no i can pay for u too as u are a good friend, and i told her no thanks we can split it.

things became worst when we met on a date 2 months ago, when we went on a restraunt and i paid there after we ate, and went a bit fast to the door, while i saw she is still sitting and i went back, which made her feel angry and mad at me, i felt sad as she misunderstood and i told her i came back for u as i didn't notice, she was a bit rude u went fast and bla bla, my fight language is just to stay silent so i don't say something wrong which might hurt her. she bought something afterwards from a store for me and i had my flight and she had a train to her city, i decided not to go with her and made a excuse on which she said f\*\*k you which made feel sad and because of what happened in restraunt and her words, and i decided to leave the apartment and she started to cry and apologized and said she says it as a joke to her friends and they dont mind while i cried for the issue of restraunt and also her words(probably it was my childish part) but it hurted me.

She used to text me almost everyday but after that she stopped to contact and was contact every 2 3 day. It made me feel anxious if something is wrong after a lot of struggles I asked what she feels for me yesterday and she responded you are a nice person and no one treated me like this u treated me like ur gf maybe in future I might get same feelings like but then she said she don’t want to give me any hope. and i deserve someone nice.

It made me feel heartbroken. I don’t know why I love her. Even after this my mind is not ready to cut off. What I should do here? I don’t know why I care so much for someone for whom I am more like a option. she sees my messages sometimes and replies after 2-3 hours which was not the case before.

I don’t know why I am holding on to her but I would be grateful if someone can advice me something It’s my first relationship and which never even existed :( and i can't even focus on my job nor my studies, i am checking her insta and fb almost everyday and thinking about her and these thoughts are making me feel depressed, i can't even have a therapy as its very hard to find it in Germany if we don't speak German :( I would be grateful for your kind advice and suggesion. as i live alone her while parents live far away from me nor i can share it with my friends.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563621,public,self,"I am lost, Please help me figure it out :( How can i get her back!",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywtvm6/i_am_lost_please_help_me_figure_it_out_how_can_i/,all_ads,6,

I don't use this platform much so I'm sorry for any mistakes I make or etiquette I don't follow on this subreddit, but this is the first place I could think to ask this question. I won't share our ages because I don't find it relevant to the story.

Over a year ago my ex and I broke up. That was a whole dramatic episode in and of itself, but it's unimportant. As the title of the post implies she is unfortunately like so many women an abuse victim. She never wanted to press any charges on anyone or pursue any legal action, but she talked about it from time to time and obviously it was something that haunted her up to then and I'm sure it still does now.

Well, it turns out her abuser decided to stalk and kidnap a woman from another country, and he's now in prison obviously on some serious charges. I heard about this about a month ago but for reasons I won't get into in this post I highly doubt she is aware of any of it. I decided to sit on the knowledge of his arrest because I wasn't certain if it is something she would want to know, or if it's appropriate that I contact her to tell her this, or if it's something she even should know. We haven't spoken in about 6 months, so I also felt like I didn't want to hit her up just to give her news, that I'm not sure if she will be happy to hear or bring out feelings she may not want to feel.

As a man and someone who has never suffered from sexual abuse I don't really know how to navigate complicated situations like this, so I thought I'd see what others have to say. Is this something I should bring up to her? I know this is pretty skimp on details but I'm trying to protect our privacy as much as possible.

Anyways I live 3+ miles away with dad from the pub and she lives near the pub.


See I don’t want to take her back to where I live because there’s this guy Iv know since infant school named Johnny who visit where I live often etc



Johnny is very smug around women and cocky too as he thinks he’s got property when he isn’t. and the majority of them love it tbh. he’s the type where me and her would be snuggled up on the couch on our phones and he’d be standing there  staring at her raging of jealousy waiting for her to see that he exists and think she’d fancy him instead type. and behind my back saying how attractive she was angrily being all like ‘how’d he get her? fuck off’ and then be around my work trying to get her attention and get an eye full etc

**admittedly he gets girls sometimes liking him and others who don’t but he thinks either  they fancy him or they don’t know he exists. There’s no inbetween . He stares at women this way walking past them on the street every time**

▪️Hers an example of Johnny: 

When we were 15 we used chat rooms for banter, I got talking to this girl miles away and showed Johnny a photo of her thinking he’d be suppprtive but no. His face turned red with rage so fast and he said ‘too nice for you her yano’ 4-5 times In a row…then he found her and started DMing her himself to sniff her off me.

▪️ also when he was 17-18 my sister had a  friend Kira who was 14. He fell madly in love with her and one night was crying drunk because she didn’t reciprocate and was at my house all the time for her so he could sniff round her. 

He’s ugly as fuck his ears are on his neck ffs but thinks he’s got stuff and special around women because his teeth are above average 



So imaging  what he’d be like over this girl Iv juts got and she’s very nice looking 



…Then a few days later I was Chatting with her when she sent me a screenshot of Johnny messaging her ‘here’s my number xxxxxx message me’ etc

This month has been tough on him, I understand why it is the case. Alongside the new job delaying his payment, his lack of productivity is frustrating him a lot - he values himself with the amount he has achieved in a given day. I am the same. 

But his home environment, the uncertainty of the new job (startup company so his roles are currently blurred) and the fact that he is a all-or-nothing person (if he spends 30 minutes on social media, his day is ruined since he finds it super hard to get back on track or focus) makes it hard for him to be satisfied with the day.

He has expressed that he has never truly felt happy. Even in the month he was pulling 16 hour days. He doesn't know what makes him happy but he knows that money will give him more freedom so that is his goal right now.

We found each other on reddit's self-improvement subreddit; we were completely anonymous for 6 months and then best friends and then, well, partners.

I’m 21 (F) he’s 24, been together 5 years.


Before I start, I just wanna say that I’m not really sure why I’m writing this. I feel like a lot of things I already know, it’s just finding the confidence to come to peace with it. Hopefully you guys can help me out. 

This relationship hasn’t been great since the start, but I’ll spare all those early details; I just want to say I was young and dumb. It’s crazy to look back on things like that, but anyway. For our whole relationship my boyfriend has only ever held down one job, this was for a lil over a year. Every other place he’s worked, it’s been a few months at most. Usually it’s his own fault, he has terrible sleep problems but won’t see a doctor. A lot of the times he just slept through work, he quit his most recent job less then a month ago and I’m panicking. I work 5 days a week, long morning hours and I get okay money; but definitely not enough to support 2 people + the cats we have. I’ve made this clear, his response is “I do help, you use my credit card” he has maxed out credit cards. They once had good value, and now he pays what he can on them. Which leaves around $50-$100, so picture that as how much he chips in for every 2 weeks. Everything else I’m doing, I buy us food,weed, litter/food for our animals , I do our laundry, I clean little shit around the room. Basically, I do everything and always have. 

Since he quit his job, he’s been doing the same usual routine of sleeping the day away/playing video games. I got really fed up because I’m currently recovering from pneumonia, and he wasn’t helping me at all. This is something we’ve fought about before, and it always stays the same. Sometimes he’ll get better for a week, but go right back to the same patterns. He tells me he’s depressed, but won’t get help and also ignores my own mental health. I can’t even afford time off because of his lack of work/will to do anything. 

I feel like his mother, it’s built so much resentment for me in this relationship. I’m not in love like I was before, I just feel like someone’s maid. I plan to talk to him about this again later today, I don’t have many more chances to give him.

Should I just give up, and find someone who actually wants to be involved/help? I’ve known him since I was 15, so I guess change is just scaring me.

Male aged 24 and work in a pub and long story short I seeing a girl who shown heavy interest in me suprisingly


Anyways I live 3+ miles away with dad from the pub and she lives near the pub.


See I don’t want to take her back to where I live because there’s this guy Iv know since infant school named Johnny who visit where I live often etc



Johnny is very smug around women and cocky too as he thinks he’s got property when he isn’t. and the majority of them love it tbh. he’s the type where me and her would be snuggled up on the couch on our phones and he’d be standing there  staring at her raging of jealousy waiting for her to see that he exists and think she’d fancy him instead type. and behind my back saying how attractive she was angrily being all like ‘how’d he get her? fuck off’ and then be around my work trying to get her attention and get an eye full etc

**admittedly he gets girls sometimes liking him and others who don’t but he thinks either  they fancy him or they don’t know he exists. There’s no inbetween . He stares at women this way walking past them on the street every time**

▪️Hers an example of Johnny: 

When we were 15 we used chat rooms for banter, I got talking to this girl miles away and showed Johnny a photo of her thinking he’d be suppprtive but no. His face turned red with rage so fast and he said ‘too nice for you her yano’ 4-5 times In a row…then he found her and started DMing her himself to sniff her off me.

▪️ also when he was 17-18 my sister had a  friend Kira who was 14. He fell madly in love with her and one night was crying drunk because she didn’t reciprocate and was at my house all the time for her so he could sniff round her. 

He’s ugly as fuck but thinks he’s got stuff and special around women because his teeth are above average 



So imaging  what he’d be like over this girl Iv juts got and she’s very nice looking 



…Then a few days later I was Chatting with her when she sent me a screenshot of Johnny messaging her ‘here’s my number xxxxxx message me’ etc

(i know i sound like a shit person but please give me advice on what i should do i really wanna make things better i really miss him and tbh being with him made me so happy and it made me wanna try harder every single day to became a better person) 

Anyways, me and him (lets call him Robbie) are not on speaking terms right now for almost 3 weeks. Robbie and I have been together for about 8 months now, and for the past 8 months we literally almost talked everyday. My mum even knows about him, they talked on the phone together before so it's kind of a big deal (I've never introduced any boy to my mother before). Robbie is literally the sweetest, he would send me photos when his out, he was literally talking to me every minute when he was on vacation and when he couldn't talk he would give me resource as to why. Whenever we would get into an argument he would tell me that his going to sleep (time difference) then 10 minutes later he would send me a paragraph saying how much he loves me. This boy would literally compliments me every chance he gets, but whenever he would compliment me I would always reply back with ""how many girls have you said that too"" or ""you're properly saying that to other girls"" ik an ass move of me and I know he doesn't like it when I say those stuff but idk why I kept saying it.

This is how everything went down, I was on a call with him that morning and he said that he had to go, but before we hanged up my ass was like ""yeah go talk your other hoes"", after we hanged up a few minutes later he sent me a paragraph telling me how he only wants me and that he loves him and that I make him happy, he also said that that I have to stop with the hoes thing cause it was annoying, so i apologised to him right away he said 'I love you' to me then left me on delivered for 2 hours and when he came back he was like ""you should leave me"" and I asked him that if he wanted me to then he said 'no he didn't want to' we kept going back and fourth until we finally resolved it, the next day we were talking but it felt off and I thought he needed space so I decided to give him a break I left him on delivered for 2 days and while I was away he sent me an 'I miss you' message but when I texted him back I lied to him telling him that my mum took my phone but he was acting super dry so I thought he needed more space so I told him my mum is gonna take my phone again and it was obvious that it was a lie I texted him again 4 days later telling him the truth on why I left him on deliver and he was still dry so I asked him if he had lost feelings and he responded back with ""idk most likely"" I kept trying to talk it out with him but he either responded back with 'idk"" or the shrug emoji so I sent him a paragraph telling him that I didn't wanna give up on him and that I'll keep fighting for him and that lets really think this through he saved the message and left it on open so now I don't know what to do help me please reddit I really love this boy and talking to other people doesn't feel right, I would rather try with him hundreds of times then starting it new with someone else",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563443,public,self,please help I don't know what to do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywt5wc/please_help_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,all_ads,6,

I(30f) and Bee(28f) have eight years of a very solid friendship behind us. 4 years ago, I introduced her to Matt(27m). His role in this story is kinda minor, but is important. Bee is family.  I used to think we had good boundaries and communicated well enough our needs and wants, without judgment and very accepting of each other, we were there for each other through thick and thin, and we would never let petty stuff between us... but things have changed this last year.  Between us, she is the type to offer practical help. Like, lending money when needed, finding practical solutions for situations, planning... but she is a complete absolute emocional brick wall, the type who freezes and panics if someone cries in front of her. I’m always the one doing the advice and emotional work,  bc she seriously can be emotionally stunted, and I do understand why.  


This year I made it to 30 in august, so I decided I wanted to celebrate, despite hating parties and bithdays in general. I invited my friends very casually to go to a bar and drink. Bee decided last minute she wanted to make it big and warned me there would be a surprise. She is a self-declared ""megalomaniac"", and i'm used to these kind of antics, so I just said ok. Turns out she talked to my friends and family and raised money to hire a ""Love's Madness"".  


It's a brazilian thing. Basically an ""MC"" in a car with a booming sound system that declaim a message in homage of your loved ones and plays music obnoxiously loud. You can hear it blocks away. There is fireworks, there is champagne and it's very very corny. It's very public, very embarassing, flat out humiliating to some people. Matt was one of the friends that refused to contribute bc he thought it was humiliating and was afraid it would be pushing my boundaries. Yes, I was very mortified but I took it like a champ despite my social anxiety and the sheer crowd from the bar looking and the 4 cameras pointed at me and my family mockery in the aftermath, bc I knew she meant well, and she promised me I could retaliate. She said my real gift would be permission to prank her in her own birthday.  


So i started planning immediately after. In part bc I know she likes this half-hearted competitions, in part bc I wanted to make her birthday as special as she tried to make mine. I decided to hire her a stripper bc it's something she would love, and I warned her I was ready to put my plans into motion. She was born near halloween and I pitched the idea of giving her a halloween party, bc we both love to dress up, and we needed privacy for the stripper thing right? I made a pinterest folder that she and other close friends could edit so we could pitch ideas together and she could also be in control of the aesthetic, food decoration, etc. Everything was put under her consideration, except the main event, the stripper which was a secret.   


But the plans were not smooth gliding, bc every week she would change her mind about something or create a problem out of thin air. First she wanted a house party. Then she didn't want house party no more, bc she didn't want to clean up after - something I, and the other friends involved would never let her do, bc it's her birthday and we would do ourselves. Then suddenly her neighbors were cops and she was worried they would take issue with a loud party. It didn't made sense why she was lying like that when I knew her neighbours are not cops. Everyday another bump in the road. I was bending over backwards to accomodate every change and still do something. And one day at the end of september, she said in one of our many groupchats that there would be NO halloween party in her house, we had to find some other place for it. Dry and flat like that. Like we just using her house as a venue for OUR party, instead of planning HER a birthday party. We already ordered some stuff at the point she finally decided our ideas weren't good enough, and I was frankly pissed, but I still went on trying to ask her what she wants and Bee says she does not know and I decide to plan something small when it's closer. Less than a week later she sends me a random pin and says: ""look how fancy my birthday this year will be"". Yes, fellas, she was planning her birthday party on her own after leaving me and other friends involved run in circles without saying anything. It hurt like a motherfucker, ngl. I fucking hate planning anything bc of my executive dysfunction. i feel bad, insufficient and incompetent the whole time. I get anxious. Talking on the phone with suppliers makes me itch. I hate parties. I was the first person in her life to bother throwing her not only one, but two surprise parties, and i was willing to do it again bc I love her... I guess I was doing it wrong somehow.  
I really should've know better bc she is a control freak, and I know this since day one when we were interns together. Every event or project she planned and dragged me into, she had to be in full charge and I would be her yes man. I'm not a competitive person. Acts of service and words of affirmation are my LL, so is not very hard to let her have her way when it's not hurting me. I can be very  stubborn and uncompromising too, but when I love someone it's easy to let go of my ways.  


But this one got the cake. We ran in circles finding solutions to her party and she was pretending like it had nothing to do with her. And I told her that. Bee then just said she didn't want a halloween party for her birthday and I asked why she didn't say anything from the beggining and she just swerved like she always does when conflict arrives.  So I knew that was a lost fight. I fought myself to move on from my anger bc I knew it was useless holding onto it, but i decided I would not move a finger to give her a proper birthday party this year bc: self-respect and I thought I was respecting her unspoken boundaries too. Need to be in control? Be my guest! The ""revenge game"" could wait. We moved on, we were okay and she again roped me into her plans: a very small dinner party to the birthday of Matt in september, who after a lot of pressure from Bee, reluctantly accepted. He also don't like birthdays and is deeply anxious and Bee reeeeally pestered him so he could go diner in her house. He was depressed and not in a good mood and I didn't take personally bc I know he struggles with aging. Idk if Bee realized it.   


Fast foward a week away from her actual birthday in october. Bee decides she wanna travel with her distant family in the weekend of the birthday itself, and wants to antecipate the ""party"", she was planning: just drinks at a bar close to her house. She warns me and Matt just the day before and expects us to be there.  


Mind you, she lives in another town. I have to traverse my whole city to get there. More than 2 hours to get there on shitty and dangerous public transportation. Uber costs a small fortune. Just getting out of the house and getting into public transportation lately is hard for me,  dealing with ptsd from the city's sheer violence, even more when it's going out at night, and i had no money for ubering 30km. Usually we meet halfway, like on my own birthday. She knows that me and specially Matt are severely anxious, and last minute plans are a imediate no to us.  I seriously need time to mentally prepare and build defenses and she knows that. Worse of all, the day she chose was an awful day for me. I just had started exercising the day before after years in sedentarism so I was dog-tired and sore, I spent the day itself of the party running errands downtown under 37°C scorching sun, and helping my aunts till nightfall, and I was communicating with her and Matt the whole time. She knew i had a busy and exhausting day and in short I couldn't make it to the other side of the town just to get drunk. She decided last minute; i was planning for weeks finally buying my new glasses, and could not delay bc the ones I had were literally falling apart and I need them to see.  


Like I said, in 8 years of relationship, we communicated very well despite one of us having such a big problem speaking up. She was always able to stablish healthy boundaries, she knows the difference between wanting and needing, and we flaked each other before, both with good reason and no good reason, but in each case we always made an effort to be compassionate and understanding if the other couldn't honor a commitment.  She watched me deal with demanding, abusive relationships, and she knows how I'm deadly afraid of not being enough for the people in my life, so every invitation was always colored with ""i understand if you can't make it"". It went both ways, and I assumed, despite being her birthday, it would be the same. On God, if she had such a tiring day I would not be mad she flaked my party. Neither would Matt. She outright said she understood that we couldn't go.  


But in the end she was pissed. She gave me THE silent treatment. At first I didn't notice bc it's normal we go a few days without talking, and she was still sending memes regularly to our group chats. But then her birthday finally rolled around on the 10/21 and I messaged her early in the day to congratulate her and ask her to get some beers at the mall after work. She refused very drily, saying she didn't felt like it. Later that night I asked her why she was mad at me and she just didn't respond. 10 min after I sent her the message she posted an ig story.... she was out drinking with another mutual friend. That was the first time she made me cry in eight years. I recognized immediately the oblique way of her of sending a message, bc I saw her do it with everyone who made her angry before. I felt so rejected in so many ways and guilty for something that was out of my control. Bee ignored my messages till the next day when she finally admitted she was mad about her birthday, but she didn't want to talk about it. I acknowledge her feelings, apologize for not making it and say and we should talk, but knowing her as I do, i understand she needs to take time to process and btw she was going on a short trip. I understood that wasn't the right timing for a talk and told bee ""take your time"".   


She understood the ""take your time"" as permission to keep the silent treatment. It lasted 21 whole days. I was eating myself out the whole time. We never went this long mad at each other. We never had a fight like this. Everytime she fucked up - bc she did fucked up in different ways and flaked a lot worse than this, for way less good reasons, I was very direct and open about how i was feeling and it helped disperse the tension between us faster.  


Bee is the type of girl that keeps silent and hold grudges, tho. She gets hurt, offended or umconfortable for the smallest, most subtle things and never EVER speaks up until it piles up and she explodes for something even more stupid and small. We talked a lot about it in these 8 years, relating to her family trauma and the stuff she still swallows until she can hold no more. I'm always advising her to speak up, and her therapist does the same.... but it's useless. This is so reccuring that we have inside jokes about it. She always said I was the only person in her life that she was completely open...  and she used to stablish her boundaries manage her expectations easily enough with me before, and I always respected it. I honestly don't know what changed and she was refusing to tell me.   


Then 4 days ago she sent a short and vague message in one of our group chats (just me, matt and bee) right in the middle of my work shift, making wild, wild accusations with the slightest veener of ""understanding"". Saying she was hurt by me and matt not attending her birthday and how it triggered some ""memories and feelings"" in her, but she tried to understand we were ""out of money""and ""not in the mood"". She said she wouldn't elaborate more bc ""she didn't want to stir up rancour"" but the fact that we didn't go to her party made some feelings she pushed down emerge: feelings that she wasn't important to us, and all our stuff and events are a priority, but not hers. That we didn't let her listen to the music she wants when we're together (????????) and other wack ass bullshit, that she feels like a third wheel bc ""we have so much more affinity with each other than with her"" (???????). She said she felt judged lately. She said she felt like we don't give two shits about her, and reading this hurt like a motherfucker.  She ended this message saying she didn't have any solution, and she didn't want to talk anymore right now about it bc ""it hurt too much"", but she still loved us.  


It felt fucking unfair. I spent the whole day on edge and I wrote a beast of a message to her adressing her accusations point by point, beginning with ""if you don't want to talk rn, why did you send this?? just to accuse us, make us feel like shit and keep the last word?"". I spent the whole day going crazy about it and  chose my words very carefully to avoid more hurt, but was very honest too and called her on her bullshit.  I poured everything festering inside me because of her silence. Again I acknowledged her feelings, apologized for making her feel the way we made her feel and adressed what I thought I did wrong - because she does not want to adress it herself so I have to keep guessing what exactly was my mistake and the real reason she is mad at me. I told her the only solution is talking. That she needed to adress at least some of ""thousand small moments"" she felt underappreciated if she wants to keep this friendship going bc I'm not risking hurting her again unknowingly nor walking on eggshells around her to perceive her every unspoken discomfort. That she already knows I'm more than willing to accomodate her needs better, but she gotta voice them first. If not with me bc I'm ""judgy"" and harsh, at least talk to her therapist bc pilling stuff up and blowing up later wasn't going to cut anymore. She just said she would read when she was home, and never answered. I know she is alive bc she still post on social media, send memes regularly on our group chats at instagram and likes my tweets, like nothing happened. Yesterday was our biweekly RPG meeting, and she didn't show up.   


The point is Matt, Bee and me have very different relationships, and honestly, she means A LOT more to me than Matt. Even Matt acknowledges her role in my life is much more important. What the fuck she is jealous of??? Matt is a very no nonsense person, so he saw the bullshit a mile away and just ignored her. I introduced them some 4 years ago, and he was more pissed that she was accusing me of being neglectful than being accused of neglect himself. He said she was being unfair to me and that he never saw me being inconsiderate to her, but I easily absorbe blame, and now I find hard to believe. We talked a lot and he thinks she is just sabotaging her few close relationships like we noticed her doing when she is interested in some guy - which I know she is.  The part she says we didn't let her listen to the music she wants got me fucking tripping. I have no words. I literally have a chromecast anyone in my house can link to and choose whatever the fuck they want to listen. We never talked bad about her music taste, and we always ask what music she wants to hear. And more important we always made the space to tell our needs, whatever it may be, small or essential. On God, it does not sound like her or these last 8 years of friendship at all.   


In the whirlwind of my own hurt, I know these last years were not kind to my friend so I'm trying to be compassionate. 2021 was a rough one. Her semi-estranged father died of cancer and her aunt who pratically raised her was diagnosed with something that could become a cancer too. Bee was sick a lot bc she doesn't seem to know better than somatizing all her stress into her body. We were both in the same job that used to be very toxic... And she decided that it wasn’t enough of a shitty situation and got roped in affair with a married coworker with two small children. I warned her multiples times how he was just playing her, but she fell hard. Whole thing didn’t take more than 2 months to go down in flames, and I had to be there to catch her, obviously. She changed jobs not long after. When she was hanging out with this guy, she distanced herself and I felt isolated and alone at this new workspace. She only looked for me to vent about him, flaked a lot for no other reason than wanting to see him and getting drunk off her mind to forget her life and she was plain inconsiderate towards both me and matt multiple times. I went literally worried sick with helplessness this whole year watching her self destruct with alcohol and bad relationship choices, trying to listen to her and talk her out of the self sabotaging...   
When she is finally over it, going to therapy as I urge her for years....... she fucks another commited guy, this time a co player in our RPG party who used her as a rebound after fighting his  fiancé of 10 years. And if i talk to her plainly how she is just hurting and sabotaging herself, not even going into the morality territory of adultery, I'm ""judgy"" and making ""acid remarks"".   


My compassion is running out, on god. Reminiscing about all the times we were there for each other and reading her saying I didn't give two shits about her... it broke me and it made me angry. She used to be my most reliable friend, but now everytime she appears on my dm's is about stupid ass drama bc she can't seem to find interest in a man who is not married or engaged, nor can keep it in her pants within our friend circle. Homegirl is pushing 30 and she still thinks fucking someone already commited to someone else or fresh out of a relationship is going to take her anywhere but heartbreakland.  
   
I'm getting tired of being constantly on edge about her, and I can already see the effects in my mental health, my sleep routine, my work. The sheer willpower I have to use to distract myself from the intrusive thoughts that came with this situation and not spiral with anxiety is becoming too much. This shit is traumatic to me and she knows it. I can't stand anymore and I don't know if she cares. My life is finally getting on track after years of struggling in every area and she is throwing my hard earned peace into garbage with her silent treatment, her resentment and her bullshit choices. I think of cutting her off, bc that's what I do with people who don't understand my boundaries, and direct comunication is the main one, but damn, i love her. I don't want to cut her off.   


There is a lot of stuff and situations I left out, but this is the gist. What the fuck do I do??? Do I insist with her to talk about the things she accused me of doing? Do I wait for her to speak up despite the wreck my emotional state is? Please help ;\_;  


TL;DR:   My best friend of 8 years is getting caught up in petty shit like friendship jealousy, not attending her bday party even when it was last minute planning and I couldn't possibly go, and keeping score of things we do to each other - all things she NEVER did before. When she is bothered by something, she does not say or indicate anything she is feeling and I just know something is wrong because she punishes me with silence and waits for me to figure out. When I try to fix it, she flat out refuses to talk and solve things bc ""she is hurting too much rn"". it's messing me up real bad.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563439,public,self,My(f30) best friend(28f) of 8 years is getting caught up in petty stuff we never used to care about before and giving me silent treatment over a missed birthday party,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywt5jj/myf30_best_friend28f_of_8_years_is_getting_caught/,all_ads,6,

I loved a girl deeply whom I met 4 months ago, we met for the first time in my country, where she spent her exchange semester, she came to visit and i asked if we can meet, we met she seemed quite interested in me on the first date and she was just looking at me while i was a bit shy but we hugged and kissed each other and i booked a hotel where we spent some nights together and had sex. it was more like a dream come true for me as she was so beautiful.

She came to Germany due to her business trip and i went to her country we met continuously and we have had sex every time plus we enjoyed each and every second specially me. i bought her presents, and once flowers and always bought something for her which she likes.

Once she mentioned her therapist told her she needs a good sex, and she thanked me multiple times, things went quite far and i become very attached to her as she was sharing each and everything with me, calling me, and wanted to talk almost everyday even i was busy but i gave her all my availability and time. i thought she loved me as she was always interested to meet me as we stayed quite far but she always wanted me to take the first step, i took paid and unpaid leaves from my work just to meet her and spent time with her.

while i assumed she loves me, but it was more like FWB thing for her she told me which i got to know after some months. she sometimes said you are good friend etc. but every time we went on a date, i paid for the restraunt, grocery and even whenever she bought for herself i paid for it, i don't know probably my stupidity.

I got signs of being used sometimes but i ignored them as i loved her, eg: she asked me to book a theme park which she likes and wanted me to pay for her, until i asked should i sponsor ur ticket too, she said no no i can pay for u too as u are a good friend, and i told her no thanks we can split it.

things became worst when we met on a date 2 months ago, when we went on a restraunt and i paid there after we ate, and went a bit fast to the door, while i saw she is still sitting and i went back, which made her feel angry and mad at me, i felt sad as she misunderstood and i told her i came back for u as i didn't notice, she was a bit rude u went fast and bla bla, my fight language is just to stay silent so i don't say something wrong which might hurt her. she bought something afterwards from a store for me and i had my flight and she had a train to her city, i decided not to go with her and made a excuse on which she said f\*\*k you which made feel sad and because of what happened in restraunt and her words, and i decided to leave the apartment and she started to cry and apologized and said she says it as a joke to her friends and they dont mind while i cried for the issue of restraunt and also her words(probably it was my childish part) but it hurted me.

She used to text me almost everyday but after that she stopped to contact and was contact every 2 3 day. It made me feel anxious if something is wrong after a lot of struggles I asked what she feels for me yesterday and she responded you are a nice person and no one treated me like this u treated me like ur gf maybe in future I might get same feelings like but then she said she don’t want to give me any hope. and i deserve someone nice.

It made me feel heartbroken. I don’t know why I love her. Even after this my mind is not ready to cut off. What I should do here? I don’t know why I care so much for someone for whom I am more like a option. she sees my messages sometimes and replies after 2-3 hours which was not the case before.

I don’t know why I am holding on to her but I would be grateful if someone can advice me something It’s my first relationship and which never even existed :( and i can't even focus on my job nor my studies, i am checking her insta and fb almost everyday and thinking about her and these thoughts are making me feel depressed, i can't even have a therapy as its very hard to find it in Germany if we don't speak German :( I would be grateful for your kind advice and suggesion. as i live alone her while parents live far away from me nor i can share it with my friends.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7563435,public,self,Did i make a mistake? :( Please respond as i am not feeling good.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ywt55q/did_i_make_a_mistake_please_respond_as_i_am_not/,all_ads,6,

We connect on a deeply emotional level and I really enjoy his company. The only problem I have is his expectation of me to figure out what he wants without him having to say it. 

He's a very thoughtful and caring person, the kind that would go out of their way to observe your likes and dislikes and silently do things according to them. He expects me to do the same thing for him which is just not possible. I'm not that type of socially savvy person who can observe people and read their body language...etc I'm more blunt and if I want to know something about someone, I tend to just ask and take their answer at face value. 

What prompted me to reach out for advice is what happened yesterday night. I got hungry and wanted to cook a light snack so I asked him whether he also wanted something to eat and he said no. So I only cooked for myself and sat down to eat. 

When I was just about finished eating, my bf comes into the kitchen and asks me in shock, ""you didn't leave anything for me?!"" I was like ""...no, I'm sorry I thought you didn't want to"" and he said that he knew he said he didn't want to but he didn't expect me not to even offer a bite after I've cooked the food as the smell spread throughout the house. 

He said that I just couldn't be bothered to care, that I was acting dumb, and that my blunt character isn't an excuse for my neglect. I apologized to him but he said I always say sorry but then nothing changes and he just went on and on until all i wanted was to be out of that kitchen. 

Any ideas how to solve this problem between us? What sort of compromise can we come to? Maybe I can show my care towards him in other direct ways?

We’ve been dating for 8 months. He’s generally a very insecure guy, and I know that when someone doesn’t love themselves, it increases the odds that they will cheat as they seek validation from multiple people in order to feel better about themselves. 

—DETAILS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP-
To put things in perspective, my boyfriend is a very kind, attentive guy. He loves me, and he shows me that he loves me every day just by doing little things. He’ll come home after working a long 10hr day on random days, and I’ve found that he’s bought me a little stuffed animal, the ones I think are so cute, just because. He’s caring every day; for example, if I’m preparing to take a bag of trash outside to the big garbage can at night, he’ll tell me to leave it for him to take because it’s too cold and dark for me to be going out there by myself. I started studying for a major graduate school exam and he bought me all of my study material, pens, paper, markers, binders that I needed for my  studies, in an effort to support me. I support him in his fitness goals, and in his quirky hobbies, extensively. I pack his lunch for him daily for work. I attend weekly 5 hour MTG card gaming sessions with him to support his hobbies. He’s also really into online reality gaming, so I’ve played some online games with him. We both do a lot to show that we care for each other. 

—-THE CHEATING PART—

Anyways, while on his phone buying some work shoes for him from Amazon. When I went to type the Amazon website address into google, I accidentally clicked a different, previously searched link for a website called All Things Worn. This website is primarily geared for men or women to interact with women/ men online in a sexual manner, and it usually involves satisfying a sexual kink. The link took me directly to a messaging page where I saw that he’d been Sexting attractive women during the duration of our relationship and years previous to when we started dating.

I had no idea, but not only that I then found out he’s been having late night video chats, and snap chatting girls that are his Facebook friends that he’s met online, whom he calls “friends”. He’s never mentioned these female friends before, and when I asked if their friendship has always been platonic, he said “yes” and from the nudes I saw that were sent before we started dating, I determined that that was a lie. It’s all very fishy and obviously he’s been unfaithful, and I want no part of it.  

However, I’ve already purchased a 60$ watch for him for Christmas, and he’s decided to get me an iPad Pro for Christmas that I can use for my studies. I know it’s toxic, but should I wait until I get the iPad for Christmas and then break up with him a couple weeks later 🤪😇?
