Just myself and my thoughts, staring at the table without actually seeing. My mind flipping through my life, feeling like it may crush me someday. 

 Feeling rundown, and exhausted. Feeling like a failure in my life, like I'm failing my wife. I upset her again last night. Falling asleep while trying to spend what few precious hours a day we have free together. 

 She says she feels it's her, that I must not care about her anymore,  that I don't find her attractive anymore. But that's not what it is. I've been burning the candle at both ends, pushing myself as far as I can, on little sleep, maybe 4 hrs tops a night. Just so I can keep the bills paid , working as much as I can around childcare schedules.  Trying to get ahead, but at best maintaining our life. I feel like I'm barely hanging on. All to have it impact her, and make her feel neglected. 

I'm stuck, and screwed. If I stop getting the extra work, and spend more time at home, I won't be able to pay our bills. If I keep working like I've been, I may lose my wife. I've cut everything to the bone expense wise I can , without affecting her and my stepdaughter.

    I go without, I don't spend time or money on me, and it feels like it's for nothing. Like no matter what I do, I'm going to lose. Either I'm going to lose my wife, or the life we have together.  I'm burning out, and don't see a way out... and it's crushing me inside.  But I try not to let it show, try to keep doing the things I can to show I care.. but that one night I fall asleep, it's all for naught.  She's right back to hurt, and confused. 

 I sit and wonder, my father that I hated, for good reasons. I know he was many things. That not all of him was bad... that there was some good in him. That unfortunately the bad often won, the abuse of my mom, his cheating, all things I couldn't look past in him. But I remember how many times I came home in the wee hours of the morning, to find him sitting at the table, looking through it instead of at it. His end of day from from his one job... were these  thoughts I have, why he sat and stared into space. Was he sitting there feeling crushed by responsibility and life..

I will never know.. he's been gone over 20 years, killed in an accident. Pushing hard to make a life for his family. I can't help but wonder, did he welcome death? Was it a relief to finally have it all be over, to let go of the stress and struggle. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, maybe fatalistic? Like I'm not seeking out death, but if it comes for me, I won't run from it, or try to fight it.

  Somedays it feels like maybe that would be the better outcome. To pass away before I can let my family down. They'd be well provided for, I've made sure of that. Close to 500k in life insurance through my job. All these thoughts just jumble together, bouncing in my head as I sit there, staring through the table. Steeling myself for the day to come... 

   Is it just me? Am I the only one with these thoughts? Who then puts on the fake face and continues to try? 

  When I open up and try to explain these feelings, people seem to feel I'm pushing blame to them, and I'm not. Just trying to say what I'm feeling .

I (22F) have a crush on this guy I used to go to high school with (22M). we recently started talking more as a while ago we both got out of relationships. 

I told him I’d like to talk more, he said he would like to as well. I am 99% sure he is romantically interested in me (my friends and those that know him think he does. I just always doubt and can’t take a hint!) and I want to talk everyday.

he’s a medical student and isn’t on his phone a ton, so doesn’t start conversations as much as I do. I’ve texted him first this month a few times and we talk (wonderful conversations about our beliefs and future goals, he is always incredibly sweet, compliments me a lot and he wants to listen to what I have to say) and then I don’t hear from him for a couple days. I don’t want to wait and wait to hear from him, I want to talk everyday but I don’t want to seem too attached or clingy. especially because this is new, and, to be honest… he’s sortof “out of my league”.

I guess what I’m wondering is, should I just text him ? are we too old to be playing games/worrying about things like that ? should I potentially hold off to see if he wants to talk to me and avoid hurt feelings ?

I work three jobs, today was an especially hard one because one job decided to have tons of meetings. I do 7-8 hours of work, and then have to cook dinner. Then he was mad because I didn't fully clean the kitchen from last night's dinner. Then he yelled at me because he asked what was for dinner and I went on my phone to check the recipe, and he had asked another question and I didn't respond within 5 seconds, because I was distracted trying to find the answer to his first question. This is during my work hours and I had also just had a slack ping. He yelled at me for constantly ignoring him. Whenever he asks me to do something, even during work hours, I have to drop immediately whatever it is and answer him or do what he asks. I do do this 90% of the time. Or I get yelled at. I feel like I'm being abused and he's my j4. I want to quit but I'll be lonley.

Today he slept til 4pm. It's a relief tbh because I know he's not going to be awake, storming around, demanding things from me. I've told him before, listen I have to work I'm really sorry  And he will go ""I need your attention right now this is important."" Once he's done with dinner he just leaves the room. He doesn't have a job, he hasn't had a steady job. I pay him money to do stuff around the house but most of the time it doesn't get done..quickly. He has good days and bad days. He's depressed and I blame myself. I took two weeks off last month for his birthday...it's not like I don't care about us. If I sleep In the second bedroom, it's s big thing, he starts a fight - but if he does then nothing is said. 


I have borderline personality disorder, quite low self esteem, yes I do make £300k++ a year, have a decent home, a nice car yet I cry myself to sleep over the way I'm treated. I have always picked men that treat me badly. I'm supposed to marry this guy. His anger, it's my fault - I need to do better and I do. I work all the time so I don't have to think about it. About my flaws.

He claims I never show him love...I do just through money and dinners, giving him a place to live. But yes we only have sex once a week and I don't go out of my way to cuddle. I'm not really lovy dovy. He says couples should have sex 3-4 times a day. I don't know, maybe some couples, but I'm not super driven by sex. But I am sometimes!! It's just not a daily constant thing...he says I need to show him more love. I'm sorry this is a rant. Money doesn't buy happiness.

However, I am questioning whether them being in a relationship is the best thing for them at the moment. This is because we don't really talk much (usually 20-25 minutes out of the whole day total purely over text). From what I can gather they're currently stressed from college and work. We live almost 2 hours away so we can't see each other whenever we please.

I said before that we've been together a month, and that period has given me the time to think about it. I don't wanna hurt them because we get on really well and have a lot of common interests, but I'm not sure whether I'd be better off as their close friend, be it temporarily or permanently. 

I should mention that I like to be quite active in a relationship, i.e. I like to talk lots and be involved with the other person's life. So I'm wondering how staying together will affect both of us. I feel like if I decided to reduce the romantic status down to friendship now then it wouldn't hurt either of us because it's only been a month however I'm just not sure whether that's the right thing to do.

we agreed to split the holidays (thanksgiving with mine, christmas with his), but now they’re going out of state for xmas and i’m not invited “because we aren’t married.” and of course his mother arranged thanksgiving out of town for the weekend, so that technically he will be “with my family” for the holiday but will immediately spend that weekend with his family. i just moved 4 hours across the state to be with this man. my mother is at end stage kidney failure. 

his family is calling me a gold digger for taking time off work to care for my family and myself while also taking classes to begin a new career as a teacher. i’ve been lending their son money for 5 out of the six years we’ve been together so that he could pursue his passions while i have cared for my dying family and have worked in an industry involving heavy labor for 50+ hours per week. now that it’s his turn to put in the extra hours and provide more, i’m the villain. 

i spent all day in hospital watching my mom get chemo today. he went out of town with his cousins for his birthday and apparently i’m “holding him back by not prioritizing him/them.” (-his mother)

i didn’t have time to make him homemade birthday sweets because my mom has f***ing cancer. i hate these people. 

i know i have to leave. just sucks ass after over half a decade of commitment and literally just bending over backwards to make sure everyone else is comfortable and happy. 

i’m pregnant. 5 weeks. he doesn’t know because his parents have been dragging him all over the country. this is my last chance to have a child and i just want to go back home to raise this child alone. i’ve pretty much given up on him because he’s totally enmeshed with his parents and i don’t even really care anymore. i have a condition that has made me essentially infertile so this baby is a miracle and i had a picture from a surprise ultrasound to give him because i was so shocked and excited. but he won’t even text me back?

is there any way to salvage this? like…any way? 

is it entrapment if i want to keep this pregnancy but don’t expect him to be a part of it? i don’t want his money. don’t need it. i’m just so happy i got pregnant when it was almost impossible, and i come from a single parent family so i’m not overly concerned about the baby not having a father because i was actually taking precautions to not become pregnant due to concerns over my partner’s toxic family.

I've been with this girl for somewhere around 2 yrs, neither of us really keep track or even really know our ""anniversary."" She's great, cares about me, let me move in with my son (10 at the time, but now a VERY teenaged boy) deals with my character defects, and lots of other great positives. BUT... She's almost 40, no kids, doesn't really want kids, always has issues with my son and his lifestyle/demeanor, hates my mom, isolates me from my family and relies way too heavily on me to keep up the household. 

On the flip side, I am very nearly obligated to hear ev-er-y single detail about every day at work, every conversation with anyone, interactions with co-workers, family, friends, etc. She definitely values her relationship with her family over my relationship with mine, which I've poorly advocated against. My family is great, and means well, but they approach situations differently... She's on the phone for several hours every day with her mom, yet I'm chastised for replying to my mom's text messages...

They say the grass is always greener, and I've been noticing some green grass growing with a co-worker. She's smart, funny, attractive, and I literally can't stop thinking about her. I don't know if I've ever felt that way about my current girlfriend.. I know she's smart, funny, attractive in a different way, but I'm not crazy about her anymore (if ever)

TLDR;

I'm sensing a loss of steam in my current relationship, and finding excitement in a co-worker.

[tl;dr] my fiancé lied to me about which friend he took home. he didn’t want me to be mad because the friend had a supposed “crush”, but he acts that way with all of his friends and i’ve never been upset. don’t know how to feel

Tonight she came back from  going out and basically told me she started talking with a guy there and  he seemed to have a bit of a thing for her, and that being honest she  kinda did too but feels really bad for feeling that way. We talked about  it a little tonight n she expressed when I asked if she chose me still,  to which she says yes. I asked just to clarify if they did anything and  she said well they didn't but there was definitely some emotional tension and she thought it felt fairly coupley.  I wasn't sure wether it was fair to say, but I did say I don't  think I'd be happy with her persueing any sort of close friendship with  this guy. Whilst I don't have issues with her feeling that way other  than being worried currently, I feel her persueing something with this  guy would almost inevitably turn into emotional if not physical cheating and whilst I didn't say it feel this would be her choosing not to think about how this would impact me and my trust if she went and persued anything with him.

This kinda feels extra bad cause it was just the other day she said she'd be  worried about being attracted to me if I started hormones which I'm unsure if I want to but if I do decide to is a very real prospect.

She has always had more fun with her male friends than her female friends, and I can honestly get that. She always had male friends from when she was a kid, and I got used to her seeing them and going out with them and I'm not jealous of them in any way. We've been together almost 6 years and I trust her with them, especially considering that most of the time, it's a big group with her female friends as well. The thing is, the friends she's planning a vacation with are new friends from barely a couple of months ago. 

Last summer, she started playing volleyball again and made new male friends in her team. They're a bit older, like 32-33 years old. Her friendship with them has grown exponentially fast, and now, she sees them 2-3 times a week for volleyball, and goes out drinking with them almost every Friday night.

Long story short, we're building a house so we both live with our respective parents in the meantime. But that means the we barely see other, and the only time we had together was the weekends. Friday night was our night, we'd spend it alone, just the two of us. Now, she has volleyball on friday nigths and sunday afternoon...  So yeah, we already got into a “fight” about it because we barely see each other, and she spends so much time with them and she has actually slept at the guys’ apartment more than once. It pisses me off and we talked about it, but her point is always that they’re really good friends and that I shouldn’t worry. 

I mean, we are building a house together and planning on having kids in the near future (might be on hold on my part). So a big part of me trusts her, but another part of me is pissed that this is normal behavior for her, like I SHOULD be okay with her sleeping over there, getting drunk with them almost every week. 

Now to top it all off, she asked me how I would feel about her going to Mexico with them to join another friend (much older) for two weeks… It’s not 100% sure, but just the fact that she is thinking about it is kind of pissing me off. I would never think about doing something like that, or just sleeping at a new female friends place. Don’t get me wrong, if the scenario called for me sleeping at a new female friends place, I would, but I wouldn’t go out drinking every week planning to sleep there. 

Now for a bit of context, I’m still is engineering school and have my last semester this winter when they might go. She has finished school a while ago, has the money to travel and the vacation days to do so. I feel like if I tell her no (she’d probably go anyway btw), I’m holding her back. 

Women of Reddit, I need you advice. Is this “normal” behavior, should I accept that? Is that something you would do to your boyfriend? Once again, we’ve been together for almost 6 years and I don’t want to ruin such a beautiful relationship for that, but even if I told her I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of her spending two weeks with them, she basically told me I should trust her and that she’d probably go anyway. 

She said (not in these exact words, but that’s what it meant) “I want to go, but I don’t want to know that you’re pissed the whole two weeks I’m away”. In my mind, that translates to “I’m going to go either way, but I would rather go knowing you’re okay with it”.

She’s teased me and called me a b**** bc I didn’t take sides with her when she was arguing with the other guy but it was playful.

Today we had class but I decided not to go and sat outside the class, when she arrived she saw me and decided to skip class too and sat with me. We talked for 2 hours and we talked a lot about dating and our past of getting hit on or just dating experience in general, she was smiling often and was being honest. She also opened up about why she wouldn’t date a super attractive guy bc she’s insecure if she cheats on him.

We’re both in our early thirties, in a serious relationship that started as OLD, and we’re happy most of the time. We enjoy eachothers company, have been able to weave our lives together fairly well, have sexual compatibility, similar love languages, and just enough common interests. The day to day is generally lovely, it brings me such joy to wake up everyday to the scent of fresh brewed coffee and morning kisses, and returning home from work to his embrace. I love him and feel at home with him.

Yet, when I have time to sit in my own thoughts I always go back to important things that give me doubt as to whether we are right for eachother. For example, he has anger management issues that he’s working on (he gets frustrated at himself, his anger has never been directed at me or other people, but it still stresses me out when it happens), he has a different relationship with money than I do (currently our finances are separate but I worry if we were married how he will handle my spending habits), he has a much more go with the flow attitude about life and I like to have a plan (i.e. career etc). 

I oscillate between whether I’m overanalyzing the relationship and letting anxiety get the better of me, or if I should trust what my gut is telling me about our incompatibilities.

I have had a casual relationship with a girl, where she just wanted to have sex, although i felt like its love.

we never communicated but we kept meeting as we were living in different countries, most of the times i went to her country just to see and meet her and spent nights with her too.

She had a broken marraige after 7 years and she loved someone whom just just wanted a casual relationship( she is still in touch with him) we met continuously and there was good intimacy, i always surprised, cared and did everything to make her happy, but i forgot to make myself happy although i enjoyed every moment with her. red flag was, i was always paying for everyhing, restraunts which is fine but even the accommodations i booked or even anywhere we went. she paid once when i asked to split. i gave her presents and even paid sometimes for her groceries. 

after 3 months of continuous meeting, once we met in her country in a different city and she got mad once saying i went quick from a restraunt where we ate something, even i waited for her at the door but she wanted me to come with her, i didn't say much and then we have had a bit of tiny fight on which she said F\*\*\*k you which made me a cry a bit due to the previous rude beahvior which i did not share, after i cried a bit she started to cry which made me feel soft and instead of leaving i stayed and everything was fine.

she goes to psychotherapy where she asks for suggestion from her therapist she shared when i asked that her therapist told her if she did not feel good then she should observe me, after that she was not talking much and even i was texting she saw my message and responded after 2-3 hours and when i asked did u work in between she said i was busy i did not say much and slowly i thought to communicate not much. as i felt something is wrong it made feel cry randomly and felt so bad all the time, i decided to share my feelings and asked her feelings on a call she said she don't know at first and then she said i treat her like my gf and i made her feel special always but she does not feel the same as i feel, i thanked her for sharing her feeling and cried a bit when she started to cry and shared what happened with her previous marriage which broke.

i communicated a bit afterward after 2-3 days and today there was something strange, she texted me after 3 days asking how i am, i said i am fine after an hour, she saw my msg and responded after an hour, i am fine, i said nice to know, and she asked how is my work going, i said its good and asked how about hers, she said she took a day off, and went to walk(probably she wanted me to be jealous)? i said thats good and she isaid its quite cold and snowy i asked whether you are serious. and told her its cold here too but no snow she saw my message and did not even respond afterwards.

Hi All, this is an account where I’ll post stuff I don’t want on my main. This is a really NSFW post btw. 

I’m a 19 year old guy and my dating my girlfriend of 3 ish months, 19 F. We have known each other for a couple years and have just decided to date over the summer of freshmen year, so those 4 years of experience really fast tracked us to where we are. I’m her first boyfriend, and even though I’ve had several girlfriends, my girlfriend and I have shared our first kiss/make out, first holding hands during a movie, first time on a real date, etc. We are both extreme virgins as you can probably tell, but we are starting to kinda experiment with each other when it comes to intimacy. Things have escalated a lot because of school stress and just natural growth in feelings, and I’m okay with that. The problem is a self confidence issue I have. Stereotypically, guys of my “demographic” are supposed to have way above average dicks, and that’s simply not me. That’s a huge insecurity of mine, and she has expressed in the past that she really likes someone (looks wise) who is over 6’, has a girthy dick, and essentially everything I’m not lol. I mean there’s nothing I can change about my height or my dick size, but knowing that I’m lacking in both the height and dick departments is really getting to me. 

We have grinded in the past, but she has never felt my dick with her hands, and like today when her elbow touched it, I moved her hand up because I didn’t want her to know. This is after I literally just got done fingering her for like 30-45 minutes having her come 4 times. I can tell that she absolutely loved it, but at some point she’s gonna want more and that’s where the issue presents itself. I have yet to ask her to do anything for me sexually, and it’s mostly because 1, I don’t wanna pressure her, and 2, I just can’t let her know that I’m just average like I am in everything else physically. I mean she is my exact type when it comes to physical features, but I’m clearly not hers, and she can’t even get an above average dick? Sounds kinda disappointing to me. I don’t really know how to approach this and I’m probably just losing my mind. 

I don’t/haven’t told her this insecurity because that would involve me telling her “hey, my dick is small, sorry” and brings up the idea to her of if she really wants to be with a guy who’s black but isn’t tall, has an average dick, and doesn’t really work out or play sports anymore because of school. Plus I haven’t met a single woman who’s okay with dating a man who has self image issues, all I hear is essentially you either are what almost every woman wants, or you aren’t, and if don’t have these features, don’t expect to be in a relationship.  This is extremely toxic and I don’t agree with it, but I don’t know any more man.  Is there a way that I can look at this situation differently? Or maybe a way I can kinda bring it up without having her second guess if this relationship is worth it? Almost everything else in our relationship is an absolute dream, but this has been killing me before we even started dating. Any ideas?

This guy is a friend of those housemates. 

I knew he had a breakup but he was dating again. I had some reservations about him, in particular his drug use and unreliability and I tried to avoid him. However, we always got along really well when we did chat. 

So one month in, I was upset about some other event and came home to find a massive party and we ended up hooking up. It was a one-off only a week ago. I wanted to keep it up, but he wasn't keen. However we ended up getting close despite lack of repeat hook up as in .. we could still crack jokes, talked about our pasts a bit, which is how I realized he is still very much tied up emotionally with his ex and she sounds manipulative. Having said that, I've been on the receiving end of my own ex telling everyone I was awful when I wasn't so, I don't necessarily believe him. I've tried to keep him at an arms emo wise and everything's being going fine. We've had our chit chats and cuddles, nothing major has gone wrong.

Today I came home from work to find him telling me he's going to go see his ex and she was demanding to know who he had been with since he had broken up with her. I asked him if they were getting back together and he said, no.  He said he won't tell her about me he thinks.... He said he's worried she'll burn the house down.

I told him not to even think about mentioning me as it won't just affect me, itll affect the whole house. He's left the house now to go see her like a complete pushover and I'm hoping that maybe he's just a douchebag and he's the one driving this poor little girl nuts. But I am concerned that she might be crazy bc its not always on the guy.

Anyway, I just kind of want some advice cuz I kind of want to yell at him and say ""you're giving me a major panic attack asshole"" but I know that's not right thing. I still have to live with this guy for another 4 weeks. Any advice?

Im tossing it up between a full confrontation or full avoidance. And yes, I decided to inform one of the other housemates as a precaution in case said ex does show up demanding my head.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7585124,public,self,Screwed the crew but crews X may be a psycho and is back.

It's late, and I've been thinking about this on and off for a year. So, fuck it- I need some straight taking Reddit advice. 

We met organically- a shared interest. Lovely- a great change from dating apps. 

So, the man in question. My type (rarely happens), personality wise and physically. Intelligent, articulate, introspective and quietly kind. He ticked a few necessary boxes I'd tried to overlook over the past few years. 

Here's the thing. We had 4 dates, and when we spoke openly about where we were at in life, he disclosed he had been offered a job offer abroad and wasn't sure whether to take it or stay. I couldn't handle the uncertainty and we went our separate ways. 

I got in touch with him last week, as I kept thinking of him (I changed my phone number a few months after we last spoke due to a work issue). 

He replied straight away, and within a few messages he suggested we meet for coffee.. He appeared genuinely interested in what I'd been up to, said he'd been thinking of me. He specified when he was free, and made it clear he'd free himself up for the following week if that didn't suit. It didn't necessitate a reply there and then. It was an open invitation to coffee.  

I've since not replied to his message. That was last week. I'm scared, honestly. He hasn't followed up, he's left it with me.

Was he thinking of me in a romantic way? Is it just a coffee? I really can't be meeting him as a friend, as I can't believe I've been thinking of this man for the past year. I feel ridiculous and hadn't realised a year had paased. I've been thinking of him but not obsessively, wondering how he is, whether he travelled, if he thought of me. I've dated since we met. I haven't met anyone else who I clicked with. We hadn't even kissed. It all felt natural, easy. I wasn't swept off my feet at the time. 

We're both in our mid thirties.

I 22(F) feel like I’ve ruined my husband’s (36M) life. I hate myself so much. I hate seeing him suffer everyday and knowing I’m the cause at the end of the day. I love him so much and he’s the kind to always look on the bright side and stay stoic so he never shows any sadness. But I can tell he probably hates the life we have now

I feel like a waste of space. A parasite. I sometimes wish I’d just die in a car crash so he can be free of me

So here’s what happened; we were dating for almost a year at the beginning of this year, and we accidentally got pregnant. I wanted to keep her. So did he. He also wanted to tell my parents asap and marry me. I stupidly wanted to elope instead because I was terrified of my brown parents who I was convinced would disown or even hurt me if they found out I got pregnant out of wedlock. I was even taught good girls didn’t even kiss until their wedding today. So I was petrified. 

And me being so scared put both of us in a fear/panic brain which ended up destroying everything. My worry influenced him to not think straight. The unnecessary panic I put him through by my baseless fear (family didn’t end up disowning me in the end and are now supportive so all my fear was for nothing) led him to make such a serious mistake which destroyed his whole business. 

He takes accountability for making the decision/mistake in the first place because he knows it was his decision. But he told me that I have a part in this too. That the panic I put him through influenced him to make this mistake a lot and I 100% agree. I hated to admit it because I knew it was true. But now we’re literally hanging on by a thread and he’s trying to restart business, and I hate myself so much for it. If he had never met me, none of this would’ve happened. He would’ve been living abundantly and peacefully. I feel like a tornado that came into his life and ruined everything.

And yet he’s so good to me. Shows me so much love and has never lost his patience with me. And because he’s so good to me I feel even worse. I’m not worthy of his love. I ruined his life.

He tells me not to panic because he is turning our situation around because there’s no other choice and it was him who made the mistake so he’s fixing it. But I’m sitting here knowing I’m the cause of this entire mess

I hate myself for putting the person I love and care about most through hell. I would not even blame him if he cheated on me, that’s how ashamed I am of myself. I wish I’d just cease to exist

Before her and I got together, I had been friends with someone (21f) for as long as I could remember. My friend and I had had some instances where we expressed romantic interest for one another, but never pursued it. 

Flash forward to when my gf and I got together. She soon after we got together didn’t want me to talk to my friend, which I, as a stupid teenager, agreed to. Once, when my girlfriend and I were in a rocky place our first year together, I reconnected with my friend. But, when my gf and I got better, she wouldn’t let me talk to her. 

Jump forward further to now, and I am in a true dilemma. My girlfriend thinks we’re fine. But, I’m coming to terms with the fact that I may be being emotionally abused.

She has used the notorious line “oh, so I’m an abuser then?” often. While things are often fine, and I feel compassion for her in those times, the belittling and bad moments come back and I don’t know how to feel. 

Recently, I got up the nerve to message my friend after a long time when I saw that she was studying at the college I had dreamed of going to (I ended up not going there because my girlfriend didn’t want me going somewhere so far away). The nerve came, also, after going on antidepressants and anti anxiety medication after a long time of my girlfriend saying that I don’t need them. 

My friend has been messaging me back infrequently, which I completely understand after being absent for so long. But, even those infrequent messages have made me realize that she is the true love of my life. She is the kindest, most caring, and coolest person Ive known. I’ve cried for days now knowing that there is a chance that I will never get to live the life I could have with her.

I’m a fitness social media guy. The “influencer” part goes hand in hand with my business/career, I’m a bodybuilder and personal trainer. It’s both a passion, hobby, and part of my income. Not a fan of the social media “look at me” stuff or the high school drama involved, but it’s part of this world I’m in so meh. Overall, Being seen with a good reputation is important here and important to me in general.

I had an issue with a person plagiarizing original content of mine, consistently. It was a mutual “internet friend”.  I never acted on it. For a year, I would see mutual “fans” point out the plagiarism and tag me. 

I really didn’t know how to approach it. When I finally got tired of it, I made a public story on my IG asking for opinions and help on what to do without name dropping the culprit. I mocked the situation calling it immature and I ended up deciding to block them and move on. Figured it was the best way since I didn’t really even know the person. 

Low and behold, my plagiarizer saw my story  and the fact I blocked them. They were upset and went into attack mode. 

They formed a group of their friends who were also popular to cancel me on false pretenses. Social Manipulation. 
One specific person (I’ll call her Dana) was a “internet friend” of mine and an actual friend to my then gf at the time. 
They attacked my image. Dana went specifically hard. Suddenly I was a bully harassing people (untrue as fuck.) Dana directly attacked my gf and our relationship, messaging her nonsense about me to drive a wedge between us (it eventually worked.)
Dana really went after me. I tried to talk to Dana about what she was doing, but she didn’t back down and wouldn’t listen to reason from me or my gf. Dana had goals to ruin me, really extreme goals out of no where. 

I lost a lot. I was betrayed by Dana, who I thought was a friend. Dana wouldn’t listen to reasoning from me or my gf. Dana spread the rumors directly to my gf relentlessly and caused my gf a lot of unrest which then got projected into our relationship. What hurt most was Mainly the damage done to my very committed relationship of 5 years. Which I’ve had to deal with the fallout of and still trying to work through. But also I had such a huge passion for the social media work I did. But now all I feel is shame trying to get back into it.

I let my work/social media/hobby die off. It’s been almost a year of nothing from me. I liked being seen as a decent person. For the last year and a half, when I try to get back into it, I feel shame. There’s always someone that reminds me that my name was tarnished, it may only account for 2% or people… but it reminds me of all the things I lost for no reason, my relationship, my decent reputation, my trust in people, my hope. 

Dana the fucking snake, eventually reached out to my gf (now Ex) to apologize for what she did a year later. Apparently, Dana was betrayed by the plagiarizer eventually as well. No apology ever came my way however. (I assume Dana apologized to only my GF because she’s an insanely popular social media person as well, manipulative attention seekers but I digress.)

Dana specifically caused a lot of harm. Never reached out to me and left me in a really bad place in my life. I fantasize ALOT about the harm I would do to Dana because of what they did. Every day I inch closer to proceeding. I have such a hard time letting this all go. I’ve thought about maybe reaching out to Dana and reasonably opening a dialog to try to understand things since I was thrown under the bus by storm by them and left confused and hurt. But I just don’t know if I should, if it would help me. I’ve never been this mad at someone before. I feel I lost a lot… my relationship and everything else. I’m wondering if I should try to reach out…?

I’m forever full of rage and unsure what to do. It was a lot falling apart all at once and all I see is Dana purely at the root of it. Karma, bad fate, nothing has happened to them. I’m so mad. I’m so very mad and have been for almost 2 years.

I have had a casual relationship with a girl, where she just wanted to have sex, although i felt like its love.

we never communicated but we kept meeting as we were living in different countries, most of the times i went to her country just to see and meet her and spent nights with her too.

She had a broken marraige after 7 years and she loved someone whom just just wanted a casual relationship( she is still in touch with him) we met continuously and there was good intimacy, i always surprised, cared and did everything to make her happy, but i forgot to make myself happy although i enjoyed every moment with her. red flag was, i was always paying for everyhing, restraunts which is fine but even the accommodations i booked or even anywhere we went. she paid once when i asked to split. i gave her presents and even paid sometimes for her groceries. 

after 3 months of continuous meeting, once we met in her country in a different city and she got mad once saying i went quick from a restraunt where we ate something, even i waited for her at the door but she wanted me to come with her, i didn't say much and then we have had a bit of tiny fight on which she said F\*\*\*k you which made me a cry a bit due to the previous rude beahvior which i did not share, after i cried a bit she started to cry which made me feel soft and instead of leaving i stayed and everything was fine.

she goes to psychotherapy where she asks for suggestion from her therapist she shared when i asked that her therapist told her if she did not feel good then she should observe me, after that she was not talking much and even i was texting she saw my message and responded after 2-3 hours and when i asked did u work in between she said i was busy i did not say much and slowly i thought to communicate not much. as i felt something is wrong it made feel cry randomly and felt so bad all the time, i decided to share my feelings and asked her feelings on a call she said she don't know at first and then she said i treat her like my gf and i made her feel special always but she does not feel the same as i feel, i thanked her for sharing her feeling and cried a bit when she started to cry and shared what happened with her previous marriage which broke.

i communicated a bit afterward after 2-3 days and today there was something strange, she texted me after 3 days asking how i am, i said i am fine after an hour, she saw my msg and responded after an hour, i am fine, i said nice to know, and she asked how is my work going, i said its good and asked how about hers, she said she took a day off, and went to walk(probably she wanted me to be jealous)? i said thats good and she isaid its quite cold and snowy i asked whether you are serious. and told her its cold here too but no snow she saw my message and did not even respond afterwards. I don't know if she is playing games with me or what, i would appericiate your advice as  i am not playing any games or something and i did so much for her, but in the end i just got sadness. but don't know why i still want her but i would not chase her now. but what i should do if she responds? should i do the same as she did or just let it go?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7585068,public,self,"I 28(M) Need a advice, How can I get her back?

I just completely feel like my needs are being ignored and now he has been snapping at me all day today and won't even look at me.

I want to talk to him but he is completely shut down so I don't know what to do.

But I've been going out with a truly fantastic girl for about 2-3 months now. Things have been going really, really well.

The one small problem that I need to resolve is on the intimacy side (basic demonstrations of affection like hand-holding, etc). It's totally on me and I know I can fix it quickly if I commit to doing so despite how anxious it may make me to initiate it on the front end.

Besides kissing at the beginning of each date and making out at end of each, I haven't initiated much. It's not that I have a problem with or don't like intimacy. Once I get in a zone where I realize what's acceptable/welcomed/not seen as weird on the other side, I have no problem initiating, but I'm always nervous about making others uncomfortable. Which is dumb because I recognize we both have feelings for each other and it would probably be well-received. I communicated this to her this week (probably not as articulately as I would've liked but I got the sentiment out there) and she was really understanding; she was glad I told her and told me to take all the time I need. I'm grateful for how patient she's been.

I know I can resolve this issue quickly if I commit to doing so. I think getting her to hang out at my place would be extremely helpful for me. Even if we're just eating and watching a movie on the couch together, I think I will feel more comfortable/natural being closer to her, and that can help me break this little barrier in my head. But I feel like making this ask will give off an ""I'm trying to take your clothes off"" vibe, and I'd hate to make her feel uncomfortable. 

If there was a specific reason I can give for inviting her over (like, ""hey, the latest episode of COPS -- lol, COPS --is coming out this evening, come over and watch it ), I wouldn't feel funny at all. But I can't think of an excuse to invite her over.

Do I sound completely crazy? Is there a way I can do it while addressing the discomfort I'm currently feeling (needing an excuse) or should I just shut up and do it with no excuse?

I have been with my boyfriend for over two years, and we have a pretty solid relationship at this point. Our financial, political, religious values, and life goals align really well. The only issue is that we’re really not having sex anymore, or as much sex as I’d like.

When we first got together, we had sex a lot, and I know that kind of pace isn’t sustainable. But I really want to have sex at the very very very least once a week. For the past year or so, we have really only had sex on average probably once a month. These past two months, We’ve had sex one time.

There were a lot of factors, I was sick for a little bit, my periods last for probably a week and a half, but I just don’t know what to do anymore. He may be tried to initiate five times, but I think it was less, I’m just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. I probably try to initiate every other day.

He always tells me We probably have more sex if I put more effort into my appearance. I am admittedly kind of lazy, I don’t really like dressing up unless we’re going somewhere, or even doing my makeup. But the times that I do dress up, it doesn’t seem to change anything.

I know it’s not fair for me to just automatically expect sex whenever I do dress up, but he’s asked me to dress up more, and I do enjoy being dressed up whenever I can get the motivation to do so. I really haven’t felt very attractive lately, I feel ugly. So when I do get the motivation to to dress up and it hasn’t changed or sex life, it really affects me.

To this day I still remember when I bought a lingerie set for Valentine’s Day, and I wore it. And nothing happened. I know that he can’t control his libido, but that really hurt me. I know I really just don’t see the point of even trying to dress up because it doesn’t change anything.

The next day I left for work from 2pm to 10pm. My bf is unemployed, so he said he would hang around, eat some stuff from my place then do the shopping for me to replace exactly what he ate and grab some other stuff I needed (he asked me for a list), to help out, because I would end up home at around 11pm when everything is closed and there is no delivery.

Just to make it clear, my bf is unemployed because he quit his job 2 months ago because he was burned out and decided to take a sabbatical as he made a lot of money in the years he worked. I am not financially supporting him (even if this sabbatical would go on for another 4 years he would still have more money than me working), but he does just sit around doing nothing all day.

When I came home from work exhausted, I really had my mind set on eating this tuna mix I had. I know it sounds super specific and dumb, but I really had my heart set on that and was thinking about it all day. I had 3 tin cans, but when I got home they were all gone.

&amp;#x200B;

When I confronted him about it saying that I come home tired after 8h of work and he just sat around all day, this was his response: 

He said was planning on going to the shop 10min away to replace them and do the other shopping he offered to do. But apparently the whole chain of shops was closed down because there were some legal problems (was all over the news the next day).

He went 40min roundtrip (he made a note of mentioning this) to another shop, but they didn't have the items he ate so he could replace them. But he did get me a bunch of other stuff, that I could eat with minimal preparation.

I told him I don't like the stuff he got me and he said that I had eaten these things before, and he thought this would be ok, at least as a substitute for one night.

He apologized for the situation, saying that when he ate those things he had every intention of replacing them, but he got screwed that the shop carrying those items was closed down (for the first time in 20 years). And that he didn't leave me with nothing but left a substitute. 

I asked why he didnt order them online (quick 20min service), and he said that it literally never crossed his mind until the moment I suggested it. And I said to him that online order is still available so he should order all the things for me.

He then send me a long and very formal apology like the one you get from HR (it's clear he was being sarcastic and not really that sorry), like ""I'm very sorry of this unfortunate situation and that you had to endure such hardship"". And transferred me money for me to order. He actually transferred me double the amount for the items he ate, so that it covered the minimum order.

But I still felt betrayed, because he went through my house and ate my food without asking first, didn't inform me that he failed to replace them. He offered to help me with shopping because I would get home late and tired (which made me feel loved and that I could rely on him), but when I got home I felt a bit betrayed and that I can't rely on him in general to help me out, or do what he says he is gonna do.

First time poster. Forgive me for any formatting mistakes. 

So I (29F) met a guy Y (35 M) on a dating app 3 months ago. 

I am an introvert by nature and in therapy for depression and anxiety. Meeting this guy has been wonderful because he is able to lead the conversation, make me go out to places where I would never set foot by myself and in general, he makes me feel cared for and explore new sides of myself which I enjoy. 

The issue is that he resembles my ex way too much and that's giving me anxiety. 
He quit his company to follow his passion in teaching, the way he talks about his passion, the way he likes history, the way  he talks about our future and the way he says that at finally 35, he has met someone he is in love etc. 
Almost every other thing about him resembles my ex . 

A brief background about my ex. 
Our ages were far apart when we started dating. I was 24 when he was 42. We broke up because I did not find the space to be myself with him. We had also shared the same workplace for a while and I felt that my every relationship with him had the power dynamics tilted towards him. We broke up after 4 years of serious dating. 

I told Y that he resembles my ex too much and that maybe we should not date but he insisted that he is diffrent and that he will match with me and everything. But I don't know if it is a good sign to start a relationship from this place. 

Btw. Just in case this helps, both Y and ex are from same country which is different than mine.

My bf (20M) and I (20F) went out with some friends whom I personally haven't seen in about 2 weeks. I knew one of our male friends wanted to grow a beard, and when I saw him, I could see that his beard had grown a lot since the last time I saw him. 
So I told him ""wow, your beard has grown!"", He said ""yeah, right?"" And that was it. 

When we left, my bf was acting cold towards me and when I asked him about it he said that he's upset that I pointed out our friend's beard, because I usually don't point out the things that are different about my bf.  

I told him I understood how he felt, I apologized, said that it won't happen again and I even pointed out how I will act from now on so that this never happens again and how we can both learn from this. To me, that seems to be the best way to handle an argument.

However, my boyfriend kept saying that I didn't understand him (even tho I showed him multiple times that I did), brought up past arguments that we had and said  ""i was sure you'd do something stupid to make me upset"" 

I feel like he's being unreasonable. I understand why he's upset, but isn't it normal to notice the changes when you haven't seen a person in a long time? I see my boyfriend every day, I can't always see that he has trimmed his beard or shaved it a bit. Especially because he doesn't have a big beard, so to me there's not a big difference.

Also, he said that he always notices stuff about me, but when I asked for an example he just said """"well, you don't change stuff about you regularly ""
So why does he expect me to notice every little change that he has, but he doesn't do the same?? Because there have been instances where I've done my hair or makeup differently and he hadn't said anything. 

Throughout our conversation he was being very rude and ironic, he would make snarky remarks, even though I was genuinely trying to make things right between us. In the end he left and closed the door to my car pretty hard, even though we hadn't finished talking. 

What more can I do to make him understand my side of the story as well? How can I make him change the way he acts when we're having an argument? And also, what's the best way to solve and argument?

TL:DR.

We have been living separate now for a little over a week as I got my own apartment and she went back to live with family. The relationship was pretty toxic throughout as it seemed very one sided with me never being able to express how I felt without it turning into an argument because she didn’t agree and whenever we had a disagreement or fight, she would then want to breakup. Things also became worse when she ended up working at a sports bar and we just had totally different schedules at that point. The last month or so we still had our lease while living in separate rooms and it became common for her to come home at 4-6am… Sometimes later. She would always come in my room when she got home and want to cuddle but never anything past that.

I (26f) have been with my partner (29m) for nearly 3 years, living together for 2 of them. We have a lot of fun together and we balance each other out well. But we have a recurring argument that makes me question things.

The spark tonight happened when I was recounting a shitty customer story to him (I work retail and for the most part things are good, but there's always one shithead). This mother came in and was being an asshole to her ~10 year old kid, who was well behaved as far as I could tell (the short of it is, she talked to the kid like they're stupid and the kid was visibly upset about it). My boss was present for this as well as another coworker, and none of us called the mom out on it. I was dry to her at the counter and I was nice to the kid, but that's all I did. My partner has some mommy issues of his own, so obviously this upset him. But he flipped it around on me, saying that by not doing anything (speaking up for the kid, refusing the lady service, etc.) that I am a virtue signaling hypocrite. I'm no activist but I go to protests and I read a lot, I'm always talking about how terrible things are in the world right now, and he said that by not doing something when I saw it happen, I am a virtue signaling hypocrite.

He also called me this when I refused to cut contact with my mom, whose political opinions are radically different from ours. We moved 4.5 hours away from her, I see her maybe once a year, but we keep in touch and that makes him furious. He called me a hypocrite and told me that I'm no better than the people/politics/situations I claim to be against.

During the fight tonight he made me feel small and stupid, I don't have the energy to argue with him anymore. Unless I agree with him, he will not hear what I have to say. Tonight made me want to leave. And this is not the first time I've wanted to. I'm conflicted though, because I do love him, we have a lot of fun together. But he doesn't respect me. Is someone like this worth staying with?

I (27F) have issues making new friends because of the trauma I’ve had in my life.

I was adopted to another family member at a young age. I watched that father die, my bio father go through addiction, sister killed herself, multiple sexual assaults. 

Through this I’ve done years of therapy. I still find myself focusing on immediate danger that I let, occasionally, some very unhealthy people in, ignoring red flags. 

With this, comes some drama occasionally. 

It’s pretty hard to find friends as an aging adult. Some people find the amount of things that have happened to me “too much”, by this, I typically wait months to tell someone my past to build trust, yet when they hear about it and I share they’re like “Wow you just have a lot going on.” And eventually we don’t chat as much.

It’s made me wildly insecure and therefore I quit initializing any form of social interactions. Rarely ask people to hang out, or get ignored because I don’t want to go to a party/music event/large crowds. 

I’ve done therapy for years and still have no clue how to foster deeper connections, with wholesome humans that accept some emotional slime.

I’d also like to say I have a few very close friends I’ve had for 10 years, and I recently moved to a new city 1 year ago, which has made the adjustment hard. 

Any advice?

First of all I want to apologize for any grammar mistakes (english is not my first language). Before i start with our ongoing issues, some background infos are required for a better understanding of our situation. Before i started dating David, i had a boyfriend of 5 years. We were the definition of soulmates. My ex was literally obsessed with me and he teached me wat love was. He would literally touch me non-stop (in a respectful and lovey dovey way), whisper sweet thing in my ear when he thought i was asleep and wake me up with paragraphs where he was expressing his love for me. After our relationship ended because of him cheating on me i was obviously left with severe trust issues and me swearing that i won’t get a boyfriend for at least another 2-3y. Everything was going according to plan , untill i met my current boyfriend David. He was innocent, sweet, caring and overall made me feel alive for the first time after my ex. We are work colleagues so we spent a lot of time together and seeing each other daily. We quickly became best friends and after 6 months of being only friends, we expressed our feelings for each other and started dating. It is important to mention that he never had a girlfriend before and in his friend goup every person has a partner so he wanted one really badly. Another important thing to mention is that he is the quiet and shy type of guy while i am really outgoing and extroverted. So first week into dating he started having jealousy issues and despising all my male friends. He was also very insecure. I tried my best to communicate with him but every time he seemed that he understand , it was later proven that i was wrong.His behavior started to drain me emotionally.We also had other issues like me telling him that my love language is physical touch and him continuing to be pretty distant. Like he is not holding my hand if i don’t initiate it and him not doing any of those boyfriend small gestures like  putting his hand on my thight ,forehead kisses etc. And with my past experience i know how a man who is obsessed and undeniably in love with acts. But I always thought of this as a result of his parents who never expressed their love for him .I am aware that i am his first gf and maybe this things don’t come to him naturally but i expected him to pay a little more attention to what i tell him and when i try to communicate this issues.Now to his good parts:he always makes sure i am eating properly, nursed me when i was sick and give me cute little handmade gifts. But I can’t help but think of these from a very close friend perspective given the fact that he is so distant physically and also feeling like waking on shells when i am with him because of his insecurities.
