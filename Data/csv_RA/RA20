He does a lot of things for his age and partakes in many activities and hobbies.

We joke all the time, so it came as a surprise when we hopped on call one day and he was super quiet. I thought he was joking as it was halloween night, but he started talking vaguely about random stuff like being depressed and asked me if I had “ever thought about killing someone.” He then told me that his mind was “spinning again” and that he was coming back to the “person I knew.” It freaked me out, especially because he was usually quiet about his family life and other personal topics.

I know my friend has a rough family life—he constantly argues with his parents, has to uphold all of the responsibilities, has to take care of his younger family members, and also has a part time job on top of trade school. What bothers me is that he sometimes dismisses certain topics out of nowhere and plays it off as a joke. He also sometimes doesn’t show up to events on time or at all cause something else comes up. Thats how he’s always been, so I took it as a normal thing.

Last night we were hanging out and went to the gas station to have a bite. He talked about this homeless lady he usually sees and suddenly brings up how he could have killed her and nobody would care about her life.

It was very subtle and quick, and he immediately brings up something else. My friend talks a lot at once about different things sometimes. He acted normal and jokey the entire time, so I acted how I usually would.

We went back to my house with my cousin who was also there and hung out. After a long night he brings up how his friends dad was a neighbor of a celebrity when she was young and again, out of nowhere, says that the dad could have killed her then and there. My cousin didn’t notice as he was on the pc, and I gave my friend a weird look and acted normal, as I was contemplating what he just said. Again he goes back to normal as if nothing happened. He left later and that was that.

After the indecent on halloween night I talked with some of our mutual friends and they agreed that he sometimes did weird things. I mentioned that he said the thing about killing someone. One of them is knowledgeable on mental health and told me that he’s showing signs of a personality disorder, and after some research it makes sense. He told me to just be there for him, and that he’s probably struggling a lot.

Ever since that call he’s briefly acknowledged the “friend” that I “didn’t like.” It seems he knows that he “switches” into this different state. I don’t know what to do.

He doesn't work (physical and mental issues that caused him to be deemed unfit for work, years before we even met, and he's on government welfare). He isn't handicapped however and will tinker around the house, or work on his own projects. He will fix the car if there's issues with the car, and works on things in the house.

I work part-time/fulltime as a manager. I've got 32 hrs on contract, but will often end up working above that, often more than fulltime. And I'm trying to complete a 1,5 year education at the side (paid for by my job).

The way we divided our money used to be that we'd pay 50/50 on the regular bills and expenses, which left me with a fair bit of money to spend for myself, and him with little to nothing. With my own money I would often buy things for us both, or things around the house (furniture, paint or other materials to fix up the house etc).  
In the past I have suggested we'd divide the bills more fairly by paying in proportion to our income, so he'd have more spending money himself as well. This idea he rejected before.  However lately he's come around to that and we now have a 65% - 35% division; I earn 65% of our income and he earns 35%, so we each respectively pay that amount of our shared bills. That leaves us both with some money for our personal bills (healthcare, phone bills, sport subscriptions) and to spend the rest as we wish. This feels more fair to me than the 50/50 we had.

We've tried to divide the chores around the house, though I personally feel I always end up doing the brunt of the work. Lately I've been slacking with my part of the chores, mostly because I just don't have the time or energy for it anymore (I'm probably edging towards a burnout and I'm taking steps to prevent a full blown burnout from happing).   
And it does sting to come home from a long day of work, and to come home to my partner watching TV, knowing that he's watched TV for the majority of the day, and knowing that he will watch TV for the majority of the evening, and that I'm still expected to clean the kitchen, the shower and vacuum the house etc.

He has however now also suggested that he could take over all chores of the house, for 100euro per month. This will however not mean ALL chores, as I'll still be the one to vacuum, probably do half of the cooking, the following dishes, do half of grocery shopping, and do at least half of the laundry.  
And this is where it doesn't sit right with me; If I were to agree to that, I'd end up with the same amount of money left over at the end of the month as he would. And I don't feel it's fair that I'm working 32- +40 hrs a week, only to be left with the same amount of money as somebody who doesn't have a job, watches TV most of the time, and probably wouldn't even spend 10hrs a week to keep the house tidy if I took on all chores himself.

Besides that, what happens when we get into a situation where I feel he starts slacking on the house hold chores? I mean, I am 'paying' him 100euro for it, would I have to start being a manager at home as well and tell him to do his chores or he won't get paid?

On the other hand I don't know if I'm just being stingy/weird about 'my share vs his share' of the money and expecting to have more money at the end of a month for the work I do?

We've been together for over a year. She has just started college for a month. Her parents are quite controlling and don't let her go out of the house on her own, and even if they do, she has to tell them everything about her plans (even asking for photos as proof sometimes) with restrictions on time, place and company. Moreover, hey don't like her going out with me. So even though our homes were close, it mostly felt like a long distance thing. That's why we were never able to date the way we wanted to and it had been pretty dry. I have been to her aunt's house a couple of times which was about the most privacy we could have had. 

I thought after she started college, we would have more freedom to go on dates together. But for the better part of the last month, her mother went and received her from college. So I am still kept waiting. In the meantime, she has has been enjoying herself in college, overcoming anxiety and body image issues from her school days by finding people were seemingly attracted to her and then she felt attracted to another guy from her class. 

Given our dating life, I can somewhat understand her position. She was the one who told me about it and I was happy that she was atleast honest about it. But I told her that she should control her emotions and try to overcome this feeling, because my trust is on her to do the right thing. But she said she probably can't control her emotions. She has been enjoying the attention, even saying that he does things for her that she always craved in an offline relationship; being spontaneous and then walk with her leaving his football practices (They have the same route towards home). She has told the guy that she is in a relationship but I told her I don't think that is going to stop the guy from shooting his shot (Because I think the guy likes her too). She said she feels happy, even though it's not right. 

I am probably going to break up with her today. She hasn't cheated technically, but I think it's beyond saving at this point and she should do what makes her happy without me stopping her.

I(22M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for 2.5 years. We're very close and I love her and we fit in a lot of ways. 

The issue is I am going abroad soon, probably within the next 6 months. nothing is set in stone yet but I pretty much have to go for my career. The country we live in rn is in not such a great state and for my particular career path, options exist but not many, I will have better opportunity and will be able to make more money abroad. I do plan on returning but it could be a long time, I want to make money and come back, probably looking at something like 10 years realistically but then again I don't exactly have a proper plan.

She doesn't want to come with me because her career better set here. (long story short). We're strong and I do think we could do long distance but it feels wrong. She wants to be married and have kids by the time she's around 28. If I'm not here that's not really possible and talking emotionally she said she'd wait for me. but that makes me feel like an asshole for having to make her wait longer than she'd like and it isn't 100% that I'd return at all. so I really don't know what to do. The last thing I want to do is hurt her or take her away from her dreams and I don't want to lose her but day by day as much as it hurts I think its the best thing for us because we have different life goals or well she has goals and maybe I don't yet. I don't want to take away from her life on ""maybe"" ill come back, I want her to be happy.

We are close friends and are currently taking 2 classes together in college. We uses to hangout weekly and talk a lot. But Once school started she barely spoke to me. I usually get to class 30 minutes early and she does too. At the start of the semester we would wait by the class together. But then she stopped showing up and sometimes I'd see her sitting somewhere else. In class she wouldn't talk to me unless I talked to her. 

The first few weeks I tried asking to hangout/study but she told me she was busy and I stopped asking. She never reached out herself. I guess she scheduled her classes badly but this didn't really make sense to me. Before school started I tried picking our classes in a way that would give us time to study. But then last minute she switched up.

So at first we talked a little at the start of the semester. We would walk together after class( she has 45 minutes of free time after). But then she started talking to me less then not at all. So I stopped asking to hangout. Then I stopped walking with her after class. Then I stopped talking to her in class. After months we had a test coming up and I asked her if were going to study together at all. We did end up scheduling a day but her late response and the way she acted in person made me feel like she didn't want to.

A few weeks before this I was going to talk to her about it. I tried waiting after class and was going to ask her if anything was wrong. But it felt really awkward and I thought she didn't want to talk to me so I decided not too. After we made plans I ended up telling her that I think we should stop talking. She responded right away and asked why but I told her I didn't want to talk about it. There is some more stuff after this but this post is already kinda long.

I would like to get other peoples thoughts on this. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I made the right decision but I also think I might have over thought this and assumed some things.

We had started texting through snap and it got to a point where we were talking every single day from morning to night it had gotten so bad it had affected our sleep we would stay up til 7am just laughing on the phone.
We live in the same town so I would always ask her if we could go on a date but she would always deny me saying she doesn't want to, so I always thought no big deal it's fine but we started to really connect and it eventually it got to a point where we decided to be a couple and stated we were boyfriend and girlfriend despite never seeing each other in person I had doubts and suspicions I was being catfished but she would send me snaps of herself every now and then. We had gotten each other's phone numbers and called each other everyday talking about how much we love each other and when we would see each other, but she would always flake anytime we set up a date,
And this frustrated me immensely I couldn't understand why she wouldn't see me, eventually she had stated she wasn't ready for a relationship and didn't feel comfortable being in one with me so we would attempt to break it off but we always got back together and continued talking.. this went on for 9 months.
Until a stranger reached out to me after I had posted a tiktok where my girlfriend had commented. This stranger asked me if we had been talking and I said yes she's my girlfriend. He then explained that she was also his girlfriend and they had been talking for a year he showed me all of the messages and even the same nude photos she had sent me she had also sent to him.. at the same time on snapchat..
(Writing this out i feel so dumb)
I was horrified and apologized I had no idea and I confronted her about it, my girlfriend explained that she wanted to break up with him but didn't know how to and didnt want him to feel sad. I called her every name I could think of and she just kept apologizing and said she would come see me. Finally after 9 months, this is the only reason she chose to see me.
When she finally came over I didn't yell I didn't get upset I just asked why and she explained that during the pandemic she had gotten extremely lonely and depressed, she had relationships but nothing serious she stated she felt sad and confused and this guy was someone she would talk to about her mental health issues.
I forgave her and listened to her and asked if there was anyone else. She said no. 
A month or two passes and we are dating and seeing each other in person, Finally a dream realized
But this betrayal irked me and made me depressed I would constantly pry and ask more about it eventually she told me that there were more people that she was talking to and that she had sent nudes to and i felt shattered once again.
Everytime I try to ask about the past she gets upset at me and tells me that this relationship is going nowhere and that I'm not being considerate, while I admit talking about it often leads to arguments i can't say that I'm not considerate of her needs I've always been there for her I've never cheated or talked to anyone else and when she needs me I'm there, when she wants to talk about things I listen, so I'm left confused and wondering how to fix myself, how to make sure I'm a better partner for her.
But recently I found out that she had been talking with one of the guys she used to talk to. She said that she told him she was in a relationship so she thought it would be fine but I explained that it was not okay and that it made me uncomfortable and this had happened right after I had made progress with getting over the past and now I'm back spiraling again in this darkness..
I had found out because I asked to see her snapchat and she wasn't expecting to have a message from this guy and it was a comment about how hot she looked and how he wanted to fuck her. I went through the messages and saw that he commented about how he wanted to keep her on snap so he wouldn't lose the nudes she sent him and so I checked and it was the same nudes she sent me and her other boyfriend..
I exploded I beat her with my words and broke up with her but she's saying she wants to try and she's saying she loves me but I have no faith and no trust in her at all and at this point I'm at a loss.
She's lied about a lot including her own name as well as her mother's name and even her own address.
Is there any saving this relationship? I really want to but I can't help but feel ill just be cheated on again.

How do I break up? We've been together for 3 months, but I feel bad to dump him.

This all probably sounds stupid, but I really don't know what to do. My bf Max and I are both 17 (I know we're young, but please hear me out). He is a great guy, super nice, gives me chocolates, his friends love me and I love them. He really cares about me, and I can tell he sees a future with me (which I always felt bad about because I never saw being with him that long, I guess it was kind of a gut feeling?). We are both great at school and teachers love him.
But there are some things that have been going on for some time, and they started really bothering me a couple of weeks ago and I don't think I can handle it anymore:

1) He texts me a lot, but like a lot.
He sends me a couple of reels a day, and if I reply to one, he starts a random discussion or really sends anything just to text with me, which I don't mind doing sometimes, but he does it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I have a lot of school-related work and my schedule is full, I am litteraly not home from 1pm till about 10pm most days and the only free time I get are mornings and weekends (we go out on the weekends). He knows this. I usually put my phone away for a couple of hours while I study in the mornings so it doesn't distract me. The problem is, if I don't reply much during the day he asks me if everything is okay and I usually find myself apologising or giving excuses to why I couldn't reply sooner. I started having my phone in the same room as me bc of it, which has altered my study sessions a lot and it takes me way more time to get everything done. Also, I have less time to just relax, do nothing and recharge (am a huge introvert) and it has started to affect my already bad mental health (I know I should get therapy).

2) Him and I are extremely different.
For example, I love pop music and he listens to stuff like 90s rock, we don't watch the same genres, cats vs dogs etc., and we often don't have anything to talk about on dates except from school and maybe family. I honestly had no idea we were that different when we started dating.

3) He thinks that we will be together our entire lives  and ""jokingly"" pressures me to choose a college in the same city as his because, and I quote: ""Girlfriend should go where her bf goes, not the other way around"". COLLEGE IS ALMOST 2 YEARS FROM NOW. He also wanted to discuss baby names (of course he hates all of my suggestions), where I plan to live etc. It usually ends up with me being annoyed and changing the subject while he is oblivious to me being upset (maybe he really doesn't get it seriously and just asks randomly, but it happened way too many times). It feels like he plans to be with me forever.

All those things made me lose interest, I feel uncomfortable kissing him, even just a peck on the lips. Whenever I am with him, I just want to go home and I feel exhausted afterwards. I don't think I can handle this much longer. My friends were shocked  because everything seemed great and everyone loves him, including my family. Two friends told me to just break it off soon and third told me to get the hell out of this asap. I wanted to break up last week but something came up and we didn't meet. Now it is our 3 month anniversary so we're meeting up before school and he said he has something to give me. I don't even know how I'm going to pretend everything is fine and accept the gift (btw I am going to get him something aswell). My friends told me to wait maybe at least a week so I don't look like a bad guy since it's our 3 months, and I agree because I know that I would feel bad if I did it now.

What do you think? Should I wait longer? Should I tell him everything that has bothered me or should I just say that this isn't working anymore and I lost feelings for him and that we are too different? I would explain it better in person, but still I don't want to put the blame on him especially because he really is a good person, I have no idea why he started acting so strange. Also, I would like if we stayed on good terms. How do I tell him that?

Me(M22) and my friend Stefan(M21) have been friends for around 6 years. I always kinda thought of him as my best friend, unsure what he thinks of him but we always seemed to get along. Around March time this year we met this girl Zoe(F25) while she was visiting from spain. We only met her twice but added her to our group chat.  


At the start things were going ok, we'd all group call and it was normal. My friend Stefan has never had a gf before and it was a running joke that they liked each other. She tried to start private messages with me way back at the start but i assumed it was friendly and didn't really go out of my way to respond. At the same time or later on i think she started messaging Stefan and i think he responded quicker/more than i did. This goes on for a while and I eventually get feelings from talking to her more. I am the first to admit this and she says she feels the same. I tell my friend and he says he likes her so i feel bad, tell her i didn't mean it and she gets annoyed and says she never liked me like that and actually liked Stefan, there's a slight argument and things go back to normal.   


She eventually leaves after 2 months after some argument between her and Stefan. I think it was something about making each other jealous on purpose or something? im really not sure. She removes us all for a few days and adds my friend and another one of my friends back around 2 days later. Her and my friend go back and fourth talking for another month and at this point its making me jealous of how close they're getting and my friend is becoming more distant. He wants her back in the group and adds her back. Its normal for a few days then she adds me back and starts saying she still has feelings for me. Im confused because from what Stefan has been saying they both liked each other, flirted, sexted a little etc. I tell her we shouldnt talk like this and that im gonna remove her coz its unfair on Stefan so i remove her and she leaves the group chat again. I then tell Stefan worried shes messing us all around, he gets annoyed, they argue for a day and then things seem to go back to normal for them, they chat privately, call, carry on flirting and i assume Stefan thinks she likes him again? I hate seeing him online because i assume they are talking and makes me jealous.  


Now around 3 weeks ago she complains to Stefan that she's annoyed i removed her and she never got ""closure"". She keeps asking Stefan to ask me to talk to her, but i honestly dont want to as it just complicates things and i dont want the drama even though i still like her. Probably wrongly i add her back and we chat. She eventually admits feelings for me again. I tell my friend who says shes told him she likes him which she denies. She eventually admits to me/him that apparently she liked me the whole time and didnt want to hurt Stefans feelings and the reason she said she liked him was because i said i didnt way back at the start and she was hurt by the way i handled it.  


Stefan is upset for a week, pissed off understandably as he thinks shes just messed him around for months. All the months of tension build and i explode in a message to him saying hes being distant, putting her first over our friendship and essentially calling him selfish. He apologises and says he wants to talk to all of us. So we try and add her back to the group again saying no feelings this time just as friends.   


She joins, its normal. I talk to her in pms and so does he as well. After a week i admit liking her in pms after her asking if i had feelings too. We chat for 2 weeks, flirt maybe a little. I still dont like seeing them talk (i can see them both online so assume they are talking) So i have tried to get around that by leaving my phone in my car during work hours and trying not to think about it as i got really down during the middle of it all as i felt i was being ditched.  


Last week Stefan is quieter than usual, i assume its just stuff happening in his life, hes currently looking for a job etc so i leave it. I ask him mid week if hes ok and he says yea just cba talkin. Fair enough. It gets to the weekend and apparently hes been complaining to Zoe about me saying i called him selfish etc but im doing the same to him as he did to me. Talking to her in pms and he can see me online etc and it pisses him off/makes him jealous. Last night all 3 of us have a group call. He's pissed off, we speak, he also has a slight go at Zoe. Its pretty cringe because he says before i spoke to her she tooks 2 mins to respond to a message and now she takes 15. Like this is so immature i feel embarrassed talking about it. I apologise because i just want it all over and for things to go back to normal. He doesnt really accept the apology and is still pissed off and we end the call.  


Later last night Zoe tells me he calls her because he wanted to make sure shes ""ok"" apparently from what she said he was complaining about me saying he was being selfish but i did the same thing and thats his main problem. I get annoyed because weve been friends longer than hes known this girl and he wants to check if shes ok rather than checking on me after having a go at me? I goto sleep early and wake up this morning to messages from him saying he understands why i was pissed, he was angry because he felt like he was horrible to me and that he knows i put him first when i originally liked her so he could ""have her"".  


I accept the apology this morning but i still feel like hes annoyed. This has all been going on so long it makes me feel like im at school. Its immature drama of going back and fourth saying i like you, i like you etc. I genuinely like her but i think i currently dont have a problem because she said she likes me? Whether its true or not im not sure. But if she suddenly said she liked him i think id feel the same as he does. If im going to get jealous with them talking and he gets jealous with us talking idk what to do.

(i genuinely don’t care if you think it’s “toxic”)

and i blocked out all of the guy friends that i used to have, surprisingly, this had a positive affect on me. my boyfriend never had any girl friends to begin with.

although i have blocked every guy, there is this one guy that i haven’t blocked. we used to have a thing for each other but it never got further than flirting to be honest. and the reason i haven’t blocked him was because when i first met him, i unfortunately got him in a difficult situation where he had to leave the girl he liked (he liked her a lot, and had once cried to me about how much hen liked her) at the time, or he had to choose to stand by me. (i’m not going to explain the details as they are far too long)

and he chose me, someone who i had just met, chose me. nobody has ever done that for me. nobody, and i mean nobody, has ever stuck by my side and chose to trust my words. 

i had his back and he had mine, and i really appreciate that type of loyalty. so, of course i couldn’t just block him. what type of hypocrite would i be? 

my boyfriend doesn’t like this guy friend, let’s call the guy friend david. my boyfriend knows me and david had a thing, and they’ve once gotten in an argument when i tried making them get along so i gave up on that and just told me boyfriend that i had removed dan out of my life to avoid conflict.

i had truly stopped talking to dan for a very long time, about 3 months. and recently we started playing valorant together and just vibing, but i just feel guilty even though me and dan are generally not doing anything other than being friends and playing video games together.

i love my boyfriend more than everything, but i also consider dan someone who hasn’t left my side when he could’ve, how could i just betray someone like that?

i don’t plan on telling my boyfriend that i’m friends with dan again, and if he does find out, it’ll look very extremely suspicious in his eyes which is fair.

should i even tell him? if i do, what do i even say? it feels like anything i’ll say to him will just end up in a “he likes you, don’t act like he doesn’t” and he’ll think i’m cheating on him

My boyfriend (26M) and I(23F) have been together for 2 years, i would describe our relationship as any other, with our ups and downs but a lot of love, patience and understanding. Especially the last 5 months things were too good to be true, didn’t fight, always enjoyed every moment, compliments, gifts, saying i love you every chance we get and planning our future. One week ago we were talking about each other before we get into the relationship, basically just seeing each other, back then i was the one to fall in love first and i had confessed how i felt while he was the one who didn’t know if he likes me or not. I had a cycle of friends we would often hangout and i found out from another 2 friends that one guy from that cycle had feelings for me, tbh i had noticed but i was ignoring it for the sake of our friendship. The 2 friends were telling me to give him a chance since the other guy (my now bf) wasn’t sure about me. I started thinking that i could try this, but i never had any feelings for him and never felt any attraction but i told myself if things don’t work out i could give it a shot. 
Basically i confessed my boyfriend that this friend had feelings for me and back then i had thought of trying out with him if things didn’t work out and that we had had a sleepover with my group of friends but never anything happened because he (my bf) was the only one in my mind.
( i shouldn’t have said that, i realised) . He said okay no problem since i chose him.
Fast forward 3 days ago i meet with that friend who used to like me ( we hadn’t met for 2 years or spoke but he texted me saying he is going to move abroad  soon so he would like to meet for once) i asked my boyfriend if i could meet him and he said yes sure no problem. I do , it wasn’t just me it was also a friend from my old cycle of friends.
2 days ago i meet with my boyfriend, everything seemed okay until i said “I’m one of the best girls you could have ain’t i?” For fun, he turns and says “ hmm yea…. But you do things that annoy me” i asked what things? And basically he told me that I do not allow him to go out with girls we know that like him, but I went out with the guy that used to like me. I told him that it’s not the same and he ended up telling me about the girl that would invade our relationship in the past and acting like she’s in the relationship with him. I basically went crazy because of that I told him it’s not the same thing and if he didn’t want me to go out with him he should’ve told me and then he proceeded to tell me that he would like to meet his ex-gf and asked what would I say if he told me so. I told him that I would not like him to meet her solo and I would like to go with him if so. He told me he doesn’t want me to come. He has things to say to her I don’t need to know about. I told him that this was a relationship that ended four years ago. What else do you have left to say? He said he wanted to ask how is she&amp; why things didn’t work out for them. I got extremely mad. I told him he cannot do that since she has a relationship. He kept saying that this is his opinion and he wants to meet if possible. I kept saying that this is not an opinion and it’s very unethical to do. He kept saying i do not respect his opinion. 
We ended up fighting for two hours about it . 
I left crying, and we didn’t speak at all until the next day . The next day I told him again how I felt, and after fighting again, he said I’m disgusting and he hates me. I ask why he said that he said it’s because I do not respect his opinion and he hates people like that in that I’m a narcissistic shit. I asked why he says all that and he said because I said I am one of the best girls and this is a red flag for him and a narcissistic trait . 
Since then I’m left speechless, and very hurt  .  I still can’t believe he said that. I asked him if he believes all that, why is he with me?
He responded that he loves me, that’s why but my behaviour makes him disgusted about me.
He has not apologised since for these words.

Secondly, she does not really mind mentioning her previous sexual encounters and many of these were with married people. Third, she seems obsessed with  this guy from Twitter and she always finds an excuse to text her. Fourth, we talked about infidelity and she said sometimes the whole thing is complicated. Fifth, she said we are exclusive but she told me she gets on this gaming platform and talks to people innocently (but also added, I met two of my exes there).

She does all the cooking in the relationship and creates wonderful dishes for us to enjoy. She's an excellent home chef. The problem is, she consistently gives me way too much food.

The explanation is that she cooks more in order to use what we have and to make sure what we purchased doesn't go to waste. I am given a larger portion because I am larger and male. I suppose men generally do need to consume more than women... However, I work a desk job that isn't physically demanding or requires me to burn through a lot of calories. The chores at home aren't a grand workout either.

About half the time I cannot consume everything given to me unless I eat to the point I'm in pain. It's interpreted as wasteful or I didn't like what she cooked and she won't make it for me again. I tell her I enjoy it, but I can't eat it all. It can lead to an argument which includes calling me a baby or ungrateful.

Of course, this is my side of the story. I'm sure given her perspective, she would provide the labor of cooking, preparing, and cleaning. Also about the food waste we accumulate with the costs and time of shopping. How what she likes to cook can't always be stored in the fridge. How I, an adult, can't finish my meal and have to be coached like a child.

Buying less is the best solution I think. It takes a lot of effort and foresight to know exactly the amount we'll eat or what we want to eat or if we'll have guests over. We don't live close to grocery stores so stocking up is ideal (at least in time, fuel, and car wearing). It's yet an additional challenge to our lives.

So for some background, my ex (22m) and I had a little casual situation going with this friend back when we were still together. He always said that it was an equal thing but, now... Well, let's just say it doesn't look that way. 

My ex and I broke up over the summer, and both stayed friends with this guy (I never wanted to tell him he had to pick a side or anything, of course not). Since then my ex moved away, my friend and I have both stayed nearby. Whenever I go to see him there's always flirty humour, frequent discussions about sex etc, but he always stops short of actually doing anything. Most of the time I find myself getting my hopes up, because of the way he's talking or whatever, only for nothing to happen. 

This weekend, he went down to visit my ex. We are both on speaking terms, so I let him know that I knew my friend was coming to visit and there wasn't any awkwardness etc. My ex confessed that he had feelings still for this friend and may try asking him out. I won't lie, I wasn't happy about this, but I didn't want to be controlling or limit either of them in any way, they're both adults, so I didn't object to this at all. All I asked was that I not hear the details... All I needed was a yes or no as to whether or not I needed to change my thinking about this friend. 

Well, apparently this last message was lost in translation, as I ended up being told half a story without being given a straight answer, which then necessitated that I actually hear the other half to stop my imagination just running with it. This was exactly why I didn't want to hear the details, why I wanted as vague but certain an answer as possible, because now knowing what happened, I can't help but feel like my friend has been leading me on. It would be fine if he'd just told me months ago that he only was into my ex, and that I never stood a chance without him, but now I just feel like all his flirty jokes and everything were really unkind and idk how to move on. I was supposed to be catching up with him over a coffee today but I've called a rain check on that saying I've been feeling nauseous this morning (not untrue, even if the nature and reason for it is a little misleading). 

I really don't know how to move forward with this, I just can't stand that my friend would lead me on like this for months. Let him be with who he wants, idgaf about that, it's the fact that he hasn't been honest with me this whole time, and yet as soon as an opportunity arises with my ex he's happy as anything. Also the fact that I'm now wondering if there's anything else he thinks about me that he's keeping quiet. Has anyone been in a situation like this before?

I'm now inches away from blocking my ex on everything, he's broken so many boundaries by telling me these things in such a roundabout way, the only reason I haven't already is in case he has anything to say that might make me feel better about my friend.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604967,public,nsfw,Found out my (21m) friend (22m) has been leading me on for months?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0vuah/found_out_my_21m_friend_22m_has_been_leading_me/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,

Honestly everything about the relationship seemed amazing. Like i was super happy. She was super supportive and i was feeling on top of the world. 

This past Sunday i went to my mom and dads house to see family from out of state and my gf was not feeling well mentally she said so she wanted to stay home at her apartment which happens to be a 5 minute drive From my parents. Her mom lives in a different city 3 hours away. As i am hanging with my family my older sister who i am very close with comes to me and asks where my gf was. 

Me-“she wasn’t feeling well today so she stayed home”

Sister-“she seemed like she didn’t want to be there at all when we all met her and then she has skipped the last 4 or 5 times we all get together, did we do something wrong.?”

I was a little shocked as a did not expect my sister to think that. She realized my face looking a little like ‘uhhhh idk thats good question’ on my face realizing she has just skipped on seeing my family entirely in our relationship. I have a relationship with HER family and they all say the same thing about ME “its like he has been in the family forever he just fits” she has 0 relationship with mine and we live close. I have gone and meet so much of her family so much and she never hangs with mine. 

But as the night progresses. A sister in law, 2 of my sisters, my aunt all made a comment in some way shape or form about her not coming to hang with us ever. 

What killed me was at the end of the night i help my mom and dad clean up when everyone leaves,( im the youngest of fam) and when i told them everyone asked me this they said the same thing and that the family has even asked each other that. ‘They all notice you go to her families but never ours’. It actually made me reanalyze the relationship. I swear i was super happy but then being asked that and realizing made me think two things-

1 i should of made it clearer that my family is a priority to even myself and realized this because i consider them important

2 it bothers me that i put in time and effort into going to her families house on random occasions with her to her family 3 hours away and she wont hang with mine.

We met at our friend's wedding and started dating after a year or so.

My boyfriend is a person who likes himself a lot and has been very vocal about how he wants to put himself first. I don't have a problem with his self love but sometimes I feel he becomes a little selfish. He travels a lot for work. Every few months he has to travel abroad but the travel period is between 1 to 3 months. We did discuss the long distance when we started our relationship and it was going okay. 

A couple of months back he told me he is not taking any new project and would stay here for a while because he has been put in charge of something which requires him to stay here. So  we were talking about moving in together but things did not go as planned because of his work. In the beginning I sulked because of it, but I got over it. Two days back we talked and he told me that he thinks that I am not happy in this relationship since I am always sulking. I was stressed other things in life and pissed that our plan did not work. Other than that I did not have any problem with him. He said he thinks I have a problem with letting things go and that's the reason I am not ending it and not because I am happy. And somehow all these things have been suffocating to him and he wanted to end our relationship. He said he thinks this won't work in the long run because I want a guy who would be around me all the time. And he cannot do that guy and he won't be happy doing that. 

I somehow tried talking him out of it ending the relationship saying I was actually happy and just sad because of the other things( my career isn't really doing well and my mom isnt well). He kept telling how negative I was about everything and how I pulled him down. He said I wasn't appreciative of anything. I told him I would try not to sulk and try to be appreciative. But in the end he told me this relationship rides on my positivity and he is not sure. But he is willing to try.

The cafe is on a scenic route and frequented by retirees from nearby.

Just before shift started my friend texting me and said they felt ill - they had congestion, a runny nose, and were coughing etc. I said about doing a Covid test, which they said they would do it later. My country is currently in a “fourth wave” and cases have jumped 20 per cent in the space of 10 days. Gov advice is to test if symptomatic. Masks are back. 

They worked an 8 hour shift without doing a test. They said they felt fine, although coughing and runny nose. I thought it was bit yuck to be around food prep coughing. 

The next day they wanted to hang out. Still showing symptoms though. I replied that I would love to but only if we double check they’re negative to Covid. They down played it, saying that “it doesn’t matter”. I’ve explained that some of my social circle are considered vulnerable people (including grandparents and parents), and that I lost my previous job and a work colleague to the pandemic. 

They’ve pointed they worked a shift whilst sick, and I said It wasn’t really a good idea to do that because a lot of people could get sick in a short period of time. At one point I’ve said “how could you live with the fact if you’re made someone really ill or killed them? A test takes 5 mins”. The rest of the conversation was just outlining that Covid is spreading rapidly, and sick leave is available. They still have enough sick leave to cover a shift. 

They’ve then done a test and it is negative.

At that point there was no friction. It seemed like a normal conversation/slight disagreement. We’ve both been happy with the Covid test. 

The next morning they have messaged saying that I made them “feel like the worst person in the world”, that “I spoke to them like a child” and that “it’s all hypothetical anyways”. They can sometimes be a bit sensitive about topics - ie I spoke about gaining for weights and they said someone talking about weight gain and weight makes them feel uncomfortable. I normally just drop it and try to be respectful. 


Our initial disagreement was via text, so I explained I didn’t intend for to make them feel berated, and I apologised. I did state that I don’t want to be hanging out with someone who is infectious, regardless of who they are. I’ve offered to call or talk face-to-face, but I was blocked. 

I’m really at a loss at what I can do, and all this because of a stupid Covid test.

However, now I've not seen her for a month and she has canceled plans twice - originally we were going to have a 2 week break because she had some plans for concerts etc from before we met, which is fair, but since then she canceled our plans twice (one of which she organised) and has told me that she has been struggling with her mental health and depression badly and hadn't left the house for 2 weeks or been to work etc.

She doesn't really talk much anymore and I've asked her about it and she told me that it's not personal and she will definitely come to see me etc and that it's a when not and if we see eachother again, that she still likes me and she is back in work again now and I've told her she can talk to me about it etc if it helps but she just says that she doesn't know what to talk about and tbh I'm not really sure what to do anymore?

Tearing up as I’m typing this. 

In the beginning of me and my s/o’s relationship, I’ve already warned him that it’s my first time opening up my heart to someone and I never knew how to navigate. I wished I could’ve asked him to wait for me to become a better person first before we jump the gun, but he insisted that it didn’t matter so I let him.

He’s always been careful and treated me the best as he can—and me, I didn’t know I was treating him like shit (I’m not an emotional person and I acknowledge that I can be insensitive at times) and because of my insensitive ass, I’ve hurt him so many times in ways unimaginable (not related to cheating, I don’t fuck around with that and I hate cheaters).

I loved him as much as he did, but it was a one-pillared relationship. Whenever he wasn’t strong for the both of us we’d always falter because I was weak, made promises I couldn’t keep and took too long to get my shit together. Despite that, he had never stopped fighting for me, and all I did was give up when it became hard because I don’t fucking know what to do or what I should do to pick up the pieces. We’ve always talked about our problems, but I keep fucking up.

And the worst: I gave up when it mattered the most. I stopped fighting when we were on the brink of breaking up. And that scarred him, and it will scar and scare him forever into thinking that I wouldn’t fight for the two of us.

I hate coming to the internet for answers because we both have our own structures in a relationship, and I’ve always wanted to figure out things on my own.

But I truly love him and if me not being desperate enough doesn’t show that then I don’t know what will.

How do I change?
How do I help him?

This feels like the last straw. Do I even try to have a relationship anymore? 

This is something I'm having trouble letting go of so I could use some perspective.

My husband and I have been married for a few years, and we thought we weren't going to be able to have kids naturally because of fertility issues on my end. Well, shockingly, I'm pregnant. I've been in disbelief about it and scared and nervous and excited and just really emotional.

Well, a few weeks ago, we decided to tell people. My husband's family lives in Europe while we live in the US. We happened to be up late so we decided to call his mom. I showed her one of the old pregnancy tests. Her reaction, verbatim, was ""oh, you're pregnant."" No excitement. Nothing congratulatory. Just a statement of fact.

So then she says, ""so anyway, [my cat] lately has been doing this weird thing"" and then talks about the cat.

I love animals, too, and any other time, I would've loved to hear about the cat. But goddamn, could I not at least get a congratulations? I just kind of slid out of view of the camera and nearly started crying.

When my husband got off the phone, we both kind of thought maybe she was in shock or something else? She had agreed to tell my husband's dad and sister, and days pass, and I'd heard nothing from anyone about the pregnancy.

In contrast, my mom was giggling and laughing and crying, and my dad told me his last wish in life was to meet his grandchild in a super dramatic fashion and how I was making his greatest dream come true.

I know my husband's family isn't as warm as mine (my husband is super warm and affectionate, but he became that way through our relationship; he was very reserved and quiet when we first met), but it just hurts.

Through the years, we've gotten them Christmas presents and cards (during covid we couldn't see them because of travel restrictions), and we haven't gotten anything in return. I've made group chats and send them updates about our lives (lots of pics of my husband and our dog) and ask them how they are and just often get no responses at all even to direct questions. 

My husband's sister reached out once I posted publicly on Facebook about it weeks later and congratulated me and asked how I was feeling. I responded simply I was okay and thanked her, but it just feels like too little too late.

I met Marc (fictional name) on the first day of high school. In my country, secondary schools are attended from 14 to 19 years old. The friendship started almost immediately and grew a lot over time. We were always together at school. Marc didn't have a computer or internet (so no msn etc) and at that time we didn't have smartphones, sms and voice calls were expensive so we almost always spoke in person at school. His parents were very strict and hardly ever let him out after school. At 16, his parents became more permissive and we began to hang out together often after school. It was like having a female friend but better. I talked about my dreams, my crushes and boyfriend problems, he was a shoulder to cry on and a trusted friend. He was sweet and even gave me gifts.
Clearly Marc also had male friends, several afternoons he was at friends houses playing video games and such.

When high school finished, I looked for a job (I've never been the sharpest tool in the drawer) but Marc who was very smart enrolled in university. The university was 40 minutes away by train, so Marc stayed with his parents and took the train every day (which is common where I live, maybe it's different in America or elsewhere). So we were always in the same city. Also, his parents finally bought a computer with internet. We only saw each other once that fall, and then he ghosted me. At first I thought he was too busy with the university. In the meantime, I started working, my life had some changes and I realized that it had been years since I had heard from Marc. I looked for him on Facebook, but his profile was locked down. I met him by chance 5 years ago for a few minutes. I was at a charity event with a friend of mine when my friend's mother, who worked at the event, saw me and told me to wait. She started calling ""Marc Marc come on, you'll never guess who's there"" and then she pushed him to talk to me and my friend. He was intensely embarrassed, she told us that he was fine and working and then disappeared. I was very confused.

Fast forward to last night. I meet a friend of mine from high school, whose mother knows Marc's parents, and she tells me that he and his wife (?) are expecting their second child (??). Apparently Marc and his wife have been living in another region for several years and this explains why I have never met them in recent years.
Thought I'd contact him to congratulate him. My SO, who I met a few years ago and therefore doesn't know Marc, stopped me. They say that if Marc ghosted me maybe he had reasons and a message from me could destabilize him. Marc and I didn't fight and I don't understand what could be the cause.

When he got here he was drunk coming from the bar. We talked briefly but didnt address our issues. So he ended up falling asleep onthe couch I assumed it was bc he was super tired, he had never slept on the couch in the past only my bed and would be offfended if I suggest he sleep out there. So the next night he calls again around 2am, I answer he says hes 5 mins away, then he never came he said he decided to go home, I ft him and he answered he was in bedat his moms house. so last night of course he calls again , I let him come over, he sleeps on the couch again. This Time I tried to get him to come to the bed like pick him up and drag him off the couch, no luck he was acting like a limp rag doll, in hindsight he was probably faking so he didnt have to come in the bed. he woke up early both times and just left out, no his nothing. Its crazy how much the dynamic has changed, its like is the spark even still there? im telling myself its going to take time for us to trust each other again and that's why he refuses to ge in the bed only on the couch. my question is whyyyyy does he insist only sleeping on the couch? I thought things could go back to how they were before the fall out I guess not 

TLDR ex came back after ignoring my txts and maintaining were done forever for months he called asked to come over and slept on the couch???? Both nights,=.

Previous post for reference so you can see how in deep I am, ""i’m at rock bottom. ITs been 3 months I’m still stuck. Last night I had a few drinks and started calling him back to back, bc I was triggered from having running into him at the bar last weekend. So I’m calling , sent to voicemail. Keep calling I said idc I’m gonna call until you answer you are GOING to talk to me. Anyways a girl picks up and says why are u calling my bf’s phone. I say bf?? She says yeah what do you want. I said well I saw your bf last week at the bar all over every girl he could get his hands on sooo are you sure that’s your man ? ( petty I know ) but I was hurt and upset. So then she continues to taunt me saying he’s in her bed every night and I’m so mad I can’t have him and she’s got him on lock. She ends the call by saying stop calling my bfs f\*cking phone. I sat there in shock and disgust. I wanted to throw up. Out of embarrassment and sadness he really replaced me when for a year he told me he just ”wasn’t ready for a relationship”. And in 3 months he’s in a “relationship”. So after the call I didn’t stop there I texted him and called him every name in the book for having her answer instead of being man enough to face me he responded. “Lol me and my girl just sitting here reading every txt you send”. I’ve never been so embarrassed. Disrespected. Low. Hurt. I really loved this ”man” and gave him me 110% to be discarded and forgotten and laughed at. I’ve spent the day in bed, drinking, crying, looking for answers of how and when I let my situation get so pitiful.""

My (40m) SO (38f) of 15 years recently (4 months ago) found out her Dad is not her biological Father. Dad committed suicide 21 years ago when she was in high school and Mom kept the secret from everyone for nearly 38 years. I've been 100% supportive of her and what she wants to do moving forward and offered suggestions only when asked. She's been holding off telling anyone or contacting her bio Dad (alive and well next state over) or her new half brothers until she's had a chance to talk to the brother she was raised with (super head case with likely undiagnosed schizophrenia) and that's where she's been stuck since finding out. My reason for reaching out is that we've hit a rough patch in our relationship due to excessive drinking on her part (I can only assume it's related). This morning was rough. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot of my job 2 hours before I need to be here because I can't sleep. Yesterday she was in a mood and left the house in the evening without telling me or our kids (teens) where she was going which in itself isn't concerning, just out of character for her. When she got home she'd obviously been drinking (not drunk) and wouldn't make eye contact or communicate with me. This morning when I woke up at 3am to the sounds of something in my kitchen I got up and she wasn't in bed. She was on the kitchen floor crying and when I asked what was wrong she said ""nothing, why are you awake?"" I said I heard her crying and wanted to know if she was OK. She instantly got irritated and told me nothing was wrong. I said something like ok yeah, sitting on the kitchen floor in the dark, crying is definitely normal (probably with more attitude than I meant). She said well maybe I just don't want to talk to you and that hurt. I took the dog out, smoked a butt and while I was out there heard her car start up and saw the headlights come on. I walked around front and asked what her problem was and all she said was ""what's your fuxking problem"" and I said ""You are!"" And pointed my finger at her and said go grab another bottle of wine I'm sure that will help. Obviously not my finest moment. I went back in the house and at this point was so wound up I just got dressed and went to work. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to handle this when I go home tonight.

Hello everyone,I don’t know from where to start honestly but I’ll do my best and please be kind in comments.
I(27) met my husband(32) 2 years ago, we had a long distance relationship, we have met in those two years few times, it was like every other relationship with ups and downs but love was there,and also happiness,dreams, promises…
At the end we decided to marry and I move in  to his country.
On this last July we got married and I moved with him to Netherlands…from that day and we are going down hill.
He’s an extremely nervous and rageous like  starts really shouting and slamming doors throwing things for stupid reasons like putting the wrong trash bins plastic, using the wrong towels to dry up the dishes,forgetting to do laundry,he drops something…etc, then after this he leaves the house for 1 or 2 hours driving around to cool off…this like the first 15 days after our wedding ,we didn’t go have any honeymoon.
After that things got escalated ;one day we were talking about his behaviour and it ended in a fight where he spat on me and leave again for two hours  and came back crying asking for forgiveness but just matter of time and he did it again  for trying to understand the whys of his behaviour,While I’m trying to understand him.
Yesterday he woke up we talked normal he sat to watch tv then suddenly he got angry and went to bathroom and start shutting doors and shouting , he spent the whole day like this at night i told him « I don’t validate this behaviour if something bothering you please come and talk with me » he then like got possessed comes furiously to me I jumped to the sofa he squeezed my face and pulling my hair roughly saying « SAY IT AGAIN !!!I’m  sending you to your home » while he was squeezing my face i started crying he said  « here we go with crying thing »i felt extremely humiliated
 The moment he let my face out  I run out and went out of the house at 9pm , freezing outside , but I have literally no one here so I just walked around and came back home, I found him on sofa watching YouTube and drinking coffee really unbothered.
I have no one to talk with, no friends no family literally no one, I thought i have found  my everything.
I would never in million years imagine I’ll end up in an abusing marriage,now I see my options ,I’m from a conservative arabic family(my husband isn’t Arabic for the record)getting a divorce is really impossible at this stage please understand this ,I have few days till I get a social number so I can work and at least get out of house some time .
Now I don’t know how you can help me since I already narrowed the options I only wanted to share and talk with someone else and maybe give me some solutions that I dont see or know about.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7604846,public,self,I’m trapped,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z0vepg/im_trapped/,all_ads,6,,,

So me and my boyfriend have been long distance dating for three months. A couple of weeks ago I was on Facebook, and I was a bit surprised to see an account suggested to me with a picture of my boyfriend under a completely different name. I’ll use other names to explain since I don’t want to use his real name or the name of the account, but let’s say my boyfriend’s name is Liam Roberts and the account goes by Evan Flores. I didn’t want to think much of it, especially because this is my first relationship and I’m scared to overreact or make a big deal out of things I shouldn’t. However, curiosity got the best of me and I clicked on the account to see what was on it. 

The first thing that stood out to me was that his relationship status said married. ( I know, I know, hear me out please). I was trying not to freak out when I saw that especially because it says he was married in 2016 and he would’ve been 17 at the time. I remember when I was younger, lots of high school and middle school couples would put married statuses with their boyfriend/girlfriend so I just assumed it was that. Especially since no person was attached to the status. (I realize this sounds like me making excuses for him.) There wasn’t a lot I could see of this account, but it had definitely been around for many years. 

I contemplated on bringing this up casually in conversation, but then I decided not too since I came to the conclusion that doing so would be me making a big deal out of nothing. That was until I realized he blocked my facebook account from that secret account. I cannot see the Evan Flores account at all anymore. He used to like his profile pictures from that account, so when I didn’t see it anymore I became a little suspicious. My sister let me use her account to see if he had deactivated the account or if he had just blocked me. Sure enough when I looked up the account name it came up, which meant he had blocked my account.

Here’s what is making me overthink things:
- When I first added him on facebook he made on off hand comment that he was nervous about adding me. I even told him he didn’t have to add me if it really made him that nervous to, but then he played it off saying he was joking. 
- Some of the people on the Liam Roberts account have him friended on the Evan Flores account. Not a lot though, just a couple. 
- He has no idea I know of this account, so why did he block me? 
- The information that I can see on this account is very different to the information I know about him. HIs workplace, birthday, and city are different. Which is weird since I know for a fact at least what city he lives in. Although he’s never told me his birthday, just his birth month. 
- And last of all, the thing that has made me practically paranoid about this, is a couple of months back before we met in person, we had a little random conversation on nicknames/middle names. I was going on about how I didn’t have a middle name and telling him about the nicknames my family gave me. I asked him I if he had a middle name, he said no, so then I asked him what his full name was out of curiousity (because the last name on his Snapchat is different from the last name on his Instagram and Facebook.) He got really defensive, even sounded annoyed that I asked, and said “ You already know my name.” And then changed the subject of the conversation. 

Please let me know if I am just overthinking this, or if I am right to be suspicious. My head is currently bubbling with theories and its driving me crazy.

So I (29m) married my now wife (31f) in April of this year. We've been together almost 7 years. My wife had 2 children from a previous relationship who I've raised with her since they were 2 &amp; 4. I love them like my own but given the age of them now they can be a little difficult at time, especially the eldest starting high school with his hormonal changes etc. I've always wanted my own child and she's always said she would do it for me, she doesn't necessarily want that as much as me but, she would do it. We've been having unprotected sex for 6 years and never conceived. 

Whenever we have a challenging time with the kids my wife goes completely off the idea of having another baby and it leaves me caught in the middle. I love her more than anything, I'd never want to leave her. But... I really want a baby. I'm at the point where I'm like okay well we will just see what happens and if we get pregnant then great, if not then it's obviously just not meant to be.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? If so, what did you do?
