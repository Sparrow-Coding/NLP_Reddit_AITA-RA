A lonely one at that. At this time, I only have one good friend. She has, up until now, identified as a lesbian. However, she has started to have romantic feelings for a man, they’ve hit it off and are presumably dating.

Though I tried to hide it, I couldn’t help but be jealous that someone I thought had no interest in men found it so easy to find one that exactly suited her interests. I had been leaving my comfort zone to meet internet strangers only to be rejected and the first guy that she has feelings for likes her back. 

I was trying to hold it in but she comes to me about every romantic pursuit she has. She spent a week or so boasting about how amazing this guy was and how much he cares about her. And while I wanted to be happy for her, and I was, my jealousy was stronger.

I don’t like secrets and I didn’t want our friendship to get to a point where I took my jealousy out on her. So, about a week ago, I honestly told her how I felt. I said that although I know it’s unhealthy and not her fault, I was feeling jealousy towards her newfound relationship. Because she comes to me often to talk about her relationships, I asked that for this one, she didn’t share.  That’s all I wanted. Again, I reiterated that this is unhealthy on my end and something I have to work on. But I just couldn’t help the feelings that I was feeling. 

It just frustrated me to no end that I had put so much effort into finding someone for me, meanwhile a woman who for her majority of her life identified as a lesbian, stumbled into her male soulmate. 

And now we haven’t spoken in a couple days, nor has she been responding to my texts. I feel as though I’ve ruined things and if so, it is absolutely my fault. In a moment of weakness I managed to ruin a yearslong friendship over petty jealousy.

She hasn’t mentioned anything, and hasn’t shown any anger with me so I’m unsure if this is what did it given that it happened over a week ago. She is the type of person to talk things through first and she hasn’t done that yet so I’m still holding out hope.

I (49f) met my BFF (45f/55m) online nineteen years ago in a 3D online world where I worked. She never spoke on voice chat or shared RL pictures with anyone, which was a little strange but I don’t really like talking on the phone much anyway and seldom joined group chat calls. BFF wanted to keep her online life and her offline life separate, so while we imparted many details and experiences of our lives, we only socialized online. There was nothing malicious about the situation, and so I just took her at face value and we became super close. Most of my friends tend to be male, and for me to find a female who I could be authentic with and speak my mind to without apprehension was amazing and I treasured my dear BFF. We were so similar and yet completely different and it just worked. My life partner (53m) and I did discuss that we thought BFF had a crush on me, but it was never really an issue that I had to skirt too much. Plus, BFF was just a friendly flirt sort of personality and I’d seen her that way with others, it was part of her charm.  


Nearly five years ago my BFF’s estranged mother passed suddenly. No one in their family was close to her, she’d burned all her bridges and was a lifetime alcoholic. She knew she was sick but only went to the hospital when she was on the brink of death: she went into emergency and passed five days later in ICU from her lifestyle and untreated cancer. My BFF went into a tail spin. She told me what happened and then a couple days later vanished. I had no way to get a hold of her and could only leave messages she was not logging in to receive. We spoke once briefly, a year and a half later, she let me know she was alive but that things were different now without disclosing too much. Then nearly another year later she came back and asked to speak to me on the phone, which was surprisingly random.  
 

The thing is, my BFF wasn’t a woman, and that was the big secret he’d been hiding all these years which kept him from speaking to me beyond text. He was a heterosexual male older than me whereas I’d been told he was a younger bi female who lived with a man and only dated women online. Clearly many things had been fudged, such as life experiences, mentality, and so forth, and I had to discern what had been real and what had not. It was a huge unveiling to contend with.  


On one hand I was finally hearing the voice of BFF and we were laughing and carrying on and it felt wonderful to talk to BFF after two and a half years of not knowing if s/he was okay... But on the other, my head was spinning because this was fifteen years into our friendship. He even said he knew he could have told me and it would have been fine with me, but he had never intended to tell anyone who he really was. Again, not malicious as it was something he and a friend did making those accounts as women to begin with, but it still rocked my trust to be misled for fifteen years (and knowing how many others have been misled socially and romantically). A catfish is still a catfish. Also, the earlier estimations of BFF having a crush on me were confirmed by BFF, but he said he was past it.  


He began calling me regularly and would pin me on the phone for hours at a time while he did most of the talking. I am not a telephone person, and no matter how many times I conveyed this, he brushed it off. He would make me feel guilty for wanting to hang up after many hours, even if it was because my life partner was home and I wanted to spend time with him, or I had things to do, or it was late at night and we were in bed trying to sleep. I would even tell him I didn’t want to talk on the phone so much and that he could message me online if he wanted to chat, but he preferred telephone to text. The more we spoke, the less I felt like I had my BFF at all.  Ideally a gender swap should mean little, but it was so much more than that which I had to adjust to. The familiarizing via phone showed me how different BFF was versus his fabricated persona online.  
 

I had to come to terms with the very real issue that my BFF did not exist and this new person was standing there in her place. Everything our friendship had been based on and the things we did for fun or talked about or when sharing our deepest selves with one another were removed from the equation now. We were no longer us, if that makes any sense. It was a big transition and I really tried because I love BFF to pieces… But at the same time I was mourning the loss of my kindred sister. I greatly admired BFF before, she was a remarkable, confident woman, but the reality of him was very different.  


When his mother had passed, he went into crisis mode over the loss as he was reminded of his own mortality. He decided to do the opposite of everything he had been doing previously, and so he stopped taking care of himself, got a job in a restaurant as a busboy, began drinking heavily and trying to hang out with a 20-something crowd who worked at the restaurant and have relationships with 20-something women. Every phone call became him going on and on about these disturbed women he was having sex with and oversharing details, or the drugs and the drinking, or other poor life choices he made while partying with a crowd half his age. He was out of control and in denial, and I couldn’t do anything. Nothing I said seemed to impact his decision making, he did not want out of his new boozy midlife crisis.  


Meanwhile, my RL was crashing around me as issues arose with my life partner and his relapse back into alcoholism, among other things. Mounting circumstance and stress triggered my own catastrophic breakdown. I’m highly introverted when under duress, and I had a lot to handle on my own, but my partner needed me. BFF was not at a point where he was acknowledging he needed help, he just kept draining me with all his drama and refusal to make better choices for himself. To be fair, BFF did let me bend his ear several times during the initial breakdown, I am forever grateful for that… Even though he was trying to convince me to break up with my partner. In any case, I made a decision: I chose to focus on myself and my partner and getting us to a healthier place in our lives. (After several tries, we did get my partner successful therapy and he is sober once more, but it was not an easy ride and took time. As for myself, I am doing better now, but it’s taken me four years to get to this stage of ‘better.’)  


BFF and I have been touch and go over the last several years since all this went down. I no longer work in that 3D world, so phone is the only way he can get a hold of me now. He texts or calls me periodically but I rarely respond/answer. I don’t feel like this person is my BFF anymore. I don’t see the two personalities overlapping anymore, I see the person who essentially deleted my BFF and tried to take her place. It’s not a vindictive or wounded view, just that I really miss the person who he pretended to be. I miss the fierce woman who I learned so much about myself from, my soul sister. I guess the time apart gave me a different perspective on the friendship, but even writing about “her” makes my heart hurt because I miss my BFF from long ago. I do think of him even though we don’t speak much, but I am pensive about being sucked back into the saga of his self-destruction.  


He called me a week and a half ago but I did not answer. He called again the next day, so I picked up thinking something may be amiss. As I was explaining he’d called too late the night prior and we’d gone to bed, he cuts me off and tells me he has Leukemia. Just like that. Boom. I could tell he was afraid, I could tell that he needed me. So I let him talk. He’s been diagnosed, but he had to go in for a scan then see an oncologist to learn what stage and how bad. His mother died of cancer, as did his grandmother, outlook not good in his estimation. He’s still drinking and partying, even bragged about a big bottle of tequila he shared with a friend the night prior. He’d waited until many of his lymph nodes were severely swollen and other symptoms arose before going to see a doctor. It dawned on me that in a span of five years he had, essentially, transformed himself into his mother and now might be facing the same end as her.  


During the course of this conversation, he invited himself to come stay with me for Christmas. My partner was sitting a few feet away and I could see his exaggerated head shake to tell me ‘no way.’ I was baffled, I stammered. So BFF said, “Oh, that’s okay, I was only joking anyway.” But I’m not sure that he was. I think he’s scared and he doesn’t want to be alone and I can empathize with that and the gazillion other thoughts panicking/upsetting him. Sickness and potential end of life, it is a huge, scary nightmare to face. However, I live in a single bedroom apartment two states away with another person and two cats. We don’t even have a proper couch, only a love seat. There is literally no place for him to stay here. Even if there were, I don’t know if I want to bring his crazy drunkenness into my life and that of my partner who is in recovery. And yet, I feel awful for not wanting him at this time when he should be with someone. I know he has his sister and brother near him, I hope one of them will take him in for Christmas. He meets with his oncologist in a couple days to learn how bad the cancer might be and his chances.  


So there it is. I’ve lost one of the closest, truest friends I ever had once already, because they were only a playful charade someone enjoyed pretending to be. Now I may lose him again forever if his genetics prove to hold more sway than the fight he’s about to enter. I can’t help feeling bad for maintaining a degree of distance from BFF and not bringing him all the way up north for the holidays. However, we’ve never even met or ever spoke about doing so. The idea sets off alarms for me. I did text him since to let him know I am here. I am not abandoning him, but he is kind of like a stranger to me in many respects even though we’ve been chatting for nineteen years.  


Update: I wrote this post a couple days ago while trying to figure my head out, but I did not put it up for public consumption 'til now. I’m still kind of iffy about the whole situation and trying to figure out where I stand in all of this. I do care for him, for who he was when he was my BFF, but how involved am I supposed to be after all this time and all we’ve been through? He feels more like someone I used to know ‘once upon a time.’ I just.. I don't want him to be alone through all of this, no one should experience that.  


Right now the ball is in his court. Today was his first visit with the oncologist to determine how bad and what can possibly be done. I texted him a few hours ago as I said I would, and he has not responded. Which leads me to believe he either got very bad news, is absolutely overwhelmed (who wouldn’t be?), and/or he immediately went to self medicate. I just hope he’s in the company of people who he can lean on and won’t lead him astray.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7610730,public,self,My BFF was diagnosed with Lymphoma and I told him that he couldn’t spend Christmas with me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z1idi0/my_bff_was_diagnosed_with_lymphoma_and_i_told_him/,all_ads,6,,,,

He graduated from Ohio State University and apparently they have a big rivalry game this week, and a tradition is to remove the presence of the letter “M”. This is the second rivalry game we’ve been together for, but last year he went to Virginia for thanksgiving, so this is the first time we’ve actually experienced this. My fear is that he’s taking this too seriously. He crosses out M on basically everything around the house, from the posters to the food packets. The part where I drew the line is when I wore a shirt with the letter M in it and he crossed it out with a marker. He also won’t talk to my brother, which he frequently does, for the rest of the week because my brother went to Michigan.

I was confused and heart broken. It was so perfect and I never really thought this could happen.

After several weeks of him apologizing, I decided to give it another chance. We picked up track and it seemed to have been going great. I met his family, we spent every single day together. We were so happy, planning trips, joking, laughing etc.

One day he told me I wasn't the same person anymore and that I turned very insecure. He said he needed a break. I was lost and confused because we were doing so great. He asked for space and I gave it. I then got a call from this guy who told me that A had followed his ex girlfriend's car to her hookup buddy's house and created a whole scene.

I reached there only to find A there with her. I went up to him and asked him what was going on. He said he couldn't do this with me. That he loves her and cant live without her. That he was sorry but it was her he wanted.

I felt like an idiot but I wished them the best and left. During this time I found out he always denied having a relationship with me, told her we're just friends and that they still met and kissed behind my back.

I made it clear that I dont want to get back with him because I am so traumatized and cant trust him but he is so persistent and swears up and down that he loves me more than I could imagine and that he will harm himself if I didnt get back with him.

i cant rap around my head how someone who really cared about you and was always there for u just stopped carring


my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc he said he was depressed and suicidal etc and felt like he wasted his time with me when he could have gotten a better internship etc

it was bad bc we hadnt had sex in 2 months and just i felt pushed aside. 

we break up and well i beg and cry and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
“ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…” i beg cry and say all i did for him etc


then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me and missed the sex 

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building 

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels but said he would make it up to me

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety

i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later he
screenshots someone's story on instagram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz”

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it


i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text
im
scared” 

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

he comes back hours later and talks to some girl next to me. and i pass by and look at each other and wave and i leave

i think ive lost most of my feelings im just concerned at the fact that he saw that i wasnt the one… what is the one? and why arent i the one?

i texted him
today only to ask him about some file i needed and called him by his full name. he was shocked i said it that way as i always call him sam. and he told
me if he finds it he will give it to me.

i ended up saying “u know what its fine we will figure it out” and thats that…

Due to some medical history I was very afraid of not finding the one and no one saying yes to me ever. Suddenly at a new workplace I came across a married man(Mr. X) with two kids who could understand me and I opened up thinking the fact that he will not try to use me and can be a good friend. However over time I couldn’t help but fall for him. One side it use to kill me that how will I face his wife what have I done to another lady and on the other side the emotional comfort that he use to give me. He told me that he wants to marry me but I was clear to not break someone’s family. My itch for stability and to be a WIFE went strong and I told my family to start looking for a guy for me as I want to get married and very seriously started looking out for marriage proposals. X told me that he loves me and would like me to be settled in life and have a happy family. He started helping me out filter marriage proposals but as and when anything use to work out for me he use to question me, ask me to say no, abuse me. What was my fault if I wanted a normal healthy happy family of my own.
This kept on happening and he became very toxic towards me… pushed me to extremes that I started having panic attacks. 
Then moved back to my home town and marriage rista thing kept on going on. Just that I had set boundaries with X in terms of not sharing my call details and chat screenshot with the guys I was talking to to understand for marriage. Meanwhile after a few months my marriage got fixed. X first tried to convince me to break it which I didn’t as I knew that this is for me. A man has said yes to make me his WIFE, which is the biggest thing a man can do. I stopped talking to X from a degree of 10 to 1 which made him go mad and he once called my fiance as well. It scared me like anything as I didn’t want to loose that man who wanted to make me his forever. After a few days I met X and made it clear that I am not breaking it amd this marriage is happening. X then came positively and said that is okay to loose me as he loves but just wants me to keep him notified of my life. Internally I was scared of X ruining everything for me by telling my family or fiance. Scared more as it was not a normal relationship. I know relationship with a married man will never be seen right no what led to it. I couldn’t cry to anyone tell anyone what all I was going through as no one would understand. Before marriage I met X 3 times. Last time because he wanted to let me go with good memories about him and wanted to say sorry for all the toxicity. Wherein he just kept on saying that I want you to have a nice life just keep on telling me what is going on in your life.
I hardly spoke to him post for a month before marriage and it drew him crazy. He was messaging me on wedding function days which I didn’t reply to. I didn’t have any emotion for him at all. 2 days Post marriage i replied to him saying I need time in my family🙏🏼 and that I love him (to pacify the fire that could destroy my marriage). And never spoke to him post that. He emailed me as well which I deleted and never replied to.
Other side I was scared of anyone getting to know about all this. I wanted a blissful married life with my husband. I never dated anyone because I wanted a forever relationship don’t know how I got into all this. A few days later my husband confronted me as he had doubts. I was very reluctant in telling him alla this because it was a truth that i myself couldn’t accept. I accepted it in front of my husband which was a very difficult thing. Since then we had multiple discussions on it with multiple things coming up for discussion. Now my husband everything when where what. Like everything. He has been very understanding of everything but I did hurt him. He feels betrayed for that fact that I met X even after marriage was fixed. Little did he know I dod it to save the marrige and to make things clear that this marrigae is happening no matter what. I married my husband with all my heart and emotions and don’t want to loose him. My everything is from him and no where else. My existence doesn’t matter without him.
He feels I lied to him and betrayed but I was scared of loosing him. Now he wants t separate and he he cannot accept that All this happened at the time of foundation. 
Apart from all this during entire courtship period mu husband was hardly interested in knowing me better. He did mention that he cant take lies but never told me about his past girlfriend because of whom he said no to me earlier. Never told me  that she met his family too and he took me to same hotel that he use to stay with her at. 
Not trying to put it on him but all I know is I want him, I want to stay with him forever and no where else. Only place I see without him is to die and nothing else.
He is scared that it will happen in future again but how to tell him nothing is and can be of more importance to me then him. 
Keep me in front of anyman and I will not even look at anyone else other then my husband.

We’ve been fighting on and off for the over 3 years we’ve been together. Most of the fights are the same, honestly. they tend to revolve around my not taking care of myself, which is particularly problematic given my diagnosis.

My boyfriend is very athletic and was a collegiate athlete. I’ve never been athletic and have different passions: mental health advocacy, writing, and teaching.

I’m just under 150 pounds, about 5’10, and he’s 5’9 over 150 but with more muscle than I have. He’s always encouraged me to work out, using my mental health as an excuse.

I like running (usually run between 3-5 mi but recently injured myself running longer lol), and I’m down to try some workout classes, but he’s been pushing lifting, which I’m less excited about, and also has made comments about my diet, which I do struggle with. Most of his comments are about my eating less or eating healthier, but I’m mostly concerned by some of the comments he’s made regarding how he thinks 135 would be a good weight for me and how I should weigh myself every day to see if I’m on track to lose weight.

I think it might have more to do with his own insecurity at times; He has expressed wanting to feel bigger in comparison to me, and I know his height is a source of insecurity for him.

he’s even made workout plans for me in the past and then gotten mad at me for not sticking to them. not sure if this is worthy of note, but I got a new job recently, and I think it’s throwing off my routine, so things have been extra hard with working out lately.

I don’t understand what I’m feeling. (I’m sorry this going to be long, I am having a meltdown).

My boyfriend treats me better than I have ever been treated. He is a walking green flag. We have been together for 7months officially, but have known each other for much longer.

The ‘other guy’ is friends with my bf and asked me out a year ago when things were only starting with my now bf (he didn’t know about that). I rejected him and told my now bf about it. They are still good friends and now flatmates.

The other guy:
I admire this man. He is incredibly smart and I have deep conversations with him, which are the exact same things that I loved dearly about my ex. 

I don’t have these kinds of conversations with my bf. My ex broke up with me 3 years ago, but I still have not completely healed (from the trauma; there are no romantic feelings left whatsoever). We connected on such a deep level. And this other guy reminds me of that bond I used to have. I think I rejected him, because I didn’t feel ready to be with him.

But then I ended up with my now boyfriend. Tbh I don’t know how that happened, but I guess he made it feel so easy. I feel safe and cared for (so much more than I did with my ex). Everything is easy with my bf and he makes me happier than I ever remember being. But somehow I always feel like we lack this “deeper” connection. He has never struggled with mental illness and is generally care free. I have the feeling that I cannot open up to him like I could to my ex or to this other guy. I have suffered tremendously from depression and an eating disorder. My ex also struggled with mental health which gave us a deeper understanding of one another. I trusted him like no one else. My mental struggles led my ex to break up with me in the end, but we were both not happy in the relationship.
I have a very toxic relationship to my mother and my father is barely present.
My ex was incredibly intelligent and good with words and language. These qualities are super important to me.
The ’other guy‘ checks all of these boxes whereas my bf doesn’t. 

I feel like my bf will never understand me as deeply as my ex did or as the other guy could. I know that in theory I could tell him anything but it’s not the same. 
I like him so so much that it fills my whole being, but I am not sure that I love him, because it just doesn’t feel the same way it used to with my ex. (But it’s a different person, and I am doing much better, so maybe that’s a good thing. I just don’t recognise what I am feeling as love.)

My bf is very good at science but not at all with words. He doesn’t have that specific spark of intelligence which I admire so much and see in the other guy. In the past couple of weeks I keep questioning whether I might have feelings for the other guy. I can’t stop thinking about him. I feel horrible. I don’t understand why I’m chasing this feeling so badly. I have always craved deep connection. But someone who makes me happy might be worth  so much more! I am a horrible person for comparing my bf to someone who never prioritised me and didn’t make me happy, when he has done nothing but that. Then again should I settle for a more shallow connection when I have always craved deep understanding? But why am I looking to ruin the happiness that I have?
My bf is so loving and caring, that it is almost too sweet to handle, like I am chocking on the love I am receiving. It feels unbearable sometimes. I don’t deserve him.

I played the scenario of admitting my feelings to the other guy out in my head and started crying uncontrollably just at the thought of hurting my boyfriend like that. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I know that he loves me dearly. 

I’m not sure whether I even like the other guy. But why can’t I stop thinking about him? I feel so guilty for not being honest with my bf. 

The other guy literally asked me out and I rejected him.
For some reason I am also certain it wouldn’t work out with him, even if I did leave my bf for him now. Why do I keep chasing what I can’t have?? 

I have the feeling I am self-sabotaging. Maybe because I don’t feel worthy of my bfs love, maybe because I am brainwashed by my last relationship into thinking that the feeling. My ex gave me is what I need to seek out for. 

I think I just have no idea what love even feels like. Maybe I am broken. 

I cannot talk about this to anyone. 
I am so sorry.

I have feelings for my friend, I never told him. There are times I thought he was interested in me, he has flat out said I was attractive before. I have tried to flirt back somewhat but I am shy in that regard and I wonder if it translated and he just wasnt interested  enough or if he didn't know I was interested.

It seems he is trying to date someone else in the friend group, he has invited her over to her house and when I asked him about it he more or less confirmed it was a date. This was last week.  


I don't know if I missed my window or if he was never that into me - but regardless I just want general advice to not feel so bad about it. He and I talk every week or so because we play a game together and I see him at school at least once a week. I really like spending time with him and I value our friendship, its just hard for those feelings to not come back and its hard not to feel bad when he is out with her or just not paying as much attention to me in general.

We had a very passionate relationship for about 2 years until we broke up because we both cheated on each other in drunken college bar makeout mistakes. We continued on/off for another year after that trying to fix what we had, but it always came back to her not being able to forgive me but I could forgive her. She was very emotionally abusive towards me during this time and always led me on, then would ghost me for a couple weeks and come back - constant mind games like this. In the end, I got the whole ""I am just not ready for this relationship.. I'm not happy with myself.. I think we are meant for each other just not right now"" 

Anyways, after that year of on/off , we have essentially been no contact (since Sep 2020) because I could not handle being in touch with her even though she wanted to be friends. I would describe this as the worst time of my life because I was deeply in love with her and didn't want things to end at all. 

I adjusted the best I could during the past two years and mostly got over it by \~Jan 2022. She texts me earlier last week to meet up for drinks after all this time. Of course, I agree to go. We ended up having a great time and after too much to drink, she's all over me kissing and asking me if I still love her (I said yeah like an idiot). The next day, she picks me up to go out on another date and once again we were acting like a couple, having a great time. 

I worked so hard and have achieved a lot in this time and recently set myself up in a lucrative career path. This is relevant because my family is pissed at me and thinks it's clear as day she wants to use me for a way out (she dropped out and is living with parents for the foreseeable future). My friends also think she wants to use me. 

I don't care about what she has going for her career-wise; I value how much fun we have together and the sense of timelessness when I am with her. I fully value her and just want to treat her well, but I never want to go back to how I felt when I was heart broken EVER.

I came from a high class household with wonderful parents who were extremely successful business owners, and I went to private school and got to go to an Ivy League college. I’m aware how privileged I am and how I haven’t truly struggled like other people have in this world, but that’s just how it is.

A few months ago I started dating this insanely wonderful guy (25). He makes me feel safe and respects me like no other guy ever has and he makes me feel cherished and loved. He on the other hand grew up in a lower-middle class household with abusive parents and not many luxuries and his parents didn’t care to provide him with many. He told me he’s paid for every gaming console he’s ever had and he’s fully financed every hobby he’s had ever since he was 12, and he’s paid for a lot of his current possessions and necessities. In terms of education, he went to community college and got a degree in media, so right now he works on movie productions and then works at a movie theater when he doesn’t have a production to be on (and there’s nothing wrong with that! Please don’t misinterpret me)

My parents have been really excited to meet him because of how much I’ve been raving about him and they said I seem so much happier than I have with any of my previous boyfriends and he sounds so much better to me. My boyfriend was nervous because he was scared they wouldn’t find his work/education satisfactory. He had never had a girlfriend before me so this was his first time ever meeting the parents. I told him they’d love him and I didn’t give a shit if they didn’t because I love him.
(one more thing about him, he’s on the spectrum so he gets really worried people find him weird)

My parents took us into the city to this extremely fancy restaurant, and okay I’m gonna say: I think the night went really well. My parents think he’s wonderful and level headed and they really want to go out again. However, my boyfriend thinks he embarrassed me and himself because of the way he acted. Here are a few things that happened he’s embarrassed about:

- The waiter brought out a really expensive bottle of wine my parents ordered and my boyfriend had to tell them he doesn’t drink and asked if he could have a Coke instead.

- He doesn’t do the best with unfamiliar foods and he wasn’t familiar with most of the stuff on the menu and tried to very quietly ask me about it while trying to find something he would eat (“is that like sesame chicken?” “They probably don’t have burgers, right?” “is that similar to something you could get at Olive Garden?”). My mom tried to offer to help at one point but he said it was ok.

- They asked him what he did for a living right after they told him my sister had got a pretty high class job in Portland, and he was extremely ashamed to tell them he was “working two entry level jobs that both pay minimum wage” but they were opened minded and asked if he had worked with anyone famous and he got to share some stories.

- My mom ordered us oysters and he had no idea how to eat them since he’d never had them before, so he started trying to eat it with a fork and we had to show him the traditional method.

- He didn’t eat much of what he ordered because it was really different from what he normally eats, and my mom felt bad and asked if he wanted to go to another restaurant afterwards so he would have something he likes he to eat, but he shut it down.

My mom told me afterwards he was such a nice guy and “a real cutie” and my dad seemed happy with him. However, my boyfriend is convinced he made a bad impression and was “disrespectful” to their efforts. He was really overwhelmed by it and feels like he did a bad job and I don’t know what I can do to convince him he didn’t mess up and it’s fine. He seems ashamed of himself as a person for acting the way he did and for having to tell them about himself.

I’m not sure what to do here. Any advice will be helpful.

Then however she got into a like legit relationship with the girl she told me not to worry about because “she wasn’t into girls.” Well whatever. I became a hoe and slept with quite a few people all men and I’m a lesbian. Hate sleeping with men. But I knew it’d upset her. Anyways, she was with this girl, then we started talking, and got back together. She called it off with said girl, but stayed friends i guess. Well she FaceTimed this girl behind my back “to talk to her kid” but she hid it from me at the beginning of our relationship. We have been back together for almost three months now, and I vividly remember her saying once “me and **** had sex almost everyday, and we don’t.” During an argument about how she didn’t think I wanted her because we don’t regularly have sex. She thinks since I was a hoe, I really enjoy doing it. Wrong- I was being petty and we live in a small town and word gets around FAST. I wanted to hurt her back. Wrong I know. Tonight we were talking about something, and she said she doesn’t like me keeping my hoe pics on my phone. I said well at least it was just pics not out doing it everyday and she goes it wasn’t everyday right? (Asking her buddy who apparently was with her and said girl a lot) and he goes “no because said girl won’t fuck unless she showered so it was like 1-2 a week probably. Some times she’d randomly go get in the shower then I’d hear her moaning but then sometimes I wouldn’t hear nothing for a few days so idk” supposed to make me feel better. No. Now I’m enraged and pissed and need help overcoming my hatred for this situation before it ruins our relationship.

A little backstory. 

I have been fortunate to go travelling twice a year for the past 4 years but our plans never aligned to go together, yet she always wanted to come with us. Now that she has time off work, she wants to go and bring me with. On the other hand, my family will be staying in Europe a bit after that trip for about a month or two and I was asked if I am coming with them. 

Both trips are a bit costly and cost about the same. I am torn on what to do. On one hand I could visit a country in Southeast Asia I've never been to and high chances that I will never have a chance to go to again. But that comes with staying with a family that speaks another language, so sort of travelling abroad to stay at home with a weekend getaway to an island. On the other hand, I save the money but stay at home here for that month and go to Europe later, but then we travel separately again.

He and his sister (whom I adore; we’re really close) have had a rocky relationship, mostly due to said strong feelings. She also has big emotions and she’s very emotionally fragile. Like, if you say one seemingly judgmental comment, she takes personal offense and has a full blown meltdown that includes unfriending, not answering calls/texts for a few days, passive aggressive comments on social media, stuff like that. 

She started dating someone a few months ago and my husband can’t stand him. She has let it slip that he doesn’t treat her very well. He’s emotionally abusive, an alcoholic, and he takes advantage of her. But she won’t leave him — stating that he’s trying to get sober, and things are great when he doesn’t drink. 

Because it’s none of my business, I don’t give her grief about staying with him. I never bring him up in conversations. I offer an ear when she’s got complaints, but I just don’t give relationship advice (because she simply won’t take it.) I support her and just want her to be happy. 

An important aspect of the story is this: because her and my husband’s relationship is not great, she comes to me with questions and favors. 

Now here’s where I need help: We’re planning Thanksgiving dinner, and she and I decided to divide the cooking tasks, and we’re hosting the thing at my place. She just asked me if she can invite her bf AND his brother. I relayed this to my husband and he freaked out. He doesn’t want them here. I don’t either, but I want to support my SIL.

To give some background, we have been in a relationship for around a year and this problem has been present since the beginning. When we first started dating, her ex girlfriend started telling my girlfriend (we will call her Sara) that I have been talking about her behind her back, leaking nudes and cheating on her. In the beginning Sara came to me about this and I refuted the claims and did my best to prove that none of this was true and it seemed to solve the problem. We are now long distance due to work so that adds another problem into the mix as we can’t communicate as often as we would like. Now the issue has come up again, the ex continues to tell Sara all of these things that I’ve done such as cheating, shit talking and blackmail and Sara doesn’t seem to trust me anymore. Mind you none of this is true I love Sara to death and would never wrong her in any way. The ex has presented no proof or actual evidence to support her claims but that doesn’t seems to be enough to clear my name in this matter. I have asked Sara to stop talking to the ex because I believe that she is the root of all of the lies because she doesn’t want to let Sara be with someone else, but Sara doesn’t seem to want to let her go, wants to remain friends with the ex and feels like she needs an answer to who is messing with our lives like this. I am lost as to what to do about the situation because it feels like Sara and I can’t move on with our relationship while these falsehoods are being told to her. I don’t know what I can do to prove my innocence any more than I have. I love Sara and want to be with her but it seems like we are at a point where nothing good can happen while these accusations continue. Any advice is welcome and i will give more context if needed.

They would call and text each other starting early in the morning and ending late at night. They will call each other on lunch breaks and even talk on the way home from work. They call and text on weekends also. This was going on for almost 3 years. Once I saw this in the phone records I confronted my husband and he denied any inappropriate activity &amp; said that they only talk about work related issues and he helps her with some of her relationship problems. We already have trust issues within our marriage and this is definitely not helping. I asked him to stop communicating with this woman because I wasn't comfortable with it and that we need marriage counseling if we was going to make this marriage work. Four months into counseling I believe that we were on the right track and I was starting to trust my husband again. That was until I caught them communicating in Instagram DM. The first message I saw was her saying ""you're wrong for going through my phone when your married"". Then he replies back ""stop using ""you're married"" as an excuse as to why you do what you do. Then he apologized for going through her phone and he admitted he was wrong but it must of been meant for him to see who she really was. I saw the messages coming through as they were sending them. As soon as the message came through and he read it, he would delete it. I confronted him and asked when was the last time he talked to her and he lied straight to my face as if he wasn't just messaging her. I told him that I just saw them communicating and he instantly sent her a message saying ""wife alert"" not knowing that I could see it. He claimed that them communicating was innocent and that I was looking to deep into the matter. About 6-7 months goes by and I see his phone records which he fought tooth and nail to keep me from seeing and it showed that they were still communicating regularly. I had 2 surgeries within a 2 week time frame and he didn’t come to either appointments but made time to text and call the other woman while I was in surgery. 
During my recovery time, the phone records shows that he would call her on his way to work right after he would kiss me goodbye. I just feel like that is so heartless. He still hasn't offered any answers that makes sense at all to. Nothing that would make me understand that it was nothing.

Thank you all for your thoughts.. I read and upvoted every comment (expect those who used slur against her, I don't think that was fair) 
I've posted the original post while on the train to work and didn't put all the details.. From the comments, I feel I might have mislead you all to think she's a bad selfish person. I'm sorry about that. The situation is more complicated than what I described and I feel you might change your stand (or might not) if you know the details.. So I'm going to write it here, but PLEASE try to be non-judgmental and empathatic with both of us. She is not a bad person I know that for a fact. 

Complication #1: the girl is married in an ethical non-monogamous relationship.. Her husband is her primary partner, and I'm her second romantic partner, and she has several fwb. All within the boundaries of her primary relationship. This might sound messed up to some of you, but I didn't think this will matter in my original post so I didn't mention it (I was also in a hurry). This fact seems relevant now because many comments talked about how she wants to get with other people and keeps me orbiting her.. She always sees other people and we had no problems with that. I, however, am monogamous. I didn't want any other relationships with other people.
This is also the reason why she wanted to break up.. We started this as a fwb situation and it evolved quickly to strong romance, which was overwhelming to her because she always had one romantic partner (her husband) and she wasn't sure how she can handle 2 at the same time. It seems that our relationship started affecting her relationship with her husband, but she's not too sure. 
What I don't understand is why she wants a plotanic friendship, not even fwb. I asked her and she said she cares about me a lot and she wants to still be able to hang out. I'm not convinced and the emotional cost of that arrangement is too high on me anyways that's why I rejected it.

Complication #2: she and her husband live in my building.. They moved in few month before we started our relationship. So there's no way I'm not going to see her almost daily. I can handle the occasional friendly ""good morning"", but it seems that she couldn't. That is (maybe?) why she's hurt. Before you ask, I still have 9 months on my lease and I can't break it without substantial cost.

Keen to read your comments again and see if your position changes in the light of the above details.

I (31F) have been with my partner (M27) for almost 6 years. We are currently unengaged. Before we started dating I made it clear that I was dating to find a marriage partner and he agreed. I thought we were on the same page. 

In the earlier years, he used to constantly ask me what my ring size was, talk about marriage/being married, and tell me he couldn’t wait to marry me. Now, that’s all stopped. About six months ago, I asked if marriage was still in our future and he said “I need to figure out one thing and then I will be buying you a ring”. He alluded that he wanted to pay off his credit card or some general debt, but continued to spend money on things for himself (expensive clothing, gaming equipment) but also on things for us such a meals out. 

He has brought up wanting to have a baby many times but I said I would feel more comfortable with at least being engaged before having a kid. Then suddenly, talk of having a kid stopped once marriage was brought up. 

The reason marriage is so important to me is that I have come from years of severely emotionally abusive relationships where I have been treated as though I am disposable and I really long for commitment. Six years may be enough commitment for some, but I really want to be married. 

We had a lunch date this weekend and I asked him again, since we were on the topic of his sister’s upcoming wedding, if he could see us getting married and he tried to brush it off. I asked if there was a reason why he didn’t want to marry me, and he said he did but he wasn’t sure why he couldn’t ask. I should make it clear that this is not a question I have repeatedly asked in a short amount of time, it’s been asked over the years only a couple of times. He has never had a solid answer to my questions about it and I’m almost feeling like I’m being led on. I know he loves me but I just don’t know what to do. 

I guess my question, and reason for posting this, is have any of you male readers experienced this type of reaction with yourselves, or maybe you can provide some guy-insight as I’m at a loss.

We’ve been talking for one full month. We met one drunk night and have been best friends ever since. He got sick, literally almost died, and I went to visit him in the hospital. His mom likes me and asked me to stay to which I was more than happy to do. I took care of him for 3 days in there. I say that to say things inadvertently moved fast and I met the entire family. He lives an hour and a half away.

The day I met him, he let me know he had a court case and could possibly be going away for 3 years. Weed charges, which as a stoner is no issue for me. But when he told me, I had no idea I would care for him as much as I do. Hesitant to say I’m in love, but I definitely love him. I worry about him. I want to be near him all the time. And it makes me feel lost and clingy and like I might smother him away.I’m terrified of losing his interest.  I get genuinely sad when he falls asleep before calling me. I don’t like being this way. 

He’s aware I overthink and handles it amazingly but I’m not gonna keep pushing it by overloading him with my emotions. I can tell he needs space and that’s opposite of what I need. Him going away isn’t even a dealbreaker for me. It takes a lot for me to feel this way and I don’t expect it to happen again. The 3 years isn’t definite and I don’t date anyway. Plus I just found out prisoners can text, FaceTime, and have tablets. 

We admit we don’t trust eachother fully yet. And with the stress of court, it never feels important enough to talk about.  Last time we did, he said he would never ask someone to wait for him and that he thought it was dumb. He’s always expressed liking me but said it was horrible timing. I tried to express to him the way he accepts me, checks in on me, and caters to my emotions is worth the wait. 

Trust is an issue on both sides. Im afraid he will use me as a crutch while in prison and he’s afraid im all talk. Idk how to proceed. For the first time dumping someone isn’t the easiest and smartest choice. 

I have to say I’m pissed. I’ve had this part of me packed up for years and given up on men and now the best man I could imagine appears, treats me well, and I don’t get the chance to love him.

So I’ve been engaged to my fiancé M for around five months (together two years) and in that time he has become very close to my mother which is something I adore. However I have never introduced him to my sister to this day and he still does not know the reason why, I just thought he had always respected my decision when it came to her and never pushed me to talk about it.
So when it came to putting together the guest list to our wedding my sister was never even mentioned. My mother on the other hand has had a problem with this since the moment I showed her the guest list saying “After all these years I thought you might have invited your sister and forgiven her.” My fiancé over hearing this agreed with my mother and said “Maybe you could resolve what argument you two had.”
I am not angry he said this, it is my fault I have not told him, but he to this day is the only person who doesn’t look at me with pity or sympathy, which is one of the main reasons why I bonded with him in the first place, he never treated me as delicate.
I have made another post detailing what happened between me and my sister and for time won’t be going into it here.
However, my mother came over the weekend to have dinner with me and M and I was planning on telling her to stop asking me to invite my sister, when M and my mother started speaking to me as if they had a whole conversation planned and really felt like an attack. Apparently my fiancé had gone to my mother to ask what had happened between me and my sister and to say my mother had made the whole situation out to be like a small disagreement between me and my sister had made my blood boil. And to say I feel betrayed by M is a huge understatement, considering he’s used misinformation to try and convince me to invite someone I really do not want to see at my wedding.
They spent most of the meal talking about how important family is and forgiveness and giving my sister another chance would be a good way to heal. I left the table without saying anything.
I’m hurt. I feel betrayed. I’m icing him out right now and I know it’s not right, but what else can I do? He’s trying to talk to me, but I can’t talk to him in this mindset. I need advice on what to say to him. How I feel he’s betrayed my trust without using anger which is all I seem to be doing right now.

My (20F) situationship partner (25M) (we are not together, we are more... in a talking stage) had pain and itchiness in his groin, he went to the doctor and they couldn't find anything, so he asked me to get tested. I did, I found out I had a yeast infection and I told him the results of my tests. I didn't know before getting tested that I had a yeast infection because I had no symptoms  (last time I went to the obgyn was at the beginning of the summer and I had a pelvic exam and I was clean).

 From what I've read on the internet, yeast infections are very minor and common and they can happen to anyone. I'm not sure how I got it, but I must have been the one who gave it to him and I feel terribly guilty about that. I really wish I could turn back time and not put him through that pain, but I didn't know I had the infection (or otherwise I wouldn't have done anything with him - and we didn't even have PIV sex, so I don't know how he got it). 

However, since I told him 4 days ago he turned completely cold towards me. Before that we used to speak every day, now we don't speak at all. I've been giving him space because I know that he doesn't want to hear from me, I've only checked up with him once to make sure that he is okay. And I could tell from our last conversation that he needs that space because he didn't seem to want to talk to me. When I told him the results he said that he was ""utterly disgusted"", and he was panicking about having the infection. To be honest, he is right in being worried because he has a lot more symptoms than me and he could have oral thrush too. 

I understand that he needs time to process everything and I take full responsibility for giving him the infection, but the way he treated me hurts. I used to think we had a connection, but now I'm no longer sure about that. I just feel cold right now.

Now I'm wondering, will he ever talk to me again? And should I even want him to?

In most ways our relationship is wonderful and I really do see a future with him. However, one of my love languages is gift giving. I love putting thought and care into presents, especially for him. Every anniversary, birthday and holiday I spend so much time and effort (and money, even though I'm a broke college student) into his gifts. Even on a random day I'll bake him his favorite cookies or if I see something at the store I think he will like I get it for him. To me it isn't about how much one spends, but caring enough to try to make the other happy and feel loved.

It makes me sad when I reflect on the past two years because I realize he hasn't really done anything like this for me in return. I also often feel like he just goes through the motions and gets something because he feels like he is ""supposed"" to. For our second anniversary he got me a candle and a random body scrub (he didn't even know what it smelled like when he bought it). He has never wrapped any of the gifts he has given me. He either just hands it to me in the plastic bag (tags and receipt included) or wrapped in napkins. I cried alone for hours after our first anniversary because he got me a $7 candle and didn't even take it out of the grocery bag after I had paid for us to stay in a really nice hotel out of state for the weekend so we could go see his favorite baseball team play (even though I hate baseball, but he loves it). It really hurts my feelings because I feel like I'm not even worth a trip to the dollar store for a gift bag and I go out of my way to try to make him happy. I know its such a small detail and shouldn't matter but it just hurts my feelings so much.

He has never taken me out to a nice dinner for my birthday or our anniversary or anything like that. We go out to eat maybe once a week together to a fast food place and we usually switch off who pays. And the thing is, he has a part time job in between classes and has like 3x more money than me saved up. I'm just more willing to spend my money on him. He recently dropped like $500 on a new video game console, so its not like I have a lot more money/resources than him. We are both pretty frugal and smart with money, and I don't expect him to spend loads on me. But I do believe there are times when one should splurge a little or their SO too.

I also LOVE flowers. I love getting flowers. It makes me feel loved, and I can't help but feel sad and like I'm missing out when my roommates display the arrangements their SO's get them. My bf got me flowers for the first (and only) time a year and a half into our relationship for Valentines Day after I said I wanted to celebrate it this year. But I don't want to tell him that I want him to buy me flowers because: 1. I don't want to seem materialistic and 2. It ruins the 'magic' of getting flowers if I have to ask for them.

Overall we have a great relationship and he shows he loves me in other ways. But some days (like today, my birthday) it just burns more than others. He forgot to wish me happy birthday until after he left for work, after spending the morning together. I kept waiting for him to say something but then he left without saying anything about it. I want a man who remembers my birthday, brings me flowers when I've had a stressful day and takes me out to eat for special occasions. Who cares enough to put some thought into things and not just grab the first random thing he sees in the Clearance aisle.

I have tried talking to him, but honestly I usually get scared to say too much because I don't want to hurt his feelings or seem ungrateful. I have a hard time with confrontation after some not healthy relationships in the past and I'm still learning to be better at speaking my mind/standing up for myself. I don't really know what to do or how to start this conversation. Any one else experience this? Are these red flags I am ignoring? How do I approach this with him?

Our last conversation before the weird question: 

So we both work in the restaurant industry. I had posted a story when I was at work and he messaged me about it. We talked for a bit, then I told him he should come out and grab a drink (he told me awhile ago that he wanted to try my place out). He said he would, then I told him to let me know and I would get him a drink on me. I didn’t say this part, but I get 50% off so I was going to do it to be nice. 

Then a week later, he messaged me in the morning. He said “I need to ask you something but you can’t tell anyone.” Already a red flag, but I said sure. He asked me if I knew “Sam” the bartender. He said she worked with me. I told him I that I never met her and that she must’ve quit over 2 years ago before I started. 

I asked him why, and he said “I  want to know her sexual orientation 😂😂.” I asked how he knew her, and why doesn’t he ask her himself, and he said he doesn’t really know her at all. 

This whole thing was really weird. I looked her up on fb and she does have my work still listed as her place of employment. I’m thinking he saw her on fb, as he said he doesn’t know her. 

What do you think of this?

I am a single 25F welder fabricator. I live in my own apartment with two cats, and I love to read philosophy, psychology, etc. I am also getting into crafts and love art. My current hobby is embroidery/needlework in trippy patterns.

I'm having a hard time making friends. I feel like I am everything and nothing at the same time. All this year I have been going to concerts which I've never done before and I love it! I can dance all night, it's amazing. I love hyping people up and making them feel good.

I was introduced to a friend circle recently by a 38M and his friends are all couples around 30yo. There are a couple single men too, and I am the only single woman. I have no desire for a serious relationship. 38M expressed feelings for me, but I explained my situation and just wanted to be friends.

But it's like I have to be ""with"" 38M in order to hang out with these people. One of the girls is super nice, but the other acts like I don't exist. I try to be nice and talk to her but she straight up ignores me or cuts off the conversation. 

I also work with all men, so I feel like I get along better with men. And I think that as the one single woman, that might come off a bit hairy. I hate this opinion and I don't know how to navigate it/communicate myself to other people that I am not here to take your man. 

Maybe I'm not hanging out with the right people. And I'll return to my point about being ""with"" one of the men. No one will invite me to anything unless I come along with 38M. He is the only person that willingly asks me to go. I saw there was a NYE concert, and I sent it to these people and they already had tickets and accommodations. 38M isn't feeling it, so I have to make my own way there by myself. I wouldn't mind going by myself if it wasn't a hard dubstep concert, and a 2.5hr drive in potentially snowy conditions.

We met in high school, dated for 5 months, and broke up because it was the wrong time. We remained friends after and he helped me out a lot; soon after I started having feelings for him again. He got a girlfriend (19F) over the summer and they dated for three years. I was ok with this because I had no plans of letting him know how I felt about him and honestly I thought I was going to move on quickly. But during that time we got closer and closer. He would help me out through so much, give me advice, comfort me when I needed it, and (tw: su\*c\*de and SA) he was there for me whenever I tried to end myself and when I was SA'd. Of course, I did the same for him, sometimes I had to, for lack of better words, convince him to tell me because he was scared of being a burden. After the first two years of dating his girlfriend, he was contemplating breaking up with her. She wasn't the best... very toxic. She manipulated him, emotionally abused him, cheated on him multiple times, and was overall just a shitty person. I told him to do whatever he wanted and what he felt was right. After months of him complaining he finally broke up with her. He started doing what most people do when they get out of a long-term relationship... he joined dating apps and started hooking up with people. I was ok with that because we weren't dating and at the time he had no idea of my feelings. 

Moving on, we work at the same rec center although in different departments. We have this coworker (20M) (at the time he was NB but went as F to the people we work with including my best friend) that we worked with for two years and my coworker knew how I felt about my best friend. One day I made a dumb joke about them joining us to hang out only for us to get wasted and leave him, looking back it was a bad joke but I did apologize to them privately after because I felt like there was tension between us. He decided after that that he would openly flirt with my best friend. I was, of course, upset about it but couldn't do anything about it because he has the right to like anyone he wants and again, my best friend and I weren't dating. But it still made me feel some type of way... kind of like betrayal of some kind... I don't know. Anyways, things were tense between us and awkward for me and my best friend. I had to leave for the last two weeks of work because of some personal problems and I told him about the problems between the coworker and me. The problem is I had to tell him how I felt for him to understand the whole thing (because, respectfully, he's not the brightest bulb).  He said that he already knew how I felt (SHOCKED WIG SNATCHED I CAN NOT BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID) and that he had no feelings for the coworker but he did have slight feelings for me. I was flying! I was so happy that I couldn't go to sleep. But, he said that because he just got out of a relationship he didn't want to get into a new one until we went back to school.  I said I completely understand and I wasn't expecting a relationship at the moment. 

Time skip, we get to college, he sleeps around more, I patiently wait for him, yada, yada, yada. He comes to visit me and meet my friends. My friends know about him and that I have feelings for him but didn't know how deep. Anyways, we start drinking, and a ""friend"" of mine asks if we had anything going on, I tell them he's single (my mistake) and she goes and flirts with him. I mean all up on him and everyone noticed. I get upset I talk to both of them (privately), cut the friend off, and called it a day. 

Time skip part 2: We get into an ""argument"" about something stupid, I said he was mine, possessive I know BUT it's not like he was the only one I told this to, I say everyone I care about is mine, he then tells me that he doesn't know how he feels anymore and he's been getting more depressed. I cried... I balled... I drank myself into okay-ness. I blocked him, unblocked him, yelled in his ear, blocked him again, unblocked him again, cried to him about it, and then we made up. I then decided fuck it and continued to like him. All of this in one night.

Time skip to now: It's months later, and he's even more flirtatious now than ever. One day he gets sick and calls me. He tells me so many sweet things, I'm beautiful, he cares for me too much to let me go, how proud he is of me, how much he misses me, etc. and we talk almost every night since then. Three weeks later he says that he wants to take me out. I choke- I gasp- I am speechless. I was so confused because he wasn't ready for a relationship and he just slept with someone else not too long ago. He tells me he wants to see a movie with me, go shopping, buy matching pajamas (something I talked about when we first met), go to a cafe, and then just drive around. All things I said I wanted to do as dates. I try to make him clear it up. I tell him that it sounds like he wanted to take me out on a date. He says it's a friend's date. I'm CRUSHED but I held it in. Days go by and he still says ""let me take you out, let me take you out."" One night he doesn't call me and I start thinking ""Why is he phrasing it like that? It's misleading and it gets me excited and makes me feel like I have a chance. I've told him that before... does he just not care?"" I confront him about it and now we're supposed to talk later. I'm thinking of telling him that I can't go and that I need space. Hopefully, I can get over him with this break. I feel like I'm overthinking all of this.

Question: Should I just let it go and hang out with him, or should I give us some space? Any advice would be great!

 Never thought I’d post a story of myself but here we are, and I would really appreciate insight. My gf and I have been together for almost 2 years. I was always there for her and I provided a lot of support for her, emotionally, mentally and daily especially with her car which I would always help her despite me dealing with tons of family issues myself. The other day we were both off, I took her on a date and we went to a casino about 2 hours away( more to this later) by the time we got back it was 12am and I was exhausted since I always did majority of the driving for both us anyways. As I’m about to knock out, with me falling fast asleep, she tells me she wants to take a break, and that she feels she hasn’t spent time with her friends or family(I’ve never stopped her and she never brought this issue to me directly). She gives me a bag to pack my stuff and I’m just struck with anger and shock that she bring this up after everything I’ve done for her. She kept saying I’m sorry I’m sorry but did not seem remorseful. She removed our pics together shortly after and removed me from location too. I just feel sad angry and betrayed, and I thought everything was fine, no major arguments, no really closure from her. I feel like I was tossed aside like trash.

I also have two younger siblings that are in grade school.

I am currently in college and every time I go home, I find my self-diagnosed depression symptoms gets worse, I would stay in bed 10 hours a day, no appetite, no motivation, counting the days till I get to leave. But the messed up part is every time I leave I get even more sad because I won't see them for a long time, even though seeing them does not bring me any happiness. And the same thing always happens when I go home, my parents would be in different rooms, my younger sibling would play games or watch TV all day. Everyone's got their own thing going on, which leaves me in bed and get on my phone too.. 

  
From my perspective, I never really got much attention through my teenage years, I could disappear for a weekend and see them Monday after school and nothing would be said. They could've came to my sporting events but never did until my last few games as a senior. I am grateful that they provided me food, cloth and education but I find myself hold a huge grudge for the neglect and lack of parenting I got.  No one taught me how to shave, or how to mature emotionally. I can't ever remember a hug from either parent or even a I love you as I got older. Since college, we have not stay in touch, I would get a text maybe once a month for appt. reminder from dad, and my mother does not even know what my major is. 

Now at family gatherings I feel silent, I am not sure what to say to my family, my brain would go blank, and I feel I got nothing interesting that I could share with them. Now I typed some of my thoughts out, I guess I am just sad that I don't have a fun, loving, or happy family and not sure what to do about it besides feeling sad.
