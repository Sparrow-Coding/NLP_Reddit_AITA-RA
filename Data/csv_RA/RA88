I (39f) have been dating my bf (37m) for 8 months now. We live in a different state than his brother (33m) and his wife (31f)

We decided to fly there to spend a few days with them and so I can meet them for the first time. I've already met his mom and his older cousin and it seems like she's the clear favorite for now because when I ask them who they like more and who they think is prettier they just give me some bs about how it doesn't matter and beauty is in the eye of the beholder blah blah blah or try to change the subject. 

I've checked her Instagram and she is what they call 'conventionally attractive' while her husband is CLEARLY out of her league. We fly in and meet them and she is soo fake, just super smiley and I can tell she wore extra tight yoga pants and a tight shirt just to show off how much skinnier she is than me which makes me feel unwelcomed right off the bat. 

I know she's trying to look casual but I can tell she spent hours making her face look perfect just for our visit. She asks me what I do for work and I just say I'm in sales because I'm in between jobs right now and didn't want her to judge me and when I asked her what she did she just name dropped her company on purpose to try to show off how successful her and her husband are. 

I can tell she thinks I'm a threat and told her husband not to talk to me because he avoided me the whole trip. Everytime I went to thank him for having us, he robotically gave the credit to her saying she's the one who cooked or cleaned etc... but I can tell he was trying to avoid me probably so his wife wouldn't get jealous.

The one time we were alone , I asked her if she thought I was prettier than my boyfriends ex and she lied to me and said she doesn't know what she looks like so i I then confronted her about still being friends with her on Facebook and she straight up lied to me and said she forgot what she looks like. 

On our last day I'm starving (sorry I don't skip dinner and eat like a normal person ) and ask them to get me some pasta so she goes out and her husband tags along  and when they get back she hands it to me in the to go container with a plastic fork ...so incredibly rude when she could have put it in a bowl since were at their house, so I have my boyfriend do it instead and I can tell her husband is also annoyed at her for treating a guest that way. 

I just hate how fake she is and after the trip me and my boyfriend got in a huge fight because we went to take a group picture at the airport and she just wouldn't move out of the way so I got emotional and asked her husband to move her out of the way and he gave me a disgusted look and said she was standing there first and my boyfriend didn't stick up for me.

She then got increasingly cold throughout the week to a point of where she refused to talk to me anymore beyond the words ""leave me alone i said what I had to say now you deal with it"".

My son is one of the most cruel, selfish, inconsiderate, narcissistic and spiteful people I have ever met. I don’t feel safe around him and I lay awake at night crippled with anxiety and fear that he may fatally hurt his partner or hurt their baby son, that’s how bad it is. He has domestically abused every single partner he has been with since he was 17 and his current girlfriend and mother of his first child has also advised me he is beating and controlling her since their third date, they have been together over one year now. She just gave birth to their son 2 months ago and the beating and controlling hasn’t stopped. He even made threats to the midwives and the midwives banned him from visiting the maternity unit and submitted a report to the police about him and he got a warning, they raised safeguarding concerns but his girlfriend managed to say it was just a misunderstanding and no further action was taken. I helped his partner escape to a women and children’s refuge last month, but she went back to him and the controlling behavior and beating has already started again, he forces her to stay awake at night, he starves her, he locks her out of the house to ‘teach her a lesson’, he make her sit facing a corner for hours like a child, he told her he’s going to arrange for people to kill her family back home. She wont call the police on him, she has no family or friends from this country and she is scared of being alone so she takes it from him. He made her quit her very lucrative highly skilled job at the start of her pregnancy to essentially be a housewife that cooks and cleans for him. When I met her she was bright, happy and outgoing and now she is disoriented, dull and a shell. 

I have tried to have a word with him about it but he gets aggressive with me and tells me I don’t have a right to get involved with or make decisions for his family and I as a woman don’t have the authority to tell him as a man how to run his home and that I need to keep out of it, yet first person he calls when he needs something is ME. He speaks to me like I am complete shit, he tries to control my life and turns up at my house any time he feels like and starts swearing, shouting and breaking stuff in my home when he is angry about something or because I stand up to him, my daughter (28F) lives here and she is terrified of him, when they were teenagers he punched her in the face and choked her. My mother is dying right now and he has been incessantly harassing me to collect his car from a garage while I’m sat next to my mother who is on her death bed, when I tell him no I can’t pick it up now I’m with my Mother (his grandma!!) he starts to verbally abuse me and tell me I’m an awful mother and one day I’ll be sorry when he decides to disappear on everyone.

My husband his father died 8 years ago. He was also abusive and controlling, my son seems to view his Father like a god, the perfect role model who can do no wrong and you can’t say a bad word about. I always thought because was a good dad to our son that it absolves him for the way he treated me but actually now I wish I had the strength and wits to take my son away from him and maybe he wouldn’t have turned out just like him. 

My son went to jail for 2 years in 2017 for selling class A drugs. He was an exemplary inmate according to the prison guards and all his hearings people couldn’t sing his praises highly enough and I truly thought he had changed. He got worse than he ever was before. Now he is an ex offender he wears it as a ‘tough man’ badge that he thinks is some kind of honor. He turns the nice guy and charm on like a switch (just like his father) and can make everyone think he is the nicest person in the world when he is a complete horror. Recently I discovered from him partner he has began dealing drugs again and is basically running their home like a drug laboratory with his newborn son around, I was horrified by this. 

After a few events the past few days I am contemplating whether or not I should anonymously tip off the police about his drugs and get him arrested. He has been in counselling and anger management sinfe he came out of jail now and he has only gotten WORSE. I am so sad, I just feel like such a failure of a mother. I hate that I have brought such a cruel person in this world that hurts so many women and causes me so much anguish. I regret that I allowed him to see his Father abusing me to make him think that this is okay, I regret I didn’t run away from his dad with him. I have always try to be gentle with him, listen to him, reassure him and uplift him and make him know that he is loved and he doesn’t have to try to be his Dad but nothing is working and I’m scared he is going to hurt his partner and my grandson who he shouts at when he won’t stop crying (he is 2months!!). As much as I know my son needs to be locked up I still feel like if I tell the police I am doing the worst thing possible as a mother and I will feel so terrible if anything happens to him in there but I am terrified of what he will go next if he is free as he seems to be getting worse and worse. I don’t know if tipping the police off is the right thing to do.

**TL:DR - My son is an abusive bully who abuses his partner and treats me terribly. His partner will not report him to the police.

My husband (31M) and I (27F) have been married for 5 years. 

I want to try and be as fully impartial as I can, because if I just write it all from my perspective of course everyone will say I should get a divorce. I'll try to include his side too.

From my side: I don't work a full time job, and I don't have a lot of friends. I realise because I have a lot of free time and not much socialisation, I rely on him too much emotionally. I was emotionally neglected as a child, and as a result I now require that feeling of being loved and paid attention to from my partner.  Unmistakable, direct affection: saying 'I love you', giving compliments, being positive and 'on my side'. I've brought up to him that I need more emotional investment from him, but he says that being removed and always keeping a wall up is how he was raised. He has flat out stated that he can't and won't change: he won't be nicer, he won't be more affectionate. I feel like my only option then is to simply accept how he is, accept that I won't ever be happy in this marriage, and either carry on anyway or get a divorce.

From his side: He works full time, plus over time some days. He doesn't have a lot of free time, so whenever he does have time to himself he'll be on his phone or watching TV or going out alone for one of his hobbies. He was raised in a family where they never said 'I love you' or showed any outward displays of affection, and he says that's how he's most comfortable. He also gets uncomfortable whenever I try to hug or touch him, &amp; generally only communicates with me on a surface or joking level. He never says anything nice, which is bad enough, but on top of that he 'teases' me sometimes, about my looks or whatever it might be. To his credit, he pays for literally everything, buys me thoughtful gifts, and plans little day trips maybe 6 or 7 times a year. He also generally has a very lovable and light personality, he always makes me laugh.

One way I understand it is through love languages: I primarily only understand the language of 'positive words/affirmations', whereas he only knows the language of 'gift giving'. To me, I feel like it's a cop out: it's the least involved type of 'love' in my eyes. Anyone with money could buy a thing. I've told him, in these exact words, that I'd rather we were poor and he never bought me a single thing, if only he'd simply be NICE to me, pleasant to me, affectionate. Just look into my eyes and care about me. He has never said 'I love you' to me since before we got married.

To give an example of our every day life... we wake up, and I say 'Good morning!' and try to be positive, make him a coffee. He responds with a grunt. Later in the day I try to hug him: he physically pushes me off him, or stands there uncomfortably until I stop. I compliment something about him, he says something rude or jokey about me. If I ask him, 'how do I look?' his response is to flash his eyes at me for one second and say 'fine' or 'not bad': even when I've clearly put in a lot of effort. He finishes work, or it's the weekend, so I try to spend time together: he's glued to his phone, or is doing his own thing. Then, every now and then, we go on a holiday or a nice lunch. He seems to think that is what makes a relationship.

For me, a lot of it feels like he's just very very emotionally immature: like I said, in his house 'men don't show emotions' and 'crying is for girls'... and also the fact that he has limited free time, plus the fact that I honestly probably do over rely on him. However, the simple things like just being pleasant, being nice, being affectionate: is it SO impossible for me to want that from my HUSBAND? Is that not the bare minimum? He says it's just his personality, and refuses to change. He says 'if I suddenly start saying I love you, or being more affectionate, I'd just be doing it because you asked me to.'

My parents divorced when I was a kid, and I worry I have absolutely no gauge for what a healthy marriage even looks like. Am I asking too much? Or is he giving too little?

We have a 3 year old and a 1 year old together. He's a great father to our kids.  Both of my pregnancies were high risk and he took care of me every step of the way through both. My last delivery was traumatic, and I decided that it was definitely my last. We live in a red state and already having 1 birth control baby I am afraid to be intimate. I asked my husband to get a vasectomy and he happily said he would since I carried and birthed both of our children. 

Well our 2nd just turned 1 in October and he hasn't even made the appointment... he keeps saying he forgot or they're closed or asked me to make it for him. I told him he's an adult and on account of that they probably wouldn't let me make it anyways. It's been very tense in out house lately. We haven't gotten to go on a date in 5 months. We aren't intimate and due to our work schedules I only see him for 2-3 hours a day. 

So I took the initiative to schedule myself for a tubal. I know for sure I don't want anymore kids but I do want a worry free sex life.

Im over 2.5 years with my girlfriend now and we have a problem. Everything was fine. Yeah maybe we had some little arguments here and there but most of the time we were like totally fine.

We are seeing us at weekends, because under the week we are both very busy. At weekends we often do very much. Most of the time we are just hanging around and warching some tv. Since 2-3 months i have my problems with that. I dont know, im bored just sitting home and watch netflix all weekend. So we talked about it and wanted to solve the problem. We tried to do some stuff like going to a museum or go to some adventurerooms but every weekend we are at the same point again and dont know what to do next. 
Sometimes i dont even looking forward to see her just because i know that the weekend its going to be that boring again. 

Im afraid. If im bored after 2.5 years with a person. How is it adter 5 or 10 years…

Both of us gay males.  We had talked online for a couple of months and I’ve been wanting to meet up, first time I asked a while back, he was busy with work and stuff.  Couple of weeks ago I asked when are we finally going to meet up?  He then suggested some restaurant in the city we both like and we’d meet tonight.  We both live in the outskirts.  Last week he texted me saying the city restaurant would have to wait because he has to take care of his dog for the weekend as no one is home otherwise.  I then suggested meeting up someplace local so he wouldn’t have to worry too much about the dog as he’d be closer.  No response.  

I then messaged one last time a couple of days ago just checking in on what I suggested, still nothing.  He’s been looking at my insta stories too.  Fucker.  As much as I want to confront him as I felt like I was lead on, no one owes me anything in life and it would just make me look crazy if I called him out and then turn it against me.  Maybe there’s another guy that’s better looking than me that he chose, idk.

I got him a job where I work and we work the same shift.

I feel like we are just housemates at this point. There’s no romance and very little affection. I try, but it seems he’s not interested in more than a quick kiss. I feel like the relationship isn’t going anywhere. I have told him more than once that I’m ready for marriage, and he says “when you grow up/ become more mature we can get married.”

I’m 24, he’s 33. I don’t feel I’m immature at all. I have a career, make 6-figures, and have bought myself a brand new car and my first house in the past year. I’m also in school part time to advance in my current company. He says I’m immature because sometimes the housework is neglected for a bit longer than it should be. The reason for this is that we work swing shift, 7 days straight. Basically we get 6 or less days off a month. On top of that, I work a ton of OT because I’m remodeling the house. (Note, the house is only in my name and he pays “rent” equal to 1/2 the mortgage+utilities. I told him I didn’t want to make the commitment of buying a house together if we hadn’t yet made the commitment to marry. He agreed, and I always refer to it as OUR house and he has equal say in the renovations).

So most of the remodeling is being done by my dad and I. We work on it a couple days out of the week. We painted, ripped our cabinets, and installed new flooring throughout the entire house. It’s a lot of work and cost about $60k so far. My bf is always complaining that stuff still needs to be done and my dad moves “so slow.” I told him it would go faster if he helped and he says “well I didn’t want to DIY it, I wanted to hire someone.” Well honestly, the finishing touches are on hold because I need to replenish my savings before I do more. It would have cost at least double to hire someone to do everything, so that would have been even slower. Plus, my dad and I are having a good time doing it together.

Anyway, on top of work, OT, school, and the renovations, sometimes chores don’t get done on time. The two big things he complains about are dishes and laundry. I devote at least a half hour to cleaning every day. He’s usually good about splitting chores half and half, but if I have a bad week, he won’t do anything the next week because “he can’t do everything while I do nothing.” What pisses me off is that he insists I do nothing if I don’t get every single thing done, and won’t acknowledge the effort I made to at least do a little bit. Like I worked 64 hours last week, did a few loads of laundry and cleaned up around the house the best I could, and he said I’m lazy and didn’t do shit all week. Okay, maybe you can say I slacked on chores, but you can’t say I’m lazy when I just worked a 64 hour week.

I don’t think that falling behind on chores makes me immature or means that I’m not ready for marriage. I’m working my ass off to build a better future for myself and future family. I won’t always be working these crazy hours. I’m only doing it now because I’m just starting out. I have yet to meet another 24 year old doing all of this. If we were married and splitting the renovations 50/50, I wouldn’t have to work so much. He offers me money here and there, but I don’t like taking too much because at the end of the day, it’s MY house (even though I’d never throw that it in his face, but I have no intention of giving legal interest in my house to someone I’m not married to).

Honestly I feel like he’s just complacent and content with where he’s at, but I’m not. I want a commitment, a husband, maybe a kid or two one day. Honestly I think I’m a good catch. Hardworking, independent. I don’t party. I’m a homebody (which is why I’m so interested in making my house nice) and spend most of my free time playing with my dogs, reading, crafting, etc. If his only complaint is a few dirty dishes and some laundry I don’t think it should be a dealbreaker… And after 4 years I feel like he should know who I am, and what my faults are, and whether or not he wants a life with me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7525928,public,self,Looking for an outside perspective - Feel like my relationship has hit a plateau…,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yt2ry9/looking_for_an_outside_perspective_feel_like_my/,all_ads,6,,

Soit isn't that she is uncomfortable with everyone it's not that as she behaves good in front of others but when it comes to me I think that i might be making her uncomfortable. So after school we walk together towards our vehicle by which u get home but she does not talk with me well i mean she talks with other friends in between when we are talking or wtevr. Then yesterday I asked her if i could hold her hand so i was holding her hand for like 10sec and then she took her hand away and wtsoevr. After reaching home i asked her that was she uncomfortable if so i also said sorry but she said that she was a bit fearful about that others will see it and i was like ok as it could have been. But i felt a bit sad as day after Tomorrow we are asked to go to school in colourful dress and not the school uniform coz of a celebration so i asked her about she's gonna come to school or not but she said no she won't coz she don't like the dress code which is instructed to us i requested her to come but she refused as she didn't like the dress code(i requested her but i cannot force her to come for me ofc) due to which i became a bit sad idk maybe i m a dumbass lol. So then few months ago we went to a place with some friends it was a festival our other friends were busy with their partners but we were accompanied by my gf's bff(F) i said her that let her be here for a bit let's spend some time together but she said that she came here for her as our parents won't allow so she took her and if she would leave her alone she would feel bad.

Now we live in our own places. The last 2 months I have gotten time to reflect on my situation and the relationship, and came to realize that my needs are not being fulfilled in my relationship. 

A lot has happened in the past. I suspected him of cheating a while back and had text messages as proof, but he just kept denying. We were arguing back and forth and he said if things did not get better (me getting over those text messages) we have to break up. At that point in my life I was not ready to leave since we had so much history together. 

When living together I have always been the financially responsible person. I was studying and working trying to make ends meet, while he was working part time. I always was the one to pay the bills and food, and he would chime in with whatever he could. I never put pressure on him. Although I was the more busy person I would never come home to him cooking dinner for me, or cleaning up the home. I always had to take care of the home and clean up after him. A while back I had a foot surgery and had a special boot that I had to walk with. I had problem with the foot getting swollen when standing up and walking for too long. He knew about this but I would still be the person to cook, clean, do dishes etc.

I feel responsible for my bf’s wellbeing, and I feel like I am currently staying just to make him feel safe. At the same time I am not putting my own needs first. I would want the same treatment as he is getting. Someone to take care of me, someone who notices when I’m having a bad day and takes care of me. Someone who makes me feel special. 

Before when we argue about stuff he always made me feel like it’s always been my fault. He gets very angry and loud when we argue and so I have always been the one crawling back and asking for forgiveness. We have a difficult time communicating and I have started to hold back on things I want to say just because I don’t want to cause a reaction.

Before i go into the bad part i just wanna say that my boyfriend has been the most humble, sweet, caring man i have ever met. He has put alot of effort in our relationship. Blocked and deleted all those girls in the beginning of our relationship. Never had to question anything. Even with his financial crisis, he drove miles just to see me twice a week directly after work. Never complained about my tantrums even with his family, uni and work pressure. Always made sure i was treated right. Never let me doubt anything or anyone. Always apologized after every fight even though most of the time it was my overthinking that started the fight.

But, theres has always been this one issue that bothered me everytime. He keeps following, liking pictures of any women with humongous tits and ass on social media. Instagram, twitter, reddit etc. NOW, i have never been insecure about my body. Anyone having exquisite body structure never ever made me feel low about mine. i just prefer it if he wouldnt do it in respect that he has a girlfriend. I would also understand if i never asked him to unfollow or stop seeing these stuff on social media. The problem is i did. Many times. Had numerous fight few of which almost led to breakup. He apologized and promised after every fight that he wont do it again. But he kept doing it again and again. At this point it isnt about following those girls, its about breaking every promise he made, it about respecting my feelings but he kept doing it even thought he knows it hurts me.

What led me to write it on here is that i found his reddit account. I never asked for his reddit handle because i knew what would be up here. I found it through a mutual page we happen to follow. Found out that he has been thirsting over bikini models asking for their instagram links. This was about 20 days ago. It completely broke me. He also shared an OF models link from twitter on reddit asking for her videos. I remember us arguing why he had followed her on twitter. He stated that he barely uses twitter thats why he followed her(logic?). I really dont know if i can forgive him after this.

Simultaneously, He keeps making future plans about us and is genuinely invested in it. He is working hard to save up money and is trying to get a better job and more source of income so he can marry me soon. He tells me he has everything planned out. He still cant go hours without talking to me and needs to communicate every other hour. He still does all the nice things that people do in relationships.

I even brought it up, saying “you’re not going to see her are you?” It was mostly a joke because she is “married” (I think the whole thing was a reality tv sham.) Anyways, he dismissed it and talked badly of her as he always does. Today he got very drunk with his friends. One of our mutual friends was around him and he confessed they met up (him and his ex.) He was going on about how she’s so cool and how she instigated the meet up. When asked if he slept with her he dodged the question but was joking around about it. I feel disgusted. I feel angry.

I don’t know how to shut up, sorry. I’m leaving out a lot of detail because this is otherwise immediately recognisable. 

I (23F) moved across the country to work for a family in 2019. This was a snap decision because I was miserable at home and needed a change. Within 2 minutes of the hour-long video interview with the family I ended up working for, I knew I wanted to work for them. I’ve always trusted my own instincts and haven’t ever been wrong but something pulled me to these people that I haven’t felt before. I can’t explain, but 2 weeks later I was being picked up at the airport.

The father (43M) is the only one who speaks my native language and his wife (42F) initially worked away until Saturday morning. She would be back for 24 hours before returning to the city. This lasted 6 weeks before the whole family moved to be closer to her job, but until then the father was essentially my only contact with other adults, and we got on very well right from the start. We have a similar humour, he was patient with me, and he’s not a prying nor chatty person. We would walk the dog together and 50% of this would be in a totally comfortable silence. 

When the mom was home, we’d go shopping, she’d show me the local areas of interest and all the places I may need to go. She made such an effort with me, finding time in her one day off to spend with me, and I appreciated it so much. 

I didn’t stay for long (my contract was short) but I grew so close to both the parents and the kids that I didn’t want to leave when I had planned and instead found another job nearby just to avoid being away from them. I’ve since moved to another country but speak to them once every few weeks and I’ll visit maybe 4 times a year. 

All this to say that I love them all. Yet my relationship with the father is complicated. They are under the impression that I’m a lesbian because frankly I thought I was. So when he flirts with me and I flirt back, I do it with the idea that there are no consequences. I find it hard to imagine he’s attracted to me and even if he is it’s impossible to think he would ever have an affair. 

I message him a lot, for updates on the family, to show him a new recipe I tried, to ask his advice, to complain about life, when I’m feeling shit, just to talk. I think about him constantly and I wonder what he’ll message me back. I imagine coming home to him and spending weekends with him and the x-rated things we may get up to. I’m obsessed with him the way a teenager is obsessed with the teacher they have a crush on. 

Never in a million years would I act on it, mainly because I love the family so much and would never do anything that could hurt them. I don’t want to even have sex with this man, even though I fantasise about it, because I don’t like having sex with men. In theory it’s great, but it turns out that in practice it’s not for me. He’s also like… my dad. My faux step-father. I lived in his house and he payed for me to be there and cooked me dinner and dropped me at parties. I came out to him. He fulfilled a father role. I am referred to as “his third daughter”.

So I don’t understand my relationship with him, but more importantly I just don’t know what to do about it. More precisely, how to get past it. I’m not distancing myself from them because I’m not emotionally capable of doing so, but I know the dynamic I have with the father is unhealthy, even if only for me, and I don’t want to feel the way I do. But I just can’t get past it on my own. Would really appreciate some advice that does not include cutting communication, because it just won’t happen.

We haven’t exactly had “the talk” yet, but he has casually mentioned a few times that he doesn’t like/do labels (I.e. boyfriend/girlfriend). I find this confusing for a few reasons, one being that he has referred to me as his significant other before, and the other being that he has talked about having “girlfriends” in the past. I feel like our relationship wouldn’t change if we put a label on it because we’re already pretty serious, so why does the idea of calling me his girlfriend seem so crazy to him? Is anyone else afraid of labels, and why?

Btw i’m not an english native so i’m sorry for all the mistakes i’ll probably make. 

We’ve been together for 2 years now. 
It’s my first love, we were neighbors and good friends at first and finally he became my boyfriend. 
Our relationship started in a very difficult moment for me ; i lost my dad of a cancer and at that time my mother was at the hospital and i was living far away from my home, at my brother’s house. He is the one that helps me go through it and even if i was dealing with complicated stuff i was extremely happy in the relationship. 
But everything started to go down because of his parents. He has very controlling parents and his mother was completely against our relationship. In fact at the beginning everything was okay, she knew me since i was living in the same neighborhood and before we get together she even talked about me at my bf, telling him i seemed nice and making jokes about him dating me. But when we started dating she became very mean, she insulted me and she even wanted me and my bf to broke up. When she knew that i lost my dad she said that i was probably insane because of that and tones of horrible things about me and my family. I was convinced that i was a problem for my bf. Turned out that his mother was abusive, he saw a therapist and finally leaves his home at 18. But i was suffering, for 2 years i had to handle my family situation and all the problems in our relationship due to his mother. I graduated and everything was fine but i somehow cracked. I am currently dealing with mental health problem, i can’t control my emotions anymore and cry a lot, especially when i am with my bf (in fact i don’t cry when i’m not with him) + i have panic attack. Since the beginning of my mental health problem my bf became very agressive and harsh to me ; he yells at me when all i do is crying because idk how to handle it. I said to my bf that i was suffering a lot and i explain him my feelings. I think he hates me now that i feel bad but it seems so unfair to me, i was here for him even if i needed help more than ever at that time. Why do he acts like this with me ? I don’t want to dump him because i love him so much and i don’t have many friends ; and i don’t want to end up alone, the only thing i want is reassurance.

So, I brought it up back then and expressed how I felt and that it was disrespectful to us, and me. He apologized saying he “didn’t mean it and it wouldn’t happen again.”  

Fast forward to present day, I was sending him pictures from his phone to my phone of just funny things when I came across a text from his group chat. I accidentally clicked on it. He was making food in the kitchen at this time. (he knew I was on his phone.) It contained so many photos of these models and he was basically gawking at them with his friends. There were also tik tok videos of thirst traps that were sent back and fourth. He sent a few pictures/ videos but his friends did the same. There was one model that my bf would talk about a lot. They would comment inappropriate things about them and what they would want to do to them, including my bf. I went to look up one of these girls while still on his phone when his recent safari tab contained “OF leaks” of random girls. I threw the phone aside from when he wasn’t present when that happened and acted like nothing happened when and felt disrespected since this has happened before. I feel betrayed, as if he just doesn’t care about my feelings. I don’t know if it’s normal for guys to do this. It feels as if he is openly telling his friends that these women are more sexually attractive than me. 
I am confused to why he is sending these photos of random women to his friends?

It has been an extremely tumultuous and, at times, toxic relationship. Admittedly, we each have our own flaws and have contributed to the dysfunction in many ways. A huge majority of our fights stem from my intense struggle with my mental health (I am bipolar and have issues with boundaries) and his non-commitment and cheating. I often find myself thinking how horribly unsuited we are - his inability to commit and extensive history of dishonesty trigger all of my very worst behaviors. To add further complexity, I have two children who love him and have known him for a majority of their lives.

Because we were so toxic and for the sake of everyone involved, we ""separated"" two and a half years ago and spent two years living apart. It was a difficult two years, with many tears and conversations and lots of personal growth from both of us. When we decided to move back in together, both of our families were skeptical to say the least. Fortunately, it really has been better this time around. For the first time in 7 years I am seeing signs of commitment from him, and recognize he's putting in a huge amount of effort to take care of both me and my kids. I have done a lot of work too, and have a much better grip on my attitude, temper, and behavior in general.

The problem now is that whenever there is any sort of disagreement or unpleasantness, he reverts straight back into noncommittal hatefulness. We could get along famously for weeks, but the second I upset him he immediately alludes to leaving me - often treating me -exactly- as he did back when I was losing my temper and raging like a psycho. It is like everything we've done and all the ways we've compromised are for nothing. We treat each other infinitely better than before - and no couple gets along 24/7 365 days of the year - so with all the growth, why are we so woefully incapable of communicating with each other when we're upset? Although there isn't any yelling or aggression, disagreements quickly turn very ugly. 

My boyfriend is horribly nasty when he argues, with cursing and name-calling, open threats of leaving me, disparaging of our relationship in general, and insistence that I am always solely to blame. I'm admittedly guilty of being petulant and rude, internalizing everything negative he says to me, and acting out (dramatically storming off, hysterics, etc). The more he insults me, the more miserable and childish I behave until we are both furious and disgusted with one another. We usually avoid each other for a while to cool off, mutually apologize, and then act like it didn't happen. I HATE this, and usually feel extremely depressed and obsess over whatever mean things he verbalized for weeks at a time. 

Another layer of this: After this many years together, I would like to get married, and this is often thrown in my face when we argue (I.e. ""I'll never marry you"" or ""this is exactly why we aren't married"").

Couples therapy is unfortunately not an option. I can't get into specifics but they are valid (career-related) reasons. 

I sincerely love him. He is my favorite person, and I want his life (and mine!) to be happy and fulfilled. My friends have expressed to me that I should leave him. My parents like him but think we've had too much baggage now to make it work and they also think I'm stupid for staying with someone who doesn't seem to have any intentions of marrying me. I myself am exhausted and heart-sick over it all, and recognize there is some sunk cost fallacy involved in my repeated decisions to stay. 

Is there anything at all I can do to break the cycle of fighting between us? I feel absolutely defeated. It crushed me to even type this up - without making this any longer, I'll just quickly add that there is a lot more good than bad. It's just really bad when it's bad.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years, and he doesn't really communicate with me. He talks to me, but not much, and he doesn't really disclose much either. He didn't mention his parents' deaths for two years; I recently learned from his sister that they died when he was 14 years old. I constantly feel like I'm the only one talking while he just listens, and I wish he showed me more courtesy and trust and felt as comfortable talking to me as I do to him. This is not the only issue we get into arguments over. For example, he asked me to wash the plates while I was working from home because he had cooked, but I put it off. When I was done, I went to wash the plates, but he had already done it. He looked at me like he wanted to say something, but he just said it fine, went to sleep, and acted like he was fine even though I could sense some passive aggressiveness. He always does this. Something bothers him, and he just looks at me funny, says it's fine, and goes on about his day. Sometimes we get into other arguments, and he apologizes first, doesn't offer an explanation, just says, ""I'm sorry,"" and then I ask why he is, and he says anything I want to hear, even though I can hear and see in his voice and in his eyes that he does not care.

I just found out his parents died, and after all these requests to meet them, he just dodged the question and said things like it was not possible and that he and his parents do not talk, always being so fucking vague and sneaky (because technically he did not lie but he did lead me to believe a different narrative). He never talks about his childhood or how he feels; he just tells me things above the surface. and even when he does talk, he is quick about it, and then he puts the spotlight on me. Even my friends think he is rude because, when I invited him out to meet them, he gave really short answers, giving them the impression he does not want to talk to them. I asked him why he did not tell me about his parent's death, and he just said he was sorry he did not tell me and did not think it was important. I told him he did not need to apologize; just talk to me and tell me why he never mentioned it, and he just zoned and walked to his room and slept (he slept). He has been a wonderful boyfriend who has always encouraged and supported me. He edited (he made me sound so passionate and professional ) my cover letter for the competitive job position i have and he recorded all my lectures, and attempted to do my assignments when i was sick for 1 week. I love him so fucking much but how am I supposed to see a future with him when he does not open up to me...

His sister is telling me that when they stayed in foster care he was used to giving up his things that he tries to redraw emotions from things that could be taken away. i get that but what does that have to do with not opening up, they seem like 2 different issues. no one can take away his parents memory.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7525772,public,self,My(23) boyfriend(23) doesn’t talk to me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yt22vg/my23_boyfriend23_doesnt_talk_to_me/,all_ads,6,,

We gained 3 beautiful children from it. The roles were always fair. We both work. We both provide. 

12-18 months ago he started to hang around with new friends. Would leave the house most evenings to hang out with them. I never objected as he worked from home and I thought it did him good. You know, just getting out of the house. Turns out he just started smoking weed. He smoked it in the past, but it was a very rare thing. By rare I mean once or twice a year. I didn’t really care because I didn’t see it as an issue. The issue with it began when he was bringing it into our family home. I also noticed he would drive whilst under the influence, thus would be after he had gone to his friends to the evening. I requested numerous times, not to drive under the influence. It’s dangerous. I further told him not to bring weed into the property due to the children. However, over the last 12 months he ignored my requests. A month ago it was the final straw as he said he was changing his life. He started to go to the gym most evening. Unfortunately, I discovered he hadn’t been going to the gym (been going 4-6 times a week). He lied about his where abouts and it turned out he was getting high with his new friends. 

I left the family home because I couldn’t cope anymore. I couldn’t cope with the betrayal and lies. I couldn’t cope with the inconsistencies. I pleaded for the old him to come back. Since he started the weed his behaviour had changed. He was more aggressive and I noticed his mental health declining. I offered him support and ask if he was becoming dependent on it. He said no and that he could easily stop. We agreed to go for couple counselling and to try one last time. 

The first week of coming home I set boundaries in place. That I wouldn’t never stop him from having his freedom. But maybe it would be a good idea to rekindle friendships ie like his father friends.  He didn’t listen and went to his pot head friends house. I told him if weed was important then i  would rather him be home. it turns out i werent happy with this. I said when he gets high, ill just go upstairs. He never smoked it in the property. Sadly, i caught him rolling a joint whilst the kids were awake and running around. it was as if, it was the only thing he was looking forward to that day. I didnt argue but told him he was out or order. The final time he got high when the kids were awake and when it was there bedtime. This was week 2 of trying to make it work. I went to bed and i thought it would be best to calm down before i approached it.  In the 3 weeks of getting back with him he continued to go to his friend house. With one being an over night stay. Sadly, i asked him the dreaded question if he werent addicted… then why wasnt he meeting me half way. i was accused of being controlling.  

I explained what damage his behaviour is doing to the relationship and threatening the stability of the family unit. Since meeting these new people and the weed habit his behaviour has become irratic and unpredictable. That i was feeling crushed and disrespected. I tried to establish the reason. to see if he was depressed.  He advised h just liked doing it and he wasn't thinking of me. he did it because he wanted to do it. his responses were child like.  i was shocked. that this was our last attempt and it just wasnt working, that i was pleading for the bare minimum. I wanted to be loved, respected and valued and not to always be the last priority. I got frustrated, i said all the effort you make going to your friends could ve spent on the relationship. We could organise a date night, we could do couple counselling. his response was that i couldnt make him do anything.  I finally asked the dreaded question, what would you choose…. me or the weed? he chose me. 

His behqviour escalater during this week. We had a heated argument and it went over 2 days. i waa working during these 2 days. i suggested we talked once we both calmed down. I continued working, and attempted to deescalate it all. I opened up and told him how these last 12 months have made me feel. i asked him to empathise and support me and that i couldnt trust him. Sadly, he said he was trying. he further expressed i needed to ""shut the eff up about his past"". separately he further advised ""youre not acting in the best interest of the children, thatmoving them away, isnt acting in the best interest. i am there dad and i have rights!"". 

i had nothing to say, i was shocked and called him scary.  hours went by, and he said he was leaving to go to his friend house to get head space. i told him this cant go into a third day, i don't have the energy. that if he went i cant keep doing this. i cant keep being left on my own. just please lets resolve this. he didn't care and i blurted out you leave, I'm throwing in the towel. i cNt do this anymore. i just want you to see me as a human being asking for you to love me. he left. 

the third day he came back asking what i wanted for breakfast. i was shocked. i said what are you doing here? he was bright and happy and said he wanted to talk. I told him everything and how he makes me feel and suddenly… the words came out my mouth "" i cant do this anymore, i cant keep being used"". 

he left and has been a good dad to the kids. 

i said he needs to get help and for him to find himself again. My husband isnt my husband anymore… this last year isnt him.

i loved him even through all of this… i love him. 

i want the old him back. The husband i had 13 beautiful years with and 3 children and a home.

My boyfriend and I are together for over a year, everything is so good (a relationship I wouldnt have dared to dream of) except our sex life. It's so bad I am sexually frustrated most of the time.

Now, I have a high sex drive. And my boyfriend has a lot of bad previous experiences with sex. His first girlfriend had been raped and would get panic attacks when he tried to touch her in any sexual way. And the gf he had before me, would make him feel ashamed if he didn't 'perform' well enough in bed. All these negative first experiences I didn't have anything to do with... On top of that he has trust issues and doesn't want to be a burden to anyone, resulting in keeping emotional issues to himself all the time.

I am very patient with him all the time. Sex life used to be pretty okay when we started dating, but after 2 months or so, he would begin to show these issues. Even though he tells me repeatedly he has never felt so safe and accepted before in a relationship. 

I actually listen to him and don't judge him. I'd never say anything to blame him or push him. And even though I have a very high sex drive, I try not to initiate too much because even kissing can make him feel stressed and lock up already. I really try my hardest to never put any pressure on it and occasionally it does work and we have a nice time in bed.

It's getting so exhausting sometimes and it really hurts to never really feel 'wanted' because it doesn't matter how long I wait, he will never initiate or even touch me sexually. Just cuddles, kisses, and touching my boobs and ass but never really in a sexual way.

It just feels like waiting for a lunar eclipse every time.

We talk about it and I know he should get help for this probably, but it's gonna take so much time to get to that point.

Now I understand it's perfectly normal of family to do this as they accept your partners.. but here's the thing. This family member has been caught in the past talking behind people's back like my best friend to his girlfriend. On a break between the two, my family member hooked up with her.. He's flirted with almost every partner my friend has had since we've always been close. Now he's met my girlfriend and likes her. I mean TikTok is fine i guess but Discord is an odd one cuz she doesn't play games and the app is only really for messaging and calls.. atleast that's all we use it for.

So we were playing Truth or Dare with my close friend group like kiddos, my partner was not there, then this question popped up: “What’s the thing that gross you the most about (my partner)?”. “We all have things that gross us about our partners, it’s normal”

I felt in a safe space to talk since they’re my closest friends. Almost opened my mouth about things that are truly unpleasant to me about my partner’s personal hygiene, but I said “that sometimes he doesn’t wanna shower before sex”.

A few seconds later I realized that was a horrible comment. I feel like crap, like I tore down my partner’s trust and humiliated him behind his back.

My boyfriend doesn't want to let his dad know because he worries his dad will scold his mom. Thing is, last month, his dad and him found out about his mom's credit card debt. And the dad did scolded the mom, but his dad say he will work hard to help pay. The dad doesn't know that my boyfriend has been giving all his money and savings to help with this other debt. I have been thinking about texting his dad or calling him to tell about this.

I've known for 6 months and yesterday I thought about this because my friend who barely knows my boyfriend, saw him in the street and ask me why does he look so stressed. And he does, I worry about him. I love this person and even if he hates me for this, if it can alleviate his stress I would do it.

The reason why I want to tell his dad is so that his dad can help him with it, maybe even confront the mom to either continue with the business ( because my boyfriend has been paying for operational cost each month) or shut his mom's business down.

Stupid things like that attacking Anne’s personality.

This has happened multiple times with different people. I don’t see why they dislike her so much. They never mention Anne doing anything to them, they just attack her personality or interests.

First a little about me, I am 22f and most of my life I have struggled severely with self esteem, bad friendships and a lot of sadness (not sure if it’s depression, but nothing diagnosed so I just say sadness lol). During my teenage years/school I NEVER got attention from boys. Maybe once or twice someone showed interest in me but it was always guys I did not like at all. I was friends with super pretty girls from my school and they all got a lot of attention so that fucked me up badly. I grew up thinking I am not good enough, worse than my friends and that no one will ever like me. This is probably a good point to add that I do look good, i would say I have a cool style and get occasional compliments for my looks/style etc so its not really about my looks, but i suspect that I always just seemed little and unapproachable.. 
A year ago, I moved to another city to go to college and I found some really good friends that finally make me feel like I am worth something and that I am likeable? I also finally got my ADHD diagnosis and stared meds which makes me capable of studying and just handling life in general for the first time ever, before that I just thought I was stupid. So this are was also crucial for my mental well-being.. so now on to my main point, I’ve had some dates and small crushes before but I have never been in love, have been loved, kissed anyone or even held hands or have been touched/looked at in a loving way and all that stuff. A few months ago I started talking to a guy and we have met a few times now and I realize he has been trying to get a little closer to me but I don’t really give him the chance. I am craving body contact and I feel this guy is very respectful and doesn’t really push anything on to me or tries to get closer in a uncomfortable way. I just don’t know how to start a conversation about my inexperience. I feel like if we get to know each other further I have to let him know that he will need a lot of patience since I don’t know how long it will take me to be comfortable with touching/being touched, letting someone close to me and I also don’t know if it will take me 2 weeks to be ready for sex or if it will be more like 5 months or 2 years. Although I had a major mental glowup if I can say it like tjat, i still think that I am not worthy of someone having that kind of patience with me, when they could go somewhere else and get sex faster and without all the mental „work“ with me. It’s super fucked and one of my biggest fears when getting to know someone:( my question is, how would some of you handle this situation if you got to know someone and they tell you all the things I just listed? Do you know someone in the same shoes as me? Would you be okay with someone telling you they might not be ready to sleep with you for years when you are a 22 year old guy?

I had my reservations about what dating would be like, and since becoming a couple, all my concerns have proven to be accurate. He keeps trying to fix things but he keeps making the same mistakes, and I’m so unhappy. It doesn’t help that I’m not a good girlfriend—at least, not in the traditional way that he’s used to. I’m not romantic, I don’t like gestures, compliments don’t come from me often, which all would have been fine if we had just remained friends. 

I know I should leave, and perhaps try to rebuild a friendship, but I don’t know if friendship is possible, and he’s been such a huge part of my life that risking the relationship stresses me out almost as much as being in it does.

My ex and I have been broken up for a while but we still keep a sexual relationship. I haven’t seen him in a year and from what he told me, the last time he had sex was with me. Now part of me believes him and part of me doesn’t. He’s not the type to lie but it’s hard to believe that he would spend an entire year celibate but then again for all I know, he could be telling me the truth. I’m also in the same boat as I haven’t been with anyone this entire time, either. We have plans to meet up and get down to business but I’m very paranoid about my sexual health. I’ve always been very cautious and part of me is thinking I should ask him to wear a condom just in case. We previously had been dating for 4 years and I never made him wear one but that was because we were always together, this time it’s different because I have no idea of his whereabouts or if he’s really telling me the truth.

To try to sum it up, we were together for a few years and there were occasions where he either tried to get back with an ex, talked about exes or posted about them and just being way too nostalgic for my liking. I ended up pushing it aside however it troubled me so I ended up taking a break to go on dating apps at a certain point and told him this. Nothing like those mentioned scenarios happened again for months until I found out he was in contact with the same ex again. Normally I wouldn’t have cared, but by around the time this happened I dropped the dating apps and was helping him out because he had broken his arm and he was convincing me that he had changed and to give him a chance. So I did, and I stayed around for a month helping him out noticing he had been messaging the ex and when I asked him about it he pushed it aside saying it was nothing. Turns out it wasn’t and from a deleted post on a throwaway account I found out he was supposedly still in love with his ex and debating between us all while convincing me to get back with him because he’s a changed person. After that I left and cut contact for a bit.

Now he still uses the same excuses saying he’s changed and he deleted Reddit even though he still talks about seeing Reddit posts somehow. I would’ve been fine remaining strictly friends but he refuses and every time I seem to ignore him he tries to do everything in his power to contact me.

I did it because I felt like it was hurting me.

Then after a while I fell in love with this girl (my current gf) for caring for me at that time. But after a while we kept arguing and arguing every week always has to be something to argue about and it's always her that gets angry at things. Today in the morning she was going out to a river with her school thing and then she slipped and almost drowned. I got sad and asked if she was okay and stuff ofc normal things a loving bf would do, then all of the sudden she just became mad at me because ""Even though I'm almost died I'm okay now so it's settled don't care about it anymore."" OFC I WOULD CARE I WASN'T THERE AND I LOVE HER SO NO SHIT I WOULD BE PISSED WHEN SHE TOLD ME TO NOT CARE FOR HER. sry for the caps but like holy fuck it pissed me off in a sad way so I got more upset because she almost drowned to death.

Then she started to like tell me ""What's wrong with you? I'm already okay what's wrong with you now?"" I said I'm just caring about you and I love you that's why I'm so afraid even if ur okay. Then she just says ""Thing is I'm still alive am I not? Why the fuck do you still care about it when I'm still alive???  
I said ""BECAUSE YOU ALMOST DROWNED""

and we're long distance relationship so I can't even do anything if she drowns or smth and go to the hospital which makes me even more worried

She started saying like ""The thing is I still haven't died did I why the fuck do you still care?"" How would I know? I love her??? What else could I be doing act like nothing happened? And yea more of those messages for a while

Then this is what she sent "" i dont feel anything towards your “i love you” "" it hurted me so fucking much.

And then this  
""okay look  
i never get this kind of caring so it makes me feel a bit irritating and annoyed when they care too much  
you care about things i dont want u to care about that much and when i do u just dont even give a fuck  
wtf?  
what is this?""

I just don't know what to do, she stopped answering on discord so I went to instagram to say sorry about the things that happened AND BOOM SHE GOT ANGRY AGAIN. She always talks about breaking up because of her ""past trauma"", saying I would want to break up with her even when I never said anything about breaking up. Not even once, but then she acts like she's the victim, saying ""want to break up? ye you know I always get angry easily at the dumb things""

and when I answered ""see you said it again"" She goes ""stfu, waste of my time talking to you about this, enough is enough. Bye."" and like that she's gone. Not broken up but just gone, this just happened an hour ago btw, she's still otw back home on the bus.

And now I'm in a vc with my ex because I was crying my fucking ass off not knowing what to do and she cares for me so much because I needed someone to cry on. Yet here she is. My ex. Not even my fucking gf does this to me.

A month after the breakup he told me that he was cheating on me but after a few years he said he only lied to make it easier for me to move on from him.

We had a mature conversation and he told me that he was always in love with me and would be very happy to be with me but because he is moving again soon it’d have to be long distance but he reassured me that he wanted it to work between us.

Moving forward to the present we text everyday and he has this thing of sending me round times (example: 11:11) to let me know that he’s thinking of me. I asked him if I was the only person he is sending these to and he said that no there is his friend (a guys name) who taught him the game and another friend of his (a girls name).

While money is an important part of the story, I'm asking for relationship advice, not money advice.

A few years ago, I offered temporary financial support to a Black couple, Alisha (27F) and Terrell (30M). They received about $3k/mo. The understanding was that they would eventually get jobs and the support would end. It was a challenge since he had three kids from a previous marriage and she had a young kid that was difficult to find childcare for. As a result, they haven't been employed aside from gig work.

I also occasionally purchased cheap vehicles for them at buy here pay here lots, since my credit wasn't very good. Finally, I made a few down payments on apartments.

I had also taken on a lady named Phoenisha (40F) and her daughter Shaniqua (20F) who were living in a trailer. They were initially $2k/mo. Supposedly Phoenisha's application for disability benefits was going to be approved eventually.

Then, I also supported an older white guy named Dan who took care of two young disabled ladies, for $1k/mo.

Finally, I lent money to Carl (45M) to help get his business going. I set up a web site and Google Ads for him, and loaned him nearly $100k over the years.

This was all a bit of a financial stretch though. To keep up with the bills, I had to take on a side job pulling in $30k/year. I also accumulated some debt. I figured that as each person got off my payroll, I could pay down the debt.

Fast forward to today.
 * Alisha and Terrell are living separately.
 * Alisha's bills are about $3k/mo.
 * Terrell's bills are about $4k/mo.
 * Terrell is partially disabled from an accident. He is still applying for work.
 * Alisha is pregnant with another kid, so she claims she can't work.
 * Dan was planning to get a retail job, but he is sick with Covid. He still lives on $1k/mo. plus his benefits.
 * Phoenisha and Shaniqua are still living in a trailer on $3k/mo.
 * Carl got his business assets stolen and is living out of his car off the occasional money that I send him. He tells me I treat him like sh** because he's used to earning $10k/mo.
 * Everybody is living on the bare minimum as far as I can tell.

I have over $110k in private debt and $70k in federal income tax debt, on a before-tax annual income of about $310k. I have used income tax payment plans for years, but I will probably not be able to keep adding to the payment plans.

Therefore (TLDR) I have to cut someone off, but they may become homeless if I do.

We were together for about 1yr 3months and I decided to split for a number of reasons, a couple of main ones being I wasn’t happy that we were going out all the time, I felt like I couldn’t have achieve my dream career (which I now know to be because of how I’ve always seen my parents relationship) all of which I know now I should’ve just spoken to her about but most of all because I’m bad with ‘what ifs’ in my head and overthinking.

My boyfriend (M 24, F23) and I have been together for a year and almost a half. When I first met him, I knew he wasn't a very sentimental person, I could just tell. But as our relationship progressed, I thought he'd open up more, and show something. He works a very long schedule at work, and that's why I always thought he was unaffectionate because of his job, wearing him down.

1 week ago, we were on vacation for about a good 2 weeks. This is the first time we could truly spend some quality time together. Almost the whole time we were there, he didn't show me anything, I was waiting for at least something, a smile, a kiss, a touch, but just nothing. We would just go for walks, swim, and when we got back, he would just lay down and watch tv. We only got intimate once, because I asked. It just breaks my heart, because I really do love him.

The only thing I can think of, is his dad, I've only met him three times, and in the three times I've met him, he was always very grumpy, and rude. My boyfriend has told me that he was abusive, how he pushed him down the stairs once, and would throw stuff at him.

We went out on our first date a bit over a year ago but it went well. He picked me up, offered to introduce himself to my mother and we had dinner together. We kissed at the end. He had exams, and I was busy so we never got around to catching up again, despite us wanting to and him constantly staying in contact from the night we met etc. He eventually had to move a few hours away and would often ask me to come and see him. I never really made the effort. He started getting a bit funny and hurt that I didn't want to come and see him and would often ask if I'm seeing others. When we first met, he wanted something serious I think. Fast forward things became more sexual (this past year). He would again, constantly ask to see me but I never made much of an effort. A few weeks ago, I noticed he made some random spotify playlist with a girl., but it was mainly romantic songs. Didn't think much of it. I recognised her profile from a while back (yes I've looked out of curiousity before). 

Anyway, much the same, he would often message me if I didn't respond. A few weeks ago, he asked if I had anyone and I said no and returned the question. He claimed he's waiting for me. 

Then, he kind of pulled away a bit for a week or so despite me sometimes not replying to him for a month etc. He asked me a few weeks ago if I would like to have dinner with him again, as we had been talking about that for a bit previously. We agreed, we would tomorrow. He texted me this Wednesday to confirm we locked it in. He asked something a few days ago, and I hadn't responded. He sent a follow up asking if we're still on. We booked it last night and he said he wants to take me somewhere we haven't been before and that he's happy anywhere as long as I'm there. Then finished off with saying that he's looking forward to it but is nervous. Then this morning, I notice that he follows her instagram page for her dog. I think I've always been a bit apprehensive, the random sexual messages, seeming like he wants a relationship etc.

We started talking a lot our freshman year and later caught feelings for each other. As we became attached over quarantine, i suddenly went through the biggest struggle in my life which was my parents divorce. I became very suicidal and depressed which led me to ghost and block her(along with many of my friends) but she took it rather  hard as she had(and still has)a massive crush on me. I still feel terrible about how I treated her and I regret it a lot. We started talking again this year and had built up our friendship and trust for each other again. I’ve had her friends and friends of mine tell me that she talks about me a lot. So I decided to try and reconnect with her. 


The main problem is that she is currently in a relationship. She has been on and off with this guy for a while and he keeps treating her poorly. She complains to me about him sometimes and she gets really upset with how she’s treated. I started to make hints that I still liked her and she began to tell me she get the same way. We started talking a lot more and would talk really late into the night. I figured things were going well.

Last night she blocked me on everything with no warning or anything. I’m honestly just lost at this point. She said I make her really happy and that she wants to be with me but now I’m just left with no understanding of why.

We’ve been together just over 2 years. We live with his 9 year old daughter who he has full custody of. When we met each other, I was pretty broken from a previous terrible and abusive relationship. After this relationship failed, I started drinking again (from a over 5 year sobriety stint) right before I met him. He’s a fellow heavy drinker, and we both initially had a lot of fun together. All in all, he’s a hard worker, a fun person to be around, happy go lucky, respectful and kind to me, and I genuinely have alot of great things to say about him. As do most of the people who know him. He’s the type of guy who would give you the shirt off his back. 

Our problems really stared about 4 months ago. I got sober almost 6 months ago and really don’t ever plan to go back to alcohol. Surprisingly seeing him drink still everyday seems to not effect me 99% of the time. But since then, I’ve taken on being the primary parent it feels for his daughter. Me and her butt heads alot and the last 6 months have been really hard dealing with the stress of having a kid in my life while being sober. I don’t have biological kids (infertility issues unfortunately) but have always wanted them. Her mom is not in the picture because she got into some serious drugs and hasn’t spoken one word to her since she was 3. 

My bf recently has been admitting his drinking is a problem recently and I try my best to treat him how I would want to be treated if I were in active addiction. Which is not to be chastised, belittled, given ultimatums, or told advice. I usually just say “oh I understand babe…. Trust me I get it.” I also ask “is there anything else I can do to help?” And he always responds with “this is my battle to fight, so no. I don’t need any help.” My only advice I ever tell him is to take things 1 day at a time and go easy on himself. Love himself enough to just give one day a try.

It sucks because he’s admitted to me he doesn’t like me talking about my sobriety with him. For example, When I hit 90 days I excitedly told him and he got all bummed out and rudely said “all you care about now is your new sober, fit life. It’s like you think you’re better than me or something.” (I’ve lost 20 lbs and have started working out a lot since then). So since then I celebrate each milestone in silence by myself and pray a lot that he finds the strength within himself to get sober. 

I notice since I got sober we fight alot more too. Mainly because I speak up more often about little things that bother me now when I used to just drink away those feelings. It’s frustrating because almost every time I bring up things he’s said that offend me, he almost ALWAYS says “I WAS JOKING!” When I know he wasn’t. This leads him to (in the last few months) relentlessly say things like “I’m getting burnt out, I feel like I’m with a completely different person. You used to be super easy going with everything and now every little thing pisses you off. It’s like I can’t do anything right. I jokingly say things and you always take things so serious. You’re no fun anymore.” 

Tonight we fought because he was saying he’s noticing a particularly concerning health issue that arised from his excessive drinking. I asked him “are you worried about that?” And he said “yeah… I’ve been worried about it for a while.” I started to say “babe… I recommend just taking-“ then he cuts me off and goes “TAKING IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. I know I know! You always say that and sometimes I wish you would just shut the fuck up!” 

It really hurt my feelings when he said that because he never says anything like that. Plus I literally PURPOSELY bite my tongue 95% of the time regarding that issue because it’s such a sensitive topic with him. But lately ever since he’s been facing this health issue, and KNOWS he has to stop….. The drinking has gotten much much more excessive. He now started openly pouring alcohol in his morning coffee in front of me. And now it seems like he’s turning into an angry drunk. What’s even more infuriating is I brought it up tonight that what he said earlier hurt my feelings. And he said his famous “I WAS JOKING, GOSH!” 

I just feel like right now our communication is horrible. I tell him how I feel, he tells me he’s joking, and he’s “over” having conversations like this, and I don’t feel like my concerns are being taken seriously. He tells me I take things too personally, and I’m always complaining. Tonight I said “well I feel like I deserve an apology.” And he said a very disingenuous “well… I’m sorry.”

I just feel bad if I leave, his poor daughter is so close to me. I can’t fathom leaving her and I really want to help him and see him get sober. I’d love some advice and insight.

She finally told me.    
She told me that she needed it.    
She viewed porn and extreme porn and erotica as the standard and never told me that she had been comparing me to it.

She admitted to turning down my advances, or any dates I tried to plan with her, so that she could read or watch a new post. She said It made her feel aroused, or in order to feel like she 
------------------------------------------------
I typically have a very positive glass is half full as long as i have my family, 

So at first, I did my regular ""thank you for feeling comfortable and sharing with me"" and of course I had questions,    
but my brain was beginning to spin,    
on the outside i was cool calm and collect,    
But mentally I was cracking.
We quickly changed the subject, I couldn't even make a logical thought about it at that point.

Then I started becoming overwhelmed, almost a great realization.

For about 13 years, she had me convinced that I wasn't good enough.    
We were drifting apart because I didn't know how to be romantic or intimate anymore.

I was extremely committed to making it better for her.    
I tried looking up things to try to spice up our love life,    
She made me feel like a pig for doing it.    
Some times what I looked up showed the couples wearing or playing what ever...her reaction was always ""Thats Disgusting""

I used to tell her ""how beautiful she was"" or ""wow you're so sexy, you turn me on all the time""    
And yes even after 14 years and a couple of kiddos, she still turned me on with just her presence.
   
She would consistently remind me that it's disgusting that I look at her and get turned on. 

For the longest time, I tried to make romantic intimate evenings. Slow things down and actually take our time.

She hated it, and wanted to skip it, just go to sex, no intimacy,  no post sex anything.

I asked her for years what her turn ons were, what I could do to make it better. Her response was always ""I don't know, I guess I don't have anything specific""

I would share my turn ons. She would often make me feel embarrassed. ""You're disgusting getting turned on when I'm in the shower. You're gross and make it sound like we're making a porno by wanting try that kind of foreplay""

------------------------------------

She signed us up for marriage counseling.

She Told the counselor she wants more intimacy and a better sex life. She hates that it feels like ""wham bam thank you ma'am ""

So I again worked on improving... She regularly declined my efforts. Critiqued everything. Nothing was enough.

-------------------------------

Now that she told me her addiction, I can't help but get mixed feelings.

She called me a pig for flirting with her or from being turned on by her still.

She made me disgusting for looking into different things for us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she feels justified with Her reasoning &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

She said she called me a pig, and declined my advances because she constantly compared it to those fantasies and felt guilty. 

She feels the mental gymnastics she put me through were justified....haha because ""you should have just known what I wanted""

--------------------------------

But now I'm emotionally numb.  
  
After 14 years or longer, she didn't feel comfortable sharing with me.

For about 13 years, she made me believe I was a disgusting pig drifting away from her and compromising our relationship. 

She wants me to move on, and forget and forgive....    
She knows that is my normal personality.

I guess I'm reaching out today, haha yes to internet strangers for help or guidance on overcoming this mental fog.

I don't remember the last time I felt this lost.    
It's not like she cheated on me. I feel I should just get over it.

But then I fall back into the dark,    
remembering the way she made me feel, the way she complained to the counselor or her friends for so many years.

She said she's willing to give what I was offering a chance, and did apologize for not recognizing what I was doing...

But I am a pig, I am disgusting, I am not romantic, I am not intimate, I am not equal to the men in her books or videos.    
I am worthless. I am so blind to the fact that my wife, for our whole marriage was planning her how she was going to watch or read while I was working night shift, or she already had plans before I made advances on her that evening....

Yes we have our kids. They have been the only thing I emotionally understood. She had been all over the place.


I don't know what to do next.    
I feel so numb, I can barely say I love you, let alone think about romance or sex.

I (19F) live with my mom and step dad, and little sister who’s ten. i dropped out of my four year university that i attendees for two semesters and came back home to go to my community college. i made this choice because i was sexually assaulted by one of my “friends”. i have a previous experience of sexual abuse ( not from my step dad) and this triggered a mental breakdown and led to me being codependent on weed and failing most of my classes. i promise this is relevant.

My step dad has been emotionally, physically, and verbally abusive to everyone in the household (not gonna go into deep detail but lots of screaming and grabbing). there is also a long history of substance abuse from everyone in the household minus my sister.

i’m not a violent person, although you may think differently at the end of this. I guess i could start off with the fact that my mom had too much to drink for one night. i heard noise coming from my moms bedroom, my step dad was laughing and my mom was groaning, and peeped my head in.
my mother was face down on the carpet in the little space between her bed and the wall. it took me a minute to register what was happening but from what i saw, my mother was throwing up, lying in a puddle of vomit, and my step dad was laughing.
i can’t remember the exact turn of events but i was livid. i asked my step dad why the fuck he was laughing at her when she needed help. he gave me some bullshit excuse and i told him to move so i could help her. he wouldn’t budge and told me to get out or something along those lines. 
i hopped over the bed and got behind my mom to put her hair up. at this point i was screaming at my step dad, insulting him, calling him an idiot, the works. because i was fucking pissed. because who lets their wife lay in a puddle of her own vomit and laugh. 
things only escalated from there and i definitely was a main contributor.
my ten year old sister, who might i add had a friend over for a sleepover, came upstairs because of my step dad and me yelling at each other. when she came in to the bedroom and saw her mom on the floor she started crying and screaming. i yelled at my step dad to get out and take her to her room. he told me to stop being a dictator and her to come in and “look at her mother”
again, pissed.
i told my sister and her friend to leave and continued to scream at my step dad to get out and leave us alone so i could take care of my mom. he kept making these sly little remarks about how all i wanted was control and whatever other bullshit. i don’t know i was too enraged to listen. a lot of names and words were exchanged.
it got to a point where he wouldn’t leave and i told him he was an idiot for leaving his daughter (my ten year old half sister) alone right now. i threatened him that i was gonna hit him if he didn’t leave.
he then, with a big grin, told me  i was  “a failure who couldn’t even finish college”
i broke
i screamed at him that i was sexually assaulted and picked up a lamp and hit him with it twice. i was blind with rage and so much pain was unearthed in that moment. all that was flashing through my mind was the physical and verbal abuse i suffered from this man for years. the floodgates opened. my sexual assault was awful, my relationship with my boyfriend (ex now) was destroyed, my friends at college all forgave him and most of them blamed me, i got addicted to weed and failed half my classes, so yeah. i guess by definition i an a failure, but to hear it from him really broke me. it was like he knew just what to say to destroy me. 

he still wouldn’t leave so i picked up the bowl my mom was throwing up in and him with it twice. he brought his fist up like he was gonna hit me back but my mom got up off the floor and stood in front of me. now i want to add, i’m not strong, i’m not very big, and i don’t hit very hard. he’s a 6’5, 250lb man. screaming ensued, this time from me and my mother and he left at some point during all this.

i immediately broke down with tears. i was so terrified he was gonna do something (he owns guns) that i locked the door and had 911 on speed dial ready. i just kept taking care of my mom and cleaning up vomit while sobbing.

my mom is tucked into bed and i’m shaking as i write all this. i don’t know what to do. i’m currently filled to the brim with shame and disgust and guilt for hitting him. i’ve never hit anyone before and i never thought i was capable of it.

i feel like i can’t keep living in this house anymore, that this was a breaking point. i feel like i’m the worst person in the world right now. i need advice desperately on how to handle this situation, i don’t really have anyone else to turn to.

TL DR:

So I've (NB 29)  known my partner (NB 31) for about 5 years now. When we met, we were both sort of in weird places in our lives. They had just recently quit a job they hated and had broken up with their long time gf, whom they were still living with. I'd recently broken things off with a bf of two years, and had kinda casually been dating a guy for a few months, but it wasn't working out so we'd agreed to end things. 

Anyways, this person and I meet via my work, and I was instantly taken with them (and they with me, I later learned). I still can't say what I was so enthralled with, but I really wanted to get to know this person. So a few days later I reached out and asked them out for lunch and a drink. They agreed, and we hit it off really well. We started going out pretty frequently after this, started sleeping together, and after a few weeks decide to make things official. 

As I said, at the time, they'd recently split with their long time gf, but were still living with her. They planned to go separate ways after their lease ended, since apparently things were still fairly friendly between them. I didn't think much of it, at first. But it's been 5 years, and they still live together. 

We sort of split up during the pandemic. Not officially, but we basically only saw each other once in a while, since I'd moved about an hour away right before the shutdown. So I guess this person and their ex gf started hooking up again during that time, and were talking about getting back together. We were barely seeing each other and as I said were basically broken up, and I was kinda seeing someone else during that time as well. To be honest, I wasn't doing well during those first few months of shutdown and didn't want to see anyone, really. 

After almost a year of not seeing one another, we decided to meet up and hang out for a bit. We walked by the beach, we grabbed lunch outside, and caught up. It was just like the first time we'd met: instant, undeniable chemistry. I was smitten all over again, although kinda confused about my feelings. After a few weeks of going out, we decided to make things official again, and they would drive over an hour several times a week, just to spend time with me.

As I said, it's been 5 years since we met, and about a year and a half since we officially started dating again. I still haven't met anyone in their life. Not a single friend, not a single family member. We have always hung out at my place, or in public, but I'd never even seen their apartment until a few months ago, and that was only because their roommate (the ex gf) was out for the night. 

They still do a LOT of stuff together. We talked about going to Vegas, and instead of us going, they took her to Vegas. We were supposed to do something specific for their bday, and they ended up attending the event with her instead, and didn't even tell me about it, nor the Vegas thing. They took her to Disneyland, too. They go out to lunch/dinner with each other's families at least once a month. I get that their lives are very entwined, since they've known each other for 10 years. But it sometimes makes me feel like a nobody in this person's life. There was even a time where we were supposed to be on vacation together, and they left basically in the middle of the night, because this woman told them she was feeling sick, and needed taking care of. They drove back several hours just to take care of her (she had a cold, it wasn't like she was severely ill). 

I've brought up the fact that all this really hurts me, and they have stopped taking her on trips etc (to my knowledge), and have started to invite me to stuff with friends/family (although I still haven't met any of these people). They have been making solid progress in separating themself from her, and have admitted to me that they know they have a toxic, codependent relationship with her. But they also are open about the fact that there are still feelings there for them, even though they know it wont work out. She has been blatantly trying to get back together with them since we started dating again, and (imo) has tried to sabotage our relationship on several occasions (the vacation incident included).  

This person and I are planning to move in together. In a few days, in fact. We paid the deposit, and sign the lease Monday (in 3 days). But I've started to spiral about possibly making a gianormous mistake in doing so. We love each other, I know that. But I also know that's not enough. We complement one another very well, we share the same morals and viewpoints, the same outlook on most things, and have many interests in common. We talk for hours and hours and hours when we're together, until we're hoarse. The sex is incredible, too, so there's that. Even when things are kinda rough, we don't scream or fight, we have lengthy discussions and our communication is pretty dang good. 

But I'm terrified that I'm being played for a complete fool. And I'm terrified that that anxiety is going to potentially drive me away from the best love I've known, despite the issues with their ex. 

Sometimes I think I'm a complete sucker. I just don't know. I've been gaslit so hard before, and I don't know if I'm being gaslit now or if I'm just so scared of it happening that I'm considering throwing away something that has the potential to be a life long relationship. 

I think I just need a sanity check. Maybe I'm being over dramatic in being so scared about us moving in together, and things going horribly sideways if my partner can't separate themself from this woman. 




some info on the ex (for more context, sorry it's long but very relevant:)

They met pretty young, have known each other for the past 10 years, and have been living together almost as long. She developed severe anxiety, depression, and agoraphobia a few years into their relationship, and also got really sick. My partner basically ended up taking care of her, working and paying all the bills and such. She's gotten a lot better in the past 5-6 years, especially with the agoraphobia. This is apparently why they've been doing stuff like going to Vegas, and Disneyland, to celebrate her overcoming it enough to do such things. Which I completely understand, at least in theory. 
She still has a hard time taking care of herself, though. She doesn't have a job, and my partner pays for everything still, from the rent to groceries to her heart medication. I'd maybe be more understanding of that if she didn't constantly manipulate or guilt my partner into also buying her tons of unnecessary, expensive stuff (or paying off her credit card when she maxes it out on stuff like makeup, expensive clothes and video games). 
My partner has a really hard time saying no to people they care about. And she knows it, it would be impossible not to. We've been working on it, doing exercises with me pretending to ask for increasingly outrageous things, and them responding ""no"". They break down in tears every single time. Even when I'm asking for something they know they can't give me, like a billion dollars. 

I'm also fairly certain that the ex has tried to sabotage our relationship before. There was the incident when we were on vacation that I mentioned above. Around valentine's day, I broke out my calligraphy pens and wrote a couple love letters in the form of poems, and mailed them to my partner. We had a long, mushy conversation over the phone after they read them, and I was feeling that happy lil glow inside. I woke up the next morning to several missed calls and texts from my partner, basically telling me that this ex had stolen the letters while my partner was sleeping, read them, and thrown a fit about it. She'd found my Twitter (which apparently she checked semi frequently, but didn't follow me. My bad for being on public I guess lol) and had messaged me in the middle of the night, basically saying that she was confused about what was going on between me and her ""sort of ex.. thing?"" (direct quote). Saying that as far as she was concerned, they were basically still dating and that my partner had all but said they were getting back together. 
I was devastated. It felt like she'd confirmed all my worst fears in one message. And I still don't know who was lying, her, or my partner when they told me that what she said was all a lie. My heart wants to believe my partner, but trauma likes to tell me they might be lying. 
It was a big turning point in our relationship, as I flat out told my partner that if things didn't change, I was out. And as I said before, my partner has been making solid progress. 

To me, it seems like this woman is taking advantage of her ex, and doing what she can to sabotage our relationship so that she might have a better shot at them getting back together. Maybe it's crude of me to think it, but who really wants to lose the person who pays for everything in their life? If that's the case, then I feel like I should be more understanding of how hard this all is on my partner. Escaping from abuse is extremely difficult, and I would call trying to manipulate someone into staying with you, emotional abuse. 

But there's still that nagging part of my brain that likes to scream: ""BUT what if *she* isn't the problem, what if it's your partner who's the manipulative one? What if everything they tell you is a lie??"" And honestly, it's really hard to ignore that little voice sometimes. 


TLDR: (you honestly deserve a medal if you just read all that)
