I'm also on mobile so please forgive me for any formatting errors. 

So I (25F) am currently on my mother's phone plan. I have been since forever and we have a system set up where I pay her each month for my phone. The way we have it worked out, I'm essentially paying $50 a month for my phone. This is fabulous for me, as getting my own phone plan would cost me over $100  a month and money is tight. 

I live with my partner (30M), whom I have been dating and living with for almost 3 years. This is all came to a head this morning. I was discussing going to visit my mom with my partner and mentioned I need to pick up my new phone from her while we visited. 

My partner looked at me confused and asked why I still wanted to be on my mom's phone plan and not get a plan with him. We've discussed this in the past and I told him then I didn't want to be on his plan. I don't like the idea of being tied to a romantic partner like that unless we're married. It's not that I don't trust him, it's just that I've been in a long term relationship before where I was tied to the person via a credit card and got severally burned by that when we broke up. I learned my lesson then and I'm not looking to go through that again. Thats just some back ground though.

I mentioned the financial benefits I listed waaaay up at the top of this post as for why I wanted to stay on her plan. After stating my thoughts on it, my partner told me that it was weird I wanted to be on my mom's plan and not get one with him.

Now I'm really questioning if it is weird for me to still be on her plan. I've never questioned it before as this is something that's always worked out for her and I, so I just assumed it was normal. 

So Reddit, am I weird for this? And if I'm not, how would you suggest I go about discussing this further with my partner. I don't want him to think it's because I think our relationships doomed or anything like that, because I don't, but at the same time I really like the plan I have with my mom.

Low and behold the date comes, we go for a walk and talk for a few hours. Everything goes well, we kissed under the stars which she said was a smooth move, we held hands and I went to drop her off home. 

As we pulled back into her driveway she brought up the idea of having a second date the same time the following week. I responded ""For Sure!"". 

We kissed again,  this time a little more intensely, but I cut the kiss a little short, we departed ways and she texted me how she had fun later that night. 

Later in the week as I tried to finalize our next date, I noticed she would take a day to days to respond. She basically said she was busy on the date she suggested we have our second one, I made a second attempt to ask her out for a second date and she once again said she was busy with friends that weekend. 

I took this as a sign of low interest and just left out exchanges there.

She was teaching remotely 40+ hours but insisted on taking a job in a grocery store; early in the pandemic, putting herself and her new husband at risk. He already owned a house, didn't ask her to pay anything, helped her pay off at least 30k in student debt, and insisted she not take the other job. He was providing close to 100%. 

She did anyway, burned herself out, gaslit him for feeling ignored and depressed, emotionally abused him and everyone around her that she didn't cut off, and 18 months later, after pocketing almost 1 year of wages, divorced him. Went on to treat me and her family like crap whenever she was inconvenienced or stressed, most directed at me for continuing to talk to my friend, her (2nd) ex-husband. 

I put my foot down and said I didn't appreciate the way she spoke to me or treated me. I tried to talk to her about the pattern of behavior &amp; how that wasn't healthy, but she insisted on being distant because she thought her ex would r\*pe and murder her (completely unfounded and slanderous btw- just textbook psychotic delusions) and I was still friends with him. To avoid any backlash, I stopped talking to her, which ""hurt her feelings"". 

She was a history of this... She makes herself a victim. Her mother took out a plus loan for her room and board in college and with a full meal plan would insist she was a ""starving artist"" and could only live on pop tarts and ketchup. Amongst other incidents. I'm not exaggerating. 

If you've made it this far... My husband and I are setting up our life insurance policies. She is a beneficiary. I do not want her to be because 1) if he goes before his mother, I feel like we should be covered before her. If she (likely) goes first, than we can just edit this. and 2) ... Let's be real. She has already made off like a bandit from one marriage. She doesn't need any more handouts. If he were to die, neither her ego nor her accounts need the help. 

I'm not concerned with reconciling with her; she's a textbook narcissist and won't change her ways. Last time we met was with a mutual friend- we cleared up a few things and I asked if she'd like to try to reconnect and she declined, so I left it alone. I honestly don't want to talk, and apparently, neither does she. But I feel completely unsupported by my husband when it comes to her behavior and our personal logistics- he seems painfully obtuse and oblivious to her toxicity and how his family has enabled this behavior for the last 30 years.

I (21F) moved into an apartment this July with two other people (21NB) (19F), and we all go to the same college together. Things have been getting bad for me here and I'm not sure if there is a better course of action for me to take other than breaking my lease and moving back into campus housing.

My cis roommate I hardly know, but we're mostly chill. I didn't know her before we got a place together, and I don't expect much from her.

My nonbinary friend, Gary, and I have been friends for 4 years. We've been pretty close through that time, but I think living together has hurt our friendship significantly. They only ever text or talk to me if they want something, or need a favor (I've checked our texts). We don't hang out. They never seem to have time to go anywhere or do anything that involves me, and every time I invite them to hang out they always seem to have other plans.

I have also learned this year that I have borderline personality disorder, which explains a lot of my impulsive, risky behavior. I am receiving adequate treatment and attend therapy twice a week.

I have done a lot of things this year that put myself in danger (excessive drinking, lots of casual sex) and I was briefly hospitalized for my mental state in September. I think Gary may have seen a side of me that they didn't see before, and I think that I might scare them.

I'm not certain about how they feel  because they refuse to talk about it. They're pretty busy between work and school, and they seem to have very little interest in improving our friendship. I have made three attempts to engage with them about our issues from September to now, and they have refused to discuss anything.

All of this is fine on its own. Friendships can naturally drift away. Additionally, I'm aware that my mental illness makes it very easy for me to destroy relationships because I have very intense, overwhelming emotions. I don't want to force them to be my friend, and I don't want to force them to be a part of my support network.

But I don't wanna live alone. Especially at this point in my life, I feel incredibly fragile and I can't really afford to be isolated. If I move out, a random person will take my room lease (vetted by the complex). I've expressed my desire to return to campus, and my roomies' first reactions were about not wanting to live with a stranger. They never asked me why I wanted to leave, and I don't think that they care.

All the same, as unhappy as I am, I don't want to put them in harm's way, and there's a chance that we could mend our relationships. Is there an element of this that I'm maybe not seeing? Is there another plausible reason for their emotional avoidance? Is this not as big of a deal as I'm making it?",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7615927,public,self,Trouble Between Roommates,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z22b14/trouble_between_roommates/,all_ads,6,

Everything is going super well, she loves me and I love her and our relationship is probably stronger then ever. But that's kind of the problem.

My gf is from a christian balkan household, which means, that she isn't really „allowed"" to bring many guys home and if she brings one home (me) she needs to be sure about him. Everyone in her family married their first bf/gf and she's also planning on doing that (me).

It's both my gfs and my first relationship and at the beginning I really liked the idea of marrying her. But now after two years I'm not so sure about that anymore. And don't get me wrong, she's literally perfect, as some would say she's „wifey material"" and she completely fulfills my needs and I fulfill hers.

BUT, I can't really see myself staying with my first love forever. I mean how would I even know if she's the one, If I didn't have one or more gfs before her. I wanna experience life and different persons and different kinds of love and AFTER that I can see myself settling down comfortably with a wife, knowing I experienced all of that.

She's almost finished with school and our plans were to go to Uni together and also move in together. I mean her family basically already sees us as married and I think she does too. But I don't know if I see it like that aswell. And after we've moved in together everything would probably be a lot more complicated if we (or me) would decide to break up. Or I won't have the courage to actually do it after we move in.

Ijust don't want to be trapped unhappily for the rest of my life. Ofc there's the possibility that we'll be happy and I'm just overthinking it and we'll have a great time and life together. But I don't know if I can do that.

We were on the bus yesterday, nearing our stop, someone else pushed the button to ding the driver to stop.

Fast forward a few months, and things fizzled out in the communication department. It was hard to get our schedules to sync up as we live in different time zones. Frustrated one day, I pushed him away. And he, to protect himself, started doing the same...

He was also honest with me and shared that he valued human-connection and contact and wasn't sure about the long distance. I felt the same way but life...

Communication went from speaking weekly on the phone for hours to a few story responses over social media and some kind words over DMs to now, nothing.

I caught him creeping on my other social media pages, and he's the first person who pops up to watch my stories (it's cute). I can also tell when he's deliberately avoiding clicking on my content, as I'm the only few people who do on his Instagram. He has a private account and mostly follows family and friends. We silently watch each other on social media but don't say a word. I feel his presence so much, so it gives me migraines.

Hey y’all, so I’ve been with my GF for 1 year and a half.

Thought the entire relationship I’ve seen plenty of red flags, and also I’ve been treated like a pet to her, I think she’s been quite disrespectful to me and using me as a convenience, this has ruined my self steem, and also has made me feel so insecure and anxious. Constantly.

After several conversations I feel like things are getting much better, she has a lot of issues and I’m also flawed, but I’m willing to work on everything together.

I love her and I enjoy plenty the time I spent with her.

But my main issue at the moment is that, I don’t trust her when she goes out, which she does a lot and plenty of them without including me and with dudes that would gladly sleep with her if the opportunity is given.

In the past she has cheated and hide it from me.

A while ago i snooped her phone, I know it’s wrong, I’ve never done something like that in my life, but I felt like she would never tell me if anything else has happened so I wanted to know the truth.

And I found about the time she cheated(I knew that one already) and one more time in the first months we started dating. And it’s likely other that I just couldn’t find. 

And I just can’t get over it or trust her when she’s out, I feel so anxious and so insecure.

Things have been amazing lately and I’ve put so much effort to make this work but I can’t get rid of the gut feeling that tells me don’t trust her.

There are very specific aspects about this circumstance that makes me feel very conflicted.

So basically we met a few months ago in VRChat if you know what that is. She was friends with a person I had met online before and I just kind of ended up integrating myself into that friend group. 

Next thing we knew we all started hanging out every single night on vrchat and overtime grew closer and closer to everyone to the point that me, my female friend, and my initial friend I met her through at this point are extremely close. We all talk to each other about our problems, really personal stuff, etc. We even eventually made a discord group chat where we all get on voice call with face cams most nights as well.

For months I basically didn't really think of her in any way beyond a close friend. However, her and I happened to live within a 3 hour drive of each other and the idea got brought up that I should come visit, and I thought it would be fun and so I did. I ended up spending the whole day with her and spent the night in her living room and had a ton of fun. 

(Just for reference She did talk to her boyfriend about whether it was okay for all of this to occur and he was totally chill with it)

By the end of the trip though is when I really started to realize my feelings for her. Ever since it's been hard to take my mind off everything.

Okay now just as a start, I know the typical advice for this situation. It's to distance yourself in order to let the feelings fade and be respectful to their pre existing relationship. 

However I worry that distancing myself could cause the friend group to fall apart. It feels like if one person steps out it could lead to everyone kinda dwindling away. The girl herself says that this friend group feels like something she really needs because she doesn't have many friends and being able to have friends she is really close with is comforting. She has described the group as her ""safety blanket"" at times. I think sacrificing the group over this could be really painful for all of us

On top of that, I know that her current relationship has been... rocky to say the least. In the past her boyfriend openly cheated on her but she didn't break up with him. Apparently a month ish before I even met her she would rant to people about how she couldn't think of even one good thing about her boyfriend, and everyone she vented to told her to break up with him and yet she didn't for I think the reason that she doesn't really have anybody else she would talk to in her area much. Granted I don't know whether her relationship with him has gotten better. She mention him a fair amount and says she tells him about stuff we do in our group. I'm also fairly sure she talks to our friend group more often than she does her boyfriend though.

I don't really know what to do. It seems like the best thing is just wait around silently and see if her relationship with her boyfriend eventually crashes but on the other hand I feel the need to suppress my feelings to maintain our current friendship status.

so, I went back, I bought a shoe, and she said that she’d like to see me again.
I told her to use my number and reach out.

Immediately, we jumped in the deep end.
We started texting and engaging in phone sex, over the next 2 weeks. 

Then suddenly things changed, and she became extremely cold. I asked to see her during our lunch breaks, i felt as if she was “iffy” about that.  One day I asked to call, she said yes.. ignored me, then nothing from her for a few days.

So… I panicked and sent a message yesterday basically saying im moving on…

She texted back saying she’s going through a lot… with her child, mental health etc.
And, I followed up saying in a text that I though she had lost interest. Hence the moving on message.

And… nothing from her after that. It’s cold.

Did I just fuck up my chance to build a stronger connection with this woman?

My mother-in-law is not a bad person at all. She just has no concept of **going with the flow**. 

Say we're driving to the mall and our GPS recommends we take X faster route. If I take it, she'll spend five minutes talking about how we ALWAYS take Y route, and it goes along the lake so it's a nicer drive, and also X route usually has traffic and she doesn't trust GPS.

Or if the house temperature is at 72, she'll talk about how *most* houses set it to 68, and that allows everyone to choose to wear a jacket or not, and also it saves on heating costs, have you ever thought about how much this *adds up*???

part of this is the ADHD that runs in my wife's side of the family. None of them know how to concisely tell a story. Some of it is just her enjoying being the center of the conversation. She gets *very* annoyed if she's in the middle of a twenty-minute story and we try to change the topic.

Anyway, I'm dreading her comments about our new place. She's lived in a big old ranch in the suburbs for twenty years, and our place is a fixer-upper condo in an urban area. So I'm proactively reaching out for advice on how to manage the situation.

Our relationship ended bc his emotionally unavailable behavior forced me to cut him off. I lost attraction for him bc if the emotional immaturity and mind games. The universe gave me a reward after dealing with him and I met the best BF I've ever had in my life shortly after. We are still together (almost 2 years strong)! 

But, after cutting ex off, 3 months later he's begging to be back in my life. I refused. He tried several more times a few months apart and I refused all those times. He tried again a whole YEAR later and bc I was so secure and felt bad for him at that point, I agreed to meet up. While texting to meet up he's trying to probe my life, which is more than what I was expecting. *He says he has a GF in a context that didn't at all warrant him bringing it up*. It was clear he wanted me to know he's getting new attention/has moved on too. I'm like, whatever, he *is* the type to jump from relationship to relationship. 

We meet up and he probes me about my current BF. I don't probe him about his new GF because I don't care what she is like, but he drops very few vague comments (that don't sound loving or positive) about topics that mirror the ones I talked about with my BF. 

**I think he's lying about this new GF and that she's either just his friend or FWB instead.** Why do I care about this? Bc he is still very serious about us becoming Real Friends again (we were friends before we started dating) and does stupid stuff on social media to get my attention, even though I still have not contacted him after the meet up. **But if he's \*seriously\* lying about a new GF (@ 27 years old) to make me jealous, I don't want anything to do with him in any way in the future. Like that would be the last straw, confirming he's a narc or just super unstable, which is why I'm curious to hear y'all's opinion.** I might even call his bluff someday.  

What I'm building this case on, haha:

\- The girl he's saying is his GF is not his type at all. And he's an incredibly superficial person who likes trophy women; he is not a personality person; he wants the hottest woman he can get. This supposed GF is a major downgrade from me and his ex before me. Like a mile downgrade. I don't mean to be mean, but it is a fact. 

\- I've seen some photos and videos with ex and his supposed new GF in it and they don't stand close to each other, are not affectionate, and actually look quite awkward. 

\- He hasn't posted much of her on social media (not even on her birthday), and he's previously tweeted and posted all about his past GFs. 

\- In our meet up, when he vaguely described a timeline of their relationship (bc he asked me mine with my BF and I gave one, so he mirrored) he at no point said when they officially started dating &amp; I also know from a friend that he was gushing over a completely different girl during that murky timeline he gave.

\- In our meet up, he mentioned that he is ""looking for stability now"" (showing me that he's changed bc he only wanted casual relationships before when we were involved). But why is he ""looking for stability"" if he's a relationship with someone?

\- In our meet up, he also said he's ""allowed to do whatever he wants,"" meaning his supposed GF doesn't care about us meeting up. He said this after I said I talked to my BF about us meeting up to see how he felt about it. I doubt he said anything to his supposed GF.

I´m sorry for any weird sentences, i´m quite emotional right now ahah  


First, little background about me:  
I(20) moved to a new country right after high school hoping, that this one/two-year gap would help me deciding, what do i want to do in the future. Right now, i´m attending language school which i should end next year, but after that i have two possibilities:  i can either make a practicum or study.   


After practicum i already have a profession, also it´s quite close to my current city, i could stay where i currently live. Of course, i wouldn´t be paid as good as after university, but the closest unis are far away from my city. Also, i doubt i would find a job in this such small area i live in. I probably would have to move to bigger city. Honestly, i consider both choices equally, but everyone is recommending me to study.  


The thing is, since four months (well, we started dating 6 months ago but made it official after 2 months of knowing each other) i have a boyfriend(m25), whom i would like to include in my future. That´s why i´m afraid of even thinking about studying, i don´t know what it would mean for our relationship. I also don´t know how should i talk with him about it; i don´t want to scare him off talking about future after only few months of dating, also i´m afraid that it would end with us breaking up.  
And it´s not like i already decided to study, but it´s something i consider.

My(27F) husband(33M) and I have only been married 10.5 months. There’s a lot to unpack here so please, bear with me. We had only dated for a couple of months before we decided to elope; we thought we were crazy about each other and we jumped the gun. To complicate things, I’m Canadian and he is American so we aren’t from the same country. To clarify, no, we did not file for a green card/PR. We met in Miami Beach when I spent a year “soul searching” there… we had met at the club LIV. We didn’t share the news with our family until after we had eloped, and we decided we would have an actual wedding 3-4 years down the road. 

My spouse is/was a trust fund baby and we had a similar upbringing. I own a few business’ and invest in cryptocurrency and stocks, and my family had gifted me the capital to start my business’. My spouse was not working and had his family’s AMEX until earlier this year. His mother is going through a divorce and they had hired a forensic accountant, so he is no longer allowed to use her AMEX. She did a rug pull on him and told him he needed his own source of income. I love my mother-in-law and we talk for hours, she is one of my best friends and that makes it all more difficult. Anyway, a few months, my spouse has now started his own business with my help and it has really taken-off; I’m happy for him. 

We went through a rough patch because I was frustrated with my spouse. He has been taking Adderall since he was 16 and he also takes Klonopin for anxiety. I believe his medication decreases his sex drive so we would have sex 5 times a week and then we go a 3-4 days without having any sex. During the days we don’t have sex, he would cuddle me and still be very loving.

We were separated from Oct 5 to Nov 14 because I thought we needed time apart. We had spent almost 24/7 together for nearly a year, and it was getting unhealthy. We both run our business’ from home and it’s easy to step on each other’s toes. During this time, we were speaking on-off and I had told him that he did not owe me loyalty. He does not have many friends because he’s an introvert and the friends he did have, they’re married with children and have moved away from Miami. He ended up confiding in his ex, they were together for two years and she had never met his family. He claimed that he did not see her in a serious matter because she was much younger (8-9 years his junior); his mother confirmed this. She would go over to his place twice a week, and they would have sex, watch movies, and she would go home afterwards. They had broken up because she wanted to move-in together and see each other more often but he objected. They had broken up over text message. Anyway, he went over to her place to talk to her because he had no one else to confide in. He felt like he owed her an apology for how things ended, and he felt his mother and I betrayed him, since we had spoken poorly about him behind his back. My husband has communication issues and cannot handle confrontation. Anyway, things got out of hand and he ended up sleeping with her the one time he saw her. He came clean without me asking, told me the truth and he told his ex, he will not speak or see her again and blocked her. I don’t know how I feel about any of this. I have also slept with a few other people during our time apart but he slept with an ex, which makes it difficult to move on from. I don’t even know what I want out of this marriage and I don’t know whether to stay or to leave. He told me it didn’t mean anything and it was a moment of weakness. I had told him he didn’t owe me the loyalty, and he said she was available, threw herself at him, and he didn’t say no. He did deeply regret it and realized it was a mistake. Here’s the thing, I believe him because his ex had reached out to him and made up lies about our relationship for months now, and she has some unresolved issues regarding self-esteem and her childhood. All in all, I’m unsure how to move forward and to trust again.

He did have work last summer, and for about a month this year before they fired him for being late too much. I am getting sick of it because he is up until 3am, and sleeps until about 2pm. We had moved to this town for my work, which has now ended(May- November). I was working outside for 10 hours a day, with about an hour commute each way. I would come home to him playing video games w/ his friends almost everyday. It would take 5-10 min before he would take his headset off and talk to me. 

The thing is, that started to drink every night as well over the last few months. I was drinking as well, but i would still go to bed around 10pm to be up for work. He is never down to talk about any conflict or problems so sometimes I will mention it and try n talk before I go to bed. It got weird because twice in one week i would be awake in the night to get water, or just up w my insomnia and he kinda went into a drunkard rage? idk how to explain it. Pretty much he called me a dumb c\*\*t , useless bitch, stupid, irresponsible, etc. He just went off w/ everything he thought was wrong with me I guess.  He has never before called me a c\*\*t, big fuckin no no word for me. Which then the next day he would apologize, tell me not to take it seriously because he didnt even remember. I still have yet to try n talk to him about that again. Just sort of freaked me out. 

Anyways, i have been done work now and  i will be taking a bit of a break to let my body rest up and my bf still doesnt have a job, or has had interviews since August. Being at home for the last week really put me into his shoes (no job, no sleep scedule, literally only plays video games), its fucking bullshit.

In opening this,  I'll start by saying I'm a recovering alcoholic.  Went all of 2022 without drinking.  Did 4 months of treatment that worked wonders to my psyche.  This was a result of heavy drinking for about 3 years.  

 My gf(33) and I (34) have been dating for 3 years.  1 year in our own places and moved in together. I had a drinking problem that she dealt with for a year when we first moved in.  It was causing problems,  she was vocal about it,  so I quit,  went into treatment,  and remained happily sober since.  Being an alcoholic,  you drink through all of your problems.  So when I quit is when I really had to face them. I was frustrated with her laziness, almost no libido,  lack of communication,. When I was drinking I bottled up these emotions,  conceded,  then blew up with the pent up emotions.  Not healthy hence sobriety.  During the beginning of my recovery I did I everything around the house.  Cooked,  cleaned, chores. Everything.  Her chores and mine combined.  She was going through stress from her work load so I wanted to alleviate pressure off of her. She has depression,  Anxiety, a little ocd, controlling issues, anger issues, adhd, self esteem  Issues.  That's all that I know of so anything can trigger anything. 

Her laziness drove me nuts. I hate when people pass off their duties off on others.  I deal with it at work all the time but in construction you can say alot more to get your point across than in regular life which was a part of why I took on all the chores.  I wanted to show her that I can handle her stuff,  and my stuff at one time hoping that she will see what's happening and kind of being up what her being lazy is doing.   It has gotten a little better now but not by much.  

Our sex life has been pretty much non existent for 2 years. Pretty much since we moved in together we had sex maybe 4 times.  2022 has been nothing.  I have a normal/ higher libido. I would be happy with sex once a week.  She on the other hand is basically 0. She wilfully on her own remained celibate for a year just because she didn't feel like it before we knew each other. She was sexual abused once in her twenties and I think it has something to do with it,  but she has no intimacy whatsoever.  We held hands in public maybe 5 times,  never snuggle on the couch.  Nothing she'll kiss me when I get to home from work and that's it. This lack of intimacy,  mainly sexual is killing my confidence,  worth,  and all around importance to the relationship.  We've discussed this time and time again that she brought up to her therapist who gave her little tips and tools to try for her. she spoke to me about them. My reply was great! I'll help with anything.  8 months later I see no effort on her side. Now she tells me I should initiate everything because it makes her visibly uncomfortable. I try doing the snuggling and whatever and it just gets shut down. Why should I put her in the uncomfortable position when she should be wanting to do it herself of she wants it to work.  Why should I just let her not do anything for us when a part of why I quit drinking and put in all the work for the relationship for her to do nothing.  No reciprocation. 

I love the woman and want to be with her but I have a hard time telling myself that alot of the time.  I'm trying not to but the Resentment in all of this is growing and growing. I've actually thought of cheating,  which is against my word,  but I feel like  my feelings,  wellbeing are being ignored because of her problems.  I feel like ending it is inevitable but I'm willing to fight for this.  Unfortunately it feels one sided. She always says these things don't happen overnight.  But after a year and very little non important progress makes me feel like it doesn't matter.

Tl;Dr -- One day at my gym, J hits on me and asks for my #, later over text she admits her feelings that she's into me. I'm about to go to college in fall 23, J is a junior in HS, we're both restricted on travel since neither of us have a license. And I will turn 18 in Dec and get my license in Jan. She's turned 17 this Sept, so I'll be dating a minor a month from now. We aren't planning on visiting the same college.

Super short tl;Dr -- might be the right person, but wrong place and wrong time. 


I'm a HS grad who took a gap year and is attending RU in fall '23. I just moved to NJ a few months back, while at my gym, J comes up to me with a cute corny pickup line and I give her my #. This told me that J already has an interest in me, and through further texting she admitted some feelings to me. 
J is also 17, she is currently a JUNIOR in HS though. She plans to attend a program specific school in NY. 
Neither of us have a license yet with us both having permits, I will get mine in January, but I'm turning 18 before then. 
So currently, we barely know each other, I'm going to uni real soon, we can't really ""hang out"" as often because of how restricted travel is (we live like 20m away but who's walking that distance) .
J still seems like a really cool person, I adore her personality, but parts of it remind me of my ex. Where my ex was childish almost, J is more grown and mature. But she's still a high schooler, while I'm about to go into college.. 
I haven't gotten much time with J which is why I would've liked a first date so I could gauge her better, I could see the chemistry there but I don't think it's the right time or place.

For context, we were together for four months and then he broke up with me over reasons I still find unfair. Really it just hurts he gave up on me so easily and was willing to let me go without even trying to fix things he felt were wrong between us. I wasn’t happy at the time either but I wish he had wanted to fix them instead of breaking up right then and there. We got back together and we were apart roughly a month so we kept our original anniversary date and now we have been together for eight. 

He has depression and anxiety. I have anxiety. It affects how we act, but my anxiety never makes me want distance from him or treat him poorly. He will be hot and cold with me though. Late October things were great. We only see each other once a week because he lives two hours away but we had a *really* great two visits in a row. He said I was beautiful and perfect and I thought for a minute maybe he did love me. Granted he told me shortly after we got back together initially that he didn’t quite understand love, but he wanted to be with me.

Then november came and he was cold again. He’s never been super affectionate but he use to say such sweet things to me and made me feel special. Lately he returns none of my flirting or jokingly responds to it. He will tweet random things seven minutes after I send him a message about missing him and talking about a memory of the two of us— in fact he often tweets about random things after he was with me, like the second i’m not in front of him i cease to exist to him.

last night it got to be too much. he’d shown me no affection in over a week. and had taken up posting about a certain celebrity and saying the celebrity was “the love of his life”, in the span of one day, eight times. the phrase “i am in love with you” in reference to celebrities multiple times, and after i tried to hint that made me uncomfortable, he did it even more. so I sent a very long message expressing a lot of things. mostly that i did not feel important to him, and that i know i am insecure and that might be tiring, but i just want to know how he feels about me. and i ended it by saying i didn’t know if he wanted to say the L word or not, but that i felt that and i don’t know if he feels that. but if he did, i’d say it. (i said i love you before we broke up, and he didn’t say it back then.)

he responded and said i was not too much, as i expressed i was afraid i was with all the flirting i do that he never returns. and then, “and you can say It i guess. i know you do.”

not exactly what i imagined he’d say. long story short I asked if he did love me because i didn’t want to just say it if he didn’t. he said he is just a kid in his head and does not think he knows what it is, and that he hasn’t even really figured out familial love yet. he apologized. i said i needed him to love me at some point, and i was afraid he just didn’t love ME. amongst a lot of other things. i said it was ok if he didn’t love me now so long as he wanted to, and would some day. and that i just want to feel like he LIKES me, because i feel like i like him so much more than he likes me, even. he’s my lock screen. i post about him, i write him poems. i express my feelings a lot. all he does is say he misses me he hardly at that. and he use to do things. be use to flirt. less than two fucking weeks ago even… i don’t know what to think. 

i asked him if he wanted to be with me still. if he thought about me all the time and looked forward to seeing me like he used to say he did (early october we could not see each other for 3 consecutive weeks. i was very upset the third week he couldn’t come. not with him, ofc. i asked if he was ok in reference to not seeing me that long— he said ‘i survived and will continue to do so’ which resulted in me saying it made me sad it didn’t seem to bother him. which is why i ask now if he looked forward to seeing me still- he use to say i was the highlight of his week). he said yes, reiterated those things i just mentioned, but did not respond to the part of the paragraph where i asked if he was in love with me. he said he was in love with me late september. since the day he saw me, and he didn’t foresee stopping. now i’m unsure again if that could possibly be true as he doesn’t love me. are they different?

he apologized for not being romantic, said he had never been in a relationship before and didn’t think he was suited for it. i don’t think he understands i would be fine with a lack of romance if he just seemed like he even liked me that much.

i don’t know what to think. i don’t know what i’m asking. general advice i guess. i love him so much. i wish he loved me. am i being unfair? i can’t make him love me and i am glad he was honest with me. just scared i’m not someone he will ever love. which hurts horribly.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7615769,public,self,My (22F) boyfriend (20M) told me he doesn’t love me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/z21jmx/my_22f_boyfriend_20m_told_me_he_doesnt_love_me/,all_ads,6,

When we have conversations, or discussions to me it feels as if what she says is fact..even when it is simply her opinion. She says ""That's just how I express myself. Am I not allowed to?"" When I have confronted her about it.

We have gotten into varies quarrels.

I have reduced my opinions to ""yea"" or I avoid specific topics, but today I learned that doesn't matter either.

I will give two examples. 

Example: Today. I was scrolling through my phone, and saw something about August Alsina saying he was gay. So, I said ""Hmm. August Alsina said he's gay"" [ She was into the whole thing with Jada and Will and their entanglement deal.] I expected her to laugh, but nope she said, ""He's not gay. He's queer""

 I said ""Well, these are his words ."" After that I tuned her out because she started to go on a tangent about how he's not gay. He is queer. It wasn't that deep to me..🤷🏾‍♀️

Example: I lost my voice a few weeks ago. The weather change sometimes aides in this. I usually take a spoon full of honey in the morning, and suck on peppermints. It helps me a lot. My friend told me I needed to drink tea. I told her no  three times. She still made me, and  brought it to me, and got upset that I wouldn't drink it. Later on while she was still visiting -- I decided I would check the mail I also just needed some fresh air .[ I live in an apt complex where the mailboxes are in the middle. The complex isn't big] . She made a statement about how walking outdoors was not smart while I didn't have a voice, and how If i'd just drank some tea I'd be a little better right now. This lead to an argument because I'm not a child. It ended in her saying ""So you just don't want me to express my care about your health either..next time I'll just keep it to myself since I'm not allowed to have an opinion."" I followed with you can care, and express yourself, but what I am doing is not harmful to you, or myself. You just sound like you want to argue as always. She responded back with ""I'm not arguing. It takes two people to argue.""

You'd think we are a couple, and hell no.

 The whole thing is childish to me, but outside of this she is a really sweet person, and has had my back on many occasions and vise versa 

What is it that I need to do to be better heard, or perhaps am I missing her entirely? I have no idea.

I (M 15) have a beautiful girlfriend  M(F 15) and I’m starting to have concerns about us. We’ve been going strong for 3 months at this point and everything has been great.

However, a month ago problems started arising with her friends. Some talked bad about me behind my back and some hated my guts. In a certain situation they started a HATE GROUP. I try my best to be the best boyfriend I can for M and have given her as much as I can and she had done the same. The problem arises on how she deals with her friends.

In the back talking situation she didn’t do anything for a bit and I had plead her just for her to talk to the friend. After it stopped but that was only the first concern.

With the hate group situation it was between the original friend that was talking behind my back and 2 others. I found out about it fast and covered my behind and toward M to confront them about it. She said it was a joke and such but then one of the people of the hate group picked a fight with me and started picking on me by using trauma. This was through text in a group chat between M and other band friends. The friends eventually apologized and we worked through it and are now in good terms.

You may be asking what’s wrong and to that I say M did nothing in both situations until last minute. And I literally had to plead with her to even try. With the hate group she didn’t even talked till after the fight because she “wanted both sides” (she already had both sides just didn’t wanna confront). 

I’m starting to not even feel like I’m her boyfriend sometimes, whenever I tell her something I don’t want her doing she tries her best to not fix it especially if it deals with her friends. She does everything to not just confront the friend and fix it. 

I’ve talked with her multiple times about this and so far not much has changed. However, the main reason I’m writing this post is because I’m uncomfortable with her ex. M is pansexual and dated another girl K before me. And they are still friends, close ones. M is very pen to affection and many of her friends (only girls) cuddle with her . But I find it uncomfortable that she does it with an ex and the ex ask for cuddles a lot even to the point to where they’d  cuddle while I’m in the SAME ROOM. Does this count as cheating?

I want to badly to confront M about this and I have ALLUDED to it before but not full confront. This stuff is starting to eat at me especially since I’m extremely loyal and I struggle to even hug other people without feeling guilty. This stuff makes me not trust her and makes me feel like I’m not actually her boyfriend and I’m just a side piece.

I’m at a loss, help.

I love him so dearly, leaving him over this has never been a thought. For the most part when I am with him I don’t care … he is still lovely to spend time with, intelligent as he has always been and so loving. 

I am sure that if he improved his self grooming habits he would  be attractive but how do I get him to do this ? He leaves the remainder of his hair long and frizzy, he lets his beard grow patchy.

Since 8th grade of high school. We are both 19 right now. He’s a cis male, and I’m a transgender male. Its been a 7 months and I just still feel stuck and can’t get past everything. He was with me through all my trauma, and we both are mentally ill. At the time of the break up I thought I just had depression, but since the break up and therapy, I have learned that I have bipolar disorder- not depression. I know on both ends we were not good to each other. He never tried for anything. He never did anything boyfriends should besides comfort. He never wanted to go out places, to come over and hang out, to go on dates, never wanted to bring me around his friends outside of school- nothing. The only thing I feel like he did right was be a shoulder for me to cry on when I was being traumatized and put in the foster system. He was there to make me feel like it wasn’t my fault when I was SAed. My own mother is narcissistic and manipulative, but when my ex told me his mom pointed out things that ive done that are narcissistic and manipulative, I was just heart broken. I never wanted to be like that. And the main thing he said that was manipulative was me putting an ultimatum down when he was failing high school, that if he didn’t graduate I would break up with him because I was graduating early and going to college, and I couldn’t hold myself back any longer. I feel selfish and just lost. Another main reason for him breaking up with me was that he just ‘fell out of love’ with me after the trip with all his friends. Which just is confusing because when he got back we had one of the most touching moments I thought in our relationship, and had s’x. And one more reason he broke up with me was cause I called him a p’ssy- tbh I don’t remember the context of why I called him that but I know I dod target him when I was mad and that wasnt ok. I know I was in the wrong for that- but does that really make someone no longer love you??

My father died in 2019 and left my mother enough to buy a house out of state and have a small sum of money (unsure of the amount, less than $100,000) She is unemployed and is financially dependent on her boyfriend, who is emotionally abusive. I am currently staying for a week with my sister and BIL for Thanksgiving. We have talked about the boyfriend and have a plan. 

I lost my wallet on the way and she gave me some cash, which I appreciated very much. Part of the issue is she’s not letting me use it, but it’s way beyond that. What prompted me to write this post was her buying all of us lunch today, which totaled over $150 even while I chose one of the least expensive entrees. Myself, my sister and my BIL all asked if we could pay for ourselves, which was vehemently denied. 

She has probably spent over $1,000 so far including our lodging, and we will be here for another week. I am concerned that she is drawing from her IRA. We never had money growing up, so I can understand her loose grasp on the concept of money, and I believe her encephalitis due to an autoimmune disorder may play a role as well. 

It has so far been impossible for us to assert our boundaries out of care for her future and I do feel bad about trying to supplant her agency. I just don’t know if it is just to think or respond to this in the way that I am.

I on the other hand very much value my personal space. I'm pretty introverted, I have a limited amount of energy for socialization. She is included in that category of socializing. She feels as though she shouldn't be included in that category because she is my girlfriend, but I don't really have control of that. 

I think the hardest part for me is that she gets upset and starts arguments when I try to prioritize my own hobbies and actually chose for myself how I want to spend my time instead of focusing on her and what she wants to do.

She’s a newer friend and we’ve known each other for a little over a month and have become fairly close. As long as we’ve known each other she’s been seeing someone who i actually think is a good dude and get along with as well. This girl is super cool and she’s called me “nice, cute, hot, funny, awesome, etc.” on multiple occasions, and I’ve also given compliments back and there’s definitely a bit of at least playful flirtation back and forth.

The other day we hung out just us when she was having a tough time emotionally (lots going on atm) and me being a good friend I tried to cheer her up.

I can’t help but think that she may have expected me to make a move on her (which I’m not against I just dont like to cross certain lines when someone is seeing someone I know) during this (touched my butt at one point, was playing with my hair, couple cheek kisses, emphasized she wanted to stay single) BUT she was a bit drunk and I was sober and i also didn’t want to take advantage of her in both an emotional state and obviously while inebriated.

Then she was a little weirder than normal to me after this for a day or so and now everything is normal again. I think why I question is the fact that we are both fairly flirtatious, and also especially with each other. But I’m still a bit confused as to what is going on.

I’ve (early 30sF) been with my partner (early 30sM) for roughly two years. We both deal with depression, but his has been worse lately. I suspect it’s the changing weather, impending holidays, and the fact that he had a truly shit/stressful time a couple weeks back.

When he gets stressed/depressed, he withdraws and we don’t live together so I basically just don’t really hear much from him for awhile. I have done my absolute best to not take this personally and self-soothe. It’s difficult because I’ve got to adjust to his absence and “just deal with it” as it were.

The last time he withdrew, it was when I was prepping for a major exam. 13 years of study was either going to result in ABD (all but dissertation) status, or the end of my academic career as I knew it. And I had to go through all of that without him, even the celebration when I found out I passed. I have never felt more stressed, scared, and alone in my life. I’m in a weird spot because I understand how depression works, but I would never have not been there for something that important, and I feel super angry about that.

But when he got That Which Shall Not Be Named, I still took him groceries and stayed available by phone to check on him. My other friends said I did the right thing, and that it’s always good to help someone who’s sick.

I don’t know if I’m just slowly being poisoned by toxic rhetoric, or if I’m acting like a doormat with no boundaries. I’m not interested in “leave his ass” rhetoric as of now, but I do think I’m too close to the situation and too hurt to see anything clearly.

(To protect privacy I falsified our age by +/- 2 years) 

My girlfriend has been suffering from depression for some time, it’s already being treated and is being treated with medication. 

Last weekend we talked about the topic of climate change and came to the topic of wanting to have children. My friend has expressed that she does not want to bring children into the world because of her depression / mental illness. 

Triggered by the previous topic (climate change), she expressed that she would like to take her medicine and a bottle of alcohol to put an end to this and that she would not live to be older than 30 anyway. 

To be honest I don't know how to deal with it. Our relationship is already struggling in some places and I have just started a new, very demanding job, which makes it difficult for me to show courage and perseverance. 

I feel like I can't support her as well, even though most of the time we're together she tries not to let her state of mind shine through. 

She always describes this time together as a break for her depression, in which she doesn't want to give it any space. But it rumbles inside me to know and of course to notice that she is not doing well. 

Unfortunately, talking about her depression or her inner life is impossible. She closes herself off completely, even if that is her right.
