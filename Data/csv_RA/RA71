My gf and I have been dating 10-11 months now, and we're about to both be moving to the same city. We're looking at apartments together, and separately because we're not sure if it's best to move in when we get there--thing is, it's not exactly a cheap city, nor are we thinking about being separate because of only preference.

Recently we've been working through some communication issues (lots of progress) and we're shaping up to be pretty decent at it, I think. However, something has come up to complicate it:

One of her friends is thinking of moving OUT from with her boyfriend, and wants my gf to be her roommate. Problem is, it strikes me as a real barrier to progressing our relationship--ive always had issues with relationships needing to revolve around other factors.

My gf is a people pleasure, to the point where if we're choosing dinner it's like pulling teeth to get her to have input sometimes on what she wants, and making sure I don't run her over verbally just due to her willingness to accommodate. The friend doesn't seem to have the same willingness to do so, and I'm afraid if they move in it's going to make a lot of things within our relationship harder.

I'm concerned that this friend will basically pick where they live, and cause long-term home life stress due to my gf's people pleasing nature (we've discussed this and she agrees it's a concern). In essence, I'm opposed to this because while if she moved in alone, we could reevaluate if we want to live together in a few months, adding another person to the picture makes it a lot more dependent on the type of lease they sign, and ofc greatly affects where I choose to live as well. I don't particularly want to have to choose something that is really close, because if I wait for them to pick a place then there's a good chance that I end up with something kinda bad, or at least something that's either 
a) a compromise of my own needs 
b) a time crunch for finding a place to live
c) a place far from my girlfriend that effectively means I see her on weekends

The seeing her on weekends thing is what I really want to avoid and not deal with--a huge portion of the reason I want to live with her is the tendency for her to withdraw when stressed, so if her home life is stressful or work is, it means that I'll see her even less, whereas if we were living together I could both see, and support her by default.

So I stopped texting him one night thinking the next day if he were really interested he’d text me. He did end up texting me the next day asking me if everything was okay, and I just told him that everything was fine and we continued to talk.

Then the next day he went a few hours without responding, which was very unusual for him &amp; he was active on socials during that time. So I decided to not text him back that day, I had a gut feeling he didn’t want to talk which is fine I just found it odd because he was just asking about hanging out. I figured the next day would go back to normal so I texted him &amp; then he ghosted me. That same day I posted a picture &amp; he liked it which made me even more confused…why put in all that effort just for it to end like that?! I would have rather him just have not talked to me after I stopped texting him. So I’m curious if after he saw me on the dating site if he figured I wasn’t interested? Because that’s not the case.

We joked around about our first time meeting when greeted her with a hug, but she had dodged it away as we were just meeting for the first time. I, at the time, thought she was just (of a few factors being) shy, of a friendship culture where that is not normal as a greeting between opposite genders, and/or due to COVID having made any physical interaction, even handshakes an unwelcome custom. I've been a few friendship circles where hugging between genders is very normal, and where it is not. Even so, there are countries where kissing on the cheek is normal between genders. Aside of the matter though.

So we were having this talk, and I said I was OK with hugs with the opposite gender, as long as it was a side hug, saying a side hug would usually be ""socially acceptable"". I asked her back, she said hugs were absolutely off-limits, and made her uncomfortable. I wanted to respect this boundary, understanding that what I find ok, is not ok with her, and thus, I said that I wouldn't hug those of the opposite gender, even if it was a side hug. She would ask me why I would think it was socially acceptable, and I would answer honestly why I thought it was so. I don't remember the word for word of what I said, but along the lines of ""because it is friendly and not as intimate as a normal hug."" Answered a few more questions, and she feels I was ""justifying myself"" and ""alluding to"" convince her to change her mind on it. I was trying my best to be as fair of a communicator whenever we argue so, I paraphrased what we were arguing about, summarizing my view of what was occurring(to help understand where the conversation was leading towards), that is: ""you and I we have different viewpoints, beliefs and values. It is evident from this that we have found a point that we differ on. I have heard that you are uncomfortable with me hugging the opposite gender, and I will no longer do that I am sorry."" (yes i really talk like that) My question here is not whether who is right or wrong, any thoughts on it are welcome too though, my question is how can our communication be improved??

As the argument carried on, she would ask me scenario questions e.g ""so if a guy side hugged me you would be okay with that?"" I said ""I would be uncomfortable with it, only as long as its a friendly side hug, I would be okay with that.""

With me answering this way to her question and other questions, she felt I was continually ""justifying myself"", which is a common reply I get to a lot of arguments we have. ""Why don't you just agree with me, say OK, and that can be it, why do you have to keep justifying yourself and keep arguing?"" ""is this something you really want to argue over?"" These statements, and rhetorics are valid, but sometimes, I feel it gets to a point where I feel like I am not allowed to communicate, and any attempt to do so is labelled as ""justifying myself"". I feel trapped sometimes in my words. I want to answer honestly, but when I do she says I ""don't have to say it like that"", ""I don't like it when you use 'honesty' as an excuse""(not entirely sure why she says that and what she means, but what I can gather is, I think she feels that when I reply ""i am being honest"" it is to do away with any moral shame for my answers? I can see how that might be true however... and I could very much be the poor communicator here). I try to be as careful with my words as I can be, because in the past I was told I used to be fairly blunt, and learned more about how I say something means more than what I say at times. I'm kind of ranting at this point, but honestly, I just would like some advice on how I/we can communicate better with each other.

Disclaimer , might be a long post

Hello, Hope everyone is ok.

I'm in my early thirties and I'm bi male. This is my first relationship with a guy and overall my first proper adult relationship. So I'm facing a lot of new things and I can't infer those things in a logical and proper fashion (as I'm emotionally biased). So here it goes.

I'm discreet. So when i met this person (online) we took things slowly. I dictated the pace and he seemed very understanding, It's been 6 months now and as you imagine I've developed feelings.

A couple of weeks ago we had our first significant argument as I was about to go for a holiday trip and he wouldn't find time for me. So as expected I made a fuss about it (and guess what? he found time. More time than expected). Obviously that made me happy and that talk was a turning point. Things became real. I specifically pointed out that I'm not looking for a friendship and asked him point blank if he sees me as a friend. His reply was positive so everything worked out. Went on my trip he was all cute , came back from my trip and again all cute. 

I'm trying to understand him but also myself. When we are together  on a any given day he seems very intimate (a lot of hugs and kisses but not much sex - which worries me a bit sometimes - ). Also there are days when we are not together where he is very attentive and seems to care (online texts).  When things don't go as expected (and it is very normal for it to happen) I become messed up. Like if he is emotional unavailable on a given day my brain understands that but its quickly override by emotional insecurities and whatnot. I try to keep calm but I can't seem to help it and go overdrive and compare what i have with others in a similar relationship. 

Then I have the need to talk to him about it. And i do but I know at some point it will become tiring and most likely he will let me go.

Not sure if my expectations are in line of what a normal adult relationship should be after 6 months of knowing each other or if my **insecurities** are getting the best of me. But I have friends that are in a relationship approximately the same duration as me and its like this :

1. Seeing each other on a daily basis even for a short period of time while we may take days to see each other. And yes both our schedules are quite full but so is that of my friends. And they always find at least an hour to see each other.
2. Work or tiredness are not a factor in telling the other person ""not today"". I'm not saying its a bad thing but for some reason I would expect at least my presence to be wanted.
3. Having sex (more often)

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I feel like we are not on the same page? Why do i feel like I'm the one who is emotionally invested and I constantly need reassurances while he seems to be ok with not having reassurances from me?  Why do I have the urge to see him on a daily basis while he seems not so keen?  We were together last week 3 days and we communicate daily but still why do I feel that it should have been more ? Is this normal ? Has anyone been through this ? How do you deal with this (if its worth dealing)?Why do I feel that I constantly need him to tell me cute and romantic things , hug me , kiss me in order feel better?

Don't get me wrong. When we are together we will cuddle and kiss , watch a movie do all those cute things. But I'm not sure if he genuinely has romantic feelings for me or I'm just a convenience for him for whatever happens whenever. 

 I know that he also makes me wanna go public which is a big thing for me.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7546487,public,self,How not to screw my relationship...Any advice?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yv1tuq/how_not_to_screw_my_relationshipany_advice/,all_ads,6,,

I have one classmate who makes me so confused on what we are. I don't know if he sees me as a friend, something more. I don't know.

One standard thing he does is liking all my instagram uploads, no reactions but just a like. We don't communicate outside college.

When we go to lectures, project time, ect he choses to sit next to me. sometimes with a chair between us, but almost always next to me. except this morning. He first sat down across me, changed chairs a few times to end up next to me (with a empty chair between us). When someone else asked if he could sit next to me so we could do our task, he made this weird joke ""OP, are you sure you want X sit next to you?"", I was confused as hell and responded ""Do you want to sit next to me?"" as a joke and then it went silence. When he said it, it almost looked as if he was jealous. 

After almost an hour of silence I ask him if he wants to get something for me from the store he goes to during lunchbreak. He agreed, didn't had to pay back. When we left after work, he kind of waited for me, then not, then he waited again. We had some chatter and he left. 

He also does everything I ask without hesitation and never asks something back for me to do. Like, he will bring me to the train station, get me food, help me with my work but never asks my help or something to do. I recently stopped asking him for help because I started to feel extremely bad.

I am very interested in athletics and try to exercise everyday, either at the gym, a jog, or a short at home workout. I have tried to encourage her to join me but little progress has been made. I know that she is aware of her weight, but I can't figure out a good way to push her in a healthier direction. I've tried to cook healthier meals for the both of us or reducing our portion sizes, but she will always end up eating a snack or another meal.

So I have known this girl for several years at university and for the past month we have been sleeping with each other. She started to act really cold and pulled back whilst giving me mixed messages (one day she would say she had feelings for me and the next she would say she just wanted to be friends). 

We finally had a phone call and I laid it out on the line saying I do like her and want to see where it goes. She responded by saying she doesn’t think we’re compatible for a relationship. I said that’s completely fair and that what’s the point of having a relationship with someone if you have to convince them otherwise. She asked that it would be good to see me at friend group events and that we can go back to normal. I responded by saying I don’t think that’s a good idea and I’m not comfortable and she got mad and abruptly hung up.

So my question is why does she want to be my friend? Any insight on these FWB’s would help.

Been friends with this girl for some time and I started liking him.

I kind of acted on those feelings and would touch her a lot when we were together (like a hand on the leg, hand up her shirt kind of thing) and she would tell me its inappropriate b/c we're friends, I kind of just wouldn't listen and I do feel bad about this. I also told her things like she's special to me, I love her, etc. It also came up casually in conversations that she wouldn't ever want to date me for circumstantial reasons. I would also say things like ""I don't want to be with you either"" but still continued doing the things I mentioned above (I don't know why I said this b/c I really did like her).

Anyways, over time, she kind of started warming up to me and reciprocating my feelings and actions and I kind of saw her reasons for not wanting to date and I started agreeing with her.

We got to a point where we agreed to this ""tentative"" relationship but we both agreed that we would go back to being friends--we just wanted something short-term because we felt like LTR wouldn't work with our current circumstances and we agreed on this. WE both agreed that we don't want LTR.

After this point, I kept talking to her about how I wanted more for our future, I'd talk about like marriage and kids and being with each other long term. I even told her i was in love with her at one point and cried b/c I was upset that I wouldn't get to be with her long term possibly. I really didnt like the idea of her being with someone else either and told her that. During this time i had reservations about being in a LTR with her (nothing having to with her, just circumstances) but I still talked about our future A LOT, like everyday lol I actually thought of names for our kids and talked to her about that. She eventually started being receptive to these things and would be like hmm yeah that might be nice, yeah that would be good, yeah we could have a nice life together. etc. 

Anyways one day she comes up to me and pitches this idea that we should be together, that she thought about all the stuff I said i wanted these past few months and she's on board, she thinks it would be worth giving a chance. I told her we had an agreement for something temporary and said no. she was really hurt and upset and she said he felt led on by me because quote: ""even after we agreed on the future prospects of our relationship, which was nothing, you continuously expressed your desire for a long term future with me and constantly fed me those ideas/feelings/expectations, when before, I never had that in my mind."" I told her I simply changed my mind because of the original concerns about circumstance that she herself had and she said quote ""if you changed your mind, why did you keep talking about our potential future together until literally yesterday when I asked you for a long-term relationship?"" truth is, i have no idea why.

Usually I would have said no but I already knew her best friend and roommate and she seemed fun to hangout with so I decided to give the friendship a try. 

At first we spent time at my place with my group of friends but recently she has been inviting me to watch her play hockey or go watch a movie then we would hangout together for the rest of the day. 

A couple of days ago she invited me to her place to watch her favorite hockey team play and I ended up having the most fun I have had in a very long time. I really enjoy talking to her and we have alot of things in common and I think we get along really well. 

She has also told me that she is planning to break up with the guy she is seeing because she doesn't think they are compatible. And since I knew she was seeing him I have not made a move or asked her if she is interested in dating but I plan on doing so after she breaks up with him this week. 

The issue is that despite how enthusiastic she is about hanging out with me and how she says she always has a great time, I am expecting to get rejected and friendzoned because it has happened to me many times in the past. And if that happens again I would like to be prepared. 

At the moment I am seeing her while holding no expectations of anything and I would like some advice on how to not develop feelings for her and be able to stay her friend if I get rejected, because i think i enjoy her company so much and find her attractive to the point where i might end up developing feelings for her which i do not want if she turns out to not feel the same way towards me.

My partner,  my love of my life. 
I didn't want to but I did. I couldn't do it anymore,  they'd love me and still do , I loves them too. I want to be with them yet I don't want to.
Well I am gonna be total honest here. 
I hurt them many times with many things like not watching movie of their recommendation,  telling them that I love my parents and my relatives the most and I'll always put them first in my priority list , not giving her enough time when I was busy with my studies and with my niece who only visits me once in a year and lastly by telling them after 11 months of our relationship that I was falling out of love
These are the thing I hurt them the most.
Oh no wait there are other things too
I didn't accepted her fully when she came out as transwoman because I was a straight and wanted to have a boyfriend not a girlfriend ( but I accepted it later anyway and was having wonderful time with her), and I also hurt her by asking for her selfie because she has gender dysphoria.

That's it , these are the things I did to her and hurt her alot. 


What she did to me was, she would sometimes make me feel worthless and useless garbage,  for an instance when I told her that I wanna be a teacher she said it was  so wonderfully I would be making futures of the children then the next day when we were talking about something she said that who do teachers do? They don't earn good money doesn't live a good life, worthless people. 

She would always say that coding the only thing that's is best and she is so proud of herself that she taught herself how to code. Then sometimes she would say that no other jobs need more skills and patience than coding, according to her coding is the only job exist that is worthful and other jobs are worthless. 
She thinks that she needs to be perfect to show the entire world that how perfect a person can be. 
She would say best about whatever she does and always make fun of those who is not like her.

She and I used to play duolingo together then I started earning more xps so she got so frustrated and told me that she'd leave the app because she can't not beat me with xps and even said that she will unfollow me there to have some peace.  She said she would love to see me getting everything in my love but she could not stand me getting better than her.

She wouldn't tell me the name of her friends,  not even her ex's name( but would tell me what nasty things they would do and how much she would love her), she wouldn't tell me her residential zipcode, building name , college name. 

She  would tell me that I control her and don't give her freedom to speak just because I stopped her twice on while she was speaking ill of people. 
Judging is good but it has its limit. 

When I told her that I want to buy my parents a house with my own money she said that's impossible because how on earth I am gonna earn that much money. 

She would tell me that in this world only she is the one who loves me and other people are al selfish ( I kind of believe that everyone is selfish,  so am i)
She would tell me that I need her.

When I told her after 5 months of our relationship that I was a bisexual she said why am I a bisexual. ( I came out first then after 8 months later she came out and I kind of did the same what she did to me , unknowingly) 

She would tell me that she would cut her hand if I left her , I would got scared  I was so stupid that I believed her.

She would make fun of me of studying much and while studying not using phone at all.

She would tell me that she could stop studying to spend the entire day with me ( she said this because I had been busy with my busy at that time)

She even told me that she would find a new best friend who would give her enough time.

She would say rude things and used to say these are the facts.


I took humanities and she knew that but she would still say that only those who tool science after 10th would become successful.


That day when I told her sweetly that that certain things is not morally correct,  she started blaming me of calling her immoral person.

When last month I asked her the name of her university she said,  ""why do you wanna know?"" 
And she didn't tell me and went to sleep after few minutes later.

All these she would do to me and then would give me guilt trip and she would made me feel like I am a toxic person. 
She would tell me that I am in the charge of the relationship because am the one who confessed to her and then brokeup with her.






So , now I don't know how to stop loving her and love for my self for a bit.

His family stays close to my house so he’d drive to meet me. He took me out on a date, when I got into his car his hand went on my thigh but then we held hands and shi. Throughout the whole date we held hands and then we went to my place. We made out and then almost hit third base but since it was my first time we were very slow. We both are a bit too kinky when it comes to this stuff altho I was very awkward since it’s my first time going this far. After that we just cuddled, watch some shows and fell asleep till he had to leave. He was respectful of my boundaries. However I had this feeling what if he’s here only to fuck around. I know our pace was very fast but I kinda trusted the guy. He was only around for a week so he came over three times. The second date went relatively well and again same cycle as the first but this time we hit third base I asked him where did he think this was going and he said I’m still getting to know u but I like u. we always did pda.

However the third one seemed different. We ate out again, this time he was sleeping over. I wasn’t so sure but I said ok. His pace this time seemed faster than the last time cause the moment we got to making out it didn’t take him more than 3-5 mins to get me naked and start fingering me. Which was ok cause hormones happen. But he wanted me to be on top of him rubbing my bare self on his dick without a condom and it took a bit of excuses about my anxiety for him to say ok we’ll not cause he it looked like he was gonna try anal without a condom on me but seeing how stressed I was he stopped. I’m very cautious when it comes to sexual stuff cause I know u can get pregnant with pre cum. We then sat and watched some kdramas and he ordered food again cause he was hungry and we ate mcd. We just cuddled to sleep late but it didn’t feel right the whole time In the morning he was kinda romantic and but then after he was fully awake he just called the Uber and left. When he asked why I looked sad when he left I said idk when I’ll see u next and I think he said “that’s the fun of it” ?!?!

He hasn’t been texting me on his own but will send streaks on snap. Half the time since last week I’ve been initiating convos on snap and iMessage tho I shouldnt be the one doing it. I personally now wish I never had him over.

We met in HS and got along really well. Ira was the only person I ever felt like I could totally be myself with. To me, Ira had the kindest and most beautiful soul I have ever met and I believe she still does. We’ve both confessed to having feelings for each other at different times but the timing was never right i.e Ira always had a boyfriend. However, there was one time when we were both single and I felt as if Ira kept dropping clues that I should ask her out. It could’ve just been me tho. At this point in my life I was scared that I would just end up hurting her and hurting the friendship that we’ve already established so I started to distance myself a bit. It got to the point where I tried to get Ira to get along with a childhood friend of hers (19F?) who Ira had a rough falling out with which included Ira’s BF after they broke up. Ira resented me for doing this and got rightfully mad bc I was being insensitive. Ira eventually forgave me after awhile. Ira  then started dating a friend of mine that I introduced to her months prior and although I was upset and felt betrayed by both I knew it was my own fault and showed happiness for them. 

Fast forward to after HS I gotta leave for the summer (something I can’t get out of) 
I ask Ira to hangout before I leave and we start getting closer again through text over the summertime. When I got back we hung out but things feel off and very different. I tried to address this with her but she dismisses it and I didn’t want to pry. I admit to Ira that when we hung out one time before I left for the summer I had the urge to kiss her but she was still with my friend. Ira just responded with, “yeah that would’ve been wrong.”  After about a month or so later of texting and calling I tried to plan a video chat with Ira and she agreed but never answered the call, said she was busy, and stopped replying to my texts.

It’s been almost two years now and we’re strangers again. I’ve tried to rekindle with her several times but she never answers. However, every now and then I’d see her at the local gym with her new bf? (Different guy) 

Before Ira I would open the door for the people who chooses to walk out of my life. However, I still have love for her and I always will. Ira is the one person I never wanted to lose. I now realize that I’ve always had feelings for her but always suppressed it for fear of the unknown.
What do I do? Any advice?

To sum up, MIL did something we told her not to do.
We got angry. She was angry because we called her out about it.
She sent me a passive aggressive non-apology text nine days after the fact and I responded with a text laying out all of my issues I’ve had with her behavior for over ten years. Four days later, she still hasn’t responded to me. I guess I’m getting the silent treatment, and I’m not mad about it.

I sent this text to my husband, my husband’s aunt and his sister (my SIL) in a group text so they could be in the loop. They received the text at the same time as my MIL. I knew my MIL would work them and try to manipulate them against us by twisting my words, so I wanted to get ahead of it.
I recently posted the text exchange in two of my posts, they’re too long to repost here so please look at my profile and catch up. I was polite and respectful in my text.

My SIL responded that we were horrible people and to never speak to her mom like that again. We were very confused by this, especially since she works with her mother and she knows what a bully her mom is. She knows how everyone must tiptoe around MIL to manage her feelings, because god forbid she gets upset about anything or she meltsdown. I didn’t say anything my SIL doesn’t already know. She was so mean to us.

Two days later, she apologized just to my husband, not to me.

And after that, she tells me that will decide if we continue or not after we meet in this vacations. And if we continue, maybe she wants a open relationship.

What the title says. We’ve been very good friends for almost 3 years now after we met in college. 

When we first got to know each other, we would text all day long until 3 am. We were a perfect match, and i was crushing so hard until he told me he is in a relationship. We stayed friends, I got over my feelings and pushed it all away, but it was always there.

Fast forward to this day, he has another girlfriend, which shattered me at first.

The thing is, he acts like someone who’s not in a relationship. He talks about his sexual fantasies he has towards me, he said he would love to live with me (which I took as a joke at first but when he said it repeatedly it didn’t seem like a joke anymore), every time we get into a fight when he don’t speak for days, he comes back even though he says he won’t. The way he acts and stuff he says indicates that he has feelings for me as well.

We are both extremely toxic for each other, but we always forgive each other everything. We both know we have unhealthy obsession and codependency because we are both friendless and lonely. When we fight and don’t speak I get very depressed and moody and I feel like I’m going crazy and want to quit school as to not see him there every day. 

I would like to note that we’ve never kissed or did something more. We sometimes lay in bed and talk. Or he touches my thigh. Which I know is more than enough considering he has a girlfriend. He said he would never cheat and I believe that.


The most recent thing that happened is that he befriended one of our classmates. I flipped the fuck out and asked him what they talk about, why he feels the need to have another girl friend when he has me. He said I’m a clown (which is true) but I just can’t stand the thought of him giving some other girl his attention and maybe going as far as building the same kind of relationship as we have. I don’t want him to tell her what he tells me and it’s driving me fucking nuts.

We have 1 and a half years to go until I finish my degree completely. I need to get out of this friendship but at the same time I can’t imagine seeing him at school every day and not talk to him.

On top of that, me having feelings for him and him feeding those feelings with what he says keeps me hopeful, and it prevents me from starting with someone new. I’ve had 3 failed relationships in the last half a year because I compare everyone to him, and I also can’t feel the same way for others as I do for him. I am literally unable to connect with other men on the same level as we did at first. 

I feel like I’m going insane.

So fast forward yesterday i text her saying i enjoyed last night and that we should do it again. She lets me know that while she enjoyed it, she has no interest dating right now seriously or romantically as she's not in the right headspace. I ask her to clarify and she gets upset and says she only went because i wouldn't stop asking her and she doesn't know how i think she likes me as she was ""just being nice"". idk about everyone else but i don't make out with people to just be nice and on top of that go on a date.

I told my friends and they're baffled , so im looking for some advice on here which will be much appreciated.

Immediately there were sparks. Immediately I could be myself with him. Immediately he showed me he valued my opinion. There’s obviously strong infatuation going on here, aided greatly by being so sexually attracted to him. Throughout the date and on the way he’d ask questions and seemed like a super introspective guy himself. On the date, he made a big gesture by getting the staff to come out with sparklers and two shots. That was really nice. A birthday song came on and I was like “omg whose birthday is it?” He was like “it’s yours”. He told me throughout the date about how he likes me. Not annoyingly, just subtlety mentioning good things about my personality and how hard it is to find. And before anyone says that was love bombing, I don’t think a nice gesture and some compliments should fit that description. But yeah, I don’t think I’ve had this chemistry with anyone, not even in the beginning stages, and that also includes my ex who I was with for five years. I feel like my heart is bursting. We did have sex on the first date, and he didn’t text me at all the next day which was super discouraging. I’m not gunna lie, I cried. I thought he ghosted me, so I blocked him and unfollowed him on Instagram. Not five minutes later, he sent a message asking why I did that. I’m assuming this was around the time he got out of a rave because it was 1am. I said the fact that he couldn’t take 10 seconds out of his day to send a text shows I wasn’t even a fleeting thought for him, esp considering how he described feeling for me the day before. I also called him a jackass lol (I know, I’m ridiculous). He said sorry and that wasn’t his intention, that he meant to text me the next day and he didn’t want to text me if we weren’t going to hang out that day. Whatever, I keep him blocked. Then today I realized I was really hostile and the way I snapped was uncalled for. So I apologized for my behavior and we “rekindled” things if that’s what you wanna call it. I can’t stop thinking about him even if I try. What is happening…
My friend told me it’s because he’s doing the bare minimum that, for example, my ex never did like listening and being attentive/considerate and that’s why this infatuation is so damn strong. I was deprived of basic decency for a long time, which makes sense. But damn, I never knew I could be so affected. I literally cried over this man which makes me question my own mental state lol. I was in a period of isolation for a while and only relied on my ex and had no friends whatsoever so that, again, just supports my friend’s theory about why I’m so infatuated.

He lives across the country but we keep in constant contact. It started with us texting each other non-stop for literally three days straight (even if we were busy) and I realized that I had major feelings for him, so I shoot my shot and ask him if he wants to be my boyfriend. I clarified that it meant I wanted to date him, talk to him more, and eventually visit each other and that would be claiming him as my boyfriend (for lack of better words). He sent a voice message saying he's been waiting for years and how he'd love to date.

Fast forward to last week and we're texting, as usual, and I joke about having a baby boy by him. It was one of those jokes where I totally meant it but I wanted to see what he would say before I actually asked if he wanted to have any more kids (he has a daughter). He flat out said, ""I'm good with my one, I don't wanna bring any more kids into the fucked up world."" Which, I get the reasoning 100%, I just really want a child. And I'm not saying I want a child this instant but yeah, eventually I want to birth a kid. I told him exactly how I felt and my reasons for wanting a child and he said he understands what I mean and why I want one but that doesn't change his mind. I didn't realize until that moment that not wanting kids/not wanting anymore kids was a deal breaker. I was seriously considering breaking up with him right then out of impulse. But instead I asked him what he saw for our relationship in the long run. What his intentions were. I told him what mines were and what I expected again but more than before because I actually saw/see a future with him. His words were, ""I have no intentions, I'm just going with the flow."" I can't explain how disappointed I was. He elaborated that since he's been shot (he got shot in the torso a few months ago and almost died because the police took so long to get to where he was) his entire mindset has changed and that what I'm getting is all he can give me right now. Which is understandable, he almost died. I can totally understand how that would change someone. And I'm not going to force him to do anything he doesn't want to do or can't do. It just sucks for me and the goals I had.

I may be overreacting but I do love this man and I thought I saw a future with him and his daughter. But I currently don't know how he feels about me and that's frustrating. I don't want to give up on this relationship, it's actually the best one I've ever been in, but I can't help but think I'm adding more stress to an already stressful situation because my mindset stayed the same and his changed. I'm not mad at him or anything but he doesn't even see me as his girlfriend anymore, but he still treats me the same. I'm just very confused and I don't know whether or not to call it quits. We both have a lot on our plates right now and I wanted to get through it together but maybe it's better if we do it separately. I don't know. Advice is appreciated!

I had been dating Taylor for 3 years before we broke up; we stayed on good terms, speaking occasionally, because we were best friends above everything else. For clarification, Taylor and I only talked about our work and day-to-day life; Taylor had started to see other people as well as going on dates, and so did I. Shortly after the breakup, I started dating Charlie; we have since then moved in together and have been in a relationship for a few months now.

Everything seemed fine with Charlie until they started making snarky remarks because I kept in touch with Taylor. This didn’t seem to be a problem in the beginning of our relationship though because Charlie was well aware that I talked to Taylor. However, as time went by, Charlie started to make more and more snarky remarks. So much that in fact Charlie talked about Taylor more than I actually talked to Taylor.

These constant remarks started to make me think of Taylor more, and in a more romantic way, which I hadn’t thought about after we broke up, and this left me wondering that I still have feelings for Taylor. To make things worse, the other day, Taylor told me that their dating life wasn’t going well because every time Taylor went on a date, Taylor would think of me instead of the person they were with.

I have been trying to shut off my thoughts of Taylor and focus on my current relationship, and just when I think I got it all done, Charlie goes and makes another snarky remark about Taylor. I understand that Charlie might be scared to lose me to Taylor, but I don’t think this justifies Charlie’s behaviour. I even stopped talking to Taylor, to try and make things with Charlie better, but it didn’t help at all.

Recently, after Charlie made one of his snarky remarks, we got into an argument, and I ended up telling Charlie that if they didn’t mention Taylor so often, I certainly wouldn’t think about Taylor so much. This seemed to surprise Charlie while at the same time confirm whatever scenarios were in their head. Things have gotten progressively worse, to the point that Charlie no longer trusts me.

Taylor knows I'm seeing someone, but they don’t know how serious the relationship is or that I'm living with my partner. Taylor has gotten in touch again and they said they would like to make amends and try to rebuild our relationship again. I reminded Taylor that I was currently seeing someone and that I didn’t know what to answer to their request to get back together, to which Taylor answered that they’re willing to wait some time until I'm ready to try again.

I'm still living with Charlie, and if I'm being honest, sometimes I just want to leave while other times I want to stay.

I felt like I was single for months. By this I mean no affection, he would leave to hang out and come back at night when Im about to go to sleep. The two times I've went to text other people, it has been due to him going pretty much MIA with HIS MOM or UNCLE. He continuously hangs out with his mom ,more than me and its so odd and frustrating.

Of course I did text other people despite his blatant neglect at the time. **I know cheating is never okay but does anyone at least understand?** I NEVER had sex with anyone else, the two times were solely texting due to pure loneliness.

In this attempt I’ll include a video I made which explains exactly what the issue is. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAOBTZGOuM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAOBTZGOuM)

Over the last 5 years, my husband’s health has deteriorated to the point that he’s now being kept alive by a machine. I have increasingly become his full time caretaker as well as the sole breadwinner. Together, we have gone through thick and thin, and we’re each others’ rock. Unfortunately, due to his poor health and terrible pain, he is no longer able to satisfy me sexually.

We’ve had sex only once in the last 2 years, and even then, it wasn’t at all like it used to be between us. Instead it felt uncomfortable and awkward, since I had to be extremely careful not to injure him. We’ve talked about it before, and he feels very ashamed that he’s usually not in the state to have sex. I always reassure him that it’s okay and that I’m not bothered. However, secretly, I was very upset, and at times, even resentful towards him about this. Even though he didn’t know this, I still hated myself for being selfish.

However, over time I have come to understand and accept this reality. I no longer feel rejected by him, but understand that he is just unable to perform due to the pain he is in. Still, whenever I watch porn, I feel guilty, as if I’m betraying him somehow. The issue is in my own head though, as he’s totally okay with me watching porn.

Sit down, talk with her, get her point of view, maybe get her evaluated, and go back to how we were. Well that's not happening. Found out some devastating news from our 14y/o, and I'm debating on whether I should keep fight for this
marriage.

She cheated on me. My wife, my partner in crime, my best friend, the fucking mother to my kids. And now I’m even unsure if they’re my kids. I haven't told my wife that I know about her affair. And frankly I don't want too, I've been with her for so long that I don't know if I can live without her. I don't know how long she and this guy have been meeting up. I hope it's only been a couple of time, because that'll be easier to get over. 

I'm trying to keep my self together for my 14y/o, but it's hard. Whenever I get a chance by myself I have a breakdown. I don't get what I did to cause her to do this. I thought I was a good husband, a good father, and a good friend. Turns out I may have been shit.

I found out about the affair a couple days ago from my 14y/o. I’ve reassured her nothings wrong, and I’ll have me and her mother explain it. I'm thinking about just telling her that me and her mom have an open relationship to keep this under wraps, to just make it not look she cheated on me. I've just been going through the motions. My wife she's still at her parents. She's still barely talking to me. Now I know why. Maybe if I tell her I know about her affair she'll end it and come back home? We have a good life together, we're good together. I feel like I'm rambling. If this was my brother and I found out his wife cheated on him and he was talking like how I am now I'd grab him by the collar and set him straight. 

Ive watch films of this stuff, heard about it, and even watched shows where the couple talks about how they get past infidelities. I would think, “they’re so stupid, just get divorced. I’d never forgive my wife if she cheated on me.” But now I’m in the same shoes and I sound just like them. From what I seen so far it was just emotional and nudes, but my daughter had taken plenty of pictures and Ive only seen about 4 so far. There’s at least 30. I feel that if I go through the rest of these photos it’ll confirm that she may have been having this affair for a long time. My daughters might not even be my kids. 

If I go public with this it won’t just turn my world upside down it’ll effect my daughters too. I don’t want to hurt them like that. I only eat when my daughters around me to keep up the facade that everything’s fine. But when she’s away I’m throwing up and shaking. This isn’t just some high school relationship. This the woman I’ve built a life with. I know what I should do, but I don’t want too. 

Over the last few days I’ve realized how much my life circles around my wife and kids. If I dig any further into this I just might break. If you’ve been married, are married, in a long term relationship with kids and a home how do you get past this? Do I just quietly confront her and do marriage counseling?

Like the title says I am not sure if I want to ask this boy out.
Just to inform you: I have met this boy 3 years ago and from the day we started talking I got interested in him.

At first I was sure that it will only stay an interest, but now instead of moving on my feeling seem to get deeper for him. Every little think he does just makes me feel better, even if it's not for me.

Even though he is a good friend of mine, I don't know if I should risk our friendship over my feelings. I am afraid that I am being too egoistic.

But for me the main problem is that he always hangs around with me and my sister, but every time we hang out, one of his friends tag along. I sometimes get annoyed, because I here the feeling that I don't get to spend enough time with him.

He also seems to like my sister more than me, since my sister is way more extrovert than me.

The only think that keeps confusing me, making it difficult for me to figure out my feeling is that he really opens up towards me and my sister and often he talks about his own feelings towards other people.

I'm also unsure if I should tell him, because whenever we go out and we see girls his type,he hits on them and then turns to me telling me he is looking for THE one.

I personally think that it is all really confusing, since I  have the feeling that he keeps sending mixed signals, or am I getting the wrong signals and putting my hopes up?  Should I tell him?

Please tell me your opinion on this, because I've been debating on whether I should post it here and ask others opinions.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years. We have an amazing relationship, are best friends, and want to get married some day. However, my boyfriend never initiates sex and it upsets me. 

Whenever I have spoken with him about this, he says that initiating sex is something he has “just never done”. I find it a bit hard to believe that he has never initiated sex with any of his past girlfriends or with the women he’s slept with before. I thought perhaps he didn’t want to initiate out of fear of being rejected, but he states that isn’t the case and I’ve reassured him I’d never turn him down. 

Whenever I initiate he is enthusiastic and he’s an amazing lover. We sexually satisfy each other. But it’s the lack of initiating/romancing on his part that leaves me feeling upset. There have been times where I’ve been fully naked sitting on his lap and he still won’t imitate anything until I do. No touching, playing with me, no kissing, etc. I always have to make the first move. 

I can’t help but view this as lazy on my boyfriends part. I don’t ask for much in our relationship and I come from a place of understanding whenever I discuss this with him. I build him up, constantly tell him how good in bed he is, etc. I’ve even reasoned with him and asked if he could initiate even just SOME of the time, it would be really meaningful to me. Although he understands what I’m saying and I can tell he feels badly about it, and he says that he’ll change his ways and make more of any effort, he never really does. I question why he doesn’t view me as worthy of making an effort for in this regard. 

It feels like our sex life is my responsibility to make happen. I’ve expressed all of this to him and not much has changed. I love my boyfriend so much. But thinking about always having to initiate sex for the rest of our relationship in the future makes me feel annoyed. It makes me feel like I have to do all the work and he gets the easy way out. 

It hurts me especially because if my boyfriend were to express to me that something I do (or don’t do) upsets him, I would make an effort to change in a heartbeat. I would never want him to feel hurt or taken advantage of. I question why it isn’t the same for him.

Been friends with this guy for some time and I started liking him.

I kind of acted on those feelings and would touch him a lot when we were together (like a hand on the leg, hand up his shirt kind of thing) and he would tell me its inappropriate b/c we're friends, I kind of just wouldn't listen and I do feel bad about this.

I would also say things like ""I don't want to be with you either"" but still continued doing the things I mentioned above (I don't know why I said this b/c I really did like him).

Anyways, over time, he kind of started warming up to me and reciprocating my feelings and actions and I kind of saw his reasons for not wanting to date and I started agreeing with him.

We got to a point where we agreed to this ""tentative"" relationship but we both agreed that we would go back to being friends--we just wanted something short-term because we felt like LTR wouldn't work with our current circumstances and we agreed on this. WE both agreed that we don't want LTR.

After this point, I kept talking to him about how I wanted more for our future, I'd talk about like marriage and kids and being with each other long term. I even told him i was in love with him at one point and cried b/c I was upset that I wouldn't get to be with him long term possibly. During this time i had reservations about being in a LTR with him (nothing having to with him, just circumstances) but I still talked about our future A LOT, like everyday lol I actually thought of names for our kids and talked to him about that.

Anyways one day he comes up to me and pitches this idea that we should be together, that he thought about all the stuff I said i wanted these past few months and he's on board, he thinks it would be worth giving a chance. I told him we had an agreement for something temporary and said no.

We broke up twice. First time, we were young and dumb and the stress of one of us moving away for college was obviously too much. Distance was hard and lack of dates lead to us growing stagnant. We still stayed in contact and re-kindled when I went to college and got back together. 

Unfortunately, we made it another year, but I suffered a traumatic event that really messed with my mental health. It affected the relationship and things grew stale again (I lacked motivation for anything—including sex). I broke up with him about a year ago because I knew I wasn’t healthy. We’ve been no contact until now. I’ve since improved and worked on my mental health.

Hard to explain over Reddit, but the relationship was never toxic. No infidelity, arguments ended with healthy communication, and overall we were very supportive of each other. I would say it was very unconditional. He’s always been my rock and he’s always treated me extremely well. I can’t put it into words, but the love we share for each other is not just surface level. However, both times, the relationship grew stale before it ended. Love was still there, but we fell into ruts and isolated ourselves. 

Recently, circumstances lead us to reconnect again and he stayed with me for a weekend. It felt good. It felt natural. We talked and concluded we needed to take everything slow, as in no pressure, and focus on catching up to feel out the connection. But—I have some anxiety over “third times a charm” because I don’t want to look like a fool and damage the relationship again. I deeply care about him and vise versa. I don’t want either of us to hurt again. This is the type of relationship that has the potential to grow and foster something great, but only if we manage to go about it the right way.

The relationship is really good, but here and there we can get into petty arguments, nothing too serious though.

Last night, a friend had sent me a video of him (I knew he was out amongst friends) and the video is pretty optically bad. His female friend is caressing both sides of his face in the background and leaning in and out. At some point, I believe it was a kiss upon watching it for about 200 times getting ready to throw up, but I genuinely couldn’t believe he would do something like that to me.

I had explained to him that I had been sent something odd and that I would like for him to explain why I’m seeing things like this because it’s very embarrassing for the both of us, and we are both very prideful people. We sat in his car and spoke for hours in which he swore to me they never kissed, but a boundary that I have was obviously crossed. He kept telling me that it’s how people talk in a club because it is loud and I disagreed, and he agreed he would be mad if someone had sent him the same thing of me. He agreed that boundary was crossed and swore to not allow something like that to happen again, but the whole thing is still making me sick to my stomach.

I don’t know if he is lying, and I am not sure what to believe. If I could post the video and keep us anon I would. Frankly, I had barely any sleep as I am riddled with anxiety about this. If I forgive him, is there a chance he’s lying to me and I’ll feel dumb? If I don’t forgive him, am I throwing away a good relationship I’m usually happy in based off a lie?

“Plz don’t ask me to do shrooms ever Bc the answer will prob be no lol”

And I say “I wasn’t going to lol”

“I will ask you to give me cuddles though:)”

We have lived together for most of that time. Our sex life was good at first, what you'd expect on a honeymoon period of a relationship. We moved in together fairly quickly, and then it started declining into almost non-existence. I still do find her attractive and I want sex, but she does not reciprocate. I think for the past year we have sex like once-twice a month, usually she doesn't come, not for the lack of trying on my part, but because she just outright refuses to be pleased (I do find it very strange, but that's the truth). We do have other issues other than sex, something I am struggling with and seeing a therapist about, but in general we work together quite well, I think. We definitely love each other, but the intimate part is not working for us.

It is going even further downhill, any intimacy appears to be gone at this point. The last few times we had sex, I couldn't get hard at all. It was clear she didn't want it, but only did it for me, to the point when sometimes she cried after our sex. That made me feel sick, almost like a rapist. So I am not surprised about not being able to get hard like that. She said to me recently that if we can't fix it, she is going to break up with me. I don't want that to happen, and I agree with her that something needs to be done. But what? She doesn't really know WHY she is no longer attracted to me, I don't know that either. She points to the fact that we spend too much time together. We both work from home, so yeah it's almost 24/7 that we are together. But what do we do with this...?

Important thing is, I think, that we had a period of ""sexual renaissance"", so to speak, back in june. It lasted for a few week and it was great. What caused it was an argument we had: I felt humiliated and lied to, because she admitted to having better sex with her exes, despite denying it before. I genuinely was so mad at her, that I did not speak to her for four days. I could see she was feeling very guilty, and was going out of her way to make up with me. I also could see that this situation, strangely, really turned her on. I outright refused to have sex with her, twice. The third time I agreed, stopped being mad at her, and everything changed between us. We started having lots of sex, it was even better than in our dating phase. But after a few weeks, gradually everything returned to normal, poof. There was no sex or intimacy any more.

See based on this, I can tell that we can work together and have good sex. But I don't know how to make it like this between us again. I asked her what was it that turned her on back then, but she only says she doesn't know what it was. She does say ""I was a totally different person"" back then. I definitely was different, the anger I felt made me behave differently. Internally I felt very different, externally I seemed to function way better. Like something clicked inside me and I became this cold, confident, focused and strong-willed individual. Yeah I can see how that is more attractive. But I can't really emulate this behavior.

We met about 6 months later at a club and decided to give it a other try. Later I found out that she's been fwb with this guy at that point, broke up with him and he confessed his love to her.

After a while she told me she doesn't want to go back to what was back then, but few weeks ago, her friend told me that after we broke up, she slept with this guy not even a week after (she was a virgin back then and we didn't even have sex at all) now, we're two years into a ""new"" relationshil and she invited her friends over (they're all friends with her ex). Before that she's been telling me that they will first go meet with their friend but she didn't tell me who, so I assumed it was no one that I know about, but it came up that it was this guy, her ex.

This is weird, because it was the same back when she broke up with me, she would always refer to him as a friend, rather than calling him by his name.

I asked her yesterday how much time has passed before they slept together after we broke up back then, and she said -oh I can't remember. I mean, it's not like I asked her what she had for dinner, I asked her when she lost her virginity, and she doesn't remember? Kind of weird.

Oh and one more thing, when she broke the fwb with him he pulled some shit and lretentsd some crazy cult is after him and he needs to leave country because he's in danger and it might be dangerous for her if he stays - two years later, he never even planned this ""escape"" but my girlfriend cried for a few weeks.

I want to call her out but I don't want to make things uncomfortable for him. What do I do? 

My sister and I are close in age (I'm about 1.5 years younger) and we live in the same city. We've never been very close and we bicker a lot but we have quite a few mutual friends and we're both close with our family so we end up seeinh quite a lot of each other. 

She quite recently introduced her new boyfriend. He comes from another country originally but is a citizen of our country and seems to be very well integrated. I'm trying to keep the details vague but if you imagine an ethnicity that is commonly fetishised by nerdy white women you can probably make a guess where he's from. My sister has idealised his home country since she was in her early teens mainly due to enjoying the pop culture. From what I can tell, he doesn't seem to share those specific interests. 

Her boyfriend is very beautiful. I'm not interested in men so I'm not saying this because I'm attracted to him. He looks like a model. However he is quite shy and insecure. He mentioned being bullied a lot growing up and having a hard time fitting in, he's also from quite a poor background. Honestly he could do a lot better than my sister. She's average looking and she's quite a difficult person. She also really doesn't treat him well or seem to care about him at all as a person. 

Having spent time with them together, I strongly suspect my sister is only with him because of his ethnicity and his looks. She is constantly taking pictures of him/them together and posting them on social media as if she's showing him off. The captions and tags are gross and 9 times out of 10 she'll find some way of mentioning his ethnicity or where he's from. It honestly reminds me of how some people are with their pets. Some of her friends are just as bad when they're around him and the poor guy seems so uncomfortable. 

When I've spent time with them as a couple, she seems more interested in taking pictures than listening to what he's saying. I've seen her literally interrupt him and tell him to stop talking while he's trying to speak to her. When our friends and family have asked him quite basic questions about himself, she has often been surprised and said he never told her, but presumably because she never asked him. He seems like a really sweet and interesting guy but whenever he says more than a few sentences he starts apologising even if she's not in the room. When she is in the room, she often cuts him off and I have literally heard her say in a really patronising voice ""aww, stop talking"". 

We recently had a family dinner and someone asked about his family, my sister was surprised to hear his mother died when he was a young child despite them dating for several months, it seemed to be completely new information to her. It made me so angry, the poor guy looked so hurt when she was like ""what? I never knew your mother was dead?"" Afterwards, I (privately) called her out on using him as a fashion accessory and not caring about him as a person. She said that I'm the one who is being racist because I wouldn't accuse her of that if he wasn't from another country. 

I've mentioned it to a couple of mutual friends who agree that she's treating him badly. It almost seems abusive to me and I think people would be disgusted if it was a white man treating a woman of colour that way. I know it's probably not my business but it's hard seeing someone being treated that way and he doesn't seem to realise that it's not okay.

Two years ago she entered a relationship, and from there was partaking in polyamory, having about 3 different partners at a time. She's now engaged to her first partner, who I believe is her main relationship, and they're getting married end of next year. That's totally fine; it's hard for me to wrap my head around polyamory, but if all the involved parties are okay with it, then it's not my business. 

This friend, we'll call her Gwen, was visiting from out of state and needed a place to stay, so my boyfriend and I offered to let her stay at our place. Everything's well and good, and at one point during the evening, Gwen texts me asking if she can talk with me after my boyfriend goes upstairs for the night. I say sure, thinking it must be something about him, although I had no idea what. 

He goes up for the night, and Gwen tells me that she's had a crush on me for over 10 years, and asked if I was open to polyamory. She says that she wanted to tell me before she got married, so that this doesn't 'blow up in our faces'. She also asked if I was happy with my boyfriend, a couple times. 

I had no idea how to respond to this. I am not in any way, shape or form into polyamory, and I don't know where she got the idea that I might be. I respect whatever lifestyle she chooses to follow, but I've been in my relationship for 8 years, and I would not do anything to jeopardize that. I know polyamory is very different from cheating, but the fact that she waited until my boyfriend left made it feel similar. 

I pretty much just responded with ""I'm monogamous, but we can be friends"" and left it at that. I went upstairs with my boyfriend and held off on telling him what happened, since I didn't want to make things awkward with Gwen. I immediately felt guilty about the situation, and upset at Gwen for making us go behind my boyfriend's back like that. 

I haven't really seen her since that happened, because I had to work the next day and she went home while I was at work. She texted me, but I haven't responded, and likely won't for a while. 

I told my boyfriend what happened after Gwen left and he was a little taken aback, but overall wasn't very surprised at all, and not upset. I pushed him further on it, and he said ""That's just how Gwen is"" and felt there wasn't anything to be upset about since I said no anyway. 

I'm honestly a little annoyed that my boyfriend doesn't care. This whole situation has made me uncomfortable, and I don't understand why she would tell me this after all these years. Maybe I am overreacting, but I feel like if I was polyamorous, I wouldn't ask people to be with me if they had only ever been in monogamous relationships. It feels as if Gwen didn't consider my feelings on the matter. 

I'm not sure what to do going forward. I don't know if I should just let it go and continue my friendship with Gwen as normal, or if I should say something to her about how I thought it was inappropriate to ask that. It's a similar thing with my boyfriend, I don't know whether to let the fact that he doesnt care go, or if I should push the matter and have him talk to Gwen about this.

Recently I spoke with my boyfriend and he brought up the idea of keeping me a secret as he’s unsure how to fit me into his life. He said he knows having me in his life will cause issues with other aspects, kids and business, and he doesn’t want to ruin it. It hurt a lot to hear that and made me think more on previous things he’s said. Earlier in the week he went on a trip and he told me he was thinking of running away because he couldn’t stop thinking of me and had to get away from me cause I made him feel crazy. 

I know he has issues with self love and being close to people. He has promised to remain open and honest about everything so I don’t think he was trying to be mean with this comment but it still hurt. In the few months we’ve been dating we’ve gone on maybe 3 dress up dates and have had countless dates canceled last minuet because of his kids wanting to switch up the schedule. 

I do accept that these things will be a battle and I think I stick them out. I thought it was something that would just be rough for awhile and then it would get easier, now it feels like there’s no end in sight.

She had been drinking way to much and said/did some things at company events and in public this summer that was outlandish. I was hard on her about it, it was unacceptable. (In one instance I made a comment about wanting a boat but that I was saving for a nice wedding, she took the wedding ring off and threw it at me in front of my companies VP). I harshly told her if she had a problem to leave. But I was under the interpretation we were working on it and not giving up.

Two weeks ago she came home and told me she’s done and moved into guest bedroom. And that this is a 1 sided relationship and I’m a bad lover. She left her explanations extremely vague. Given it was October 29th we agreed she would move out December 1st. I was in denial for a while and kept trying to show her I loved her. After 3-4 days I went and stayed at a friends to get some space. She was throwing way to many mixed signals. After a week I decided to stay back at the house and quit running from the situation because I have to live there when she leaves. I found a room mate and let her know too.

One week later she finally opened up a little bit. Said she thinks I’m a bad listener, that I’ve put work first lately, and she’s mad I missed 2 of her friends weddings (mind you they were 2 years ago before I had a full time job and could afford to go). Also that she has been looking for happiness through me (which I do see now that she brings it up). Two days pass, Thursday comes around and we talk again. I make some valid points to her, like that she should have communicated those things frustrated her a long time ago. She instantly started verbally attacking me about how it was all my fault for 20 minutes probably. After that, I said let’s change the subject and I will cook you dinner. She said she wanted nothing that was in the fridge, so I asked her what she would want. She wanted a pizza, so I took her to get one. During the drive there I asked her what her goals and purpose were (because she keeps saying how different she wants to be). She instantly snapped at me and said she wants no deep conversation and only small talk with me. It hurt me bad and for the first time in the situation I was mad. I went home ate 1 slice of pizza and went to stay at my friends.

I have been staying on and off at the house since, plus avoiding anything other than small talk. On Saturday she asked me twice if I was okay and why I was being so weird. When I came home from the gym, she was blaring sad music in her room crying loudly. I left for the night, came home Sunday. She literally cried all all day in her room Sunday. It was almost pathetic. She is an emotional mess but won’t let me help. It kills me. I cleaned the house and split our belongings s up over the weekend too. 

She claims to have looked for places online but I haven’t seen her physically look. She is also going home for a week for the holidays, which leaves her 8 days to find a place. I am scared I will actually have to kick her out. Her family is calling me concerned. The area we live in is expensive, with her teachers salary she will likely spend the the entire months paycheck to move.

While I love her, I feel as if she is not an affective communicator and needs to grow up. I have financially supported our lives substantially as well. We could have fixed things if she just talked to me. I do feel like I’m guilty of being stressed from work and that is all. As of now, I want her to leave and work on herself on December 1st. If our paths cross later, I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.

A few months ago she moved to Oregon for school. Ever since then our relationship has been different. I know everyone says long distance is tough yada yada but this is not what I had excepted. Before she moved we used to hangout all the time and when we weren’t with each other we’d call text joke around all that fun jazz. I figured hey once she’s moved and settled down we’d probably FaceTime and call and text a lot more make up for the time we aren’t together that stuff. Nope the complete opposite happened. I get less and less texts or calls sometimes I can go a week and get maybe a single text from her and that’s it. Some days she’ll give me quick texts like hey I’m at work or I’m done work but that’ll be it. Sometimes I can get her in the phone but she doesn’t really talk except short quick answers to my questions about her day work etc She never actually has a conversation adds to it or takes interest in me or my day or anything like that. I’ve tried to set up date nights where we could FaceTime and watch a movie together or play a game or something multiple times Shes stood me up not calling or texting or answering my calls. She  hasn’t even tried to set up new dates or anything I feel like I’m putting in all the effort. I’ve tried talking to her about it I’ve asked what’s wrong why she isn’t really talking to me she says nothings wrong she’s busy but she loves me the last time we argued about it she blew up at and said I’m so sorry I have a life outside of you and can’t cater to you.

We have a 4 month old &amp; have lived together for 1 1/2 years but we are currently sleeping in separate rooms to give space. Things were never too bad, we aren't perfect but I never thought either of us were unhappy so when he broke up with me it was a shock. I told him I did not want to break up and that we will make it work &amp; he agreed that we would still try but without the title. I asked him if he was making this decision because there was another woman and he told me no, that other women were not even a thought &amp; that he was dealing with unhappiness within himself that he needed to work on in order to be a good partner to me &amp; that I needed to work on a few things that worried him, like my anxiety when it comes to big groups &amp; strangers, so that I can be a better partner to him as well. I believed him &amp; understood exactly what he meant. Fast forward to 5 days ago, I was having dreams of him emotionally cheating on me with a particular woman in his life, lets call her B, that he has been friends with forever, like giving her flowers, taking her out, etc.  I would wake up crying because in my dreams he was doing things for her that he wasn't doing for me anymore. The first time it happened I chalked it up to me overthinking about her bcs when he mentioned my anxiety when it comes to big groups I knew he was talking about how I always tell him no when he asks to go out with him and his friends. I do not go because of her and never will because she makes me uncomfortable (I have never told him that, flaw on my part) Anyway, when the dreams continued it all felt so real that I decided to go through his messages so I didn't feel crazy, which I have never done to anyone. low and behold he was texting her as well as another woman, ill call her S.

He claims it was all texts and nothing physical, but I know he met up with B &amp; I know they have history together. I told him that she was the reason I don't go anywhere with him bcs I know her presence would piss me off and it would ruin the atmosphere for everyone, I told him that I knew they had history and that I was hoping nothing like this happened. I asked him to tell me right then and there whether he wanted them so that I could leave and move on. I asked him why he would tell me we were working on saving our relationship if he knew he was interested in other people, he said he's not interested in them &amp; that he was just bored, said he would stop texting them and that he was wrong for even initiating it. I believed him. 

the days after that have been great, he's been putting in effort and I have been too so I thought things were getting better. We had a few drinks at home on saturday and spent the night together in the same bed. I woke up before him and his phone was right next to my face. When I picked it up to put it on the charger for him I saw texts from S. My heart sank. I tried to unlock it to read the messages but he had changed his password. I did not react though like I wanted to after, partly because I was still drunk &amp; knew it would make things worse, I just calming got out of bed and went to the other room. When we woke up I did not mention it. He asked me why I had left and it took everything in me to not start crying and yelling. 

I know we are no longer together, so technically its not cheating, I guess I should be grateful that he waited until we were broken up, but this whole situation is breaking my heart. I'm so conflicted on whether or not I should keep trying, or if it is a lost cause &amp; pointless. I love him and I would do anything to make it work, but every time I think about the messages my stomach does flips.

I transferred to a different university to begin a completely different program last fall (I was 21 at the time). During orientation, I met a girl (18F) who approached me and we hit it off as friends. Near the beginning of the term, she was flirting with me a lot and made some not so subtle comments about wanting to date me. I politely told her that I wasn't interested and she seemed to accept it. About a week later, she got a boyfriend and we continued being friends as normal. During the winter term, she was going through a rough patch with her boyfriend and I did my best to be as supportive of her as I could. She later broke up with him and told me that she had feelings for me. I again told her I didn't feel the same. We finished the semester and parted ways after exams. It was also around this time that she started to say ""I love you"" anytime we parted ways or ended a call. Sadly, I'd reluctantly say it back, thinking it was platonic (I cringe looking back at how dumb it was for me to do that).

At the end of April she dated another guy who she met on Bumble, but broke up with him recently due to a lot of issues surrounding him. Recently she's been saying weird things to me over the phone like ""I had the biggest crush on you during semi-formal. Haha, sorry that slipped out cuz I'm sleep deprived"". I later visited her at her farmhouse and we went to a nearby beach. She suggested playing a game where we each write the names of our crushes in the sand. After some screwing around, she ended up writing my name in the sand. A couple days later we were talking on snapchat and she asked me ""What if I told you that you make me happier than any other guy and I truly feel content with you?"". I brushed it off saying that's great and all to which she replied ""Love me back goddamn it"". I don't remember what I replied, but I think I brushed it off saying that she can always find someone better. Around this time, she would also send me these posts about how people can be soul mates in a platonic way and how I'm her soul mate.

I've made it crystal clear to her many times that I'm not interested in more than friendship. The first time I turned her down at the start of the year, she literally replied saying that she knew I didn't like her back (since I never reciprocated the flirting), but thought she'd try anyways. And throughout the school year, I again made it clear that I only wanted to be friends and nothing more. I'm not sure how much more clear I can be than that.

I'm honestly starting to get really frustrated at all the advances she's making, despite me making it clear that I'm just not interested. I should also add that during the time I've known her, she's always had a lot of trouble taking no for an answer (i.e., At semi-formal, she would keep asking me to dance with her. I said no as I don't really dance, to which she literally grabbed my arm and wouldn't stop pulling until she started tearing my blazer). I'm unsure how to move forward as I'm getting more and more pissed off with her constant boundary pushing behavior. I could give many more examples, but I'd probably reach the word limit.

Once everything with her family was alright again about a week later, we decided to meet up again and set a date and time all the while still talking normally, getting closer etc. Date day comes and I make it to the place we agreed to meet up and long story short, she doesn't show up. I texted and called a few times and nothing, so after waiting 45 minutes I headed home. 

I've never been stood up before and I tried to feel my feelings, which sounds silly I'm sure but I am really good at not doing that as a defense mechanism but I've been in therapy for a year and a half and blah blah blah working on all of that. So out of that, the biggest emotions I felt were disappointment but mostly embarrassment. I also tried not to let my emotions get the better of me and jump to too many conclusions because there's also the possibility that something bad could have happened, not likely I think, but not impossible. 

None of that is really why I'm writing though, just backstory more than anything. I'm writing because the only thing really making me dwell a little on everything is the mystery. Admittedly, this is my first time in a long time going about dating in a healthy way and so I'm trying to figure out if I maybe missed something? Like did she catfish me? She had pictures on her profile that seemed legit, I don't really do social media so I never saw her Instagram but shes sent me tik toks and saw some she's made, etc. Is she just someone who ghosted me and end of story? It was insanely out of character out of nowhere, even the first time she cancelled on me she did it like an hour or so In advance, was super apologetic and offered to pay for our raincheck outing vs now where it was just raidio silence.

I [M,25] is writing this post to get some help from the community to handle the current situation.

 Let me start from telling you guys about me. I am an average looking guy, sde by job. I had my last breakup in my 2nd year of college[5 years back from now]. After that , alike many men i though of being emotionally unavailable and focus on work. On that path in like 3 more months i realized i am in love with a friend whom i met in my college. I call it love because her being around made my day brighter and my heart was able to tell that she is nearby by beating faster than usual. But due to past experience and suffering i just wanted to pursue with my work. I was there as her friend for her, this way she was happy and a little part of my day becomes brighter. Eventually college ended. I got one of the top job in campus placements. 3 years went by, which includes her getting a bf, us partying, bitching and even helping each others at the times when no one else would. I considerd myself her bestfriend and she told me the same, who actually did not want any thing more than being friends. She was a very social person she also started gifting out the farewell gifts she wanted to give to people she wanted. Before last day of college, I prepeared her a scrap book as a farewell gift.  I was waiting for my present to be delivered. On the 2nd last day i gave her my present and she was stunned to have it. After getting to know that she really have not considerd buying me a gift, I wrote Good bye and she thought i made a mistake by correcting me that goodbyes are for last times. We had a good laugh about it. After 7 days i received a t shirt of the same amount.
The only thing that got broken into me was that when i was at my complete honesty, i got nothing, not even a friend who considers me as a friend.

Then i moved away for my job, in a state of complete isolation of not engaging with any other girl. In my company i met with another girl [20 days older than me], lets call her Amy.
She was my college senior which joined same company 1 year back. As she was committed in long distance already it was easy for me to talk to her. We started talking, she use to come to my building for lunch and then i use to drop off to her building. Then covid came in, we all went back to our hometowns. Luckily her place was 1 hour away from mine.She use to visit me we spend the day roaming in the city , exploring new cafes, spending time in our college etc. It was a little more than 1.5 years that we spent and me having absolutely no intentions for her being anything more than a friend. One evening after spending whole day, we were walking in a park and had a little awkward moment for the first time. At this time i was doubting my friendship with her. After some time she discussed with me about going out with some ex colleagues on a trip, to which i supported like a friend would have done. But after that something snapped in me. I was having a feeling of emptiness and was like something is going away. I realized i am feeling for her, i stood on that thought for a month with complete isolation and decided to propose her. After 1.5 months i wrote a letter to her and sent it. To which she messaged me she had her breakup 8 months back and is not ready to be more than just a friend to me. I was heartbroken but was sure to not extend this friendship for my own sake. She started not vieweing my stories etc, and no texts from both sides.

Its been exactly a year now. I have not met anyone else whom i felt more connected to, i mean no one. She still comes in my dreams at night. She changed her job , i recently moved to the same city.  We both are 25, our bithdays are 20 days apart, alike last year i wished her after she posted an insta story. But she did not do that on my birthday. But still i am having dreams about her and its affecting my life.

They were very happy, he was a simple man that pretty much worked 9-5, your basic provider type guy, solid and stable dude, seemed healthy and all that. I'd say like a 6 or 7 out of 10.

Then during lockdown, they were both doing very well as they had each other company. Apparently they're very into nerdy stuff like RPGs, so that was good. But somewhere down the line, the dude started becoming depressed and then he began doing yoga, training as a therapist and talked about dark stuff like childhood trauma and all that. I knew this was gonna be bad.

First time I saw them after lockdown, I was completely shocked. They both have changed so much, she stopped wearing makeup and just sounded depressed to me, meanwhile the dude looks like this hottie with style, like solid 8 or 9 out of 10. He said he realised there was more in life or some spiritual whatever, but she described him as ""emotionally mature"", but I just don't get why he changed so drastically?

I spoke to her after that and we met up as well (I was very worried), she said how he made her realise a lot of things about herself and her insecurities (it sounds like the dude has been gaslighting her!) ever since they got together. Janice is straight up just excusing his BS, I swear the dude is just using her to make himself feel better. He's always passive-aggressively saying shit like ""don't change yourself for me, just do it for yourself"", yeah like no shit Sherlock, Janice ain't doing nothing for you, who tf do you think you are.

But every time I ask her whether she's happy, she says she is, so I worried he had hit her or something. Turns out he's just been out exploring new hobbies and interests (that she's not into, again passive-aggressive), I bet he's trying to get laid or find a new partner. She is completely neglected now after lockdown because he's always out on nights (they only have one date night every other week!) trying to ""discover himself"".
