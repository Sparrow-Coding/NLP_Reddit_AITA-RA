I recently partially moved into a house with my Dad (54M) and stepmother due to some relationship issues. After I moved my step mother was "" cleaning "" in my room and found some things that disturbed her. She found my tarot cards, "" The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need "" by Joanna Martine Woolfolk, "" Dear Universe "" by Sarah Prout, and ""50 Shades Freed"" by E. L. James. My stepmother is Christian and believes that tarot cards, manifestation, meditation, astrology, and BDSM to be evil and that of Satan. I, on the other hand, don't have a religion. I have some beliefs, but they do not fall into one religion. Step mom brought this up to my dad in hopes he would save me from this evil and take it out of the house and back to my apartment. Unluckily for her, he told her that since I am on the lease, I have the right to have my things there, and if she had an issue with it, she should talk to me. She did not like that answer, but she insisted my dad do something with my belongings. After my dad brought them back to the apartment (I have been in between places), my dad told me why he brought them. The next day, my step mom texts me to say that she did not mean to cause a big issue. That her spirit was unsettled and she needed my dad to tell me she can't have them in her house. She went on talk about an experience she had after watching Ghost Hunters where she believes her old house became haunted and had people from her church pray over her house. She felt that she NEEDED to protect me, my children(her grandchildren), and anyone who enters her home. I told her that she is being closed minded and it was not okay to put this between me and my father and not talk to me about it in the first place was very frustrating. That I didn't like how she assumed I was bringing evil into her home. We can talk about it in person. Am I The Asshole?

But he would have situations on which it was in one ear &amp; out the other. He would either yell at me for not sticking to the contract &amp; producing a content a day or ignore all my advices to meet in the middle where i would make multiple content a day to make up for the missing days.

I try to set boundaries on where i set ground rules like he can’t send mass messages without replying to all comments first or he doesn’t tell me what customs to make and the sub gets angry because they have to wait days to get it. He will take money from them before i will agree on making the content and then have to refund them if i don’t feel comfortable.

It makes me so upset because my manager keeps getting in the way of me truly making money to survive in this economy.

We found out we were expecting in February of this year, and we lived about 3 hours away from her family, and 20 minutes away from my parents. We lived in a town of 25k. Amenities, good paying jobs, and reasonable rent were there. We had a middle of the road apartment, I was making good money and we were living comfortably and I was building us a nice savings account. 

Fast forward a few months into pregnancy. My fiancé was really needing her family. Like bad. I was the sole source of income since she was not working as her morning sickness was more like all day, 24/7 sickness hell. I felt really really bad for her. Her family was almost 3 hours away. She wanted to move. Her parents generously offered us a place in their home, and a opportunity to save even more money. 

I found a good paying job in their town of 2k and we moved. 

I should probably mention that my in laws are hoarders. And I am unfortunately the kind of person where cleanliness affects my mental health, which is why I am a clean freak.

It is frustrating as that that is a shared space, and it’s difficult to cook when countertops are full of quite literal junk. It as if they see a cleared/clean spot at have the urge to fill it. But again, it’s their house and they are absolutley justified in putting whatever they want wherever they want outside of our allowed space. 

The issue is, I’m not going to be paying rent for a house that’s full of things that aren’t mine. I won’t be paying for a house that has a garage that I cannot use becuase it is full of junk. 

Am I being an asshole for feeling this way?  They’ve been more than generous to us by letting us live here rent free while they’re also living here, and i have absolutely no problem paying the entire expenses to live here after they move out, however I cannot justify paying for an entire house if my fiance and I cannot use the entire house or atleast have a house that is not full of quite literal junk.

I can't shake the idea that I'm being overly controlling, so here I am.

Some background first. My (23m) girlfriend, Priscilla (25f), and I have been dating for nearly a year and a half. Her parents like me, although I can't talk to them much due to a language barrier. I've been trying to learn the language they speak, but I've been struggling on making small talk (and just struggling in general). I hate small talk, so it's 10000x worse in another language.

Now, onto what the title asks. None of her extended family know that I'm Priscilla's boyfriend. They met me in the past but it was when we had recently started dating (around 2-3 months), so they didn't know at the time. Now, although I don't blame her for that, I do blame her for keeping me a secret from them for an extra 14-16 months. We're a really serious couple, we're each other's first kiss, we took each other's virginity, we talk about marriage and our future, how many kids we're going to have, we spend a lot of our free time together, etc.

When I bring up the fact that I want her extended family to know about me, Priscilla dismisses it, saying that she wants her parents approval before telling them. I understand that, but the problem is that she won't talk to her parents about it and she uses it as the excuse every single time. She's used that excuse at least 5 times while making no effort to talk to her parents about letting her family know about me.

I can't tell them myself because 1) I never see them, 2) same language barrier as her parents, and 3) I'm incredibly socially awkward.

I told her about how I feel like I don't matter at all and how she never cares about my feelings (using examples), and now she isn't talking to me or saying that she loves me. AITA?

He has always had an issue with his drinking. When he is drunk, he is volatile, angry and mean. It has caused dozens of middle of the night screaming fights, unprovoked. Very early on I began to have an issue with him drinking and began to oppose him going out. I had to learn to let it go and give him his freedom to avoid resentment, but it makes me uncomfortable every time he wants to go out. Not to mention, I feel resentful that when I go out, he cant even give me 2 hours without multiple calls and accusations. I usually leave him alone 100% when he’s out to avoid him feeling suffocated and avoid fights. 

I feel like he’s never respected my insecurity with his drinking.  He does it anyway and calls me controlling. I do struggle with wanting to be in control but iv worked so hard and he continues to use it as leverage. I feel like its manipulative, but what do I know? 

Three times in the last month, he’s snuck out to bars, lied about it, and gotten drunk. Then, coming home and being verbally and emotionally abusive. Truly cruel things. Tonight, he went to a bar again for “only 8 minutes.” The issue isn’t the bar, it’s the lack of respect he has for me. He thinks I’m mad because he made a choice I couldn’t control, and I didn’t get my way. No, I’m mad because despite knowing how abusive he is, and knowing the problems it causes us, he chooses it anyway. He screams at me that I’m controlling, and it feels so unfair. I don’t want to tell him what to do. I want him to CHOOSE not to because he knows its hurtful and inappropriate. His justification is that I always disrespect him. His examples of disrespect is me giving attitude, and how I talk or respond to him when I’m not in a good mood. I’m TRULY working hard to grow, I get better and learn every day. I just feel like his actions are far more extreme and he shows no remorse at all. It really screws with my mind the way anytime I oppose anything or have a differing opinion of his choices, I get shut down, told I just want to be in control, and then he usually turns the convo to be about something I did to upset him, rather than give me an validation or just listen in the least. 

It gets exhausting being told how I am to blame for every bad choice he makes. I’m the reason he cheats, lies, sneaks around, drinks, etc. It sucks to feel like I’m doing better and then have it all thrown back in my face like I haven’t grown at all. Every fight, he reminds me how miserable this relationship has always been and its all my fault. He mocks me when I’m upset. It just feels so unfair.

(Just gonna use MIL and FIL for easier reading lol, also please excuse grammatical errors. I'm typing this on my phone)

For context:
I have bad anxiety and cannot handle being yelled at with breaking down crying, This isn't the first time FIL has yelled at me.

I [21] and my boyfriend[Also 21] live in a flat on the same property as my BF's parent's house, (the property isn't owned by my future inlaws if that helps anything) 

Anyway, my MIL has brain cancer and had a fall a few nights ago, FIL was in the shed and had left his phone in their house, so MIL called us and we went upstairs to help her. 

After a while of helping her get dressed and making sure she hadn't badly injured herself. Future FIL came upstairs and we explained to him that MIL had fallen and we had helped her, we also tried to remind him to bring his phone with him next time incase BF and I weren't at home if MIL were to fall again. He took what we said it as an attack and started screaming at us that it wasn't his fault and that he shouldn't be expected to look after MIL. 
Being screamed at made me have an anxiety attack so I left downstairs and back into our flat.


So now onto today, I had just got back from work and BF and I were cleaning out my car, FIL came over and gave me a hug and apologised to me, saying ""I won't ever do it again"" (something he said last time)
I replied with ""I understand that you were in a bad mood last night, however I didn't appreciate the way you spoke to me, and if it does happen again, I won't be talking to you again, so I know it won't happen at all""

With this FIL said ""So you want it to just go on like this?"" 

I once again reiterated that ""No, I am not saying I won't talk to you at all again right now, I'm saying that you're getting one more chance."" 

I thought this was the end of it, as FIL walked away but as soon as my BF had gone to put something from the car into the flat FIL came back again.

""So you want to keep it going? I said I won't do it again"" He started raising his voice, which started to make me cry, cause you know, confrontation.

""No. That's why I'm saying this, so it won't happen again.""

""But you're continuing it by saying that! It's all mind games!"" He was yelling now, he was still inside the yard while I was on the driveway. Though at this point I was on the other side of my car against the fence because I didn't want to be anywhere near him. BF came back and that's when FIL left, angrily muttering to himself.

I feel like I only set a clear boundary of how I wanted to be treated, and my BF agrees with me but I guess a side of me still worries if the way I went about it was wrong.

As a married couple they tend to go out to certain events and do a lot of things as married couples do, then come back and talk about how great everything was, how much fun they had, how we should ALL go together next time around! Sounds great.

So when it looks like we all have free time I start mentioning maybe going to said events, sometimes they’re down but more recently they’ve started coming up wish excuses about how ‘well it wasn’t THAT fun’ ‘Don’t want to waste money on that’ ‘Not worth it’ and so on. Kinda sucks but I’m not going to push someone into doing something they don’t want to.

One of the things they talk about all the time is their very frequent trips to Vegas. I’ve never been but have been wanting to go for YEARS and every time I mention going they throw around excuses until the subjects drop then go again with a different also married friend group later that same year. Sucks but I get it.

Since they’ve shot down Vegas so much I started asking another friend who’s more than happy to go (who also hasn’t gone but has been wanting to) I mentioned being excited about the trip to C and M when we were catching up over drinks and C suddenly got really quiet and moody. I tried to ask what was wrong, she said nothing, then texted me later going on this long weird rant about how she feels like she’s being replaced, it’s rude to mention travel plans with another friend and why didn’t I ask her and M if they wanted to go too? I tried to explain my reasoning of them always shooting it down (They also don’t like clubbing, tend to turn in SUPER early, can either be super easy or a nightmare to travel with but my other friend is way more chill, open and can keep up with what I want to do) but C wasn’t having it, we got in a bit of a fight, she called me an asshole and M isn’t replying to any of my messages so now I’m wondering if I crossed some sort of line???",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852451,public,top,self,AITA for going to Vegas?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc37sx/aita_for_going_to_vegas/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

She's a good friend but we don't have much in common but we were in same dance program at university and have been super close since. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is only one problem, she's a little self absorbed. She's always posting on social mrdia and loves looking at herself in the mirror and loves telling me about all the guys who slide in her DMs. I'm a cute girl but she's prettier than me. You all may not believe me but I really don't care about her looks, we don't have the same taste in guys and our vibe is different. There will always be someone better or worse looking than you so what's the big deal, we're all people, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Last week a celebrity liked a comment of hers on SM. She's a really big fan so ran into my room to show me. I'm not into celebrity culture but I acted as if I was amazed because I wanted to make her happy. I get to work and at lunch she texts me saying he has a gazillion other commenters to choose from but must have had his eye on her because he liked her comment. I replied, ""whoa such a awesome moment"" thinking that she'd know see I was trying to share in her joy (even though for me this is utterly stupid). I'm still eating lunch and she goes oonoon say that he's into her and liked her comment because heas a crush on her and will probably slide into her DMs. She then writes jaja. (That's how we say haha on Spanish).

&amp;#x200B;

Even though she wrote ""jaja"" I know she wasn't kidding, she actually thinks this celeb guy liked her comment because he wants to sleep with her. Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't but frankly I'm annoyed because I have no interest in telling her how 'hot"" she is because it's stupid and bores me to tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I decide I'm over it. I write lol and a laugh emoji and said nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that could be interpreted as if I'm laughing at the idea of this guy finding her attractive. That's not what I think. I was just over talking about it. She hasn't spoken to me since other than perfunctory greetings.

I (31F) have been a content creator for more than a year after one of my creative video got viral on Tiktok. Since then I keep gaining followers on this particular platform. I finally produced few products and received good sales and reviews. But I'm still doing freelances to cover my expense since the sales  are not always soaring. My siblings know that I do not want to go back to 9-5 job because I love the idea of self-employed and have the privilege to work any time I want. Recently I created a new account on Youtube and decided to try diverse niche than my Tiktok. This is still a learning process because I want to explore and understand which specific content that people are interested to view in my Youtube channel. 

My sister (26F) recently got COVID after her oversea trip. She decided to stay in my house that I rent together with my other 2 siblings. Since I am a full time content creator, I can take care of her and cater her needs during the recovery.

After resting for a while, she joins me watching Youtube vlogs at living room and suddenly decided to give advice regarding my niche and strategy on Tiktok. She told me that I should add more niche in the Tiktok and bring them to Youtube. She also said she saw videos of people made short vlogs on Tiktok and received high engagement. But I dismissed her advice and told her I don’t for her advice. Besides, I did that few times on Tiktok and did not received high engagements or views on that compare to my standard specific niche. She said that I was too arrogant to not accepting her advices. Plus, she have no interest in my niche in Tiktok and Youtube. Her interest is totally different than mine. Mind you that she has 9-5 job and do not have content creator experience like I do. She made decent money than me, but we are totally different fields. So, I don't see the point why I need to listen to her advice and if I want to get advice regarding this topic, I have Youtube gurus to go to.

I learnt the hard way that we cannot give advice to people unless in these 2 situations; 1) It is a life threatening event, and 2) The person ask for the advice. 

This is not the first time she tried to give advice to me and most of the time I just ignore her because we are totally different person and have no similar interest. But this time I was so fed up, I already on the verge to scream at her to STFU but she is also sick with COVID. So I went straight to my room while she was still 'giving advice' about my content creator job.

We have already been together years, lived together for over a year, and have bought a house together. Already very much established. We picked a date, decided we just want to do a courthouse/jp ceremony, and that it would be just us, with his best friend and wife as our witnesses. No parents, siblings, etc. Nobody from the family as witnesses so there's no jealousy or ""unfair treatment"". We could then prepare celebrations with families at a later time.

When we told my parents, they were absolutely thrilled at the news and were extremely respectful of our wishes for the ceremony.

When we told my future husband's parents, they were excited for us, but as soon as I wasn't around, my future mil told my husband that she was very disappointed that we would choose to exclude them, but left it at that.

He spoke to me about it the next morning. We talked a bit and established that he doesn't particularly care either way, but I do feel semi strongly about having this to ourselves. So I asked him for time to think on it and make a rational decision versus my initial feeling of having ""what I want for my wedding"" taken away from me. He was amenable. No harm, no foul.

Later that evening, his mother bombards the both of us in a fit saying that we have no right to exclude her from the ceremony, that she's going to be there no matter what, she carried him for nine months, she deserves this, how could we ""invite"" friends over parents, you name it.

My only response to her was that I didn't appreciate the way that she approached it with me, that the issue had already been brought to my attention, that we as a couple had decided to mull it over for a while before deciding (as to avoid this sort of confrontation), and that she wasn't doing anyone any favors by reacting in this manner.

My future husband does admit retrospectively that he wishes he had told her about our discussion, but he didn't think she'd explode in such a manner.

At one point he even made jokes about sticking stuff up her butt, which obviously made me uncomfortable, he touched her butt a few times too, I told him to stop but I guess he ignored that since he continued doing it.

I took that as an opportunity to change something in his profile.

Lock down happened and we started chatting regularly day and night got to know each other more became best friends. I confessed my feelings for her and asked her out she said no coz eventually it'll ruin our friendship, I agreed and stayed as we were. Later she invited me to her friends party went there enjoyed. I met her other friend's bf and later we 4 started hanging out (me, my girl best friend, her friend and friend's bf). We decide that we 4 should have a night out, we drank had fun, at night me and my girl best friend were on same bed, I was beside her I asked her if I can kiss her she said yes (only if I don't catch feelings for her) and damn that was the best day of my life.

 Later we 4 made more plans, me and my girl best friend became more and more intimate if ykyk (still had those feelings for her but didn't tell her coz ik it would be no, so I let it flow how it was). Once she got late from work so i called her up and told her to meet me coz i didn't wanted her to go so late, her grandmother was so grateful that i came to drop her at 11 pm. So heres the story, She starts working makes new friends they go for party there she kisses the manager (manager has a gf and is probably 10yr oldr en us), after couple of days I tell her to meet me and hang out, I was calling her to know where she reached so I could get there in time and pick her up, her number was busy so i tried calling again and again so she knows I'm already there, she gets mad and yells why are you calling again and again, I felt little bad about it don't mind she said it was work call and I'm not that guy who'd get over small, infact all her friends think I'm the most Calm and chillest person. So here comes the part where she kissed that manager, she tells me that and my heart drops ,felt like there was no land under my feet, heart beating suoer fast, i had never felt so worst and down in my life, but it's just I can't tell her anything she is not even my gf and can't even ask why she madeout with that manager,  it's just I couldn't bare that coz I'm still in love with her, how much ever I try to forget it, it comes back and haunts me, even if she did she should've kept to herself and not tell me, but day prior making out with that guy I was over her place and we made out and did some more.

His side gig is that he sells, buys, trades figures, Funko Pops, Hot Toys, just about anything. So I knew my brother was gonna go sell at comic con and I asked him if he can get me a ticket which he said he would buy it for me and I would pay him whenever i could, the only condition was that he wanted me to stand in line for the “Hot Topic” booth for the exclusive Funko pops. Every Comic Con always have exclusive Funkos every year and of course everybody always want to get their hands on it. I agreed and we headed off Friday to Comic Con. Getting there I helped my brother take stuff out his car and go up and down the elevator bringing his stuff.

So we find out we, as exhibitors or sellers can’t stand in line early so we would have to wait with everybody else for the pop at 4pm , only people who got priority were the “vip”. I was a bit annoyed but didn’t think it was that bad. I get in line and something goes wrong in Hot Topics system and they had to get a customer one by one. So like I said we got in line at 4 and we were there for HOURS. Keep in mind, Comic Con opens there doors at 4pm and close at 9pm on Friday. I was getting angry at the fact that hours were passing and I never knew when I would get the pop. My brother only passed by once to check but he came to taunt me and say stuff like “Oh you look so tired standing there huh” with a smirk. I was angry but sucked it up and waited. It was hell the line was moving about 3 inches every 15 minutes and I kept looking at my watch and saw time was running out. I was extremely thirsty and hungry and really did need to use the bathroom but I couldn’t fort getting out of line because I knew my brother would kill me. I ended up getting the pops that I payed for with my money and by the time I left the line it was 8:10pm. I dropped off the funkos to my brother with a angry expression and went to use the bathroom and get water and food in me.

By the time i undid everything I needed it was 8:45 and most of the booths were already closing so I couldn’t even walk around anymore. My brother packed up his stuff said bye to his partners and we left. My brother still acting smart was saying “so how was comic con? Pretty cool huh” I was livid and told my brother I couldn’t even enjoy it. My brother snaps at me and said we agreed to it. He dropped me off home and he didn’t even pay me back for the funkos I bought. He ended sending me a Venmo request for 35$ for the ticket but I am not paying for. I told my sister about this and she agrees I shouldn’t give him a single cent and if anything I should be charging him for the funkos and my time for standing in line. One of his partners did apologize to me and even told my brother in front of me that what he was doing wasn’t fair.

When he got a phone due to after school activities when he was 9, we made it a rule and gave him YouTube kids. He’s always followed the rule until recently.

Turns out, 11m has been watching YouTube for a total of 12 hours last week. Thus, the following fight:

Dad is with him right now, and texts me at 1130pm to ask if I set up YouTube restrictions. I say no, he uses YouTube kids. Dad says he’s been watching regular YouTube. I say “if you know he has feel free to handle it.” A little passive aggressive but like, you’re there not me and why do I have to be the bad guy here? I also tell him to do something to stop it. He says “so you didn’t tell him he could?” It’s midnight and I’m at my boyfriends and he knows this, so I just set up the restriction of 1 min daily on YouTube and show him the change. I also point out the time.

Now the convo shifts, he defends that there’s a way to make YouTube safe for kids that’s not on the kids app and he just wanted to be sure I didn’t do that and that our kid really is breaking the rules. I remind him we considered that option last year and chose YouTube kids. He shifts to maybe I changed it and didn’t tell him

Now here’s where I’m may be the asshole: it’s midnight, you’ve got the kids and you’re texting me about it. So you’ve got a pretty good idea he isn’t allowed or you wouldn’t have said something. 

He couldnt remember that we set limits together or that I had to punish him for it last week. And now he’s saying it’s somehow on me because I could have changed the rules on my own. Both are solved by just talking to your kid in the morning and giving him a chance to defend it or come clean and then discuss the punishment with me. 

So I get mad and point out that he’s expecting me to do it all. He tunes out the discussions on how to parent them or forgets and then asks me to remind him all the time (schedules, bed times, rules, appointments, punishments etc). And then has the audacity to say he “was just checking”. I told him it’s “no big deal” to him but to me it’s just another in a long line of me having to be the one who helps him instead of him being a responsible dad and remembering.

He didn’t text back and I’m feeling bad because I usually just let it go but I guess since the split my willingness to just suck it up to avoid a fight is gone and I’ve been calling him out on it a lot more and in not so nice terms.

One friend, who I'll call Mike (17M), has recently become quite close with me, and we have been playing online games regularly with each other. We do have other friends in common and agreed that one friend, I will call Freddy (17M), could join us. 

For context, Mike underwent pretty severe bullying at school (we have all just graduated and are going to UNI together), and is pretty selective with people that he allows in his social circle. I have had to awkwardly tell people a few times that they can't play with us because Mike doesn't like them. A task that he always leaves to me.

For more context, he is new to the game that we have just started playing together, and I have had to teach him the ropes. He isn't very good, but I don't bug him about it in a serious way because he is still learning, although we do make jokes with each other about our respective skill levels.

So, the argument lies with the wording of my invitation for Freddy to join us. In this message, which I sent to Freddy personally and then shared casually with our 3 person group chat (mistake), I make two comments about Mike which he found to be 'dissapointing'. In the first comment, I bring up the fact that Mike has rejected two of our other mutual friends, and imply that Freddy should be glad that he has made the cut. I said this with the intention of 1. Providing Freddy with the knowledge that Mike doesn't want to play with those people and 2. trying to make Freddy feel nice that we want to hang out with him. I didn't intend to disparage Mike, as I agree with him and have said as much.

The second comment, which was made in closed brackets at the end of the message, says that I will be the main person teaching Freddy the ropes of the game as Mike 'is still learning and is sliiightly incompetent'. I fully expected Mike to take that comment as a small joke at his expense, but instead, he felt that I was labeling him as being personally incompetent. 

Mike texted me after he saw the message and accused me of implying that he was weird and then calling him incompetent. After I told him sorry and that I didn't mean any of it as a sincere insult to him, he said that he didn't read it as a joke and that it felt pretty bad. After sitting with it for a while, I am starting to grow annoyed that Mike has crafted a sort of victim story around two pretty innocuous comments, and that he shouldn't be making me feel guilty for saying those things.

Both of us work but I earn slightly more than she does. Before getting married we dated for about 3 years and all throughout our relationship she has never been careful with money. She didn't and still doesn't care about savings and likes to spend money as it comes in. She likes to treat herself to nice things like luxury purses, spa days, and branded clothes. I don't have a problem with her pampering herself except it has led to a situation where nearly the entire household expenses fall on me whereas her money is almost spent entirely on her. At times, she runs out of money at the end of the month and takes money from our joint account. It also bothers me as we had our son 8 months ago and we need to start saving for his future.  
Now to the issue in hand, about two weeks ago, my wife spent a lot of money, equivalent to about 1000 USD on a dress, it was for no specific occasion, she said that she just liked it. The problem was she didn't have enough money to buy the dress so she took about $750 from our joint account, we had $1500 in it specifically to pay bills. I was furious when I found out as I had to foot the bills from my savings again but I didn't say a thing.   
Yesterday was her birthday and we went to her parent's house like we usually do on her birthday everything was going well. Once the celebration was over we came back to our house and my wife excitedly asked me where her gift was. I told her that because she had spent a lot of our money on the dress, I thought that it was her gift. No, she wasn't wearing the dress in context instead wore a different dress she bought specifically for her birthday.   
She started crying and yelling. She told me that I was financially abusing her. She also said that after the birth of our son she had put on a lot of weight and it was difficult for her to find a dress that looks good on her and that I should support her instead of being a mega jerk which made me feel bad and had me thinking AITA for not supporting her and getting her a present?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852389,public,top,self,AITA for not buying my wife a birthday gift?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc2p3s/aita_for_not_buying_my_wife_a_birthday_gift/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

My parents instilled in us that money doesn't grow on trees and we should learn how to spend it wisely. So, I was able to save a decent amount of money in my adulthood.

One time my cousin asked for help and she borrowed $5,000 to pay for her debt. You know to typical cycle of debt, borrowing money from one person to pay the debt to another person. Since she is my cousin, I lend her the money on the condition that she should pay it in 36 months with interest. She agreed and promised to pay it back. However, she asked me not to tell her father (my uncle).

For the first few months she was able to pay me more than the monthly amortization but because of the pandemic, she stopped sending money. I understood that the pandemic hit us hard financially so I was very lenient. Its been two years now and she only paid about 10% of the total amount, including interest. 

I kept reminding her to pay but she always say that she will once she got the money. Everyone is telling me to inform my uncle about it and he should pay for her daughter's debt. But I don't want to inconvenience my uncle. I also want my cousin to be responsible for her actions.

Later I found out that she has money and spent it to luxurious items and pays for her boyfriend's bills. She really has no intention of paying me back. Because of this, my brother told my uncle about the debt. My uncle was mad at me for not telling him early because now he has to work overtime to pay me back. Even my parents were mad at me for lending my cousin a huge amount of money knowing that she is bad at handling her finances.

So now family gatherings are awkward. My parents don't talk to uncle and aunt. My cousin is already unwelcomed. My relatives are pointing out to me that what I did was very stupid and caused a crack in the family.

I'm I missing something here? I was kind enough to help my cousin. I wasn't pressuring my uncle to pay me back. I think things were blown out of proportion. I'm confused.

During those chiller times I was fine w/ messaging him, and got to know a little more about him + his personality! He seemed like a cool guy, so I did start to gather my feelings. During break it was blatantly obvious that he liked me since everyone basically outed him, so he confessed through messages. My response was smthn along the lines of “at one point I did have feelings for you, that all kinda changed after I realized how I would be in a relationship, but we can continue to get to know each other more.” At the time of his confession I came to the conclusion that I’m “unsure” and maybe this’ll work out? He proceeded to message me non stop and ask to facetime when, at one point, I just decided to make it clear that I have a life and can’t be talking to him all day. I knew that he really wanted to proceed w/ the “get to know eachother more” part, but it was getting annoying, and the whole situation made it feel like he just wanted to rush the whole thing when I BARELY knew this guy. What really irked me was that it was only through messages, he never did anything at school. We had a convo w/ him claiming that I was “playing him” since it didn’t seem like I was making an effort. I responded by saying that I’d rather that everything be irl, since I am more comfortable that way. We agreed to be patient with each other. HE WAS NOT PATIENT. The whole thing that got to me was the fact that he was posting tiktoks and other stuff on his ig cfl that was OBVIOUSLY pointed toward me. They went along the lines of “i wish shed take the hint” or “im being left on delivered but i still love her.” He also posted messages with his friends saying stuff about me so, at this point, I knew that he was making everything VERY. PUBLIC. Even though he did all of this, he accused someone of “leaking” messages between him and I. Again, constantly messaging me and accusing me of being the leaker. I was tired of everything and decided that I can’t talk to this guy anymore. His presence at school even made me uncomfortable, asking people “how do i talk to girls” when I sit right next to them. As a result to this whole situation, he messaged me less, and I barely responded. During the confession I told him that I didnt want to lead him on, since i was kinda dry, and his response was “you can lead me on all you want.” This was basically me trying to make him realize that I wasn’t interested anymore.

Then I remembered he hates his dad and right now he's going in the same direction as his dad who has multiple arrests for theft and dv. So I turned to him and said he needed to stop this shiz and quit acting like his father. The stealing continued it got worse when he started to bring his girlfriend over I was civil to them but started locking my stuff up well a little over a year after the grounding him and his girlfriend started threatening his siblings that they were going to give away the kids pets and accusing us adult with abuse and other heinous acts I had to come home early from work to help the younger kids feel safe after this he said he was moving out so him and his GF came and picked up their stuff and I stood there getting SCREAMED at just horrific things like I deserved to get graped and to lose my daughter 7months pregnant because I'm a fat c word while my boyfriend listened on the phone (he didn't say anything because he didn't want to make things worse) t has brought me back to having the worse mental health issues I can't sleep, eat, and my body hurts so bad I can't get out of bed it has made me physically hurt.

Well we did Thanksgiving without them and mil spent the whole day crying because she just wanted everyone to get along. I'm asking if I'm in the wrong because I feel like I ruined Thanksgiving for her and Christmas is coming should I ignore what the GF said and just do Christmas with them or should I stand my ground and either not go to Christmas myself or them not come again and I have to watch mil cry all Christmas like thanksgiving",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4852378,public,top,self,AITA For telling my nephew he's acting like his father and demanding an apology from his girlfriend before I spend time with them in the same building,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc2kcf/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_hes_acting_like_his/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Overall I don’t want her to *hate* one of the aspects of myself I love the most. I don’t want her to think wearing black clothes is disgusting and I know deep down she loves me the way I am

But my parents refuse to teach her to respect me

Finally

I made the mistake of asking my parents to tell her not to say those things but they said I am the older one and I should just ignore her?

But that really infuriates me because she respects her friends, teachers, and my parents just fine because they discipline her if she starts to disrespect them. But when it comes to her disrespecting me I should just ignore it?

I didn’t say it but I wanted to but this is bad parenting

Since I am the oldest and will be her caretaker in the future after my parents pass, I feel like it’s very important for us both to learn to love and respect each other as we are

I think my parents are sabotaging my relationship with her by not teaching her now to NOT perceive me negatively

Honestly

I just really want the best for us but that will NOT happen until we start accepting our differences

I really do not expect her to behave/respect me without my parents teaching her. I fully understand and blame my parents for not implementing this and practicing this with her

We live across the country from my family, so we usually get excluded from family events but my mom invited me this year. I didn’t realize the invitation hadn’t included Dean and brought him with me.

Before I start, Dean has an “adopted brother”. They found each other as children who needed support and have been inseparable since. His brother and I have gotten very close and I consider him to be my best friend.

We got the baking supplies Dean needed to bake the various things he would be bringing to the dinner and went to the house. As soon as we arrived, my oldest brother was surprised to see him and even commented on it, which we both brushed off. I was put on babysitting duty over my nieces. I had met the older two once and had never met the youngest but still, I had to babysit them. I did my best to watch over them and play dress up, I make a pretty good fairy princess if I do say so myself. But when we were outside I could see my mom, SIL, and her mom interrogating Dean from the kitchen window. When the girls finally had enough and decided to bother their dad, I went to find Dean who told me about some of the questions he had been asked. Highly personal questions like our sex life, his mental health, and his parent's death. I was disgusted but he told me to drop it and just get through dinner.

I was willing to drop it until his answers were used to put him on blast in front of the entire dinner table. The SILs mom told the dinner table about a disgusting rumor she’d heard about Dean and his brother being incestuous. I told them it wasn’t true but it made my blood boil, but he grabbed my hand and told me to eat. I listened, but they didn’t stop. My mother used his mental health diagnosis as a joke. I was beyond pissed and ignored Dean to ask what their problem with him was. My mom outright told me that she had never invited him and that I had brought him without thinking about how that would make them feel. I demanded they tell me how they feel about my husband, and the SILs mom once again brought up the rumor. My mom nodded and said she didn’t feel comfortable around incest. I once again told her that it had never happened. But she once again said she hadn’t invited Dean. I turned to my dad and asked his opinion but he just shrugged. So I picked up everything Dean had made for the dinner and we left.

Dean thinks I did the right thing, and I think I handled the situation to the best of my abilities. But my oldest brother, his wife, her mom, my mom, and my dad think I’m the bad guy and that I need to apologize.

I know, it might seem silly but seeing her so disgusted by me really hurts especially when she never behaved like this before

I remember when I walked in with my first ever *goth* black dress and both my sister’s told me I looked beautiful 

Overall I don’t want her to *hate* one of the aspects of myself I love the most. I don’t want her to think wearing black clothes is disgusting and I know deep down she loves me the way I am

But my parents refuse to teach her to respect me

Finally

I made the mistake of asking my parents to tell her not to say those things but they said I am the older one and I should just ignore her?

But that really infuriates me because she respects her friends, teachers, and my parents just fine because they discipline her if she starts to disrespect them. But when it comes to her disrespecting me I should just ignore it?

I didn’t say it but I wanted to but this is bad parenting

Since I am the oldest and will be her caretaker in the future after my parents pass, I feel like it’s very important for us both to learn to love and respect each other as we are

I think my parents are sabotaging my relationship with her by not teaching her now to NOT perceive me negatively

Honestly

I just really want the best for us but that will NOT happen until we start accepting our differences

I really do not expect her to behave/respect me without my parents teaching her. I fully understand and blame my parents for not implementing this and practicing this with her

I (M23) have been working at a domino’s for 4 months now as a driver.
It took me nearly two years to get this my first paying job and to me things never really went smoothly. I never got any training which I was told I would get and I found it hard to try and fit in. It’s mostly because of my screwed up autistic brain but other things didn’t help such as the fact that most of my coworkers communicate in their own language most of the time and while I personally don’t have a problem with what language a person speaks because it’s not my business it did make me feel left out and I wasn’t brave enough to speak to anyone about how I felt. I feel like the main problem is the lack of communication between the managers and the rest of us. I hoped that when new management came in about two months ago things would improve and initially I felt better about coming to work but I was getting almost no shifts and again I should’ve said something but I didn’t want to come across as pushy or a complainer so I said nothing. The most recent incident came a few hours ago when a coworker posted in our WhatsApp group that they couldn’t come in and asked if someone could cover for them. I immediately said I would do it but a couple minutes after that someone else said they would and then the manager asked the other person to take the shift even though I put my hand up first. I replied to that with these emojis 🤨😒 and the manager immediately laid into me for giving attitude and then told me in a dm that I didn’t get more shifts because I sped too often on deliveries and that they were apparently sick of repeating themselves. I was only ever told once about this. As of 3 days ago she ceased to be the manager at the store I work at and was moved to manage a new store that just opened but she still has control of our roster. I haven’t said anything else about it. I have half a mind to just quit and find another job but given my previous experience with job searching I’m worried it’ll take forever to find another job and I don’t want to go through that pain again.

I NEVER talk to her so in my head I kind of just decided not to get her anything until a few hours later I realized he was indirectly telling me “I’d appreciate it if you got her something” so I later asked him what she would like. He had nothing, and instead told me to ask a friend since “last year she loved the gift he got her”

I paid no mind and instead insisted on bouncing ideas like perfume purses or whatever and he just gave me nothing and again told me to ask his friend. I finally just said you should know more about her than your friend, he still didn’t give me anything.

I finally said alright I’ll get her *thing* and if she doesn’t like it then that’s fine she can throw it out. He didn’t like the idea, FINALLY gave me something to go off of, which was pretty much if it isn’t an expensive brand and fancy she wouldn’t like it and would be creeped out if I got her a stuffed animal.

I just said okay great something to go off of and just asked about a budget, however I don’t feel like I should be required to talk to a friend of his just because he happened to get her something she liked.

Telling me she’d probably like something from a high end brand would have been enough for me yet he didn’t really tell me that until I said I’d get her some dumb toy and suddenly he remembered a key detail that would have been helpful.

So how much of an asshole would I be if my response to him next time he tries to tell me to talk to his friend is going to be “I’m not talking to him so you’re stuck actually having a conversation with me about this”

I then told her i was going to shoot my shot as a joke because we normally make jokes all of the time she told me not to so I said ok.  About an hour later she tells me not to text the girl because she was actually into her and i told her i was fine with that so I didn't text her. Then some time later nancys crush texted me ""hey"" and me trying to keep the conversation short i reply ""hey"" she proceeded to ask me how my day was i replied ""fine and you?"" To be polite because thats how i was raised she replied ""fine"" and we left it at that. this repeated 2 more times over the span of two weeks. One day my friend decides to look through my phone and sees that we have messaged each other and stops talking to me for a day or two, i ask her what was up and she said i was texting her behind her back. So i explained to her the situation that i just wrote about and she told me not to talk to her again so i say ok and stop texting her. A few weeks layer i accidentally send her a snap because im the kind of person to tak a picture and send it to everyone and again my friend goes through my phone and sees i have a snap sending to her and she stops talking to me again. When i explain the full story to her she ""understands"" and tells me to block her so i do. A few days after i block her my friend says she is trying to be more mature so she was trying to distance herself from me because i'm weird. I ask her how and she explains that she thinks i was going afternoon the girl she likes. I explained to her i wasn't and she said i ruined her first ever female crush.

For context, we’ve been together for two years and live together. Back when we met he told me he’d never ask me to marry him (unless it’s out of love) but he’d have to at some point find someone to turn his temporary visa into a green card...whether it’d be out of love or he’d ask someone to do it. Well.. recently he started asking me if I’d do if I’d he needed it and he’d be at risk not having his visa extended (which he is in the next 2y). I was married before and severely abused in it and I never want to get stuck in another abusive marriage. I told him I’d have to think about it whether I’d do it just to help him rather than out of love because we decided we wanted to get married. Mind you, in the past few months he started treating me not as well anymore.. when I bring it up, he’s just gaslighting me. 

Well, recently he started to tell me if I really would love him then I wouldn’t be hesitating and I’d be down to help him. On one side this is manipulation, on the other side, it’s working and I’m wondering whether I should be helping him since I do love him…on the other side, he hasn’t been as good to me and idk if we’d stay together. Though if I end up marrying him I’d have to be stuck with him for a few years until he gets the citizenship. Earlier in the car when it came once again up he told me he feels like the relationship is super ones sided where he does everything while I barely do anhingt… yet I’m the only one cooking most of the time, only one cleaning (he pays half of the cost for a person to come clean every two weeks and thinks it’s enough for him to never move a finger besides that)… in the past I used to do his laundry too but eventually I grew sick of taking care of him while not getting anything in return.

Last whole week we were both really sick, yet I got hit double as hard because I had my period at the same time as the flu. So, on top of having fever and extreme couch with no voice for multiple days I was also in pain and throwing up. He was also having fever on 1-2 of the days and some cough, but went working while I took the days off. So, in the car earlier he started mocking me how I called him on one of those days delirious from high fever and crying how badly I felt and in pain I was…saying I just made it up for him to feel bad…. That just made me kind of rethink the entire marriage thing if I want to get stuck in this..

The only place we didn't check was the room of the 4th housemate. We thought it wouldn't be there because he had washed his clothes more than 1 week before that.

She constantly goes between making digs about my bland wardrobe to making a big deal out of buying me things like coffee, and implying that I should be grateful that she and his father Fred are so generous and can do things like host us over the holidays.

At Thanksgiving, Alex and I said that we were close to finding a venue but the one we were looking at had quoted us $25,000, which we didn't want to pay, not because we didn't have the money but because it was just out of our stated budget. Frida immediately said that of course Alex wouldn't want that since he'd be paying all by himself, and made a show of telling us that she and Fred would pay for the wedding. At the same time, they said that they expected us to get a pre-nup because Alex needed to protect himself and his family in case ""anything happened."" We were going to do one anyway, so we shrugged and agreed.

She looked up everything from my property records to salary scales at my old Big Law firm, and apparently realized that I'm worth nearly as much as she and Fred are.

I didn’t like her at first because she was always trying so hard to be perfect, so I would say some jokes around her that were just mildly racist (she’s mixed black and Asian.) She never reacted or said anything, and she was always trying to be super nice to me (it was annoying sometimes), so I figured she was okay with the jokes. About 6 yrs ago I found out that she posted about me in an online group where non-white people complain about white people. The person who sent me the screenshot was a friend of a friend from college and asked “is this you?” The comment that my SIL left didn’t have my name on it, but she quoted something I said in the past that she felt offended by. I felt angry and attacked and started distancing myself from my SIL. Fast forward to 3 yrs ago and my mom was asking why I seemed like I don’t like my SIL and I told her about the screenshot. My mom freaked out and told my SIL that she was causing conflict and needed to apologize. My SIL tried calling me but I was nervous so didn’t pick up. She then emailed me and said that she wrote that post asking for support because she had nowhere else and that she was more upset that someone in the group broke the privacy policy instead of what she actually wrote. She wasn’t even sorry about how she hurt me at all. I emailed back saying that I felt betrayed that she would gossip about me online and that it’s never appropriate to say negative things about someone even in a private group. She wrote back basically saying that if I don’t want the racist things I say to end up online then I need to stop being racist. I was shocked with how harsh she was, which made me wonder if all those times in the past where she acted “nice” were just fake. She hasn’t spoken to me since and blocked me from all social media. I’ve tried talking to her indirectly and even sent some gifts to her kids. She not only ignores me at family gatherings but acts like she’s shielding her kids from me too.

We live across the country from my family, so we usually get excluded from family events but my mom invited me this year. I didn’t realize the invitation hadn’t included Dean and brought him with me.

Before I start, Dean has an “adopted brother”. They found each other as children who needed support and have been inseparable since. His brother and I have gotten very close and I consider him to be my best friend. 

We got the baking supplies Dean needed to bake the various things he would be bringing to the dinner and went to the house. As soon as we arrived, my oldest brother was surprised to see him and even commented on it, which we both brushed off. I was put on babysitting duty over my nieces. I had met the older two once and had never met the youngest but still, I had to babysit them. I did my best to watch over them and play dress up, I make a pretty good fairy princess if I do say so myself. But when we were outside I could see my mom, SIL, and her mom interrogating Dean from the kitchen window. When the girls finally had enough and decided to bother their dad, I went to find Dean who told me about some of the questions he had been asked. Highly personal questions like our sex life, his mental health, and his parent's death. I was disgusted but he told me to drop it and just get through dinner.

I was willing to drop it until his answers were used to put him on blast in front of the entire dinner table. The SILs mom told the dinner table about a disgusting rumor she’d heard about Dean and his brother being incestuous. I told them it wasn’t true but it made my blood boil, but he grabbed my hand and told me to eat. I listened, but they didn’t stop. My mother used his mental health diagnosis as a joke. I was beyond pissed and ignored Dean to ask what their problem with him was. My mom outright told me that she had never invited him and that I had brought him without thinking about how that would make them feel. I demanded they tell me how they feel about my husband, and the SILs mom once again brought up the rumor. My mom nodded and said she didn’t feel comfortable around incest. I once again told her that it had never happened. But she once again said she hadn’t invited Dean. I turned to my dad and asked his opinion but he just shrugged. So I picked up everything Dean had made for the dinner and we left.

Dean thinks I did the right thing, and I think I handled the situation to the best of my abilities. But my oldest brother, his wife, her mom, my mom, and my dad think I’m the bad guy and that I need to apologize.

I left home when she was 6 and lived far away until she was 22. Our relationship started to get closer then, but circumstances on both sides made that hard still. We both went through breakups and moved in with our parents at the same time when she was 24 and I was 35. I moved away again shortly after that, but in the meantime, she started to withdraw from everyone - friends and family. 

What has followed has been an intense downward spiral that has hurt our entire family emotionally and many of us financially. She told me at the start of it that she was depressed but didn't want any help. Then she started dating a guy who she told me was the only one who could help her. I tried to help and talk to her about getting help herself and not relying on others, but she didn't want to hear it. She stole money from one of our nephews, she cost my parents thousands of dollars for various things, she used my name for something without my knowledge, she got evicted multiple times. She was apparently spending $400/month on weed for her and her unemployed boyfriend (that has to be a shit ton of weed!) and tried to grow mushrooms to pay rent. She abandoned a car my parents gave her and still owned and paid for on the side of the highway and told no one. The list goes on and on.

She has been living with our parents off and on since 2018, and they CONSTANTLY make excuses for her. That's not her fault, but it makes the situation worse. She has said some horrible things to me in the last couple years and we don't talk, although because we make polite noises for 5 minutes once a year, my parents pretend we're okay. They don't listen to my boundaries about my sister and don't set boundaries with her. She seems to find it easiest to not make an effort with anyone. Part of why we don't talk is she told me she didn't want to and I've made it very clear I'm respecting that boundary but am here if she needs me or wants to start talking. 

She's in a fairly messy situation currently and it seems like it's probably quite stressful so I've been hoping I could help. I started by mentioning that to other family and then emailed her to just say I love and care about her and want to help and that we could discuss the other stuff later. She hasn't responded (it's been 6+ weeks) and a few weeks ago my mom said she was claiming she was ""too busy"" to respond but would soon.

I just don't want to try anymore. A big event is coming up for her where large gifts are common and I'd intended to be quite generous, but I just don't know if that's the right call. It just seems like another way to get my heart broken. I'm tempted to stop making any effort at all. I wouldn't refuse to talk to her, but I'm tired of holding the door open. She can open it if she ever wants. I'd like to tell my parents I will not talk about her anymore.

I mean, I know they're making the bread, but the people selling it don't perform any tippable service, they just stand there as you grab a loaf or two and type the charge into the iPad.

I want to support them but they're already charging a high, luxury premium on their goods, and adding a tip elevates that premium to a level I can't really justify spending. I've tipped a few times and always feel ripped off, but when I choose ""no tip"" with the seller standing a foot away from me, I always feel guilty.

I tip generously in all the normal tipping situations, like restaurants, Ubers, barbers, etc. At the farmer's market, no one used to tip (to my knowledge) until the iPads arrived, but now it's awkward and I'm just not sure.

In celebration, one of the players on the other team drove their arm across all of the cups on the table, knocking them all over, then proceeded to go crazy. 

Allowing a redemption shot for the losing team is a standard in beer pong, and something that was followed in the previous games we played. I immediately began arguing that this should lead to overtime. The other team and the spectators voted that it should should simply be reset and allow us our redemption shot.

My reasoning for forcing OT was as follows: 1.) At any other time in a game of beer pong, knocking over your own cup means it is taken off the table. Just because this was before a redemption shot does not change this. 2.) Knocking over all of the cups is a party foul. This sort of behavior should not be condoned.

I think he just hadn’t eaten much that day so is feeling the alcohol more than normal and I  planned to head home soon to get him something to eat.

He says he’s going to the restroom and I say okay and that I’ll wait outside for him. He comes out and I asked if he’s paid his tab. He says he “doesn’t need to” I say uhhhh, yeah you do. I go in and pay for him. I look at the receipt and it said the first round was comped but the second round wasn’t. Total was like $20, not a big deal.

We get home and he starts FLIPPING OUT saying I made him look bad and because of me he’s going to lose his job. I told him me paying the tab was better than the staff going to his dad, who is doing business with them, and saying he walked out on his bill. He says he would have just handled it.

I live with my boyfriend and he was away at the time. 

After dinner, I got dressed into some lounge clothes before we began to watch a movie. She asked if I had any clothes for her to wear, she came wearing a tight fitting top and leather jeans. She is also large than I am so my clothes would not fit her. I called my bf to ask if she could wear an old t shirt and lounge shorts of his that I found.

He said it was fine. Maybe 5-10 minutes later she came out the bathroom, and sat next to me on the couch and asked if she could get a bag for her clothes. I got a bag and noticed she put her bra  panties in the bag too. I didn't say anything. It just found it very weird. I have big girls so I understand the need to take a bra off at the end of the day but panties too?

A few minutes into the movie she started asking questions about the clothes accompanied with sexual remarks about her body. 

I told her the shirt was an old shirt of his from a few years back and she said verbatim ""I love how the shirt feels against my skin, it's like so soft, does he wear this often?"" I told her yeah its one of his workout shirts and she replied with ""wow, I feel so connected to him."" and laughed. I brushed it off and didn't think much about it.

A few minutes later she said ""Whew, my pus\*y can finally breathe I had that thong on for so long, his shorts fit so nice on my ass, but the front is giving me a fucking wedgie in my pus\*y, it's like he knew they would do this to me hahaha"" 

At that moment I was fuming , I spent time with this girl and she never was like this. She doesn't know my bf personally but has seen pictures of him. To my knowledge she is not a super sexual person but then again, I've known her for less than a year. The entire interaction made me very uncomfortable. 

I don't know if she was trying to make me aware that she liked my bf or that she wanted to make me jealous as a joke or was actually getting aroused by wearing my bf's clothes without underwear. 

I told her that I was ready for bed and she should leave and then later after I had time to think, I told her I didn't want to speak anymore and blocked her. Before I blocked her she said she knew I might have been uncomfortable and she said that's just her personality but I refuse to let her come near me or my bf, I don't trust her. 

She changed out of the clothes before she left and I have thought of throwing them away but my boyfriend asked where they were last night, I didn't tell him about it yet, it happened Friday night.

Should I tell him? Was I overreacting? I did not curse her out but it made me angry.

My partner (45M, also autistic) would be only too happy to never spend time with my family again, but he feels obligated to go to family events because my family are less shitty to me when he's around. He is very supportive and doesn't put any pressure on me not to see them, but I know he would be relieved to have a permanent break from my family.

I said I was sorry but I wouldn't be able to finish my order (I had already given my address, but I hadn't mentioned payment methods) and said goodnight to the cashier/server.
I searched online for another pizza place and placed my order at their website (everything was automated and I didn't talk with any servers this time). Cue my mom and I waiting for over an hour for the pizza to arrive. The delivery guy arrives and she goes to collect and pay for the pizza (I told her what the price was and explained the whole debacle with the other pizza place). We eat it, it's very nice, and I remark how it's very similar to the pizza of the other pizzeria (neither the box nor the delivery guy had any markings of the pizzeria's name).
When we finish eating, we hear another delivery person at our door. Sure enough, it's another pizza. I tell my mom to refuse the delivery because it must be from the original pizza place who must have not cancelled my order correctly. She goes out, doesn't have the heart to refuse the order, and pays for the second pizza. That's when I see the new box it's from the second pizzeria, not the first, and realize that the pizza we had eaten was the cancelled one. My mom is upset with me because she had to pay for two pizzas, and I'm upset with her for not having noticed that the price from the first pizza was off (and thus noticed that it was not the order we placed last).
I reach for my phone and send some messages to the first pizzeria, angry that they had not cancelled my order, that we had two pay for two pizzas, and saying that their service was terrible.

The only places my family has to drive me to and from is school and my mother's house on weekends since my parents are separated. I'm disabled {physically and mentally} so I don't like leaving the house much, and thought this wouldn't be too big a big deal.

My family keeps pushing me to get a license even if I don't use it in case of emergency, but I know if I did they'd force me to drive. Even my older sister has stepped in and tried to convince me to take the test. I understand that it must be frustrating to have to drive around someone who's pretty much an adult, but even ignoring the mental problems, if I have a {suspected} seizure while driving that could be dangerous for everyone involved. I've explained my concerns to them, but they insist. Even when I tried to compromise by saying I'd get it if I was cleared by a doctor first for the suspected seizures they still insisted on getting it now.

They threatened to just schedule me for the test anyways, and I threatened to just fail it on purpose if they did. They got really upset and told be I was being selfish and entitled. I told a friend about the situation and they agreed with my family that I'm being selfish about their time, and should stop making excuses.

We live on the east coast but are both from the southern United States, and Alex's family is essentially royalty in their hometown. His parents have a very visible local business, sponsor kids' sports teams, tithe heavily in church, and have their own jingle and commercials. Alex's mother Frieda decided right away that I'm a gold digger, because I come from a tiny town that she refers to as ""a patch of dirt in the middle of nowhere,"" and my government salary (which is public record) is less than half of Alex's, though we're both government attorneys. She constantly goes between making digs about my bland wardrobe to making a big deal out of buying me things like coffee, and implying that I should be grateful that she and his father Fred are so generous and can do things like host us over the holidays.

&amp;nbsp;

At Thanksgiving, Alex and I said that we were close to finding a venue but the one we were looking at had quoted us $25,000, which we didn't want to pay, not because we didn't have the money but because it was just out of our stated budget. Frida immediately said that of course Alex wouldn't want that since he'd be paying all by himself, and made a show of telling us that she and Fred would pay for the wedding. At the same time, they said that they expected us to get a pre-nup because Alex needed to protect himself and his family in case ""anything happened."" We were going to do one anyway, so we shrugged and agreed. Frieda immediately began telling everyone in town that she and Fred were paying for the whole wedding, and people keep coming up to me with thinly-disguised sympathy to say how nice it must be to have a ""dream wedding"" due to Frieda's generosity.

&amp;nbsp;

Alex and I engaged counsel and have been passing our pre-nup between ourselves and our lawyers. Frieda pestered Alex about it so much that he finally told her the holdup is with my counsel, because my assets are more complicated to deal with than his. Even though he's told her before that I'm not a gold digger and didn't need his money, it apparently didn't sink in until now. She looked up everything from my property records to salary scales at my old Big Law firm, and apparently realized that I'm worth nearly as much as she and Fred are.

Me (40f) my partner (48m) have been together for 5 years

Adulting sucks but my partner can’t do the basics 
My partner earns 6 figures, at least 5 times what I do
We don’t live together and we both own (mortgaged) our own homes
He can’t manage his finances, bills are always in default, always ignoring the phone when it rings as he thinks it’s service providers looking for payments, he’s always broke but is never short of finding money to drink or gamble (I also drink)
All of our time together is spent at my place, my choice I hate his house and it very messy and in saying that it’s probably only 4-5 sleepovers a fortnight, which I cut down from almost very night a year ago because I’d had enough of wifey duties with a girlfriend benefits 
In the last 3 months he has started contributing $50 for bills a month- the last 5 years he didn’t and he spent 80% of his time at mine (he works remotely) 
I cook he’s made me a meal maybe 10 times in 5 years, I clean, I drive everywhere (we spend most days together)my petrol, my insurance, my car payment and servicing costs, he doesn’t clean up after himself, uses my son’s deodorant/ personal care products, I pay for everything 
His car is rubbish and he doesn’t drive it beyond just to my house
I feel like the adult in this relationship with finances but I have asked him to go to financial counseling to help his situation, I refuse to be involved in helping him fix it as he’s not truthful with his debt so I think a professional is a better option
We do not have anything jointly owned and I will always keep it this way
His money is his business even tho I sometimes let him work for my business and pay him cash when he’s crying poor

My husband (30M), isn't really keen with the idea of godmother but let it go as she's my best friend from HS. She really insisted to have a gender reveal party, so she already has set up a plan for months so far. She'd sometime ask my husband for ideas, but most of the time she's the one to decide for the party. And I haven't touched my finger into the planning at all.

What I didn't know is there had been a miscommunication between the two, and she'd gone and asked people around her but me about my husband's input and how she should be the one paying for everything. Mind you, my husband HATES the idea of asking people to pay for anything or money in general, and he is willing to pay for most of the party, like food and decorations! But in my friend's mind of understand is that she's to pay for EVERYTHING, when she and another friend of ours (31F) are going to split the bill for the decorations only.

Because at one point of the conversation, the party would be held for me and my manager (32F) who is also pregnant, and this was only at the start and before planning the party. So my husband and I still thought until the start of this week, that the party is for 2 people. And my husband is bad with names, so he asked Annie if my manager would make any input towards the food. Considering the party is for 20 people. And he referred to my manager as ""the other girl"". But the party is only for me which we didn't know of.

It's starting to bug me quite a lot that she'd gone and asked people around her for ideas, and she called me on my bday this week to say she's withdrawing from planning, as it seems my husband had better idea. When he had NEVER made any input for ideas beside the food when I had asked him.

He is currently feeling bad and guilty (even though he hadn't done anything bad), since she's going around and ask people, even her mom and our other friend, for opinions.

I'm at the point that I just want to cancel the party, let it go and reimburse her for the decorations, as I'm kinda pissed she didn't ask me, and the doubt I'm starting to have against her. She's truly my best friend, but I'm feeling like she's putting a strain on our friendship with the way she's doing. And it doesn't really help me how she kept asking me how our financial situation is since we're looking for an apartment, and that I should consider it's under my name and not split in half between my husband and I.

I (28f) have a friend (24f) that I met some 5 years ago. She was living in a really unhealthy and abusive family situation. When my husband and I bought a house, I had an opportunity to give her a place to stay and get on her own feet. She's been here since March. 

She does not contribute to household expenses. She bought her own groceries maybe three times, then quit her job. She says she's in too much pain and can't work anymore(even though we met at work). She wants to get on disability for her chronic illness...but has not taken any steps to get that. So she basically sits around all day and does nothing all day every day. I didn't bring her here to live with us forever, I expected her to get her shit together and live her own life. We're just supposed to be a helping hand. And yeah, she agreed to this plan. It was known from the start what this was meant to be.

Here's where I feel like the asshole: she smoked when we met. When she quit her job and didn't have money anymore, I quickly got tired of buying her cigarettes. More or less, I forced her to quit because I just stopped buying them. Since then, she's just been eating heaps of sugar. Literally, we have gone through 4 bags of sugar since July. My husband bought us a really good bottle of pure maple syrup for Christmas morning last year, and it was mostly full until she apparently discovered it last week. He found the bottle in the trash can and was really upset. We obviously don't normally go through syrup like that on our own, so when syrup popped up on the dry-erase grocery list in our kitchen, I was mad. I wiped it off and didn't buy any. It's been like three weeks and she constantly writes syrup, ""choci chips"", jolly ranchers, etc, on the list. And I keep erasing it. So she sees me do it tonight and starts crying that she has an addiction, she needs sugar to replace her cigarettes and I'm being mean to her.

I do feel bad. I love her and recognize she has trauma that makes her very immature. But at the same time, beggars can't be choosers bro. Get up and get a part time job, you'll be able to buy whatever. 

I'm trying really hard to be patient with her, I am. Because I struggle with family and trauma, too, and it was really hard to get on my feet with no help. In that, though...if someone had given me free housing? I would have not been sitting there crying about the free food. She's welcome to whatever's in the house, it's not like we're starving her. 

I don't know. I've never smoked or drank really (because they're habits I knew I couldn't afford) so I don't have first hand experience with withdraw. I did force her to quit smoking.
