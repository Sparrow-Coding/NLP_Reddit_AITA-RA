So I (19m) am turning 20 in January and my parents want to celebrate this by inviting my entire family (mom and dad's side) out to a restaurant to eat brunch. Both sides combined we are around 20 people. 

Now, I'm not a big fan of celebrating my birthday but my mother has convinced me to ""let the family celebrate me"" at this brunch, and she wants this birthday to be a big deal because my 18th birthday was ""ruined"" my covid. So I'm lucky it's ""only"" my family that's invited. 

My cousins are, of course, starting to date and stuff. I've met two of my older cousins' girlfriends a bunch of times and they've been to multiple family gatherings. They've been dating my cousins' for years. And now one of my younger cousins are dating a guy. They've been dating for half a year, but I don't know him and I have never met him. Like, I have absolutely no idea who this guy is.  

I'm of course going to invite the two girlfriends of my two older cousins' to my birthday, but I've told my parents that I don't want to invite my younger cousin's boyfriend, because I've never met him and I honestly find it a bit weird to invite a guy who doesn't know me and probably doesn't even know I exist. 

My parents say that since I'm inviting my two other cousins' girlfriends, I have to invite the boyfriend too. And if I don't want to invite him, I can't invite the others because it's ""discriminating"" (don't know if this is the right word, sorry). They won't accept my reason for not wanting to invite the boyfriend (We literally haven't met each other), and say that I'm splitting the family apart because of it.

I don't understand why it's such a big deal since I don't know him. Like, correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like since it's my 20th and last ""big"" birthday, I should be allow to only want my family and people I know to be there? I don't know if I'm completely out of my mind for wanting that?

So she’s never had a boyfriend and never been in love. When she’s drunk she tells me she’s never been in love and I have had my fair share of bad relationships (with cheating and everything) and I’ve been cheated on. So I feel like I’m not the best person to rant to about love or relationships. I’ve been single for 3 years now. We’re obviously in two different mindsets and I can’t help but want to bring her down to earth fast whenever she goes into these depressive like states about not having a boyfriend or falling in love. 

Last night out of nowhere she told me that this guy she matched with two weeks ago, she drunk called him and left him a voice mail , apparently he said she was too emotional and she was upset that he said that. 

This guy the day before, she told me this guy is 33, unemployed, lives at home. Got a DUI the year prior. And has slept w/ 52 women. When she mentioned she doesn’t want to sleep with anyone right away he was turned off. Then he mentioned she’s thick and he likes thick women. She felt offended by the fact he called her out saying she’s thick. There’s a whole bunch of other red flags . 

I had to tell her that there are a ton of men out there that are 33 years old, have nice jobs, have a place of their own.  I had to tell her repeatedly to not talk to him anymore. 
She said “but he’s so hot and has tattoos and he works out” it feels like I’m talking to a 5 year old who really wants a toy even though she knows it’s bad for her 

I then asked her how long have you been talking to him ? Thinking it’s been atleast a month or more. It’s only been two weeks she says. 
I asked her why or how do you fall for these men in such a short period of time (because I’ve seen this happen before with other guys she met on dating apps) she says she has daddy issues or maybe it’s due to her zodiac sign. She says she falls hard. But she hasn’t even met them in person yet! 

A part of me wants her to get a boyfriend or get married so she stops whining to me about these random men she suddenly starts falling for hard. And I want her to fall in love so she can stop obsessing over it. 
I think bc of my bad experiences I can’t really offer her any good advice. I don’t know what advice she wants when she tells me of these guys that are clearly not good for any women.

I end up literally sleeping on the floor cuz they're on the couch &amp; being woken up multiple times by him screaming and yelling. Finally I wake up at 4am &amp; leave. I text friend saying I had a lovely time &amp; hope he has a pleasant day. 

Fight happens where he tells me I was rude to his friends because I didn't make small talk with them, I did. That it was my own fault that I didn't play games because I went upstairs, that they kept asking me what was wrong with me all night to which he replied I don't know she's just like that &amp; I'm a horrible selfish person. 

I messaged his friends on Facebook, told them I was sorry I ruined their evening &amp; that I thought they knew I had dental work done that made talking hard, which I'm sure they noticed. This lead to him calling me a vindictive horrible pos. I was so selfish bc I didn't think nor ask about what he was going to do with his dog this week because he had accepted a ton of extra hours (before even asking if I could help out this week) &amp; that he never wanted to hear from me again.

Recently she hasn’t given me a break and every time I see her she calls me bad words, hits me, and throws stuff at me. 

Every time she does this whenever my sisters there (her mom) I tell her to watch her child. She reluctantly does but her child doesn’t stop. It’s not like I don’t like my niece or anything because I used to love taking care of her or protecting her from her mom when she would be getting a spanking. I don’t know what I have done to get her to start acting like this towards me and do know how to stop.

Today a day after my sisters birthday I was in my room getting ready and putting on my shoes because we were going to go out and eat, when my niece comes and throws a little hugs juice at me and gets juice on me. I was upset and mad that she got juice on me, and my sister saw what had happened and didn’t do anything about it, so I grabbed the empty juice container and threw it at my nice.

When I did that my sister got upset at me and I closed the door to my room because I didn’t feel like dealing with her and she had said she didn’t want to go to her birthday dinner anymore because I threw juice and slammed the door on them and everyone at the house got upset. I didn’t even slam the door on them.

 A couple minutes after that my mom came in and started to physically attack me and scratched me, slapped me, and held me down. I couldn’t get her off and I didn’t want to fight her but when I tried to move she would put her whole weight on me and I was genuinely scared of her. Never have I been this scared of my mom and I screamed for anyone to come and help me get her off of me because I couldn’t breath, but no one came. 

I couldn’t stop shaking for a bit and I screamed at everyone who was going to the dinner and got into some serious arguments and my sister took away the iPad she gave me around 2 years ago (that she gave me when I wasn’t in my best spot and it helped me get rid of a lot of things). My mom forced me to still go to the dinner and I didn’t have a choice but to go.

And I don’t mean upset like I was enraged. I’m not even mad. I’m just… hurt.

I (22M) have been in a long distance relationship with my GF (23F) for a little over a year now and have known each other for two, this short length of knowing each other being a reason why I think I’m in the wrong.

So, my birthday was this past Monday and I was really excited about it, especially being able to spend it with her since it was on a Monday, so my family was busy that day and we couldn’t do anything to celebrate. But… she wound up forgetting and I spent most of the day celebrating alone since she was also working that day. And yes, both last year, the year before, and even earlier this year when the topic of B-days arose, I told her that it was my B-Day and what the exact date of it was.

But here’s the thing that makes me think I’m in the wrong: She has a habit of forgetting B-Days and I KNOW she has a habit of forgetting B-Days. Not only that, but the second anniversary of when we met was 10 days before my B-Day, the first anniversary of our relationship was a week before my B-Day, her mother’s B-Day is today and Thanksgiving hadn’t happened yet. There were a lot of important dates near each other and that might’ve contributed to my B-Day slipping through the cracks for her.

And I asked some family members about it, and they were completely nonchalant about it, thinking that it wasn’t a big deal. Which again, tells me it doesn’t matter. But despite all of that… I don’t know, SOMETHING in me can’t help but feel hurt that she forgot.

We used to work at same restaurant and became very close over the two years I worked there. It was never a full blown relationship, but I would consider it a deep friendship.

This was about three years ago.

Flash toward to today, and he now works at this popular gay club in my city. I rarely go out, but when I do, he always lets me in for free. Never any of my friends, though. This is where the problem lies.

I have two friends who I go out with. For context, they are Hispanic and black, respectively, while I am white and so is J. They think it’s racist that J lets me in for free and they have to pay. They think we should all be let in for free. This doesn’t make sense to me considering how long I’ve known him, where’s they’ve never met him. Plus, I don’t know the club’s rules for waiving cover charges; maybe he’s only allowed a few each night. They’ve now accused me of being racist for defending him and now they’re mad. So AITA?

The background is that I and my friends are Chinese and there is a story happening in China these days, one woman break up with her boyfriend and then abort her 5-month embryo (or her child, whatever you want to call it. I don't want to involve politics), packaged the body of this child in a box and send it to her ex-boyfriend's house. Her boyfriend's family was crying when they saw it.

This woman's ex signed a prenuptial agreement with her and it treat her very unequally (economically). Her ex's parents also treat her badly. The reason her ex's parents treat her badly is that they think she cannot break the relationship because she is having a kid inside of her body.

So when I saw this news, I said this woman has some mental problem and her behavior is very inhumane. I told my friend she just wants to her ex suffer (although her ex is shit) and then she uses this child (or embryo) as a tool. I know her ex's family is pure shit but her behavior is still inhumane and super immoral. My friend disagree with me and said I should never judge a woman who did an abortion. They have their reasons.

I told my friend I am not talking about if she has the right (in China abortion is not a political thing and everyone can do an abortion), I am saying what she did is wrong. If she has some personal problem that she cannot have this kid then I will not judge her, but what she did is just use this kind embryo (or child) as a tool, it degreed human's life and dignity, and all she uses this tool is to let others suffer. Although I don't disagree that they deserve the suffering, but this kind of behavior is outrageous and insane. I told my friend if a person put a 5-month fetus which already looked like a real human and almost can survive outside of the uterus in a box and sends it to others to let them suffer, this fetus even containing her own DNA, then that person is definitely insane and needs to visit a psychologist. I said things like ""she proves she has no conscience for doing this kind of inhumane and disgusting behavior"" to my friend, My friend strongly disagree with me and we had a bad quarrel because I judged that woman.

Finally, my friend and I made a deal, my friend thinks because I was grow up in China, the way I think is affected by Chinese culture and politics. My friend told me to ask Americans or other people from developed countries to see what I think are Asshole-like ideas. My friends and I agree that the average American shows more sympathy to others, especially women. I want to ask if am I the asshole for judging and commenting on that specific woman's behavior?

She is best friends with his cousin. She’s been seeing her boyfriend(22m) who we will call B on and off for seven years. Their relationship is toxic, she calls me crying with the usual rants include his sketchy behavior with other women and his poor treatment of her (ignoring her for days, screaming at her, hanging up, etc). She has never told me to not give her advice, and is the one who brings him up almost every time.

A few days ago, he told her to tell me to look at FB since I’m not active on it typically. I’ll admit I probably could have been more open-minded. He was asking for me to come to him if had had suggestions for his relationship and I asked him if he was being passive aggressive. He responded he was asking for advice. I told him I didn’t really believe that he’d meant that but that even so anything I could tell him would just be things his gf has repeatedly told him already so if he wants to know how to fix anything he needs to just listen to what she says. After that he  
-he demanded I give him actual advice or leave him alone. I reminded him that he messaged me and that the advice I’ve already given him was as good as it was going to get.
-Called me manipulative 
-He said my advice was toxic to F and that I need to stop giving it to her because it’s pissing him off

I just repeated what I had said and told him my observations from our conversation alone (controlling, cannot take criticism)

he then began using Facebook information to try and scare me. He asked me if he intimidated me. Then he sent me these messages

“You assume a lot. That’s what gets people in my profession killed.”
“It’s a good thing I serve and protect the citizens. Don’t become a communist though, I have no mercy for them.”
“Anyway you can take the moral high ground I don’t care, but if you accuse me of cheating, not caring about her or even a whisper that I’m no good for you I’ll have a very stern talking to with you” to this I asked if that was supposed to be a threat to which he replied “BAM winner, I know you would say that but no it’s not a threat for legal reasons”

My fiancé served in the military and was upset by it, so he typed out a tidbit about how using his uniform to try and intimidate me was disrespectful to it. Never got hostile. This sent B into a rage because he accused me of being anti-military, disrespecting his brothers and sisters in arms and that he wouldn’t put up with it. I responded that I have respect for the uniform, just not him. Then the conversation ended after he kept calling me names and told me to fuck off.

I sent the screenshots to F. She defended him saying that he was genuinely asking for advice and didn’t mean anything he said as a threat.

We are a big group and my birthday is the busiest holiday week of the year, so I asked them to commit. Lucy (33, F) replied yes, with her BF.

The cheapest decent places would have cost 180 $ per person, and were not great. I found a luxurious villa, and decided to pay half of it myself and ask everyone for 170 $ pp no matter how long they stayed / if they had transportation costs / special diet... I checked first with two friends who don’t make a lot that they could afford it. I told everyone who had committed the conditions and asked them to tell me within 1 week if they couldn’t come, as I had 1 week to cancel the booking.

Lucy asked me if they could come for 1 night and pay less, as they lived nearby. Half of the group lives nearby, that’s why I had picked that location, so they wouldn’t have to pay for tickets. So I replied the price was fixed.

After the deadline, she told me that they decided not to participate, but would still come on my birthday, for the whole day; I could tell her if I wanted some “financial compensation” for them using the pool.

I got mad and told her she should have replied before the deadline, so she apologized and said if her decision put me financially in trouble, she would pay. I declined: paying their part does not put me “in trouble”.

However, I told her I thought what she did was selfish. If everyone living nearby had let the people living far away to pay, they would not have been able to afford it, so there would have been no weekend at all.

She got mad and said she’d never ask a couple to spend 300+$ for her birthday, that she was not gonna pay to stay close to her place, that it’s not her fault if other people live far away and need to stay the nights while she doesn’t, that it’s mine for wanting such a luxurious villa, and that if I’m not happy with her coming for the day maybe she shouldn’t come at all.

So I told her she should not come at all.

For a long time she had a low pay and tried to not pay her part. It was little things. Like we visited a place where you had to pay 1$ to take pictures, she offered to be the one shooting as her camera was great, split the 1$, and she would share the pics with me. I replied I actually wanted to take some pics myself, she said sure and did not use her camera at all, so I paid the 1$, took the pics then shared them with her; but she never offered to split it. 

It was really small amounts everytime, and she was regularly down and I didn’t want to press her head further down, so every time this kind of things happened I wouldn’t say anything and assumed she would pay her share when her finances improved.

Now she makes good money, travels a lot, has a great apartment… I was genuinely happy for her, but if she behaves selfishly, I’ll now call her on it.

In October, My 25m friend 24f came from out of state to visit  since she moved away at the beginning of the year to move into her parents house to help take care of them and the kids. We dated for a few months. Altogether She owes me $1205 from a trip we both took this year. We both agreed that we would be splitting the Airbnb and events on the trip. I booked everything on my credit card and she said she couldn’t send me the money yet because she had to wait for something but said it would only take a week or 2 but it never came. After the trip she asked me for some money for her stay at a hotel because her and her family got into a really big fight and they kicked her out of the house, I was on the phone when this occurred so I know this is true. The hotel was getting expensive so she asked for money so she could stay longer. 

We talked and I told her how I loaned money to a friend b4 and she never paid me back so it is not easy for me to do and gives me great anxiety. So I asked her to “make a contract” with me to give me some relief saying she will pay it back through text messages. The contract for the first part of the money reads

“I will be sending you $800 for your hotel stay. When can I expect the money to be paid back?”

“Hey “OP”, I will be paying you back $800 over the next few months in increments $100 starting after July
I “her” agree to this statement”

The full $800 was not for the hotel. The other half was for her to rent a car so she can do her job as a lyft driver or something.

The day after I give her the $800 she posts on Facebook her buying a brand new car, 2022 Toyota Camry. Her posts says she didn’t put anything down on it.

2 weeks before she comes She moves back in with her family and things go bad again. Her family is really bad to her for no reason. She goes stays with a friend at an apartment and her car gets towed. $400 to get it out. A week after that she gets a speeding ticket and they find weed in her car. I think the ticket for that was over $350.

She drives over 800 miles to come visit. we have a good time. She heads back. I figured since it’s been over 3 months since she was supposed to start making her payments and she clearly has money to spend if she can drive that far mainly for her niece’s birthday party. Go out to party, she should be able to know when she can start paying me back my money now that she’s got her trip out the way.

Here’s how I asked *text messages

“Hey ***, we need to start those payments for the money you owe me. The total is $1,205. When can I expect your first payment, and how much can you send me a month?

Her: Morning “OP”, I don't like this approach. Because you already know what's been going on and I haven't ducked nor dodged you so why start the text message like that.

Around this time last year my parents asked me if I wanted to come over for Christmas. I told them sure, I live abroad so I don't see them very often. The plan was for me to arrive December 22nd and go back on on January 7.

Our relationship was very rocky when I was a child due to my dad's mental health and anger issues, but he's in therapy for that now. I'm in therapy as well for the diagnosed PTSD that his issues have given me. This will be relevant later.

I bought myself a round-trip train ticket ($150) for the long ride home as I don't have a car and have really bad plane anxiety. Around December 15th my mom called and asked me if I could bring back some of those cookies that she loves and I tell her of course. I decided to get them on the 21st so they're still super fresh upon arrival. I also bought some breads and sweets for my siblings. The total came down to about $40. I'm a student and due to my chronic illness and heart condition I can't work a lot so money is tight and I had to take some money out of my savings for this to afford all of it, but I didn't mind.

Fast forward to the evening of the 21st. I'm on the phone with my dad telling him that I got the cookies mom asked for and that I have to get up at 7 to get to the train station and that I'm super excited to see them again. 

Out of nowhere he tells me that won't be necessary because he and my mom are leaving for some island in the Carribean the next day. I ask him how long they've been planning this for and he told me that they decided two days prior. I asked him if they could cancel because I thought we'd already established that I would be coming over and he says no. He then says I should be more understanding because mom has fibromyalgia and the cold makes her pain worse and the heat will make it better.

After that I called my mom and I'm going to be honest here, I said some really unkind things and called her a selfish bitch (among other things) for making me spend nearly $200 and have me go through all that effort only for them cancel on me last-minute. I demanded an apology and a full pay-back of all the money. Apparently that hurt her feelings and she hasn't talked to me all year. My dad then called me and said that he had a talk with his therapist and that his therapist told him ignore my angry outburst and not give in to my demands because, quote, ""people with PTSD can't think rationally"". 

This morning I woke up to a text from my dad asking me if I want to come over for the holidays, no cancellations this time. I told him to fuck off until they both apologize for cancelling on me last year, for the thing he said about my PTSD, and to pay me back for last year. He refused to and gave me a written lecture that I'm just holding just a grudge and should get over it because it was, quote, ""a misunderstanding"" and ""we're family"", but I absolutely refuse to and I told him to not text me again unless it's an apology.

I was working 15+ hour days 6 days a week. Wasn’t ever going out because I moved to this city for this job and never had any free time to make any friends.

They promised they did everything possible to protect me from it and that they were scared to tell me and how I would react. Personally, I could deal with this situation because I feel like I would do anything for the person I love. I know there are ways to protect someone in an intimate relationship with someone with an STD like this. But, what has bothered me is that it’s taken 6 months for them to tell me this. It’s adding on to the things that I’ve been seeing that shows me they aren’t emotionally mature and lack personal integrity. I even feel like if they hadn’t been drinking, then I would have never found out about this situation. With it being the holidays, I’ve been too busy to even get an STD test so I don’t even know if I contracted it or not.

Okay this is a bit messy but please stick with me.   


I (26f) have am my mom's (54f) child and only daughter to my dad who she met after breaking up with my uncle ""Bob"" (53m) who had cheated on her with my aunt ""Jane"" (51f) and was pressured into marriage by their parents finding out Jane was pregnant with my cousin ""Amelia"" (32f). I'm not sure about all the details but from what I've gathered Bob started sleeping with Amelia because she was willing while my mom wanted to wait until marriage. My grandparents were very religious and traditionalists. 

My mom was devastated and cut Bob and Amelia out of her life for years and went LC with my grandparents after they retried pushing for reconciliation after Amelia was born. Eventually, my mom met my dad and got engaged and I guess by that point she was truly over Bob because she invited him, Jane, Amelia, and their son ""Bob Jr"" (28m) to the wedding. Jane was bummed out that she couldn't be a bridesmaid or that my mom made my god sister her flower girl instead of Amelia and there was an argument. Before the wedding there was a sit down between my parents, Bob, Jane, and my maternal grandparents where my mom said that she was willing to have some type of relationship with all of them but only under the condition that they all agreed to never speak about the past again. 

From that day on me and my cousins all grew up together and never knew the truth and I thought we were all one big happy family. So I was surprised my mom wasn't as sympathetic as I thought she should be when it turned out that Bob had been cheating on my aunt multiple times with different women. They later divorced after Bob had gotten one of flings pregnant. 

Bob moved away and barely saw my cousins but he always sent me cards, presents, and messages. I also didn't find out until later but he actually paid for my college in secret so I didn't have any debt while Amelia and Bob only got partial help from him. 

Recently my uncle Bob passed away and his lawyer requested that I attend the will reading and I went to more so support my cousins. I was floored when I realized that I got almost everything. That's when the secret came out and it was revealed that Bob never got over my mom, was still in love with her, and always as me as the daughter that should've been his. 

It took me getting a DNA test to prove that I was my father's daughter to convince everyone that my mom never slept with Bob, and during that time my cousins and Bob's other children said some really nasty things to me. After some time had cooled off I looked at the total value of my share of around $400,000 (after fees) and agreed to just give 50% to my cousins. They weren't happy and felt that as Bob's legal children they should get EVERYTHING, wouldn't hear about accepting any less, and called me a greedy witch with a b.

First incident: One night AC and I were having dinner with my  boyfriend, who'd brought their dog. BF's dog tried to play with AC, who up until that point had never hinted at being uncomfortable around dogs, and accidentally scratched them (it didn't even bleed but I don't doubt it hurt). AC started panicking and insisting we go to the hospital because he could have contracted rabies from the dog. Even when BF ensured AC the dog was healthy, fully vaccinated and Greece had been rabies-free for years AC wouldn't calm down. We took them to the hospital hoping the doctors there would reassure them everything was OK, but they were getting increasingly paranoid and treatened to sue everyone for malpractice. AC got referred to a psychiatrist after mentioning they had recieved rabies prophylaxis multiple times for similar incidents but they left AMA.

Though I sympathized with ACs situation I was tired and pissed because I had to stay at the hospital interpreting for them all night. I went to work with no sleep and I had to deal with them thinking they had rabies for weeks which resulted in sleepless nights and multiple doctor's visits. I tried to get them to visit a mental health professional to no avail and at the point of AITA incident I was sick of the whole thing.

AITA incident: One day we were walking home after running errands and something flew 5 meters away from us (pretty sure it was some bird), AC became convinced it was a bat which bit them and insisted we go to the hospital again. I knew they weren't going to get anything done at the hospital but I agreed. Doctors got a good laugh and sent us home, he had a breakdown saying in the US he would have gotten the shot and begged me to take him to a different hospital. I wasn't about to go through the same story again so I took them to an other hospital, abandoned them there even though they spoke no greek and I booked them a ticket on the next flight home (which was worth it's weight in gold) which I mailed to them and told my BF to get them their suitcase because I didn't want to see them. I didn't answer any of AC's calls after I left. Vacation was over.

I have been bugging him about it and keep asking him, and he has just continually refused to handle it. He said he would text the landlord when I asked him to, as I feel that that’s probably the right way to go about it, and then he didn’t. When I asked him about it in person he said he was going to try to get our other roommate to get him a copy, but that other roommate is away for a while so how is that going to work? I should have just confronted him then and there about why he’s avoiding telling the landlord and that reiterated that I think he should just tell the landlord, but I said fine and that if he finds that the other roommate can’t copy his key for him (definitely will be the case since he’s away UNTIL JANUARY) then he can use my key to copy.

But I regret that, cause making a key behind the landlord’s back feels sketchy so I just don’t want to do it. I don’t really know my roommate, we barely see each other and never talk or hang out even though we have lived together for 2-3 years. I’m just worried about some sort of bad consequences as a result of giving him a copy of my key without telling the landlord first. Although he said it’s definitely in the apartment (he just can’t find it), it’s out there somewhere. Or maybe he actually has his key and is tricking me into getting him another one without having to copy a key himself. Why would he do that, I don’t know, but the whole way he has avoided getting a key for so many months has been so bizarre that I’ve just lost any sort of trust in him.

I actually made a copy of my key, because mentally I can’t take this anymore of him always needing the door unlocked. I don’t feel safe anymore. But I wish I didn’t make that copy, because now I realize that I don’t want to give him it! I just want it to be handled however the landlord wants to handle it.

I don’t know what to do, I want the landlord to know about it but I don’t want to cause some sort of big fight with this person I’m living with where I have to “tell on him” and he gets angry at me for that and tries to get back at me or something. I wish he could just be a responsible adult and handle it himself. 

I suspect one explanation for not wanting to tell the landlord is that the landlord may want to change the locks and it would be at the roommate's expense, and so it would be much easier and cheaper in his eyes if one of us other roommates could just give him a copy of our key. We also have a house where there are several doors that the same key is used, so all of them would probably have to be changed. I'm planning on asking him what his reason is next time I see him why he doesn't want to tell the landlord, but I can't take this much longer so if he says he'll refuse to tell the landlord then I'm considering just telling him myself.

    We’ll fast forward several years and we’ve had two kids (now 4 and 5). My husband, who use to feel similarly about organized religion, unbeknownst to me starting taking my kids to church.

My husband (who has become increasingly religious) started a new job that sometimes requires he work Sundays and began to ask me to take them. I initially refused but starting to be made to feel bad for not doing this one thing for my mother in law who does so much for us and also because the kids enjoy some music class they do during the mornings.

MIL and FIL's mom (GMIL) really really hate each other. It is hands down the most toxic MIL DIL dynamic I've ever seen.

MIL drew one and the question was what is the worst thing your partner has ever done to you?

MIL replied that when GMIL got married, MIL assumed she would be wearing red because she is Japanese. She had Japanese and Chinese mixed up and apparently Japanese brides tend to wear white. MIL put a lot into finding the showiest red dress and trying to ruin the wedding. FIL never told her because he didn't want to deal with it, and MIL was extremely disappointed when she showed up and GMIL was in white and didn't think anything of MIL's dress. 

Ever since hearing this story, I've been anxious about what MIL would wear to my wedding. I know it might not be logical, but if she would do something that cruel in the past, I don't know what she is capable of. MIL recently mentioned she still didn't have a dress for my wedding, and I set a boundary that I need to see whatever she buys before she commits to it. MIL laughed at me and called me entitled and insecure.

I said I was serious and she blew up about that is not how you treat the mother of the groom and I need to learn respect. I pointed out that she did something nasty to GMIL and she just started yelling at me that I am disrespectful and I have no idea what I'm talking about. She ran to FIL.

For another 6 years, it was total quiet. F**in best years of my life. UNTIL, a chance encounter with my parents and my sister. I immediately thought ""oh s***, here we go again"". And I was right - they always did it via call, having found out my number somehow.
Now the present.

Due to his house being 40-50 minutes away, he allowed us to stay the night. As soon as we got there, Maggie and Jerry’s girlfriend, who we’ll call Angela (27f), starting catching up and talking about how things had been going the last few months since they’d seen each other. After a few hours of eating, watching and talking, Maggie said she was gonna go take a shower, and Angela said she’d go up to help her figure out where everything was and how to work it all. After about 10-15 minutes of me and Jerry not hearing the shower, I went up to see what was happening. I walked Jerry and Angela’s room, to find Maggie and Angela making out. I mean full on make out session, with them rubbing all over each other and rolling around and even moaning at one point. Angela glanced over at me and laughed, and as her head was turned Maggie aggressively kissed Angela’s neck, giggling and moaning the whole way through until she saw me. She laughed and got up from underneath Angela, and sorta teased me and said something like “You wanted in on the action?” I was so confused that I just said that I was checking if everything was okay, and Maggie assured that they were fine, and then jumped back ON TOP of Angela, and they both smiled in a way that seemed SO cheating esque before Maggie kissed her on the lips and they went right back to making out. I went downstairs, and frantically told Jerry what was going on, but he just brushed it off and said that that’s what Angela does with all her straight friends to “experiment” or “have some fun” and he told me not to worry and that it was something all straight girls do. I couldn’t stop thinking about how aggressively they had been kissing though, and after 30 minutes had passed since they had gone up there, I went up to see what was happening. They were STILL making out, and Angela was letting Maggie feel and touch her boobs (not sure if I’ll get removed if I use the other word) while they kissed. I went downstairs, and I guess they fell asleep because Maggie never joined me in the guest room and Jerry slept on the couch. Anyways, right now I’m on the couch while Maggie, Angela, and Jerry are all continuing as if nothing ever happened and I just don’t understand how this is treated so nonchalantly because to me it felt like cheating. Should I call them out for it, or should I just not try to change social norms? I knew that some straight girls would make out or have sex to get a guys attention, but I was unaware that some just did it for fun. If it’s a normal thing to do, and if Maggie just does it to try something new, than I’ll let it go, but I didn’t know this was a thing and I wanna know if I would be the asshole if I called them out.

As the boss, I always write myself in to take call for Thanksgiving or X-Mas as an act of service since every salaried person has the bulk of their family hours away from where we work.  My wife's family and my family live the farthest away, being either a 14 hr drive one way or 10-12 hr multi-flight itinerary.

My wife and I have been this long distance away from our main families for almost six year now.  During that time, only our respective parents have made the effort to visit us in our new home.  Last year, my side agreed verbally to finally allow us to host Christmas this year since they knew I had to stay local to my work.  However, as soon as it came time to plan for the holidays, those parties quickly denied ever having agreed to join us at our home.  We tried to hold our ground that we we were not travelling for both Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, but my mom was devastated and crying about not getting the family back together.  

We agreed to join this year on an earlier weekend in December this year, but wife and I are sick of being expected to be the only ones who have to fly and take vacation time to observe holidays. We understand that we are the ones that moved away we should reasonably expect to travel for a good share of holidays, but we have been holding our arms open for six years to get the family just to see our home once.  The effort just doesn't seem reciprocated.

The only thing that gets us any degree of understanding is that I have to work some holidays and they lay blame at my ""evil"" company for making me work when my 100 hourly people are.... they don't understand that I am fully in charge of the on call rotation and I value my employees holiday time off to a higher degree.  I could easily be a tyrant and force other salaried people to work and get me free to travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year.  However, I'm thinking of going the other way with it and just scheduling myself to work both holidays every year to avoid the travel burden until we are allowed to host the family just once.  I know my mom will not take my side or my wife's side if we stand our ground on not travelling 100% of the time without the external force of work duties or something like a new infant to excuse us.

We’ve been having arguments about family visits- my brother would like me to go over every week or every other week which is difficult for us to do that regularly.

I’ve taken time off work before the 24th to be able to prep the turkey and get things ready, I’ve decorated quite a bit because last Christmas was shitty with what my husband was going through and the ones before were covid, so I was pumped to have a great time this year. I should also mention that I have space for them to sleep over if they prefer. He said that when I have kids, we’ll spend Christmas at my house and that since his kids would be older they’ll visit more frequently.

I've had my dog for 7 years since he was a puppy. Prior to living with my wife and her mom, I lived alone with my dog and would sleep with him every night. I had explained to my wife that my only request when living with them is that my dog remain with me at night. He doesn't have to share my bed anymore, (since I share it with wife now) but at least keep him in my view.

I moved in about 4 months ago and although my wife has tried to explain things to her mom, her mom has a very hard time accepting this, and every night, tries to bring my dog into her room. She will carry him in and turn off the lights. Every night I've had to go upstairs before bed and have my wife bring my dog back into our room which is met with comments from her mother. 

My mother-in-law's stance is that the dog is now her dog as well and she has every right to sleep with him too amongst other things. Other than bedtime, I do not try to be possessive and allow my mother-in-law (anyone for that matter) to play with him and enjoy his company even if I am upstairs working. My mother-in-law has made me feel like my dog is not my dog anymore and tries things like seeing who he takes a treat from (competitions to see who the dog loves more), and giving him a shirt that reads ""Mommy's boy"". The shirt wouldn't really bother me if she had the right intentions or read ""Grandma's boy"".

I've tried to let him sleep with her twice but my anxiety of making sure he's ok and the safety of having him near me does not allow me to go to bed. My mother-in-law, visibly seeing how tired I am these times, continues to ask for my dog at night.

I work until 2 AM, and usually go to bed at around 4. I sleep until noon. This has worked surprisingly well with my classes since I turned 21 and got the job last year. I am not the kind of person who will sleep like 5 hours a night. Everyone at school does that. And they're irritable and tired and gain weight and have caffeine and nicotine addictions. I get my eight hours and I feel to sleepy to function if I don't. 

My parents ask me to drive home and then go with them to our thanksgiving celebration. We're going to both of my grandparents' houses, which geographically are kinda a triangle with their house, but the 2nd stop is very close to my college, so it made sense for me to drive instead of riding with them.

I get home, hang out, and then we're leaving the next day. Mom wants us out the door at 6 am. I get to sleep around 3, only sleep a few hours, and am trying not to fall asleep on the road. It's kinda scary, even though I know I will literally die I still just want to close my eyes so bad. We get there around 10 am, and I say hi to everyone and immediately go to the back room and take a nap on the couch. I wake up at 1 pm for dinner, have a plate and don't really talk to anyone much, and then go back to sleep. I woke up again around 6 pm. At this point I'm finally rested and ready to socialize, but my parents want to leave and go to their hotel room at like 7 pm. 

My mom is mad at me for missing the whole day and says I knew I had to be up early so I should've just gone to bed earlier. I don't know why she doesn't get that I have to be used to being up late for my job, and I can't just go to sleep at 9 pm (literally 7 hours earlier than normal) one night randomly because I'm not used to it and I'm not tired yet and I won't fall asleep. She says I should've just had a coffee and been tired for the day so I could see my family instead of sleeping. I think that's very unhealthy and I would've been so irritable and annoyed by everything my already often-irritating extended family say, I would've rather just not been there than done that.

The guests included my brother (50s M)from out of town and  his 3 children (two in their 20s and a toddler, 3 yo).

I have a dining room table with 8 seats, a breakfast room with 2 tables (1 table is adult size with 4 seats and 1 table is a toddler table with 4 chairs). Finally, there is a couch in the den with a big screen TV with a coffee table where 2-3 people could sit. The regulars know that it is free for all and they can sit wherever they want. Usually about half or so sit in the breakfast room and half or so sit in the dining room. This is my brother’s first time here for Thanksgiving that I can recall in at least 5 years.

After saying grace, I told everyone about the seating in the dining room, breakfast table area, and the den. I then directed my two school age children to the toddler table and made a seat for my brother and his 3 yo son also. So there were 3 kids and my brother at this table. I commented to my brother “you can sit next to your son so you can help him with his meal.” I brought my brother his cocktail which was in the kitchen and he was helping his son eat. After everyone else got food, I made another batch of cocktails for everyone and finished heating a final item in the oven. So about 30 minutes later after everyone else had started eating, I finally fixed myself a plate and looked for a seat. I headed to the breakfast room and no one was there. My brother and his sons were done eating and were in the den on the couch watching football, so I went to the dining room where 5 people including my wife were sitting. They were all done eating, but they were socializing, so I sat there and ate my meal. After eating, I hung out in the den with my brother and nephews. As far as I knew at the time, everyone had a great time and at the end of the night, I walked my brother to his vehicle, gave him and my nephews hugs and wished them a safe trip home.

Well, Saturday I got a confrontational call from my mother saying that my brother told her that I made him sit at the kid’s table and “why did you do that?”  She stated that my brother was obviously bothered by this, but he didn’t say anything to me about it.

I might be the a-hole because I may have made my brother feel like he was not welcome to sit wherever he wanted. I was just trying to facilitate his 3 yo getting help eating.

Karl isn't the oldest child but the most responsible and he's always looked after his mother and sister who has two children (now adults) when he was able to. When we got married, his finances became less available to them and they've never gotten over getting less from Karl (i.e. he would buy school shoes for the children but not an entire wardrobe and for her birthday his mom might get $50 instead of $200). For the record, I never told Karl he should do less. However, we had plans to start a family and wanted to travel more often so he no longer had those extras to give. 

My MIL (80F) in particular uses every opportunity to remind me and anyone other than Karl how much he used to do for her. Most recently, she spoke to our son (14) and told him to tell his dad how much she misses the extra money he sent her especially now that she's old and might die soon. My son had the phone on speaker (she was aware because he was getting ready to leave) and I heard it all. I told him to say goodbye to his grandma and tell her I'd call her back. When he left, I called her and told her not to use our children for her greed and if she wants anything from Karl she better ask him directly, not her grandson. I reminded her that she gave Karl and me a crinkled up $10 bill as a wedding gift and after all her son has done for her ungrateful ass, she shouldn't expect anything else from him but love and affection. She started to cry (she should get an Oscar for the fale tears she's managed to squeeze out through the years) and told me I'm an asshole for being mean to her. I told her I'm tired of her whining about money especially when she's not wanting for anything. Karl thinks I was a bit harsh but he agrees with me.

Last night we met up with a friend, who I will call Sasha. It was her 18th birthday so there was heavy drinking involved and everyone got very drunk. We had a really fun night and decided to go back to her house to continue drinking. 

We were all in her room talking and it somehow gets brought up that Josh had a relationship with one of his friends who we bumped into that night, who I'll call Ash. She is a very big girl and Sasha had mentioned this is why I shouldn't be threatened. I said I didn't worry about her because of what Josh had previously said about her, which I shouldn't have mentioned because it was a horrible thing to say. Of course I shouldn't have said this because both Josh and Sasha were now pestering me about what it was he had said. I said they didn't want to hear it and I wasn't going to say it, but they were practically begging me to. So eventually I said it. I said that I didn't worry about Ash because Josh told me having sex with people that big is gross- worst mistake ever. Josh freaked out and jumped on the defense saying he never said that, and Sasha who is a bigger girl too got upset. We got in a huge fight and things got really bad. I got very upset and apologized for everything and told him I just wanted to go home. He called me a lot of horrible names and said some really nasty things to me, which I won't get in to- Basically implying that I'm the worst person ever. I've never seen him act like this before.

I was tossed back and forth for years.  Too much trauma... But please let me give some highlights.  Dad has mostly been there putting me first.  Mom?  Not so much, as if it was my fault she destroyed her marriage.  Would lock me and my soon to be stepsister in the upstairs of my soon to be stepdad's mom's home with my soon to be stepsister who was my friend at the beginning.  Years passed, my mom finally stopped suing my bio dad for bullshit, she finally married this guy.  Unbeknownst to my mom's family he was a porn addict and her excuse to me is ""everyone has something, and I should understand"".  I never truly connected to her, always felt I was a means to an end.  Soo.. this stepdad had CD's showing myself, and other female relatives, (even a 13 year old) with faces transposed on provocative poses.  I discovered this accidentally when I was 25... I was sickened.  Of course, mom never tells my family.  He gave a half assed apology and mom swears me to secrecy. 

Here is the crazy part. Mom is successful, always was the breadwinner in that relationship. He never worked to add to equity in their home.  Ever.  He eventually passed from cancer and I was there24 7 and 365.  Was his daughter, my stepsister?  NOPE.  She visited 3 times in 2 years. I have pics.  

So, after he passes, my mom actually gives my husband and I 13K to put down on a house with a 1500 sq basement with a seperate entrance.  She was to update it and move in when she was ready to retire.  My home is NC, she was still working FT in Long Island.  

The day of my closing she tells me ""I am not moving in with you, and the home I have equity in is for the stepsister.  because her husband told her to make sure that stepsister was ok.

Bottom line, I have a mortgage I will pay till I'm 81.  And stepsister will receive the home with equity and will be mortgage free at age 60.  I feel somehow the duty to your child from birth should come first.

Let’s call “friend” C.

C and I have known each other since year 10 but became friends and even closer since start of year 11 ish. We got super close at the end of year 12. We ended up going on a road trip holiday and bonded over our new experiences together and made a really beautiful friendship that I treasure to this day. 

Two months after the holiday, it becomes noticeable C is ignoring me. Every few days I would send a message checking in making sure she was okay since that was what we always did and I was hearing nothing from her.  C was still posting random stuff on their stories across all platforms but I wouldn’t get a response till a week or two after and even then these responses were dry, self centred and nothing like the person I knew. I waited three months in which time my dog had passed away for her to ask how I am.  I then waited a month for her to even reply let alone start a conversation with me bc at this point I am doing all the initiating messages and talk. I probably asked her 12 times if she was okay and if I had done anything to hurt her or even if she didn’t want to be my friend anymore which I repeatedly said I would respect her choices. Each time I was told yes she was okay and she was just busy and C would beg to hang out as she missed me and didn’t want to lose me bc she apparently cares a lot abt me.  

Anyway some time has passed and after a few months of her being too busy to reply I organised a chance to see each other in person and talk out my feelings and hers in an attempt to salvage this friendship. She had stated how much she wanted to be friends and how much she wanted to hang out and see each other more bc she misses me and how she talked to her mum abt the distance but failed to even reply to me asking if she’s okay.  

Weeks passed again and it was her birthday which I tried to organise a surprise for her since I know her family won’t do much. No reply.  I ended up just wishing her a great day and wasn’t expecting a reply.  I ended up getting a reply a few hours later which was weird. 


Through all her excuses of work, church and volunteer at church which I have so much respect and understanding, the part of me that wanted to make it work has disappeared over time.  

Recently I got a message from her saying hello and trying to check in on me which hadn’t happened for over 6 months. 

I am confused now bc I am getting mixed signals now. I haven’t heard from my last checkin in a week after hers and it’s just a vicious pattern of waiting to see if she is my friend when each time I mention going seperate ways she promises that she wants to be friends and will work on communicating together.

The hunger of my fast hits me. I remembered I had packed a small bag of peanut m&amp;m’s. So I start to eat them. And this big fella (muscled) comes up to me as if he’s known me for years and asks for my food. And I sternly but politely refuse. He told me I was mean and stormed off.

My family refuses to give me any sort of personal space at all. My brother claims that his desk is overflowing with papers, and has to use the desk in my room. He also claims that he needs absolute silence when he’s studying, so I practically never get access to my room except until after midnight. Also, my wardrobe is in his room while his wardrobe is in mine. Whenever he needs to take his clothes, and vice versa, he barges in without knocking, no matter what I’m doing.

Whenever I’m calling my boyfriend, or having a meeting, with my room door closed, my parents always find a reason to enter the room, either to talk to me or pass me something, despite knowing that I’m on a call. 

It’s gotten so bad, that I have taken to staying out for at least 12 hours every day, just to get some space to do my own work. 

I am also considering marrying my boyfriend just to get access to government housing and a place of my own. I have the option of renting, but rental prices have skyrocketed after the pandemic and I want to save money for a house.

I actually broke down and asked for some personal space, after which my parents yelled at me to give my brother some space to study. Either that, or move out.
