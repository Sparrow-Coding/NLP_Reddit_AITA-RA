We both work, he is a head chef, works 6am - 2:30pm. With a 25min commute. 

I am in administration and work 9am-3:30pm but also the primary carer. 

Since my little one was born, I would do nights alone, most care for my baby is done by me. However, my hubby and I share household jobs and he mostly cooks (i can‚Äôt cook well apparently and he refuses to eat my food). 

This brings us to this morning. My daughter didn‚Äôt sleep until 10pm last night and woke around 3am, I slept around 10:40pm and then got up with her at 3am. 

After sitting in her room with her for 1.5hrs I felt like I wanted to lay back in bed but she was still slightly awake so cried upon placing her in the cot, - now i understand some would leave her in the cot but i chose to take her to the bedroom with me. 
In doing so, i disturbed my hubby, it was 4:50am. And his alarm goes off at 5am so i thought he might becokay. (I know the gut wrenching thought of waking before the alsrm, it can be disappinting as those extra minutes can make or break a day)
So i get his emotion but the rage and dismissal of my welbeeing bothers me. 

Well it caused him to wake and yell in rage that i woke him before his alarm. During this the cat was nagging to go outside, usually at that time ,i would always get the cat out, as i am aware the rage he gets when his sleep is intrrupted. but i asked my hubby to whilst i held my daughter half asleep. 
He refused and raged again. 
Eventually i could ease my daughter onto the matress beside me but left little to no room for me comfortably, i roled out of bed. (Otherwise i would have fallen out )
I then said to my partner ‚Äúits now 5:30 can you get up soon , so I can rest‚Äù knowing he will have to leave to make it by 6. 

He raged saying he has to work and had the worst night. Yet i have been up for hours and due to his raging my daughter woke and now we are all up and i have a sooky baby to deal with before i go to work myself in a couple of hours. 
He was up and out the door within 10mins.

note: it was hard on my end to tell this was happening until i could physically see kevin moving his stuff into the common space bc i work crazy hours. 
we were afraid of our credit scores being messed up and being unable to find someone to fill in the room on such short notice, we did the kind thing in allowing kevin to stay no longer than one month to help gail with rent. we then learn gail &amp; kevin are dating. i am uncomfortable living with someone who is dating a guy straight out of high school. it is also revealed that kevin is entirely financially supporting gail while they pay rent to a studio for music and pays for their producer‚Äîleaving renting the room from us their last priority. 
we decide through all the deception and fear of our own financial statuses in the case of skipped/late rent, it‚Äôs best to tell kevin and gail to move out by dec 1st. we do not see a future in which either person is financially stable without the other person. we allotted them just over a month to find a new place &amp; get the moving things in order. 
the new roomie is a mutual, she is financially stable. 
it‚Äôs three days until they are supposed to move out &amp; nothing has been packed up. kevin asked me about gail‚Äôs security deposit and it completely slipped my mind to take care of that. i apologized and said we could work it out but the new roommate because of moving costs may not be able to pay the deposit for another two weeks. gail and kevin are really mad and hostile now. i urged them that this could have been sorted out had they brought it up any time this past month. it‚Äôs a red flag that kevin was the one to bring up gail‚Äôs deposit when kevin shouldn‚Äôt even be living here in the first place‚Ä¶i‚Äôve been supporting this household buying common goods more often than others to try to make things easier. it‚Äôs just this one time that i slipped up forgetting their security deposit situation.

i feel like a lot of unnecessary responsibility has been put on me in addition to a lot of negative emotions from these people considering how kind we‚Äôve been to them and how many favors we‚Äôve done for them. i fear that they‚Äôll damage my belongings or steal shit before leaving. they have a history of disrespecting belongings (taking my vapes, burning a hole in my couch). they‚Äôre mad that they won‚Äôt get their deposit back for another two weeks.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4834193,public,top,self,AITA for not giving my roommate their security deposit back the same day as their move out?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7549p/aita_for_not_giving_my_roommate_their_security/,all_ads,6,,,,

I am being made to feel like an arsehole by others but more an arsehole to myself for not setting boundaries  

This guy I have seen around came up to me and asked me if I could get him a snack as he didn't have many places to go get food (churches and all) I knew he wasn't fully homeless but I knew he was on hard times. So I said I would get him a snack for cheap, but explained I couldn't afford much due to my own situation.

At first, I didn't mind but started hinting he wanted he would like certain things, which I refused as I couldn't afford. In the end he went 'But I don't want anything that costs too much' and went for something cheaper than I suggested. I was suspicious at this point but part of me was thinking I wanted to at least give as I was feeling charitable and I knew he was on a walk so wanted to give a little. So as I was leaving, the shop people said 'are you ok? Need any help?' But by the point I was almost out the door and paid for it. So I just handed them it and left, without talking to him. In some ways, I regret being mislead until after and not fully seeing it, but more so I see it as a small lesson for myself to make boundries. I don't fully regret it as my mind was that I wanted to help someone enjoy their day, but I realise after that he had disappeared when the shop keeper came so really, I think its likely he has done this before.

It won't stop me helping people, I like to do it. But I learnt a lesson. I need to learn to be more aware and smarter.

They‚Äôre moving in with the husband‚Äôs mother and they have Covid so they are to be staying here in the meantime until she recovers. 

For a bit of backstory, I heavily dislike my sister. For most of my childhood she mentally and abused me and caused a lot of the trauma I have to this day that I‚Äôm working with my therapist. She mentally and physically abused me up until the point I was in 5th/6th grade. From then, she caused so much havoc and drama in my house that I became clinically depressed at 12 . She eventually left my life when I was around 13-14 and she‚Äôs been hoping from state to state with her husband. The last time I saw her was when I was a senior in high school which was about 5 or so years ago and it was only for a day. I worked a bunch during that time so I maybe saw her for an hour or so. 

Since then my sister has had 4 kids and they were all reported sick. Most of them has the flu and one of them even was in the hospital recently. I have literally no relationship with any of them as I have no relationship with my sister. I only know 2 of their names and even then, I don‚Äôt know what they look like nor their birthdays. I also dislike her husband as he is the definition of a dead beat. All he does, from what I‚Äôve heard from my parents, is play video games and smoke weed.

They took care of us for 20 years until me and my mom managed to get a flat together, my mom used to work some times and help but all of the time it was free support and rent free. I am really grateful of what they did for us and decided to try and help them as much as I can as they are a bit off financially, I helped them to build a house, I did gift them around $8k and help them from times to time when I can. I am forever grateful of what they did and will always be.

I want to move out of my own flat because my mom wants to control my life and I should do as she says.

I have to try and support everyone, I have been working 10h daily for almost a year with some times resting and she still manages to shit on me about how I am not working and spending a lot, my mom doesn't work I support us with everything that we need, she puts a lot of pressure on me to help her sister and always reminding me of what they did for us, telling me that I am too young of thinking of owning a second flat and so. I earn around $2000 monthly in a country that the average salary is $350. I have around $500 on a loan I took for my flat to finance a few things. 15k in total that will end up within 3 years. I can support this financially.

I brought up the topic that if she continues to control my life like this, I will move out and will never come back. I will let her have the flat she deserves it she did what not for me.

I have to ask permission to go on a trip for example and everything, I am not a person that likes to be controlled and I am an adult at the end of the day.

I will get a flat on my own and move there with my girlfriend but this has the price of cutting ties with almost all of them probably because they will never support this. I tried talking it with my mom and she told me that as long as she is alive I have to do as she says. I love my mom to death but this is not something I can take anymore.

She and her sister went ballistic on me, telling me that I should not let her alone and that I should listen to her only and so and how my girlfriend is the reason why I want to move out and that we should do as my mom says.

They took care of us for 20 years until me and my mom managed to get a flat together, my mom used to work some times and help but all of the time it was free support and rent free. I am really grateful of what they did for us and decided to try and help them as much as I can as they are a bit off financially, I helped them to build a house, I did gift them around $8k and help them from times to time when I can. I am forever grateful of what they did and will always be.

I want to move out of my own flat because my mom wants to control my life and I should do as she says.

I have to try and support everyone, I have been working 10h daily for almost a year with some times resting and she still manages to shit on me about how I am not working and spending a lot, my mom doesn't work I support us with everything that we need, she puts a lot of pressure on me to help her sister and always reminding me of what they did for us, telling me that I am too young of thinking of owning a second flat and so. I earn around $2000 monthly in a country that the average salary is $350. I have around $500 on a loan I took for my flat to finance a few things. 15k in total that will end up within 3 years. I can support this financially.

I brought up the topic that if she continues to control my life like this, I will move out and will never come back. I will let her have the flat she deserves it she did what not for me.

I have to ask permission to go on a trip for example and everything, I am not a person that likes to be controlled and I am an adult at the end of the day.

I will get a flat on my own and move there with my girlfriend but this has the price of cutting ties with almost all of them probably because they will never support this. I tried talking it with my mom and she told me that as long as she is alive I have to do as she says. I love my mom to death but this is not something I can take anymore.

She and her sister went ballistic on me, telling me that I should not let her alone and that I should listen to her only and so and how my girlfriend is the reason why I want to move out and that we should do as my mom says.

Usually, I can easily ask him to get his chore done and he will do it, realizing his mess is impeding the rest of the house's ability to function (i.e doing his dishes so we can use the sink). 

Recently, this housemate got a new girlfriend, who suddenly began living with us, and who is 3X more of a mess than he is. I have expressed my complaints about how I end up cleaning up after the two of them on a daily basis. Many people recommend I stop doing their chores (which I want to do) but I can't do my own laundry if they just hog up the machine for hours. Or I can't wash my own dishes if the sink is full of all their dirty dishes. Or I can't watch tv when they leave all the couch cushions, not on the couch (yea idk how to explain either). Hopefully, you get my point with these examples. 

We have tried to implement a chore chart, which they also don't even follow, and when they do their chore, they half-ass the job, so I (or another housemate) end up having to do the chore again anyways. 

The last resort of advice I got was to just leave all their dirty dishes/laundry/etc. in their room or in front of their room. It's super petty, and I know that and that's why I don't want to do it, but it just seems like talking to them constantly to pull their weight isn't working after many complaints from the rest of the house.

4. Cookie
5. Fruit snacks
6. Brownie

I told her to give my niece the fruits or vegetables if she has a problem with the treats and she told me she threw away the lunch because it was distracting to the other kids. 

I decided to call the office and tell them that I needed to pull my niece out for an appointment at 11 (lunch is at 11:30) and that she‚Äôd be back by the end of lunch. 

So at 11, I picked her up, we got happy meals, cookies, fruit snacks, and milkshakes. Then at 12 (end of lunch) I dropped her off with her happy meal box and her almost finished milkshake. 

Teacher saw this and was fuming. I guess she told my sister what happened because shortly after, I got a call from my sister saying I was being petty and should‚Äôve just dropped off a new sandwich.

However, I have some mental health issues which stem from growing up as my 2 older brothers had drugs issues when I was a teenager that really affected the family unit. I was severely bullied by one of my brothers (Dave) and, when he was expelled, I became the target of bullies as he was part of a particular drug scene who took his behaviour/ unpaid debts, etc out on me. I am an adult now and have a great relationship with both my brother's who have recovered amazingly from their addiction and are a part of my life. 
Growing up, I was the youngest kid and had to be perfect. Was not allowed to have a single problem. I was depressed at 13 and it was brushed under the rug like a teenage tantrum and my parents were angry with me and told me ""we have more important things to deal with, you are just a brat"".
This was all very difficult at the time, but I grew up, left the country, got married, and have a very happy life, until recently when it all came flooding back and I had a bit of a break down which resulted in me losing my job and my very supportive husband caring for me. 

My parents have been amazing throughout; paying for my treatment, telling me they love me and will do whatever they can to help me get better. However, I was recently in a conversation with them both and mentioned my ""disfunctional childhood"" thinking they would understand. They both freaked out. My mum started crying, shouting ""I'm a terrible person and mother"" and ""thanks for confirming the worst thoughts I ever had about myself"". My dad told me ""you're the worst kind of selfish bitch"" and ""we don't want to see you until you show a bit of gratitude"".

I'm honestly shocked. I love them so much and I feel like I'm just talking about my own experience, nothing to do with them. I spoke to both my brothers and they say that they think I've had a hard time and I deserve to talk about it. 

I feel so guilty and confused though. Like maybe I am an arsehole for bringing up those times as they were hard for everyone.

I would mow her lawn, fix up things around the house, and buy her groceries. She paid me good money and she was a kind person. Eventually I realized how lonely she was so I would often go to her house and spend time with her since her actual family lived far away.

Towards the end of high school she started losing it. Her memory got worse and she‚Äôd forget things. I felt bad accepting money and started making up excuses and would lie to get out of her paying me. I think she realized I was avoiding her payments and felt bad. At the end of my senior year she wrote me a check for my college tuition. Keep in mind my tuition was close to 25k a year and she paid for a full year. I tried to not accept the gift but she insisted that I accept. After I went to college she hired a caregiver and didn‚Äôt really need me but I still tried to visit.

Well this year she died and I was on her will. She gave me her home and some money. Her immediate family fought hard to get the home from me but I fought hard to keep it. I offered for them to visit and grab any family keep sakes but after that the home was mine. 

I decided I‚Äôm selling the home and moving across the country for a new job opportunity. Her family came at me hard and demanded I sell to them.

He had an ex (R) who he was still friends with and talked to everyday. They very obviously flirted with each other and after weeks of asking them to stop flirting and spend a little less time together, she was finally out of the picture. Another friend (S) from the same group is still very close with him. She took her side at first but we have convinced her otherwise. He talks to her once a week, shes a missionary and is only allowed internet at specific times. He told her about R and all the problems that it caused and S said that its all because of me and that i need therapy because I'm going to turn out like his abusive ex (A). I got very upset about this, I know I'm not the most mentally well person but i tried and am still trying my hardest not to get jealous and controlling with him. S apologised and nothing really happened after that. 

With his permission, I listened to his and S's voice notes that they sent each other and anytime he mentioned me S would get annoyed at him and make him promise not to have sex with me. I think it's a religious thing but it still makes me uncomfortable. In the voice notes he called her things like 'my dear' and 'my love' and said he loved her. I confronted him about this and he said that he just thought it was funny to sound like an english gentleman. I don't really believe this as this is what he calls me. 

Today, he was messaging S and had a huge smile on his face, I don't know if I'm overthinking this or not but it just didnt feel right. S will be coming back off her mission in march and he said that when she does, he'll be talking to her everyday and the thought if that makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to turn into a psycho jealous girlfriend but I also don't want to be taken advantage of.

Sorry for the grammar, I'm emotional. 

I (20F) have been friends with K (23M) for 5 years. He recently got a girlfriend, B (?F.) This caused a debate. I was told they started dating at the same time as two friends he didn't like that much. He apologized that night but took it back the next day. He told me I wasn't told because I was being distant. I have always been a cold and distant person. I'm afraid of losing friends. Then I was also told that I was mad he was happy. Untrue. I was sad. We sort of made up after that, but it's been on my mind. Because of that I really didn't want to try to become friends with B.
K made a group chat on Amino, added me, our friends, and B. I had her blocked because I didn't want to attempt a friendship, my dms are not open to her. I wanted to keep my friendship with K to myself and not try to be her friend. Keeping to myself, mostly. K made me cohost, as he always does. K did the same to B. Since it was a public chat, anyone could join. 
This whole thing happened yesterday. Earlier in the day some members were off topic talking about MHA. I was involved in the conversation, there was no rp going so I thought it was okay to be off topic. Later in the day, B was talking about Cyberpunk while there was an rp going on. I had just unblocked her, ready for her to talk to me if she wanted the bond or whateva. I was actually going to involved myself in the conversation but another cohost said we needed to get back on topic. That was ignored so I shut it down. I to all was well, as it's my job to keep everything on topic. Later I get a DM from B saying that I was picking and choosing off topic chats. I shut it down because it was her passion. Untrue, I bought the game for her bf last year. Then she proceeded to tell me that she'll call me out publicly next time. Like okay?? So I dmed her bf because I was pissed and flustered. Told him his girlfriend was accusing me of hating her because of her passion. Then her dmed her and came back and told me I was a liar. My wording was accusing at her, yes, but it felt like she was accusing me of hating her because of cyberpunk. We had a fight where he told me I was treating him like a therapist. I thought I was treating him like the older brother he claims to be. Like my confidante. But apparently not. I don't tell him things because of the therapist comment. I tell my mom things before him. I ended the argument by saying I love him, he knows where to find me when he wants to talk. This feels like HS drama. We're both adults. Why is he acting like we're 12? That feeling comes from the fact he left every single group chat we're both in. It feels like hes running away from his problems. Today he took away my cohost privileges and I just left the chat. I have been explaining this to everyone who asks.

I paid for their dinner all seemed well

They recently invited me and her to a pizza party (I only got the invite from her)

Day of I wasn't really feeling it and decided not go go the day before. We had a few other plans all weekend together and I just wanted to do my own thing that day. Prob the asshole for that but I don't think it's major to cancel, and the girl I'm seeing was ok with it. They were doing a day drink pizza and board games and I wasn't really interested. (Been trying not to drink and eat heathier) 

Now they invited me to some Xmas dinner (again only receiving the invite through the girl) this time she says I can't skip and all her friends are mad at me because they had to pay for my share of the food from the pizza party and they feel like I left her alone. 

This was news to me, I didn't know the pizza thing was a pre paid event. They are mad because they bought ingredients and they had to pay for my share. I am aware the xmas thing is pre paid, some private chef thing, I'm fine with that and agreed. 

I think the full pizza message was never communicated to me by the girl and even so, how much is dough sauce and cheese? Can't you just keep that in the fridge? I offered her money to send to them but she won't take it. I think the whole thing is a bit abusrd. I wouldn't be mad at a friend for canceling last minute to a party multiple people were attending and I would have paid for the food for all my guests. I think because they are younger? (22-26) I am 30

I later find out one of the girls who I met at the dinner I PAID for thought I was flirting with the waitress because I was joking around with her ordering from the menu, believe the joke was when she took all our orders I asked if she (waitress) wanted anything. Small laughs and that was it. The friend seems to not be fond of me due to this.

Now I don't even want to go to the xmas dinner anymore tbh but I'm kinda stuck now because I said yes. Was thinking about bringing pizza to it but don't want to embarrass the girl I'm seeing. 


I think they are being petty, and they have made me feel a little like I'm in the dog house over pizza ingredients. They don't know I know which I also think the girl I'm seeing should have told me the full picture before inviting me to something so I'm a little annoyed at that but not major.

She loves me and we have plans for the future but she keeps bringing up all the things her friends get from their make admirers.  

I finally snapped and said that I could not afford to be a sugar daddy.  She said her friends aren't like that.

AITA for reacting negatively straight away and saying I think it's weird? I feel like I've offended him. I can't decide whether its okay. They are both mature adults, but the age gap could mean that their new friend has less life experience/ emotional maturity. 

This isn't the first case either. They've dated way outside of their age range in the past and expressed they wouldn't think its bad if I (F under 18) decided to date a man in his thirties.

In order to regain a little bit of freedom, I am going to take the CBT (mandatory training course to ride motorcycles here) and save for a motorcycle so I can get around myself more easily. I told my parents this and while my dad was very supportive, my mother said she refuses to let me do it. 

I tried to explain to her the benefits, as I see them, to her, showed her all the gear I was planning on buying to protect myself, how they‚Äôre all fully certified to high degrees etc, showed her the website of the instructor I was going to get lessons from, said I would be paying for all of this 100% myself and she still said that even if I got a motorcycle myself and paid for it all, she wouldn‚Äôt let me ride it because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo dangerous‚Äù and ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù. 

I told her I don‚Äôt really need her approval if I do it all by my own means, and I wasn‚Äôt looking to get approval anyway, I just wanted to share a life plan with her. 

She then made a whole list of threats from putting locks on it then hiding then hiding the keys to outright selling the motorcycle. 
I said if she did any of that I‚Äôd just call the police. I don‚Äôt have the energy to deal with her myself. 

Obviously my mother was NOT happy with this and told my father. He said he doesn‚Äôt want to take sides and that I can do what I want no matter how he feels because I‚Äôm an adult.

After saving for two, almost three years my boyfriend(30M) and I(29F) were finally able to buy our very first car.

My bf and his brother(36M) were joking saying that once we got the car we'd be able to drive him/pick him and his gf up from concerts and whatnot, which from the beginning I never though it was *that funny* (yeah sure! My bf will be your personal driver, right). Lately, since the brother doesn't know how to drive yet, he's been taking the wheel to get some practice when we're all going to the same place. This I think it's fine.

Yesterday though something new happened. My bf has been driving his brother's gf home when she's over visiting, but my bf was tired last night and he let his brother drive her home instead. Now this made me realize he's totally fine with his brother taking the car, which I then asked him if this was gonna happen more frequently, to which he replied ""probably, yea"".

Now I've been with my bf for almost 8 years now. I've known his brother for almost that long too, and his brother has never been that good with money. He buys things on a whim like a ukelele and drops the lessons soon right after, that kind of stuff. He also never made the habit to save up until very recently now that he says he wants his own car but lending him our car this easily makes me feel that he'll get very comfortable with his current situation and drop his motivation.

I don't like the idea of his brother who has not been putting the same effort like us take the car that easily. Buying it was a huge deal for both of us and I get it that my bf wants to help him but doesn't seem fair at all. I'm thinking on talking to my bf about this but I worry I may come off a little rude.

Not my 1st kiddo but will be my last. I have POTS and HG. I‚Äôm miserable and on modified bed rest. My bf(27m we will call him Gus) wanted to announce our pregnancy at his moms on Thanksgiving. We had a talk about how I would not be able to go to his moms for Thanksgiving due to how sick I am. It would have been a miserable experience all around. There would of been 12 of us crammed into their very small house with one bathroom which I would of likely spent most of my time in since I vomit anywhere from 4-25 times a day. Add all the thanksgiving smells into it and I likely would of had to set up camp. 
He agreed graciously. I told him he could still go if he wanted and even offered to drop him off or give his sister in law gas money to come get him. he decided against it and wanted to stay home with me and our kids. 
We hadn‚Äôt told anyone I‚Äôm pregnant yet, but decided we needed to tell his mom. We wanted her to understand why we weren‚Äôt coming. 
When Gus called her to tell her, she was ecstatic for us. She immediately wanted to tell everyone, including his brother and SIL, to which Gus said ‚Äúnot yet.‚Äù We wanted to tell them after Thanksgiving and explained we weren‚Äôt going to announce on social media at all. 
She wanted to know why. 
1. I didn‚Äôt want to make the holiday about me. I‚Äôm not a fan of being in the spotlight.
2. I didn‚Äôt want to undergo the obligatory inquisition that follows a pregnancy announcement. I didn‚Äôt want to have to explain how sick I was and then hear the usual rapid fire responses of ‚Äútry ginger. Dry toast. Crackers. Unisom.‚Äù Etc. HG doesn‚Äôt work that way. It‚Äôs exhausting trying to explain that it isn‚Äôt morning sickness. Especially when compounded by POTS. 
3. His brother and SIL suffer with infertility. She has been trying for years and his brother wants a child badly. I can‚Äôt imagine being them and having someone waltz in that already has children and they announce ‚Äúoh btw we‚Äôve done it again!‚Äù Especially on Thanksgiving 
4. all my other pregnancies have been filled with drama (addict ex) or have ended in loss. I want one quiet pregnancy. The older I get, the more private I become. In truth we are not planning on posting on social media about it all until after the baby is born. 

She didn‚Äôt like our reasoning for not announcing on Thanksgiving and focused on how ‚Äúwe couldn‚Äôt put our lives on hold for his brother and SIL‚Äù 
so when his brother got home from work she made him call Gus. In the background of the phone call she kept hollering ‚Äúgo on and tell him Gus! Tell him your exciting news!‚Äù 
Feeling backed into a corner, he told him. 
I was furious and told Gus that I would not be sharing any further information with his mother the rest of the pregnancy. I‚Äôm now worried she is going to post all over Facebook about it. He thinks I‚Äôm overreacting but I think he needs to set some hard boundaries with her. Which he won‚Äôt do because he doesn‚Äôt want to confront her or upset her

She has mental illnesses that definitely don't help with it, but I tolerate it because I care about her.

Anyways. Like it says on the label, sometimes she says or does things that irritate me and force me to bite my tongue. Things such as:

-Way oversharing personal details to people she just met, often making them uncomfortable.

-Only talks about herself and never asks about the other person in a conversation.

-Constantly negative and pessimistic.

-Manipulates family and friends using guilt trips.

-Plays the victim card when things go wrong. It takes her weeks - sometimes MONTHS - to get over said things.

-Puts herself in bad situations and never learns from her mistakes (she usually blames her mental illnesses and/or someone else).

-Treats her dog better than her own son.

-Reliant on Marijuana to regulate her mood and appetite, is unbearably miserable without it. Insists it's not a problem even when therapists suggest that it is.

-Various little nitpicky things, like: not screwing caps tightly back onto bottles, leaving lights on and doors open, not charging controllers, stacking bowls and plates together in the cupboard when putting them away, etc.

And if you try to call her out on any of this stuff, she'll play any card in the book to not take accountability for it.

Am I the asshole or the opposite? It's really hard to tell because she may have me gaslit.

The warehouse manager (36M, I think his youth is a factor) has been running cash poker games for the dock workers (30s/40sM) during the workday for the last couple months.

Not in the afternoon or the end of the day when everything is done, in the morning before the day's orders are prepared to ship. And also in the afternoons, but once the work is done it's not a problem.

This affects me two ways. First, I've been defaulted to lookout and have to call them when they need to come do their jobs. Second, pushing prep to the afternoon puts me at risk of having to stay late if a problem order isn't brought to my attention until late (the dock workers can load the truck and leave, I'm stuck figuring out the paperwork).

I've gone to Warehouse Manager multiple times about being uncomfortable with both aspects. Each time he's told me he understands, and then nothing changes. I even played the crying card last week and they still only worked 2 hours this morning.

I'm unsure about going to our boss because that's a pretty nuclear option.

My mom and Aunt Sarah‚Äôs children found out when people started calling and texting them to offer their condolences. Mind you: Aunt Sarah was still alive but about to be taken off the ventilator. Everyone was horrified. My cousins hadn‚Äôt even had time to process or inform most people that she was even sick.

I am the oldest of my siblings (36yo) and was disgusted, but content to let it be. However, my siblings pointed out the ongoing pain that was being caused to my cousins and encouraged me to respond. I was furious, and after some thinking about it, I put her on blast in the comments. I did not have her cell phone number to directly contact her and thought commenting on the post was the fastest way to get her to take it down.

I commented, ‚ÄúWhat the f\*\*\*, Aunt Kate? Why would you post this before even family has been notified? Do you really want the first way people find out to be from social media? You took the time during all of the grief to post? This is sick.‚Äù I refrained from pointing out that it was an outright lie because I wasn‚Äôt sure if anything had transpired since I last heard from my mom. 

She responded at some point because I saw a notification. However, she also then deleted my comment, so I couldn‚Äôt see what she wrote.

I followed up again after seeing she had deleted my comment, ‚ÄúAnd you are \*so distraught\* that you‚Äôre actively monitoring your social media post and deleting comments that are pointing out how f\*\*\*ed up this is? How dare you.‚Äù

A couple of minutes later, my mother starts to text me hysterically, because Aunt Kate is now telling her the ‚Äúnasty‚Äù things I am saying about her. Aunt Kate also blocked me. I told my mom that I was not sorry, she never removed the post, she loved the attention she was getting from ‚Äúbreaking the news‚Äù on Facebook, and she was a C-word for taking it up with my mom instead of addressing it with me. 

Aunt Sarah survived longer than expected after she was taken off the ventilator and didn‚Äôt actually pass away for several hours after the post. 

After the fact, one of my friends told me that my Aunt Kate was also grieving, and IATA for putting her on blast in a public forum. I think she deliberately stole a personal, intimate, and tragic moment that I my cousins had the right to share in their own time.

I grew up in a very accepting household for lesbians, so when I came out in 2018 everything was fine. My family helped me discover that I am also asexual and non-binary, too. I figured out I was Polyamorous a few months ago and they were the first people I told. By this point I have been with my partner for 6 months (now 10).

Every week they ask me whether or not I have told them that I found out that I'm poly and every time that I reply with no, I can see their faces contort into something that looks similar to anger but not quite. 

I asked my friend in college (18F) (I live in a country where you go to college at 16, not 18 and its mandatory) what I should do because, in all honesty, I am completely terrified to tell my partner. I'm almost positive that they're monogamous (the complete opposite of Poly, if you didn't know) and I'm almost positive they'll be disgusted with me. She didn't know what to tell me and just said to think to myself if I was positive, I was Poly (I am). I asked her that a few weeks ago and now, whenever she asks if I had told my partner and I say no she always texts me (if it's over messages) that I should just rip the band aid off and if it's Irl she just looks away and continues with whatever she was doing.

Still confused and terrified, I turned to the person I trust the most despite them being an online friend. They(17NB) sympathise with me as they, too, are scared to tell their partner something. I told them today because, even though I only know them through a screen, I was still scared to tell them. They told me to ask what my partner thinks of polyamorous relationships, but my partner is smart, and I know they'll catch on even if I say ""hypothetically"".

Earlier today my parents finally told me that I was an asshole for ""hiding"" this from my partner. I'm not trying to hide it; I'm just trying to gain the courage to actually tell them. And to make matters worse I've begun to gain a crush on a girl in my science class (and I still love my partner).

So, I was driving my bike at around 11 pm. I almost always pick up hitchhikers as late at night public transport options are limited and expensive and who doesn't like to help a fellow human? However, by coincidence so far all the hitchhikers I have picked up were male. 

Today I saw a woman asking for a lift and my first thought was ""What woman in her right mind ask a stranger for a lift"" and the now famous on reddit scam videos (where a woman asks for a lift and if the person stops, a gang attacks and tries to steal their stuff) started playing on the back of my mind and I just drove off.

I was a manager in retail and had my period. 

When I'm on my cycle I always put the tube back in its original wrapper and wrap that, and any used products, up really well in toilet paper before going in the covered bathroom trash can. Then I try to hide it underneath some paper towels I have when washing my hands.

Unfortunately, most times managers couldn't leave the store without another manager to perform the returns or any complicated transactions. So taking out the trash is one of the duties of associate team members unless there was another manager to cover the floor. Then a manager and an associate could go take care of it together.

So I asked a male associate to take out the trash.

He came back complaining that he could see a tampon in the trash. Telling me I should dispose of them better.

When he brought it up to me I said, ""You didn't have to go through it, just toss it in the dumpster."" half-heartedly.

""I didn't, it was on the side of the bag, open.""

I asked, ""Were you not expecting to see tampons in the bathroom trash with a staff of 95% female?"" jokingly. 

imo tampons are expected to be in the bathroom trash. Not a surprise or anything. It was wrapped up and wasn't expected to just ""fall out"" for everyone to know I'm on my cycle. 

I'm not embarrassed by being on my cycle but I'm always very clean, and not just for sanitary sake but because of the stigma with periods.

I am sensitive about my smell, doing very physical sport and my dad telling me I stunk after heavy exercises. I shower twice daily (needed as I live in a desert) and use MENs deodorant stick, antiperspirant spray periodically during the day and top up with parfume throughout the day especially after a smoke. Recently after a minor disagreement, out of the blue she tells me ‚Äúand another thing, some people close to you at work are saying that there is an odour to you‚Äù. This for me is strange as I barely interact with anyone at work, I am never in the staffroom or spend much time with anyone, in addition my students often tell me I smell nice and I have had multiple coworkers ask what my parfume is. She told me that she just wanted to be kind and that she didn‚Äôt want me to get hurt. I took this under consideration and evaluated if there was anything I could do to fix this. I asked my flatmate who I am closest with if she or any of those in our circle had said anything and she said no. 

The next day my flatmate who is friends with her approached me to check on me as this had an effect on me making me feel a little humiliated and hurt and flatmate wanted to check if I was ok. Flatmate stated that she has never experienced said odour but that coworker had approached her and asked if she had smelled me before. This upset me as it became clear that they were discussing this in the staffroom. I told my flatmate that what hurt the most is that this friend would not say who had been speaking about me but kept insisting that it was people ‚Äúclose to me‚Äù. 

The next day I received multiple aggressive texts from said friend who accused me of telling my flatmate that I had told her, that this friend had said it was flatmate. Mind you I had not once said anything negative about this friend and was still under the impression that she had just wanted to be kind. I told her to ask the people she was discussing me with, and not me as I had not said anything bad against her, nor had I implied or said that she had named anyone. She then continued and said that ‚Äúshe was just trying to be kind, but some people just didn‚Äôt deserve her kindness‚Äù. At this point I again told her I had done nothing wrong and that if that is how she felt she should just take her kindness elsewhere. She BLEW UP, demanding that I say this to her face, telling me to come to her class and have the BALLS to say it to her. I told her that in no way would I solve a personal matter at work and that she should be professional. I just feel that her ‚Äúkindness‚Äù was destroyed by her aggressive attacks on me despite me not having done anything she was accusing me of.

At this point I was drunk and ignored him all night while badmouthing him and telling my friends obnoxious stories about him such as the taste of his semen, if he is shaved down there or not etc etc. And after a while  my best friend and I got down and started twerking in front of everyone. At this point he was furious but he just avoided me because he didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene again. 

Then one of his friends got into a fight with another guy over a trivial matter and my boyfriend went to support him but I asked him a 100 times not to go he just ignored me and didn‚Äôt consider me at all.

They are not having a tour and their only stand-alone concert currently available is in another country. I have been to this country before, but on a study abroad trip with a large group several years ago, however I have been open about wanting to return there. 

The news of this artist not having a tour is extremely recent and I was devastated when I found out. This concert is the first for their newest release and I would love to be there for it. I was doing research on flights and hostels this morning and I would be able to get a relatively inexpensive plane ticket (for this trip at least). I told my boyfriend (26M) and asked if maybe he wanted to help pay for a portion of the ticket in lieu of a Christmas gift (we have a pretty big budget for each other). He was not enthused about the idea of me going alone but is not interested in going himself. I said that I would be totally comfortable going alone and he said that he didn't love the idea because of safety. I mentioned that I've traveled alone many times across the US, though not internationally. I know myself and I'm not particularly worried about the travel or the location, as the city I'm going to is rather safe. I'd argue it's safer than where we live now. This country also speaks our native language, so there wouldn't necessarily be a language barrier.

I brought it up again a bit later in regards to the flight and he said that I was not being very considerate of his feelings because he was worried about my safety. I reiterated that I do not need his permission to go and he understood that.

I know you're all going to say break-up with my boyfriend, but I do think he's coming from a good place. He is very worried about me traveling alone. When I started to tell him about the potential trip, he said he would feel a lot better if someone went with me. I told him that I felt totally comfortable traveling by myself and I didn't want to put the financial burden onto another person. I'd say I'm the biggest fan of this artist out of everyone I know. And I also feel that if he truly wants me to travel with someone he could come with me, as he has also expressed interest in traveling to this location and it's not like he's broke, he just doesn't want to spend his money on that because this concert isn't important to him, which I totally respect. I just feel that if you're not willing to come with me, you forfeit your right to being worried. I'm not going to forfeit the opportunity to see this artist when I can afford it myself (even without a Christmas contribution) and get the time off. This is something that's important to me.

The topic. I have many lectures on Monday and due the pandemic affecting my motivation to study, I have been having trouble keeping up with the courses and being more stressed (my mother is aware of this). So, I postponed our talks twice from Sun to Wed, a day we, in the past had our routine calls on, and because I have Thu free. During our second postponed call on Wed, I told her this and that I preferred to do this for the next few weeks because I had more time on Wed nights. Somehow she started saying how we haven't talked in so long (10+ days or something), which is a lie because we had talked the previous Wed (7 days ago), the first postponed call. It's annoying being berated for something that didn't happen, but the conversation continued. She then said how she works 8 hours a day and wakes up early and doesn't deserve this from me. While she works a job that is physically demanding, she doesn't work more than average and she acts and thinks she is entitled to whatever she desires of me and when I do something that goes against that, she says how I'm making her sad, but I don't think I'm responsible for any of that nor for making her happy. And in regards to her job, with how aggressively opinionated she is to me, she has lived in a country for 10 years now where she has yet to formally learn the language (somehow she always drops out of the language course) and is doing the same job she started which has no required qualifications and that she got without even speaking the language. That is to say, she has put no noticeable effort into improving her situation. So far I haven't told her any of what is written here, but those are my thoughts on everthing. After saying she doesn't deserve this, she went on saying that I don't do anything in life and that I should have time to talk whenever, and that's when I first replied ""if you think I do nothing, then I'm ending the call"" and I did.


I was offended that she was, once again, minimizing/devaluing what I do and it feels like she spat in my face when she knows my struggle (she has also tried to use my struggle to her advantage to coerce me to visit her during summer). I also live alone, so I need to take care of myself. She is also a hypocrite since she broke her leg last year and while recovering and actually doing nothing during her day, as she had to stay home and rest, she would only call her mom at the end of the day, to which my grandmother told her that if she's at home all day doing nothing, to call her during the day instead, which my mom didn't do.

Yay me!

Last weekend, I decided to go out for drinks by myself (caught up with a few of my friends). Aside from doing it to celebrate, I'm doing it because I haven't in the past 7 years, due to the following:

* Money issues (insolvency, nearly went bankrupt)
* Birth of children (5 and 2)
* Death of my father-in-law
* Death of my grandmother
* Conflicting work schedules between me and my wife
* The Big C shutting down all the bars.

During these same 7 years, my wife went out with her friends plenty of times and I had no problem with it whatsoever. 

However, the minute I sit down at the barstool, I get a text from my wife that the power went out. Dialog is as follows:

&gt;Wife: Power's out  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife: Come home  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Fuck off.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife: My phone's at 38% I cant charge it what if there's an emergency  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Put it on low battery mode.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife: Can you just come home?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No, it's my first night out in 7 years. Stop being a big baby and make it work

Throughout this whole ordeal, my 5 year old was a bit unsettled and nervous, while my 2 year old slept like, well, a baby. Regarding the phone situation, she took the 5 year old to the car to charge her phone. 2 year old would not have noticed a thing, he slept so sound.

Anyway, my wife kept on asking when I'm coming home, and I told her I'll get home when I get home. Even if I did get home, what was I supposed to do? Go up and climb the power poles? Fat chance. There was nothing I can do, and she was just trying to sabotage my night. I planned to stay out until last call anyway, but I still stayed out until last call purely out of spite at that point.

Power came back about 2 hours after it went out, so it was just her trying to ruin my night. I can't control the weather, I can't control the electricity. Sorry.

In the aftermath when I got home, she was mad at me for how I handled it. She said that this was a ""crisis"" and I proved to her I'm unreliable in a crisis.

That's not a crisis. IT was, at best, an inconvenience. It was a temporary unavailability of a luxury item.

In her diatribe she also said she was ""never going to have sex with me again,"" but the next night, she gives me the best sex I ever had. You sure showed me. I learned my lesson, sweetheart. /s",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4833933,public,top,self,AITA for staying out until last call?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z72qd4/aita_for_staying_out_until_last_call/,all_ads,6,,,,

 So, we both decided to visit a shopping Centre for some Black Friday shopping that was an hour away from the City that we live in. We went together and decided to go back together at 5pm. He bought the return ticket online and I bought it in the bus. We were waiting for the already 40 min late bus with a bunch of other frustrated people( the transportation system in the country we live in is horrible to say the least). When it finally arrived it was already half full and the bus driver was nervous and shouting that he'll only accept online tickets as they have priority. Since the taxy coming back would cost me 90Euros, and the next bus would be in ""another 20 min"" I told my friend to say that we were a couple and that we came together in order for the driver to accept me as well. When we finally came to the driver he said in an agitated manner that he can't accept me and only let my friend on. He entered without any hesitation and I stepped back. I expected he would at least be a gentleman or show any interest in trying to help find an alternative to go home. But no, he just left me there.

so to be honest for the first two weeks i was bad at my job. all i do is take boxes of fruit and salads and put them out. i‚Äôm just a produce stocker. i felt usually there wasn‚Äôt anything to stock, as the morning shift (i‚Äôm afternoon shift) will have already stocked everything we have and the things we needed we didn‚Äôt have in the cooler. part of this was due to my lack of attention, and part of this was because of the lack of training i‚Äôve received. another thing is that my girlfriend works in the bakery and every night she has to do the dishes and clean the floors by herself. so since i thought i had nothing to do, i would go help her. but my boss did not like this at all. which is fine, i completely understand why, i‚Äôve  stopped helping her close and i‚Äôve gotten better at my job, i‚Äôm always busy now.

this is where i feel my boss has crossed some lines. we‚Äôre allowed to break together, there are no rules against this so we break together every day. but about two weeks ago we went 10 minutes over our break time on accident. when we left to get mcdonald‚Äôs (its right across the street a five minute walk) we saw our boss leaving to go home, already clocked out. we waved to him, he waved back and smiled, everything was good. but after that while we were walking i kissed my girlfriends cheek. we‚Äôre fairly confident he saw, because he went back inside the store, timed us, and when we came back told us we were no longer allowed to break together. the both of us think that he did this cause of the kiss. this is the only time we‚Äôve gone over our break time.

also, at our job all the departments take out the trash to the same trash compactor. one time my boss took out her trash for her just so we wouldn‚Äôt interact with each other at the compactor. another time i walked by the bakery and ran into my boss and he then proceeded to grill me for like five minutes straight as to why i was walking past the bakery. i was going to the bathroom, i have to go past the bakery to get to the bathroom. he seems to be genuinely upset at the thought of me just looking at my own girlfriend 

i never pull this card but these past few months i‚Äôve really felt that my boss treats us unfairly because we‚Äôre in a gay relationship. yes i understand that i have not been the best employee, but i have since improved and his treatment towards me and my girlfriend has not. he doesn‚Äôt treat anyone else like this, and there are multiple people who have break buddies as well. none of them are forbidden from breaking with each other.
