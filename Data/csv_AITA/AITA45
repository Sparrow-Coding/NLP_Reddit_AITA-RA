We had been considering it for a while and are fully committed to getting married and starting our family together. After a while of looking, she found a nice place with plenty of space for us and her 2 kids from a previous relationship to settle down and call our own. 
When finalizing everything, she informed me her sister and her sister’s fiancé wanted to leave the place they were renting and move in with us until after their wedding was over and they had saved up enough to find a new place for themselves. The previous owner of our new house had turned the small upstairs space into his “man cave” and there was enough space for her sister and sister’s fiancé to turn it into a small temporary apartment of sorts. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea but she said it would be a temporary thing and it would help with the bills for the time being, so ultimately I caved in and complied as they are really good with helping out with my GF’s two kids. 
Her sister’s fiancé quit his job prior to their wedding this October, so as of now there is no timeframe of when they may finally attempt to find their own place. On top of that, my GF’s older brother recently found out his wife was cheating on him and my GF and her sister invited him (and his 2 kids) to come move in with us until he can get back in his feet again. I was never asked once or checked with at all about this idea. I just found out that he is basically planning on turning our whole garage into his own little apartment space, but until he does that he will be crashing in our living room. 
I basically am losing every room in the house I could enjoy some me-time in besides me and my GF’s bedroom. I’m on the verge of telling her how fed up I am with all this and moving out until it can be OUR home.

With Christmas coming up, I don’t know how to get people gifts because I can’t afford to spend anything. My solution is to make art. I’m not a perfect artist, but I’m not bad by any means.

I told one of my friends about it and he said he thinks it’s really cheap and that I should tell my family to not get me gifts if I can’t get them any in return

My logic is that if I get like a $20 gift from someone, that’ll be about 2 hours of work from them, right? But for each of these pieces it’s going to take me 4-8 hours. Plus they’re heartfelt and a personal planned concept for each family member.

My friend insists that it’s cheap and I don’t deserve anything gifts from them if I go through with this. Maybe he’s right and I’m the asshole for it? I don’t deserve something of monetary value if I can’t give anything of equal or close to equal value. 

Maybe he’s upset that he isn’t getting anything from me? I don’t have time to make everyone gifts, but I don’t expect anything from those outside my family (though I wouldn’t complain if I did get anything).

I am pretty sure I had that rsv thing that's going around. Coworkers had asked how I was feeling and we got to talking about the symptoms, so I decided to share my experience. 

I described how I didn't have a stomach ache, but that I had been coughing so much that it made me throw up. As I was getting to that detail, one of my coworkers ""Bella"" walked in (she missed most of the lead-up to that part). 

She cut me off mid sentence, although everyone else in the room had been actively listening to me, and said, ""No talking about throwing up in the lunch room!"" I looked at her and thought she was kidding but could see that she was not. 

I said, ""Oh, is that a rule?""

She said, ""Let's make it a rule."" 

I was a little annoyed that she cut me off especially when I was mid sentence and she had missed the context for the story, and that it was in the middle of a conversation that other people had chimed in with, too, and no one else seemed perturbed by before she waltzed in. 

Her shut-down response ended up making me feel weird, like I was gross or something for thinking it was ok to talk about something like that. I shook it off and stopped talking, but I haven't eaten in the lunch room since then.

I guess I didn't like feeling censored or to be sort of made to feel like I was disgusting or tone deaf. I don't know exactly why it bothered me so much. That day, after work, she said she was sorry for telling me not to talk about that, and I said, ""oh, it's ok."" 

I still haven't eaten in the lunch room since that happened, but I'm not a big eater anyway, so it hasn't been a big deal. I'm not avoiding anyone, but I have started to associate the room with negative feelings, not to be dramatic or anything... it's more that I'd rather take a breather and not be stressed out during that 30 minute break than to eat, at least for the short term.

So I had a best friend for about a year and we were really close. Anyways when talking about exes she brought up an ex she didn't talk to because she thought he was a bad person, I, of course, support her decision and declare that i hate him for hurting her. Anyways a few months after that she tells me she texted him out of the blue, I question it but she tells me that she isn't getting together with him just wanted to talk. I find this okay and eventually also join the group to have more friends. At first, I was not attracted to him, but as I got to know him he was really sweet and kind of the first person I could open up to. Knowing full well the girl code, I ask my friend multiple times if it is okay to date him, she says yes multiple times and even tries to push me to ask him. I ask him and we start dating, and now because we were far apart we could go on dates or anything like that but we did do things on the phone. I'll put this in here for more story context, I'm kind of a s\*x crazy person and we already had done a lot of inappropriate texts and pictures, so it was finally time to do it when he had come to visit me. We had agreed not to share this information with my friend because of the fear that she would be mad and freak. I was fine with this because I thought it would be extremely awkward to talk about. Anyways after we had done it, the next day I visited my friend and she was talking about how she liked how I never lied to her, feeling guilty after that I told her. She was indeed mad about it, more to me even though apparently my boyfriend said he wouldn't have s\*x with me. Apparently, I had broken the girl code ( which I didn't as I said I asked multiple times), and also I had broken a promise which after I looked through our texts there was no such promise! I apologized for something I didn't do multiple times, she said she forgave me and said we could be friends and I let it go. After a while, though it seemed like she would not let it go, and eventually yelled at her out of the blue for putting me through emotional turmoil and never apologizing or admitting you were wrong. She yelled back saying that i was being ridiculous for bringing this up and that we were toxic for each other and we shouldn't be friends. I agreed but still never got an apology.

We agreed to go over a month ago and they have already bought tickets. Recently there has been issues between us, his sister (26f) and her bf/child’s father (28m). Recently my bf texted his mom (53f) asking for advice on how to handle the situation without his sister throwing a tantrum. I told him not to do this because I knew the situation would escalate to something like this. His mom took it upon herself to ignore the point of the text and ended up calling his sister the next day (we don’t know what exactly was said but it was enough to get her bf to call my bf). I believe she did this on purpose because she called his sister right before she came home where I was babysitting. I had previously agreed to watch her child before all of this happened. Fast forward I tell my bf I do not want to go to this Christmas festival because of all that has transpired between all members of his family. I do not want to be around any of them nor pretend like everything is okay. My bf completely has disregarded my feelings and says we need to go because the tickets have already been bought and that his parents will be upset. I feel like he cares more about his parents (this isn’t the first time) than how I feel and how comfortable I am in a situation. 

I don’t know what to do at this point and I am not comfortable being around his whole family but he doesn’t seem to care. So AITA for deciding not to go?

Me and a group of her other friends decided, as a gift,  to create a ""Friend over the Years"" hamper. Lots of personalised gifts that represented different stages of her life (E.g. t-shirts, thermoses, certain snack foods), each paired with a photo of her from that time period. We handed the gift over to her on her birthday and the reaction was lukewarm, but seemingly grateful. But this wasn't my issue.


She went quiet for about 6 months after that. Another friend in the friendship group then messages me saying she's been confronted by Lisa, as the gift was a disappointment. Lisa has told her she wanted individual gifts, as ""group"" gifts are lazy. Lisa told this friend she's welcome to let me know about this. The other friend was super stressed out by this, as she's the type to really blame herself when things go wrong.


I ended up calling Lisa to talk about it. She reiterated what she had said to the other friend, but backtracked a little saying that she wasn't upset with me over the gift, more the others. I got quite upset over the phone, being quite blunt that it wasn't okay, that we put a lot of effort in, and that it's ungrateful to respond that way. She didn't have to like the gift, but to get upset about it was immature. She got upset and apologized for upsetting me, and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't yell or anything, but I was pretty blunt and even compared her actions to those of a person she really doesn't like (""that's the sort of thing so and so would do"").


Since then I've gotten long periods of silence. I eventually asked what was up. She told me that she's been reflecting on what happened, and that she didn't deserve to be spoken to that way, and especially didn't deserve to be compared to so and so. And that my confrontation made her really doubt how good she was as a person. I feel I got pretty stubborn here, and didn't back down. I also didn't really acknowledge that the way I spoke may have made her feel pretty bad. I maintained that I was still upset by the actions, and didn't do anything wrong outside of the comparison I made (which I apologised for). Since then I've been doubting and wondering if maybe I was the asshole in this situation. We havent really repaired things, and I'm feeling that I should've been more mindful in how I responded to her.

My annual income is about 4x hers. 

When it comes to big purchases like a car or home I often ask if she can contribute. The response is almost always extremely negative immediately. I’ve resorted to a point where I calculate the finances and assume 0 help.  If I can afford it then we can’t afford it.  

For her it’s a history of a job she doesn’t want to be in and years of regret before she met me. I often give career advice and write many of her thank you letters following interviews. But I obviously cannot do the interview.  Some of my career advice has been met with negativity right away.  

Tonight we looked at an apartment and it’s a stretch. She loved it.  So before I even asked I prefaced my question with please don’t be mad but how much can you contribute.  She feels as though there’s an expectation that whatever number she says is never enough. I say it could be 0 it could be 1,000. At this point, I’ve told her, I expect nothing. 

I admit my tone can be negative sometimes.  But I suppose my patience has been running low with respect to her job.  She’s been wanting to change since the day I met her about 6 years ago.

I said of course and he went to look up showtimes/buy tickets again but I remembered last time I couldn't make it and so I said that we should hold off in case something comes up. He said fine. We planned to go yesterday and so when he was on his way home from work he asked me to find tickets- but when I looked it up it looks like they stopped showing the movie in theaters already. I told him this and he got really sad again, I said we could just watch Black Panther but he said he didn't really want to. I said okay let's just get sushi then but he said that he was really looking forward to watching Knives Out. I said it's not a big de, the movie is coming out soon on Netflix anyway, and he said ""yeah I guess"" but didn't really seem that excited for our date anymore. When he got home he said he wasn't sure if he wanted to go out anymore and that he had work to catch up on. I was kind of upset by this because I've been stressed all week and I needed this to de stress, he literally knows that but he still wanted to cancel. We ended up going out and I was able to get all the stuff I needed to off my chest (thank god) but on the way home a fight kind of started and we've been on shaky terms ever since.

Some of us invested our capital (myself - $18k), all of us volunteer in different ways/amounts. The business has not grown much, barely survived the pandemic, and we just aren't that competitive. My role was to get the thing up and running in the first 1-2 years (HVAC installation mostly but also server) and not provide any major labor after that. That was two years ago and I'm still putting in regular (unpaid) hours as a server 1-3 days a week to help keep the thing afloat. (tips go to the business).

After having a good look at the numbers earlier this year, and how things have gone since, I told the others we should consider closing the business, and that I'm only still working here because the business needs me.

(Not relevant to the business, more my mindset, but the last several years have been the worst of my life, losing in a real estate deal, losing a career and the only good relationship I had. This business, while not the cause of my problems, exacerbated all of the things going badly in my life in a major way. I really should have just walked away two years ago when my original timeline expired and I really needed to attend to my health and personal life.)

They responded in the next meeting saying that they would let me out of the business, since it's been a big drain on me, if I gave them my shares. No hurt feelings, no debt (the business has debt but that's a liability for the business, not me nor them personally, so I don't know why that was a mention) and I can move on. They said they can run it fine without me and they want to make a go of it. 

The next meeting I told them it makes sense to end the business relationship since we want to go in different directions and I want to agree to their arrangement. However, I said I think I should get my $18k seed money back. One partner said the seed money was gone and no one should expect to get it back (he paid $0 seed money for the record) and got livid over the ask. I suggested a long term repayment plan, one that would be small payments over years that shouldn't hurt the viability of the business. Also, if the business went under and couldn't pay its liabilities, I wouldn't see most of that money anyway. I saw that as a compromise, but we didn't have a conclusion over whether I should get any money at all. We will meet again next week to try to work this out. I'm fine with not seeing most of that money again, especially if they end up closing the business anyway, but I would like them to try to give me something.

This wedding would also require my daughter and I to miss school (my daughter is in HS, I teach). 

Today my wife comes into the room wear a new dress and asked me how I like her new dress for the wedding. I go, ""what wedding?"" genuinely confused. She reminded me of the wedding I said we couldn't go to a few months ago. 

I told her that no I would not be going and neither could our daughter. State testing is that month and I don't want my daughter to miss testing. I also can't leave my students to a sub during testing without it being a really good reason. The wedding of someone I never met does not sound like a good reason to me.

I'm annoyed about her spending money on the dress already and, if she goes, her tickets, but that's her business. I said, ""The dress is beautiful, but I thought we agreed we couldn't go to this one? But you can go by yourself if it's that important. We can't. Sorry.""

NOT LOOKING TO DEBATE ABORTION WITH ANYBODY. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CARING FOR DISABLED CHILDREN.

Throwaway because my brother follows me on Reddit and I don’t want him to think I hate him.


Some background; I (F28) am the oldest of three kids (M26, and M20). When my youngest brother was 2, he suffered a severe spinal injury. He became fully paraplegic, unable to do anything for himself. He is fully “there” mentally. The moment he was injured, my parents turned me into his caregiver. I never got to go out with friends or do sports or other activities because I always had to care for my brother. My parents worked a lot, but when they were home, they claimed they needed to relax. So I never got a break from my brother. I don’t resent him, he’s a great guy, but I resent my parents. When I was 18, I moved out. My brother was sad, but he understood why. I visit my brother a few times a month, and do not see or speak to my parents besides that. 

So, my point; earlier this week my fiancé (M28) and I somehow got onto the topic of life changing injury/Illness, and he said something along the lines of, “well hey, at least we know that if we have a disabled kid, you’ll be able to care for them!”

I stopped him in his tracks. If I know my kid is going to be born with a disability that would effect their quality of life in a big way, or that would require an incredible amount of medical care, I’d have an abortion. I love my brother, but I am not going to dedicate my entire life to caring for someone if it can be prevented. I’ve seen how being disabled impacts him, and I would never voluntarily do that. But, more selfishly, I don’t want mine and my husbands, and any siblings, future to be dedicated to caring for someone.

My husband can’t understand why I wouldn’t want to raise a disabled child. He knows sacrificing for my brother hurt me, but says it made me a better person. He said what if he or a child gets injured during their life, I said that’s different. Of course I’d care for them, but I’m not going to have a child that is automatically going to need an incredible amount of care. He asked what I’d do if the kid was born with disabilities we didn’t know about, and I said it would depend on the severity. I’d get them a care nurse, or put them in a home where they could get the care they need. 

My husband is very upset. He called me an asshole, and left to go to his brothers three days ago. He won’t speak to me, or respond to texts/calls. I’m heartbroken. I love this man with every part of me, and he’s never been someone to over react, and it has me wondering if I’m the asshole. 

TL/DR; I lost my childhood because I had to care for my disabled brother. I told my husband I would not want to give birth to a disabled child, and that if I did, I would give them up. He says I’m an uncaring asshole.

A little over a year ago, I (28M) left home and moved in with my girlfriend (26F). It's not far from most of my immediate family, only about a 15 minute drive.

On every holiday, and sometimes just to get together, my dad and sisters Mandy, Bran, and Britt (26F, 24F, and 22F, respectively) all meet at Bran's apartment. They also bring my mother, who I outright despise as she's caused a lot of headache and heartache for my family. Of course, I seem to be the only one who pays this any mind, as everyone else treats her like the family matriarch.

Now, I've been in my current house for some time, and not once has any of my family even come to visit me. The most anyone has done was Bran and her now husband following me home after giving my car a jump. It's not as if they don't know where I live, and even if they don't know the address, they can simply ask me. I've told them that the only caveat would be that my mother is not welcome.

I feel it's strange that they'd rather pile into Bran's tiny apartment (mind you, there's about seven of us packed into it, along with her dog and four cats) rather than come to our house, which has plenty of room to host everyone comfortably, but most times, I simply write it off as neither here nor there.

Last Father's Day, however, I started to suspect. Bran was going to host again, but she and my dad had some sort of fight (pretty common, as they're both very hard-headed), and she called it off. I instead offered for my dad to come to my house, where me and my girlfriend could make him a nice meal. He declined rather brusquely, stating, ""No, son, I just want to stay home."" I get that he was upset, but it was starting to feel like he didn't want to come to my house at all.

Fast forward to now, and we're moving in about two months to a nicer house on the riverfront. It's in a town about two hours south of us, so I invited my dad and sisters to Thanksgiving at my house, or even to just stop by and say hello. I declined the invite to go to Bran's house, as my girlfriend needed help preparing her Thanksgiving dinner, and I agreed.  Instead, I catch hell from Britt who claims it doesn't matter, because we never visit her either (she currently lives an hour away in the big city), and all I get on Thanksgiving is a two word text from my dad.

He does a lot around our son and I usually feel like we’re doing an equal amount of work at home. But he does not do mental labour. I am the planner, and it’s a bit of a thorn in my side sometimes. 

On Saturday afternoons we normally have a play date. Our friends who we see were at another family members house and invited us to join them. The plan was to be there roughly around 2. Our toddler usually naps from 12-2 ish like clockwork. We will wake him up if he sleeps late so that he can get to sleep at night. The place we were supposed to go is maybe 30 mins away so they knew we’d be a little late. I relayed all this info to my husband. 

I was not actually supposed to go with them because I had an appointment at the same time. I was excited to have an afternoon to myself. However, I get back from my appointment at 3 and my husband is still home and toddler is still sleeping. He had gone down at 12 so had been sleeping 3 hours. I asked my husband what was going on and why they hadn’t left yet. He looked all confused saying that the baby was asleep. I asked him why he didn’t wake him so they could go. I guess he either didn’t realize it was 3 or forgot when he went down for his nap.  

I got mad and told him that he was selfish. We couldn’t go to someone’s house 2 hours after they invited us to be there with a groggy toddler who had slept too long. And now I was loosing my afternoon off and probably going to have to deal with a toddler who won’t sleep later.

She’s probably gonna throw this in my face and be like “omg you should just give him the bag look at how your dad reacted” and i’m considering it just giving it to him with a note like 

“Idk why you think i’m such a bad person, but here’s the bag. have a nice trip :)” so he can just leave me alone. But even then he’d probably be like “your doing it cause mom told you” and still be pissy about it. I just don’t want two people to be mad at me at once.

I was diagnosed as Bipolar when I was a teenager and the last two years have revealed that my mood swings have been intentionally triggered by my family. It all started with my decision to reach out to them via group chat. I sent my first text to the group January 2021 and my last December 2022. During this time, I was finally able to put my Psychology degree to use by appointing myself as the unsolicited group chat counselor. But it didn’t go as planned. I started off begging for us to get family counseling, but throughout this whole experience my family has been consistent with their claims that my efforts to heal our family unit is the result of my ‘manic episodes’. None of them know that I have an audio recorded memoir detailing my side of the whole experience.

I started my Spiritual journey a few years ago and shortly after that my Dark Night of the Soul began. At the time I didn’t know much about Spirituality, but at some point during our group chat my twin sister randomly told me I would never be the ‘Chosen One’, and that opened up a Pandora’s Box. I had never heard that term, in that context, before then. I’ve heard the term ‘Spiritual Warfare’ but until now I never had proof of its existence. My experience includes an unbelievable amount of narcissistic projection, gang stalking and it exposes several unsuccessful sacrifice attempts (for those who are Spiritually inclined). In my opinion, this was all done as a way to silence my voice. I’ve suffered in silence for 20 years, due to the belief that I was ‘crazy’, and I have finally found my voice. I’m using these experiences as a case study and I am choosing to share my findings in the format of a blog diary. 

I know we live in a world that promotes the mantra of ‘what goes on in this house, stays in this house’. But that is an outdated ideology. And as embarrassing as it might be to speak my truth, I’ve decided to use my life as proof that there is a Spiritual aspect to mental health ‘disorders’.

I, (19f), started working at a fast-food chain. I became friendly with a coworker (19m) who works there a lot because he's not in school. Let's call him Kevin. I asked him to hang out because I was looking to make more friends. I knew he might be interested in me romantically but since I've never been in a real relationship before I decided to hang out with him anyway to see where it would go. We hung out for a few hours and he treated me to dinner, which is when I realized what he was looking for.

I wasn't opposed to dating Kevin- however, things took a turn when I left town for Thanksgiving break. He was texting me in a very familiar way- making all these plans and even going as far as proposing a vacation to New York with me. I tried to tell him to calm down (I think he just liked me a lot) but it was starting to make me uncomfortable. When I got back, I agreed to hang out again to give him a chance. I think I was just trying to force myself to like him. The date itself was fine, but I knew for sure I wasn't interested. 

One night, during one of our closing shifts (just the two of us) Kevin was being very flirty and touchy. I tried to think of a way to cut things off without ruining our work relationship, so I told him I thought I was gay (half-true, i'm bi). He said that didn't change anything. So, I told him I was having a hard time mentally and didn't want to hang out anymore. I thought that was the end of it and we were on the same page. 

He texted me later that night saying he loved me. I didn't respond. He barely even knew me, and thats why it freaked me out. When he texted me again the next day, I blocked him.

Here's where I might be in the wrong. When I went back to work with Kevin, I felt extremely anxious the entire time, to the point of nausea (i have pretty bad anxiety). Even his presence made me uncomfortable. He tried to talk to me but I mostly ignored him and gave short answers. I realized I wouldn't be able to work with him and texted my boss, asking her if she could schedule me different hours than him.

She informed me we were not allowed to date coworkers. I'm still pretty new, and I didn't know this. She informed the other boss. I don't know what's going to happen now and I feel like I might have caused a big problem at work. I just feel so stressed about the whole thing. 

Was it wrong of me to bring my bosses into it? I feel like he's a nice guy, despite being a little creepy. I feel terrible.

We are getting induced anywhere from 5 am to late afternoon. It all depends on the hospitals call. 

My bf was supposed to ask our friend who lives in the same complex right next door to feed our cats when we go, because once you leave the hospitals building, you can not come back in. He took care of our cats short notice (a few days,) on Thanksgiving for a day, which wasn't a big deal, but my bf is piss poor at being considerate apparently... his friend works nights as a security guard at our local mall and sometimes travels for hours to see his girlfriend.

My MIL calls asking if my hospital bag is packed, yes, is his, barely, he can pack it when he gets home. Did you call *insert friend?* ??? I thought partner would have already asked him sometime last week. Apparently not.

So I call friend and feel terrible, he was not working and just getting out of a movie. I told him the situation bc my bf didn't tell him we were getting induced at all. I explained everything. How once you leave you can't come back in, bf was supposed to ask him at minimum 3-4 days ago, and how it's not a big deal if he can't, I could ask my mother, it would just be a shitty 20 minute drive.


He took it up no problem and despite my constant apologizing and even offering him a chunk of money (from our savings, but I didn't tell him that) because we could be gone for up to over a week. He reassured me it's completely okay, and it's not a big deal. I told him thank you so much, and offered $20 again.

I (m17) live mostly with my mum (f46) and spend every other weekend at my dad's (m50). I've done this since I was like 5. My dad met my stepmum (f51) a few years after my parents split up. Lets call her B. B always wanted kids of her own and acts like I am her son.

Everything went wrong when B had a miscarriage. B developed alcoholism and caused a rift in her and my dad's relationship. I don't blame her for either of those things, as they are horrible for anyone to experience.

But she never got therapy for that loss and I do blame her for that, as it isn't demonised within my family unit (I myself have gone to therapy multiple times). I think my presence is a reminder of the child she never got to have and she's never forgiven me for my existence.

One time I planned on staying up at my dad's house for most of the summer, but a week in B snapped at me for not showering for two days, confiscated my phone and grounded me. There's been countless times where B would shout at me for things I don't remember doing on one weekend but the next time I'd come up she'd make me lunch and give me dessert after dinner. Another time I got a C- on an essay and she yelled and berated me until I cried, one of the only times my dad stood up to her. The most recent incident which happened an hour ago.

I already knew it'd be a bad weekend, her uncle had passed away that week. Everything was normal until the end of dinner, when B started telling me off for not cleaning my room last weekend I was up; I apologised, said I'd had coursework to do, when she started saying that I took stuff out of my drawers and then put them back in again (a lie) and was telling me off in a raised voice. Fed up, I told B that I had little interest in being her emotional outlet, left the table and went to my room to do my college work.

She sent my dad up about ten minutes after and he tried to tell me off for not cleaning up and I'll admit I got pissed off. I can count the times he's stood up for me on one hand, and while I know B yells at him it didn't exactly cross my mind at the time. I was angry, and just so tired of being her emotional punching bag because she has the emotional control of a toddler.

I told him that I was tired of being an emotional punching bag, bringing up those previous times. I then told him something along the lines of 'neither of us standing up to her enough' and he then left to go downstairs.

He came back up and asked me to have a conversation with both of them so we could sort it out, and I refused because everytime she does something like this we have one and nothing ever happens because 'we just forget it happened next time I come up'. He then told me something like 'you don't respect our \[his and B's\] relationship enough'/ 'you don't respect me enough' and now I feel like a complete d!ck. I know she takes it out on him when I'm not here and while I do feel like I shouldn't be her emotional outlet, I feel like snapping at him for her behaviour was a mistake.

I live in student housing, me(25f), A, B, and S. Three girls who all are amicable and in either undergrad in the honors program, masters programs or law school (me) which means our student housing is great, its a big apartment close to everything. Seems great right?

We set up a chore board for what we agreed on to do, bathroom, kitchen, living room. Totally cool with that. Then two weeks in someone added “dishes” to the board. Which had me very confused, but maybe it was just a personal reminder to do it. Then that night I get a text from B, apparently I had forgotten to wash the dishes. I was like ? I wash them begrudgingly (the dishes were overflowing the sink, none of them mine as I was my own immediately after use) I felt like a maid. Ever since, every time I have washed these girls dishes the sink is overflowing with dishes, and I am also expected to pick up the impending dishes which will get dropped off throughout the day into the night. 

I reach out via text to these girls ask to be off dish duty because I wash my own. Was not met with what I’d hoped.  B and S claimed they were far to busy and it doesn’t matter who’s dishes they are its the kitchen its a part of chores. We are ALL busy. I am in law classes my days range from 10am-9pm and 9am-9pm all in person classes, along with work and volunteering weekly, and I still have been washing my dishes. Something I completely disagree with having washed my own plates my entire life in every living situation I’ve been in. I realized I couldn’t get through to these girls after trying to explain for awhile. I just find this so chaotic and gross, just leaving dishes to pile up especially considering we’ve seen a roach im the bathroom before. But I had an idea. 

My school/apartment is in a city, theres roaches all over. Especially in the boiler room. First one I see on the floor I squash it and put it in a piece of paper towel then in a plastic bag. While alone at our place at the sink I opened the bag with the dead roach inside I take a couple pictures, then texted them:
“Hey guys. I just found this on my plate when about to wash dishes.
I squashed him with paper towels but ugh. This is why I always wash dirty dishes immediately after use, I was worried something like this could happen. I think it should be best from now on if we wash dishes immediately after use. Sorry for the gross pic.”

Damn, did that shit work. Their responses were them totally freaking out and agreeing with me. This was only a couple days ago, but it makes me so glad to see everyone washing their own dishes. My other shy roommate who never spoke up sent me a thumbs up emoji. 

Tldr: roommates refused to take me off dish duty (we wash everyones dishes in the apartment) despite me washing my own dishes. I killed a roach outside our place, took a photo of it and showed my roommates who since have been washing their own plates.

I'm using an obvious throw away because I cannot have it known what school I go to or who I'm talking about. I'm a student living in university housing and I also work for the school I attend. I'm also roommate with an RA for the dorm I live in, which I initially was completely fine with because he seemed nice enough. We got along rather well for the majority of the first semester, but as time has gone on, he's said more and more things that make me feel he shouldn't be an RA.

My main issue is all the stuff he's said about Hispanics. I'm Mexican, and although I poke fun at my ethnicity often, it's really uncomfortable and upsetting when someone else does it. Over the semester, I've been more and more scared to come home and be in my own apartment due to whatever RA is going to say to me. He's called me ""colored"" before and has made jokes to people I didn't know about the size of my family, saying that ""having a lot of kids is a Hispanic thing they don't believe in condoms"" which is a rather gross stereotype building off the idea that Hispanics are too stupid to use birth control. He's also made jokes about deportation being ""part of [my] culture"" and has asked if my dad was legal because he's an immigrant. Additionally, this RA just casually talks about sensitive information about residents such as where they live, details about roommate conflict, etc and says it isn't his job to care even though it literally is.

Last night I drafted an email to his boss about his behavior and I'm honestly terrified to send it due to fear of backlash. He holds authority over me and I'm scared that saying anything will get me in trouble because he has, to an extent, ""blackmail"" on me (ie, evidence that I drink/smoke weed underage).

I feel like it's my obligation as an employee of my university and as a student to report inappropriate behavior, but I don't want it to get back to him that I reported him. Also there's an issue of his financial aid. I know he comes from a pretty affluent family, so they would be able to afford paying for his classes and housing, but if my report does end up leading to his termination, he would lose funding for housing, meal plan, and some other fees.

Gonna try to keep this short and sweet. There’s a dog park about 5ish minutes from my parents’ house, where I take my dog, Fritz (my parents house him bc my apartment doesn’t allow German shepherds). It’s a nice park tbh, the enclosed play area for the dogs is on a hill and really big. Plenty of room to run.

Fritz isn’t a very social-play kinda dog, he just likes fetch. We chill, we mind our business. Sometimes dogs like to pick on him but he’s very patient, I swear. Gentle giant. Sometimes other dogs see us and want to join. A lot of people don’t really interact with their dogs, not really my business but maybe your dog wouldn’t be such an aggressive player if you threw the ball yourself, yk? It’s fine though, if the dog is good I don’t mind at all. I love dogs.

Today, Fritz and I are doing what we always do, I’m standing at the top of the hill throwing balls for Fritz. I think it’s important to note that I bring Fritz’s own toys (2 tennis balls and a Chuckit!™) because he has a problem with letting go of a ball unless you have another one already loaded, and when it’s time to go he wants to hold onto his most recent catch. A dog (I think it’s name was Riley) comes up, and starts immediately snapping in my dog’s face, trying to literally bite the ball out of his mouth. I try to offer her a different ball and she ignores me. So I call out “whose dog is this?” A woman (around 26-30 I think) says it’s hers, and I ask (very politely, I don’t like being rude) if she can get her dog. She seems annoyed but calls Riley over. We go back to playing, yada yada. Now Riley is actively chasing Fritz, biting him, jumping on him, and probably scaring him a bit given how he dropped the ball and backed away with his ears down. I look over and see the woman is totally ignoring her dog and talking to her friend. Fritz finally gets to me and Riley is still doing it. Fritz is much bigger, and I can tell he’s getting pissed off. I know I’m in trouble if he snaps at her bc, yk, German shepherd vs “smedium” mixed breed.

I yell to the lady “hey, can you get your dog?” This time the woman is definitely annoyed, and as she’s literally dragging her dog away says “maybe you shouldn’t do that here.” I ask what. She says “play individual games.” I say “at a park?” She says “you can do that at the soccer field” (there’s a “no dogs allowed” sign on the gate). I say “maybe you should pay attention to your dog more.” At that point I decide to pack up and go, because honestly it’s not worth the trouble and Fritz was done for the day anyway. As I’m passing, the friend goes “you didn’t have to be snarky.” “Girl fuck off” slips out before I can even stop myself. I quickly leave. Obviously I’m not proud of saying that, I usually am not aggressive. My friends and sister say I was totally in bounds but my parents say that it was totally rude and I should never talk to people like that.

but anyways so after awhile we hang out a few times but the didn’t like how I was doing i was a major pothead before this breakup and never touched any drugs other then the good ol ganja but after she ghosted me I went headfirst into abuse and did a bunch of shit drinking, popping pills, lean, acid, and cocaine etc nothing crazy like meth and shit though 
But all I told her was I did coke for the first time and had been drinking didn’t want her to know how bad I was actually doing btw it was bad I should have died of a OD but anyways she decided to once again stop talking to me for awhile 

Eventually she needed a ride from me and wanted to hang out and well the night before I went to a party and hooked up with someone and I guess they left a hickey on me

I was hungover and didn’t really look in the mirror when I got up to help them just got dressed and went out the door but after we hung out they where mad at me for having that hickey on me even though we aren’t dating anymore and once again have chosen to not speak with me anymore

I struggle a lot with that and don't socialize much because of it, and the week of my birthday is typically the only week I have with people. 

I love my friends but some are harder to get along with than others and make me feel inadequate a lot.

 So when I went to dinner with everyone, we went to one of those places where they cook in front of you n stuff, before we left I had a few glasses of champagne and we ate cake- so I was already a little drunk and not extremely hungry from all the sugar. When we sat down and our chef came, he pretty much only talked to my friend, Jane (23f) the whole time and was hitting on her the entire time- I was pretty isolated by myself at the end of the table. My friends were all taking selfies together (without me) and doing sake bombs with the cook. I ended up walking to the bathroom because I felt like I was going to start crying just cuz I felt bad. I left and came back, over the whole thing and ready to finish out dinner, and the chef was making fun of me for ordering vegetarian food instead of steak or something. 

By the time we left, I was pretty drunk so the situation gets confusing. But I just wanted a second to calm down since I figured I was just drunk or something and it's all not as big a deal as I thought. My feelings were hurt and dinner was shitty but I didn't want to ruin everything over it. When I got home I went and sat in my mother's bathroom for a second and told everyone to give me a minute so I could get it together, my mother came in and started yelling at me and telling me I was being a bad host n stuff. I got into an argument with my mom and everyone heard it which is cool when you're 23 and getting cussed out in front of all your friends lmao. 

I ended up rejoining them after I talked to my friends a bit about it, but Jane didn't talk to me much for the rest of the time and said that ""I was just pushing myself to be too social"" or something. 

I just can't help but feel like I owe everyone an apology for being an asshole- but on the other hand I feel like it was valid for me to feel upset about dinner.

We try to get together once a week at MIL and FILs house, with those of us whoveymoved away connecting remotely. We all get along well, except for one BIL - Matt (33M). 

I'm not sure exactly HOW relevant is, but I do know it definitely contributes - but Matt has bad BAD OCD. I can sympathise. My OCD is pretty bad too. But his seems to encourage him to be adversarial, argumentative, nit-picky, fatalistic, pessimistic, and in pretty much every other way, a downer. 

It's been taking a toll on the family system for some time now, but we managed - asking him to lighten up, redirecting conversation to something else, inviting him to positive outings, and socialising one on one amongst ourselves sometimes so we don't ONLY see each other with him.

But lately he's gotten SO bad that a bunch of us find ourselves actively avoiding him. But he's the only one who still lives with MIL and FIL. Honestly, he's like a dementor from Harry potter. Argues everything, sucks the joy out of every comment, takes issue with everything said...it gets to the point where we end up sitting in awkward silence all staring at each other, after he has crushed every avenue of conversation. It's almost like he doesn't WANT is to enjoy things. Anyone who tries to reason with him gets loudly, rudely spoken over by him until they give up.

I'm sure I'm gonna be asked this, so yes, he's diagnosed with depression. So far no med trial is working. We've been trying for years. His depression is described as pernicious. He sees a therapist quarterly.

The other sibs and I have talked, and we're considering saying something to him. I and my husband are the closest to him, so we all think it should probably come from us.

I am F27, best friends w depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. SOMETIMES my long lost friend psychosis likes to show herself, you know, unannounced. But we still welcome her anyway IG. To support this um, friendship, day to day - I have weekly sessions w a psychotherapist, daily meds incl anti depr, anti psychotics and sleeping meds. 

BUT WHEN THE FRIENDS START ACTING UP - my emergency lists kick into gear! Yk, one list tells me to breathe, the other list tells me to breathe again, and if all breathing fails - the emergency contact list is in play! So now, let me get into the detail of how my emergency contact list works.

My 1st contact is my long time best friend and clinical psych herself. Idk how many times ive called her and shes saved my life but she is number one on the list.
My 2nd contact is my mum but only because she has to know ig I wouldnt really call her unless the Drs needed consent for something and I cant give it so meh
My 3rd contact is therapist - but only for psychosis
My 4th contact is the hospital because if weve made it this far bro just tie me to the bed already lmao

So there is LOGIC in this list and its a tried and true list of contacts that has NEVER FAILED me.

Now now now... lets move onto my partner. Now I do have to throw the age card in bc hes 10 years older than me and it shows... I dont know how many times hes told me Im crying over nothing *sheds tear* or his other phrase ""look lady thats just how the world works"" and honestly, I dont mind his ignorant harshness lol. Esp bc he does keep me grounded for the most part. BUT! Im like dude, w that sort of mentality, you dont make the list! Nor do I want my significant other to become someone I depend on for those moments. But again, he doesnt make the list!!!!

And last week during an epic showcase of my friend panic disorder - my partner realised he wasnt on the list. I spent 6 hours at my 1st contacts house w no electronics just me and an exceptionally fluffy bed. Obvs cause I didnt have my phone, my partner wasnt able to get updates from me. Just my 1st contact. And wOW DID HE THROW A HISSY. But I had to explain to him its not ab being the first to know or being someone on the list. Its ab knowing how to handle a crisis. And if my 1st contact has decided you dont need to know something its because she is either focused ON DA CRISIS or its just not an important update. I have to trust the decisions being made my the people on the list bc im not in a space to provide my own logic...

So, my sister has a beautiful little girl that I adore so very much. She asked me and my boyfriend to be the baby's Godparents before the baby was born and we gladly accepted. We don't plan to have kids of our own, but we love all our nieces and nephews with our whole hearts. Now, baby is 4 years old and is a joy to be around. They visit us regularly, during the summer more than winter because I am a university student and business owner, so my schedule is very full. I do my best, though, to make sure baby knows me and knows I love her. Especially recently, I have been doing my best to visit with her and her brother more often. 

So, today, I was starting a term paper I have been procrastinating. It's 2,500 words, due Tuesday. Yes. I know. I have ADHD and suffer from chronic procrastination, but I make sure that is no one else's problem but my own. Regardless, I work best under pressure and my grades are pretty good (Bs sprinkled with some Cs). In the past, before my diagnosis, I actually flunked out but have managed to bring my VERY low GPA back up to nearly a 3.2. I'm very proud of myself. 

While reading my sources, I get a text from my sister asking if I could take baby from 6 pm to 11 pm this evening so she can go to her husband's company Christmas party. I told her with such short notice, I don't know if I can, since I procrastinated this paper and I'll be working on it all weekend. I told her I would let her know how much I get done and if I can get enough written to justify taking the rest of the night off, I could take baby. She told me ""No worries,"" and she'll find someone else. I figured I was off the hook. 

She messaged me once again a few hours later saying she went through her exhaustive list of dozens of people to watch baby but no one can do it last minute. I mean... duh, right? She asked once again if I can take baby, acknowledging that taking baby would be an ""inconvenience"" to me, but if I didn't my sister would not be able to go to the party with her hisband. I repeated what I said above: I don't know, but I will let her know if I can later this afternoon.

She then went off on me. Saying I should have planned my time better and that I need to spend time with my goddaughter and this is what godparents are for. I politely told her if she had told me a few days ago or even yesterday that she would need a sitter, I would have been happy to plan accordingly to make sure I could take baby, but she's still very upset with me! This essay is worth 40% of my grade and I'm very proud of how far I've come in my studies. I'm so afraid of failing again.

Our grandparents are getting older and there have been a lot of conversations in the family about what to do to prepare.

She texts me randomly one day and said she was going to reach out to a lawyer with “permission” from my grandparents about selling their house to us for “a couple of bucks” because we are the only ones they trust to do the right thing with the sale and split the money amongst our parents (her dad, my mom, and our uncle). She also told me not to tell my mom cuz she doesn’t want her to freak out.

I asked her why wouldn’t they just do that with their own kids directly. Why would it need to go through us if the intention was for our parents and uncle to inherit it equally. I told her “it sounds like a manipulative way to steal inheritance from their kids tbh”

She then goes on to defend herself saying that we are the ones with business backgrounds that get along best in the family. That the others would fight about it and we are a neutral third party.

I told her it’s ridiculous to think that as their grandchildren of only 2 out of 3 of their kids, that we would be a neutral party. I said that the idea was so wild, that it would qualify as elderly abuse.

Then she said that I was rude for calling her manipulative and then went into a long winded text about how she tries so hard to be my friend and that I never trust her. That I don’t think she does anything with positive intent and how she’s just trying to help the family. How she might have been bratty and stupid as a teen, but what has she done in the last 10 years.

She then told me I’m causing a rift in the family, that she doesn’t want someone who thinks of her that way in her life, and blocked me. I also know that she called my grandparents and bad mouthed me.

Truthfully, she has done enough things in my lifetime that make me not trust her completely.

To start, there are 5 people in my house.  Myself, my mom, my sister, her boyfriend (B), and his mom (M).  B's brother broke up with his girlfriend almost two years ago.  M, after checking with the rest of us, offered the brother (J) a place to stay for a few months to get back on his feet.  Again that was almost two years ago.  J is still in the house.  He's also staying rent free, since it was to ""get him back on his feet"".  Well he did that, then lost it all due to his bad choices.  J doesn't contribute to the house in anyway.  Asking him to do chores is usually met with a ""Really? You want me to clean \*your\* house?"" look.  The most he does is keep the back patio, where he spends the majority of his time, tidy.  He doesn't pay rent, or anything towards any of the bills. In fact the one one time he was asked for $100 to keep the electricity on, was met with him begrudgingly giving the money along with a ""Never ask me for money again!""

J has a habit of mildly inconveniencing people in the household, but making it seem innocent.  Its mostly because he's just not considerate of the fact that 5 other people live there.  My sister and I tend to get the brunt of this tbh.  He also takes complete advantage of his mother, but that's not the point of this post, just one of the reasons he annoys me.  One such incident of his inconveniencing happened yesterday and is why I'm questioning if I'm the A-hole.

J likes to take super long showers.  J also has a habit of deciding to take them right around the time I need to get ready for work.  We had big drama over it back when he first got here.  We haven't had an incident in a while.  Except it happened yesterday.  When we moved into the house, I put all my ""getting ready"" stuff in the bathroom.  Makeup, hairbrush, everything.  I don't have a mirror in my room, and its usually a non issue.  Except J decided his hungover self needed a shower right then.  Everyone else who uses that bathroom to shower, will check with any other awake occupants to be sure no one needs to use the bathroom before its blocked off for a length of time.  J does not.  If he had, I'd have gotten the stuff I needed ahead of time.

Now I'm being told maybe I should move my stuff out of the bathroom because ""how is he supposed to know \[I\] needed to go to work?""  Keep in mind that there's a calendar in the kitchen with everyone's work schedules posted on it.  So now I'm mad about the situation, and being treated like I'm a witch with a B for being mad.  I'm mad at his lack of consideration for other people and that I'm being asked to change something that has been a non issue except in regards to him.  And that the solution is for \*me\* to change something, and not to ask him to have more consideration for the other 5 people he lives with.

We grew up dirt poor and I was the one that ""made it out"". Without getting into detail I am grateful to be extremely well off and can afford to set aside a couple thousands a month for them, especially that I don't plan on getting married or having kids myself. Always made it clear there would be no strings attached (and meant it).

We're not from a western country. I ended up settling in Europe a decade and so ago, but began spending around half the year in my home country once I was able to afford it. 

My brother (22M) is gay. I'm exposed enough to American pop culture to have caught up early on (Glee fan as a teen, goes to fashion school, all his close friends are girls, you know the type), but the rest of the family are entirely clueless (or in denial). 

I am perfectly fine with that. I am not exactly straight myself but that's besides the point.

A few days ago we were hanging out alone and he came out to me. I showed him all my support but asked him to stay on the down low as long as he's not out of the country. That's not what he had in mind. He was planning on coming out publicly.

As I said, we aren't from the west. To add insult to injury we live in a random ass village that's an hour away from any proper city, so we're talking cartoonish 18th century levels of social conservatism. My parents are better than average on that end, but still extremely homophobic. 

Coming out around here is a safety issue. You could get killed. I trust my parents to be sensible enough to stick to the silent treatment after shouting bible verses at him, but the macho boys that hang out topless around the village square with gun stockpiles at home probably have different plans.

Now I'm not saying it's an inevitability but you're definitely putting yourself at too much risk. Getting killed might not be that likely but you're definitely getting beaten up at one point or the other. Homosexuality is also illegal, you'd have to get caught in the act but anyone with some judicial connections and bribe money could make a decent case regardless. 

My brother is a grown adult and should be able to make his own decisions, but this would be incredibly irresponsible and he would be throwing his life away. I told him I could help him get out of the country as soon as next week and he wouldn't have to spend a cent but he was entirely determined to come out and ""fight for his rights at home"". This is perfectly commendable and brave but I just wasn't comfortable with my brother wanting to martyrize himself for the greater good. So I found myself telling him that if he went through with his plans I'd stop financially supporting him.

To be clear this was entirely a bluff and I would never actually do that. 

He ended up backing down and we agreed on me helping him move abroad, and eventually coming out to my parents and siblings only somewhere along the line.

She began relying on me to wake her up for class and to get her food, I didn't mind it, I made sure there was food for her whenever I was back home before she was. Throughout the semester she's stormed in during my exams/woken me up at random times just to yell at me for not waking her up.

(also some context, I suffer from bipolar disorder and she is well aware of it)

 We had a class together one day. I had forgotten to bring my ruler so I asked one of our friends for one, she immediately snaps at me ""I literally gave you one as we left"" I responded ""Sorry I've just really been out of it recently"", immediately she snaps ""well I'm depressed too"". That triggered me because those were the exact words said by my previous abuser. After class, she turned to me and said ""are you upset at me?"" that's when I just lost it.I told her I didn't understand why she had to say that to me over a ruler. Then she yelled back at me saying why I made a joke about being depressed if I didn't want a response like that. I said it wasn't a fucking joke. She said, ""well I wasn't joking either, I'm also fucking depressed"". I immediately stormed off, called the school crisis line. I was sent to the mental hospital. I recieved paragraphs from her stating that ""I just didn't understand how depressed she actually was"". Still, I apologized to her first.

Earlier in the semester, we had booked a trip for the both of us that was at the end of the semester, on the day, I woke up at 9 and packed the rest of my stuff, our flight was at 12pm. I look to her and asked what she was planning to pack. She tells me ""Oh I'm not going"".I went ""What?"" ""Oh I'm not going I canceled my flight and I'm going straight home"" It was about to turn 10am, I go into the bathroom and just process what she just said and went back out and asked her why would she tell me this two hours before our flight left. No response. A little later she suddenly sends me a text saying she canceled our Airbnb too.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the week, she lashes out at me through text proceeding to unfold everything, claiming how she fails to feel guilty for not telling me about her canceling the flight because she was ""so scared of my erratic behavior"" and how living with me was like living in a minefield due to my disorder. Not to mention claiming that ""I would leave her stranded like when I had a manic episode"" when I got sent to the mental hospital by my school. Ending it off with how I had never attempted to make an effort to care for her and make it up to her after I was admitted to the mental hospital.

And they threatened me and told me not to follow. I don’t know why they didn’t want me, and i can’t recall anything bad i’ve done
 I left the discord call and the game. They messaged me that they were sorry. I refused to join.
They insisted i should be with them and kill the dragon. I accepted. So, i went through the nether, i had to rebuild the bridge they destroyed, so that i couldn’t follow. And when i finally came to the stronghold, they asked me not to take any coordinates, since they wanted it for themselves. When we finally beat the dragon i left.

It because he can take care of himself, he’s remodeled his house, he has a new truck—he has the life I thought he always deserved and also me and my cousins won’t have to fight over who will pay his bills.

Ok so here's some background knowledge on the situation. My (f43) and (m39) parents and my sisters (f17) (f19)and me have been camping at this park/resort for 2 years and we love it. However due to our neighbors having aggressive dogs we moved in 2022 to a new spot with our now neighbors (f49) and (m55) let's say their names are Bella and Mike. We knew them the previous years because we sometimes would see each other at different gatherings, family nights and game/card night etc. We all grew very close to each other in that one year by haveing football events, game night at each other's campsite just for fun, along with some other people. And pretty soon we were all giving out each other's numbers so we could stay connected during the winter. 

Me being the person I am, I would always text everyone ""good morning"" and text  everyone who answered back with a ""what are you up to today?"" text and some more small talk after that. I didn't think this was weird or anything because I had a group chat with my mom side of the family and we did this every morning so I did it with them and some campground family friends. I consider them family so I would talk with them as if they were family or a close friend saying ""what did you eat today for lunch"" or ""ummm that sounds like a delicious dinner"". However Bella would never answer back so I always texted Mike more of these things then her, cuz he was a family friend and school is boring. Pretty soon he started venting to me about his work which my dad does so it wasn't really a big deal, then one day he took me and my sister's out for ice cream after school. However it turns out that Mike lied to Bella and said that he just went to Milky Way by himself, which I apologized to him for because he got into the ""dog house"" because of me and my sisters. He said it was fine and he enjoyed spending time with us and said that there will probably be a New Year's party before my sister goes off to college.

 But then yesterday Mike told me that they can't have the New Year's party because Bella went through his phone and she thinks that were more than friends, which to be honest I can't quite wrap my head around it cuz I'm a child and I hate infidelity due to my family's past. I apologize profusely and said that ""I'm probably going to have to stop talking to you because I don't want to be hated by her, I sorry"". ""He said it's his fault, and he always messes up stuff"" and I felt bad so I said ""we can still talk just not as much and can I text her and tell her I'm sorry???"" He said ""please dont"". So at this point I don't know what to do, I can't ask my mother because she's a very confrontational person.

I’m very introverted while she’s the exact opposite. From the beginning I’ve made an effort to stay in touch consistently, even though I really dislike texting so often. It was fine until recently when she started demanding more time and attention. We’ve had several long talks about me needing time alone to recharge and how it’s nothing personal, she seemed to understand, but she’d always get offended whenever I didn’t reply. Even when I was going through some very hard times, I told her what was going on and that I needed time to process everything, but she managed to make it all about her and how depressed she got because I wasn’t there for her.

A couple months pass and she keeps demanding more time, now she’s texting me several times a day from different platforms, and whenever I replied to something she’d bombard me with more texts and asking why I haven’t replied to everything else. It drained me to the point where I didn’t want to talk to anyone anymore, she was taking all my social energy. I’ve tried to establish boundaries with her several times, but she always has a response as to why she does the things she does, completely disregarding that I’m not comfortable.

I recently came back from a trip where I took the opportunity to get the alone time I so desperately needed, she didn’t like it and posted some indirect stories about her putting all the effort and getting nothing in return.

We had an exchange of very lengthy texts, and I was already losing my patience because she kept saying it was all a misunderstanding and she wanted to call me to fix it and move on. I was already typing back something when she texted that her dog got very sick and was at the ER. After giving it some thought, I decided to still reply what I was writing, and told her that I was willing to put this aside for now and give her support, but she said she’d rather just fix this right now and get over it, while continuing to argue about the points I made. I responded that it wasn’t something that could be fixed right now, but she kept insisting, and arguing. I said arguing wouldn’t make the problem disappear, and told her I was done discussing the issue for now, but to let me know how I could support her regarding her dog. 

She just kept arguing and rambling, wouldn’t stop texting and calling, I was feeling so anxious and pressured, since she wouldn’t stop I told her again that I said I was DONE for now, and how this just shows how she’s not willing to understand or respect my boundaries. She responded with some emotional blackmail, saying how she just wanted everything to go back to normal and kept insisting that it was just a simple misunderstanding.

She doesn’t have any disabilities or other medical issues, but she still lives rent-free with her mother and refuses to get a job. My spouse, Skylar, explains that Samantha doesn’t contribute to the house in any way and won’t even pick up after herself. Yet my mother-in-law is always willing to enable Samantha.

My mother-in-law called Skylar last week because Samantha was craving pumpkin bread from this bakery by our house and she was hoping Skylar could pick it up for her. Skylar said not now because I was at work and Skylar was staying home to look after my niece, Erica. Erica just had surgery, so one of us always stayed home to make sure she was okay and had what she needed.

Samantha didn’t like this. Samantha posted a rant online, accusing Erica of being lazy and selfish and forcing others to cater to her. Samantha then said that people who expect hand-outs instead of being adults and taking care of themselves are pathetic and a drain on others.

If Samantha just wanted to be a hypocrite, I would have ignored her. But because insulted Erica, I wasn’t going to just let it side. I responded to Samantha’s rant by mentioning that she is jobless and living rent-free with her mother yet has a problem with Skylar and I helping Erica after she just had surgery. Most of Samantha’s online friends didn’t realize Samantha was living jobless with her mother and began to criticize her.

Skylar said that Samantha instigated this situation by insulting Erica, and Samantha wouldn’t have gotten embarrassed online if she just kept her thoughts to herself. Our friends are saying similar things. But a few others (mostly other in-laws) are saying that I was immature and thoughtless by responding to Samantha’s rant the way I did.

They said that anyone who matters to/affects us already knows that Samantha is a hypocrite and all my response did was create more drama. They also said I put Samantha in a bad mood and now my mother-in-law is stuck dealing with it. I feel sorry for my mother-in-law, but at the same time, she actively chooses to enable Samantha.

This week she invited me to a pizza party. I was really hesitant because I was pretty concerned about meeting her friends, like I said I’m pretty shy. I was leaning towards saying no, but I asked her if she wanted me to be there. She said yes since her other closest friends Couldn’t come and she at least wanted one of her closest friend to come. Because of what she explained I said I would come.
When I got to the party my friend tried to include me multiple times but I felt awkward so instead I sat down in her empty living room alone. 
I overheard her talking about how one of her other close friends was coming soon. 
After being there for maybe 30-40 minutes I decided to leave because I became I felt awkward sitting there alone and I was too scared to talk to the other people there. In addition I was almost in tears since I was anxious. 
My plan was to leave quietly and text my friend that I left since I didn’t want to make a scene about it and was scared they would juge me. But when I got to the door my friend saw me and ask if i was leaving and why. I explained that I was leaving since I didn’t want to be there.

I think that puts me in the 1-2nd percentile of kids my age? Anyway. It is extremely hard to find clothes for myself. Even clothes that are XXS juniors tend to have necklines too low, or sleeves too long. 

In addition to this, it is even harder to find clothes that sixteen year olds would wear in my size. I often have to pick from the kids' section at stores. It feels awkward sometimes, going to high school in shirts that say ""𝐈'𝐦 𝐦𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐲'𝐬 𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬"" or ""🎆🎆🎆𝓜𝓪𝓰𝓲𝓬 𝓲𝓼 𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓵 🦄🦄🦄🦄"", but I know beggars can't be choosers, so I put up with it.

They would go so perfectly with a pair of loose jeans, and it's somewhat of a closet essential for girls in my school. These are in such nice colors too, a lavender and a sage green. I'm over the moon.

I ask my mom if they are for me, and she says yes. However, she is saving them for me to wear at an event that is in August next year. She doesn't want them to get discolored by then, so I can't wear these now. 

Oh...ok. I ask her if she knows where she got them from. She shows me the same set online. I ask her if I can order another one, since she doesn't want the these to get ruined, and these are relatively cheap with free shipping. She says no. I prod her more. So am I just not able to wear this kind of top until August next year? She says not to argue with her, and that I can't always get what I want. 

The last part of her speech seems fair, right? Thing is, the very day before that, she was encouraging me to order lots of stuff from F21 because she would return them if they didnt fit. The order came THAT DAY, and she knew I had to return 7 out of the 8 items. She's right. In terms of clothes, I absolutely can't get what I want. So when there's something that fits, and that I want, shouldn't I get it? Especially if she has been telling me to look for clothes?

Ever since then, I've been giving her a little bit of the cold shoulder. 

I feel that my mom is being unreasonable. But I also recognize that it is a privilege to find clothes that fit me at all, and I might just be a whiny teen.
