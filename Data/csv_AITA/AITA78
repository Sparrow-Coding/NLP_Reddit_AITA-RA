It was a lovely late thanksgiving gathering because me and my boyfriend spent thanksgiving apart, so his family made a second gathering so they can invite other relatives too. 

This gathering was located at his mother’s house, which he is visiting. When we went in, there was this beautiful fully decorated around 14ft tree, that was put up on the first of November. 

It was lit up and had many ornaments, it was beautiful decor. We all ate and conversed, it was great! Until, it wasn’t. 

They have this huge poodle who is the cutest thing, but, is too hyper. I was sitting on the sofa talking to my boyfriend’s sister. 

I was playing with the dog, got given treats from his father and was walking with them. The dog took the whole pack of treats out of my hand, so I ran to get it. No one was in the main room at this point and his sister went to go freshen up. I was chasing the poodle, when the poodle went behind the tree, I followed, I ran &amp; the light wires wrapped around my feet. I tripped, the light wires tightened on the tree and it fell backwards. It didn’t fall all the way &amp; it just landed on the wall. But, the ornaments fell off and it was a mess. 

Three people came running because it made the most embarrassing sound that could be heard by anyone near by. I was beside the tree that was now crooked backwards &amp; the mother came and started gasping. My boyfriend checked on me, but, the mother was distraught… for the tree (I still can’t believe this). 

The men started to put it back in place even though it was heavy and the mother was still in a frenzy. I apologised, asked her if she needed compensation for any damage, my bf told me that it’s fine and i left with my boyfriend. 

I was really close with his mother but now she hasn’t even responded to my message.

   I (16F) Dara, had a friendship of 5 years with two girls who I consider my best friends, Amelie and Barbara (16F). Last year our friend group grew a lot, 8 people, and we became very close with one girl, Liz(17F).
  We had the habit of gossiping a lot, but nothing mean, just stuff that people had said or done, we even had a burn book like in mean girls. So as the time went by Barbara and Liz started to get really mean about other people's bodies. All four of us have problems with our physical appearance so I couldn't understand how could they say those things.
  After some nasty comments were made about one of our teachers Amelie came to talk to me about this since it was also making her feel really bad. We talked and noticed we had the same opnion on the matter,  both getting extremely exhausted and mentally drained from the situation.
  The reason why we didn't brought up the way we were felling was bcs Barbara reacted horribly when we complained about something she was doing, getting angry and not talking to us for some time. She also struggles with some mental health problems, sometimes she would lock herself in one of the bathroom stalls and me and Amelie would get worried and trying to make her come out. So we were scared.
  A few months passed and things were only getting worse, especially the state we were in. But at the same time Amelie and I started to get closer with another friend of ours, Xande(16M), he is a very intelligent and funny guy. Barbara didn't like that and made some comments about him that made us very upset.
  So me and her decided that we were done and needed a break, Amelie talked to one of our closest friends, Milo(16M), and he agreed that maybe we should ""give a break"" on the friendship and clear our minds. When we went to school the next day we sat in different places then we used to, we didn't ignore them or anything. Liz came to talk to us, she understood our point and that was that, but Barbara got really upset with us. As we expected she locked herself in one of the bathroom stalls and we went after her.
  After she told us to leave, for the first time ever we left, we didn't look back or regret our decision for the first time in 5 years. We spent the rest of the day with Xande and another friend of ours, Olivier(16M). The day was SO much lighter and I felt well the whole time. No negativity in sight.
  Barbara doesn't want to talk to us anymore, she said she hated our attitude, that we didn't considerate her fellings and refuses to understand our side of the story, and I think she talked to Liz bcs she is also not ok with what happened anymore, they left all the groupchats. We are definitely getting our own pages in that burn book.

I (20F) used to be really good friends with Gabbie (23F) and her husband, Mark (23M). We met in 2019, and started hanging out all the time while my boyfriend Zach (21M) and Mark were deployed. I helped Gabbie out of her lowest point. When her husband was deployed, she was too depressed to do a lot of chores; I ended up doing a lot of her dishes, laundry, and other chores. In January 2022, my boyfriend ends up cheating on me with Gabbie's SIL (that's another topic for another day. We've worked things out since then). Gabbie knew the day it happened and didn't tell me. The four of us (Me, Zach, Gabbie, and Mark) end up going to dinner just two days after I found out. When I confronted her about not telling me and acting like she didn't know, she told me it ""wasn't her place.""

 June 2022: Gabbie blocks my boyfriend on Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. I ended dup blocking her on Snap and she blocked me on everything else. August 2022: Our mutual friend Kate (23F) ends up talking to me at a birthday party. Kate and Gabbie had been friends since they were babies. Kate is asking me general life questions, but asks me a question related to Zach and I. I ask her if Kate knew about what happened, and she said yes, that Gabbie had told her everything. This pissed me off. If it wasn't ""her place"" to tell me, then why does Gabbie think it's her place to tell everyone else? 

October - November 2022 (today): Kate and I start hanging out. Every time we hang out, Kate posts a pic on Snap. Every time, Gabbie swipes up and asks if Kate wants to hang out. Gabbie is a bridesmaid in Kate's wedding, and I'm invited to said wedding. Gabbie is mad because I'm invited as well as my boyfriend. Kate essentially told her to ""get over it"" and that it's Kate's wedding not Gabbie's. I've been talking to Kate about my experiences with Gabbie over the years, like how she essentially left me at my lowest point when I needed the most support. Kate starts getting mad at Gabbie, essentially stating that Gabbie's friendships are only ""what's convenient for her."" 

Tonight, Kate mentioned that Gabbie wasn't speaking to her. Kate had asked Gabbie a question, and Gabbie left her on read. After trying to call and getting ignored, she tried to text Gabbie only to find out that she had been put on ""Do Not Disturb."" Kate said that she feels like Gabbie is ignoring her and is a bit upset about it.

I can't help but feel like I'm tearing their friendship apart by hanging out with her. My friends say that it's not my fault because Kate should be allowed to hang out with anyone regardless of how her other friends feel about said person. But, others have questioned my intentions for hanging out with my ex-best friend's best friend. Others have called me an asshole for being Kate's friend when I know that Gabbie, her best friend, hates me. I'm just super conflicted.

Last night I met a couple other tourists in my hostel in Osaka. (2 Male Americans, 1 Female Austrian, and 1 Female French)
In the beginning they all seemed chill so I agreed to go bar hopping with them.
Though upon arriving at the first bar I realized I was the only one who knew any Japanese. As all of them ordered in English not even trying to help our poor waitress out. Worse they scoffed a couple times when she seemed confused as to what they wanted.

Not wanting this to be norm for the night I tried to give the basic pointers to help them order in Japanese. Basically telling them to just point at the menu and say 'Kore onegaishimasu' (I want this please) Though it was pointless since they kept ordering in English. Eventually I became the orderer for the group because I couldn't deal with the growing confusion frustration.

Fast forward a couple bars later and we going to another bar when a couple of them pull out cigarettes and start smoking on a street what has clear signs not to smoke. When I brought it up they shouldn't be smoking, and we could go to bar what allows smoking. They gave me the most hair pulling anger endusing comment I ever heard. ""Don't worry we are tourists no one will say anything"" 

Hearing that I told them I was done and I couldn't  be around them anymore.
They then told me I was being a asshole and they didn't know how to get back to the hostel.

My SIL and her girlfriend (both 27) are hosting Christmas this year. 

My sister (25) asked if it was okay if she could come up to spend Christmas with me (she still lives in my hometown) because our father is spending it with his wife’s parents in Florida and our mother passed away while she was a freshman in high school and I was a senior in college. 

I checked with my sister-in-law and her GF and they enthusiastically said yes. They understood my sister’s circumstances, and they had a good time with her at my wife’s bachelorette party, and considers my sister family. 

We settled on doing a secret Santa this year and they had my sister involved. However, when my other SIL (33) found out my sister was in secret Santa, she raised a whole fit about it because she “didn’t know what to get my sister if she got her.”

Then, my wife and younger SIL acquiesced because they claim it’s easier to just let their older sister be like that, because it’s just a lot to deal with otherwise. So they just decided that we’d just do regular gift-giving. I didn’t see how that was any better because now my older SIL would have a 100% chance of getting my sister a gift rather than 1 in 8. 

Then I was like, well, I’ll just make it easier on everyone gift-wise and have a little mini gift exchange with my sister and wife before we go over for Christmas. I told the family not to worry about getting my sister any gifts and they said ok. 

Then (not sure who started it) it was decided that we were going BACK to secret Santa. And my sister wouldn’t be part of it. But a few of them would still get her gifts. 

I was honestly too confused within this whirlwind of events that I just initially went along with it. But then thought about it later while out with my friends yesterday and we agreed this would be embarrassing for my sister.

I texted my wife to please request my sister’s inclusion. After some initial resistance, my wife brought it up to her family while out with them and my older SIL absolutely blew up on her. She claimed Christmas was “her thing” and she didn’t make anyone buy presents for her fiancée’s parents when she hosted last year. Of course, we would’ve if asked to, especially if it was secret Santa. She also didn’t want her only gift to potentially be spent on my sister. 

My wife and younger SIL didn’t back down and made a new list that includes my sister. And made it so my older SIL couldn’t have my sister as her gift recipient. 

While I feel the right thing was done, I feel terrible for creating a rift.

So I (f18) share a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with another girl. However, from the start she’s been pretty controlling. She will get pissed if I have guests over after 12 even if we’re just quietly studying in the living room. She will go as far as to tell me “to go to sleep”. Today she lets me know that my guest, who is also a female btw, needs to leave at 11:45 because she needs to take a shower and she thinks it’s weird. I tell her that we’re studying and that she’s free to take a shower. She messaged me back that the apartment is a private space and me and my friend can go study elsewhere. 

What pisses me off more is that she never cleans or does anything. She will leave piss on the seat, if she missed the trash can she will just leave the trash on the floor. I’m the only one who ever cleans the bathroom (it was so bad I physically gagged multiple times). Then, on top of that if I’m quietly studying she will message me multiple times until the guests leave.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4832583,public,top,self,AITA for thinking my roommate is controlling?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6nrt1/aita_for_thinking_my_roommate_is_controlling/,all_ads,6,,,

My dad moved back a couple of months ago to get a job leaving me with my mom and because of all this I have had to put my own life on hold because my parents are very strict and won't let me try to get a regular job and there are no online jobs that will accept someone fresh out of high school with no experience. 

Because of all of this the mental health of my family is extremely low- including me because I feel like they are holding me back from living my life and learning how to be an adult not only because of our really bad circumstances but also their over protectiveness. 

So because of that I turned to social media- specifically posting beauty and makeup stuff and have gained a bit of a following, no money but I do get free items in exchange for promoting and using the products. 

Because I've been relatively successful I want to branch out and go onto YouTube/twitch and maybe casually do gaming stuff too but the computer I have is very bare minimum- my dad got it for me back when covid hit and everything went online so it's not really meant to be used for what I'm using it for. 

So I went to talk to my parents- and essentially what I said is either I want to move to the US with my dad so I can actually get my life started and make some money for myself or if they could help me at least upgrade my PC so that I can keep doing this social media thing (they are supportive of what I do) and I can branch out and not only do gaming but I can also edit videos without the program crashing every 5 minutes. 

They said no to both of those things which annoyed me but I accepted it since they just explained they don't have the money for it right now.

So I have just been trying to keep doing what I was already doing but then I over hear them talking on the phone one night of both of them basically shit talking me and calling me a brat for even asking them for a PC and immature for thinking I could easily get a job in the US. 

I know asking for a PC might be a lot for us right now but I'm doing it because they have not really given me any other choice for ways I could get money for myself. 

I hate the idea of me wasting more of my life sitting around doing nothing- this maybe a dream for other people but not me.

So my bf (m23) and I (f24) have been fighting a lot latelly, like once a week or something.
He tends to ask a lot of personal details about my last partners (even the ones that where one night stands). Once he asked something, and I told him, and he didnt like the answer and went on a long argumento bc of that.
For that reason Im always a little bit carefull with what and how i tell him things about exes.
This last time he wanted to know if i had ever done some specific sexual things in my past (things that we had never done together and only now he told me he would like to try, and i said yes). I told him yes, ive done that, he asked how many times, i told him, he asked with how many people, i told him too. But than he wanted names. He wanted to know exactly with who i did what. And i tried explaining to him that i was not going to tell him names, bc it was none of his business, it doesnt concern him, changes nothing in our current relation and i dont think it is right to go on telling people about somebodyelse intimacies without their consent.
He was really mad with me and said that he couldnt trust me bc of it, that i was witholding information from him, that he needs to know that bc thats the only way he can deal with the information and with his own ansiety. And basicly said that i need to tell him everything always otherwise he cant trust that i will not lie to him eventually.

I am not in the U.S. and I know it's normal for people to leave their parents' house at 18 over there. In my country we leave a few years later. 
I lived my whole life with my mom, spent a couple of years in different cities when I went to college, then lived together again. My plan was to live on my own much sooner but the pandemic hit and I was advised by my psychiatrist to not be alone during it. Anyway, finally managed to move out a couple years ago. We live like 8 mins away from each other by car.

Ever since, my mom has been trying to keep being in my life (which is good) but sometimes she takes it too far. I have managed to set some boundaries with her, but it's not enough. The thing is, she does a lot of things *for* me that I never asked her to do. And then gets upset if I'm not immediately and visibly grateful. 

Some examples:
- She'll randomly drop by to give me clothing that she bought for me. Some I've liked but most of it no. I've asked her to stop gifting me clothes telling her to use the money on herself instead, or to tell me in advance so we can go together so at least I can choose something I like. She keeps doing this. And of course, later gets upset if I don't wear it. 

- She'll send a gardener or electricist or whatever to my house when she thinks I need it. She pays them in advance, but doesn't ask me first if I agree. 

The last straw was this month when I got sick. I had to go to a pneumologist and was looking for one myself, but then she called me and said that she had already booked an appointment with a Dr. that she chose. She didn't ask if I was ok with it, she was just informing me of the decision without consulting with me. (*** Here you don't have to be referred(sp?) by another Dr to go to a specialist, you can just go directly. And the consultation was 30-50 USD so it doesn't bankrupt you either) 

I told her that I had felt blindsided and like I had zero control of my health and life decisions when she did that. She got very upset and said I was ungrateful and didn't speak to me for about a day. 

I'm very conflicted about this because how can I be upset that my mom is doing nice things for me? Also, things being as they are, maybe I should appreciate that I have a parent that can help me. But I feel it's not actually helping me at all and I'm not being allowed to be independent.
How can I tell her to stop without sounding ungrateful? Or am I wrong on this?

We started dating at 17 and it started off as a very sexual relationship. I blame myself for ending up where I am today because I was very persistent on being with him in the beginning and didn't realize we'd get this far. He gave me so many signs that I completely ignored because I simply wanted to feel ""accomplished"" that I ""got him"" I guess. I was young and dumb and my way to get him was to peak his sexual interest. As you can tell, it worked. The excitement only lasted for about half a year to a year I would say because I changed and conformed myself to be the person that he wanted me to be. For example: he didn't want me out with my friends, he didn't want me to have guy friends, he didn't like that I liked taking selfies (or pictures in general), he didn't like me on my phone, and he didn't like that I had school events that I wanted to go to. This was only the beginning of the changes and adjustments I had made to make him happy and keep in mind, it is still all in effect today plus some more things now. He is the type of guy who is very verbally aggressive and does not stand down to anyone. Therefore, he has no problem ""telling me how it is and how it should be"". 

All this to say that we have been facing this continuous issue in our relationship which is that he thinks that I need to please him whenever he wants it, not when I want to do it. I will admit, I have had a decrease in sex drive for about 3-4 years now and it has been a big point of contention mostly because on most nights he wants me to please him and I just want to go to sleep. Keep in mind, he does not verbally say it he just lays in bed and is quiet, grabbing himself over his boxers o he is playing video games and when I go to say goodnight he will make a humming noise or he will say ""so that's what your going to do?"" in a harsh tone. He won' outright say what he wants or even initiate any intimacy or affection that shows me that he wants me. The other night it happened again as usual and I talk to him very calming and in a soothing voice that ""I am not obligated to please you just because you want it, I have to want to do it too""

We would get drunk together and go out dancing, randomly on a weeknight night when we both had work the next day. I always felt like he knew me, because I would invite him into my world, with my friends, share my thoughts etc. The relationship was definitely skewed towards me giving and him taking- he was often at my place. I was still working on resolving my need to be needed at that time…Anyway, as we got older I started to clearly see some behaviours that irritated me - double standards and entitlement. There were things that bothered me but I didn’t feel I could discuss them with him since he reacts strongly and negatively to feedback. He is also not forgiving and that made me feel like I was walking on eggshells. These traits followed him at work, where he got fired from three jobs consecutively. And this really affected him so I didn’t want to kick him when he was down…Move along to Covid where he called almost daily saying he wanted to check in on me but was actually just complaining about the pandemic (as if it was only happening to him). Then I got pregnant, and I felt I needed to prioritize more positive interactions. We often enabled each other to binge drink and this was clearly no longer an option. I knew that our relationship would completely change. I even felt like I would have to reassure him about the pregnancy (as I did on my wedding night bc he was crying - FYI I’m not his sexual orientation so it’s not bc he is into me that way). I pulled away and he noticed, but never addressed it with me. 
Fast forward to a week before I deliver, I am hormonal and feeling angry. This is someone that i called my best friend, and felt that he should be here for me during this time, but wasn’t. I was more worried about how he feels about all of this instead of being supported. And in my rage, I  wrote an email - NO verbal abuse or name calling… the letter mostly consisted on me calling him out for being what I perceive as not a good friend. But it did come off harsh bc I was lashing out. 
He stopped speaking to me. It’s been a year.

He never asked about my daughter. A month or so after I gave birth, my friends had a birthday and all went out with him but didn’t invite me. They also took a trip together and didn’t include me.

So the months passed and around a month or so ago, he started acting/dressing (ears + tails and growling/barking (and at one point he got suspended for biting a kid

One of my current friends (they/them + minor) also noticed this and at one point got in a physical fight with him. They told me that they thinks being a furry is creepy and is deeply unsettling to them, I agreed because I feel the same way. 

Since he started being a full-on furry, I have slowly been trying to disconnect with him. I have a few other friends who are also somewhat-furries, but they do not do… that (one of them wore a tail to school once but that was about as bad as it got) 

I am starting to feel low key bad for drifting away from him. I had multiple reasons for this though. The way he acts makes me very uncomfortable, he mentions how he would like to be… intimate…. with animals. I also did do it partially for status, (that is why I feel bad) I was, and still am, afraid of being associated with him.

I went in there yesterday and he had his foot blocking the door.

The door being blocked has never happened before in 7 years which is why it was weird to me. 

We’ve never had a no p*rn rule but we do have radical transparency across devices. We have each others passwords, permission to look through whatever we want (we were both cheated on in prior marriages this is what works for us) 

Out of curiosity, I asked him what the content of the game was. He opened up and told me that it was a town where he was role playing a basic dude banging every college age girl in town. 

Now the fantasy itself isn’t so bothersome. This is two adults of an adult age. It’s a video game so they aren’t even real people. 

But I’m really fn bothered because my stepdaughter which we’ve been raising together (19f) is the age of these girls and he said he didn’t see a problem with it…

This is his biological child here. He’s literally old enough to be these characters father IRL. I got really upset because I think it’s creepy. If he was fn milfs I wouldn’t have an issue… but college girls? 

Am I just totally off base here to feel upset? I had to spend 30 minutes explaining to him why it was creepy and I don’t think it really set in.

His excuse was that he never really got to experience what it was like to sleep with so many girls and that he wanted to explore that part of his life in a way that was easy (he has trouble with women) and safe and wouldn’t be disruptive to our marriage. 

I am literally so creeped out I don’t know what to do. We’ve built a whole life together and are raising three kids together.

So I used to be a “spicy” dancer when I was 22 and I used to tell my mom who lived back in my home country that I just worked at club as a bartender .
My cousin (M 40) find out about this and he pretty much told me he was cool with it and he wasn’t judgmental at all so we continued to stay friends .
A few months after I run into my cousin , his dad ( my uncle ) and his step mother at a restaurant in Miami , at the moment this happened I was wearing shorts and no bra so I got some weird stares from my uncle , but regardless I went up to their table to say hi and that was it .
Later that same year my mom calls me crying talking about someone within my family had call her and told her that I was engaging in more than just being a “spicy” dancer ( if you can understand what I am implying).
So I immediately blamed my uncle for it ,because who else was it going to be ?
I sent him and his wife a message on Facebook telling them never to speak to my mother ever again and before they make such allegations that can be really detrimental to my moms mental health they should at least have proof or if they really were so worried to talk to me about it first . And I blocked them , haven’t talk to them ever since .
I asked my cousin if he knew anything about it and he blamed on my other uncle that really didn’t have anything to do with it .
Fast forward a few days ago ,
my mom asked me to make peace with my uncle and of course I said NO.
But I started thinking none of it make any sense ,for them to even know everything my mom told me on the phone ,and I think it was probably my cousin just being messy and making stuff up .

Then i made my first ever twitch stream. Then i searched up: kill999slayer and it showed that he was streaming so i joined and said ""hi, im new on twitch.""    i dont know what he said next but it had bad words and stuff so then he reported me and i got banned. soon i came back under a new name called: JackFrost999slayer.   Yet that kill999slayer guy noticed me again.  so i made many accounts so that way i couldnt get caught and boy did it work. now im a 13 year old and one day i will get my revenge on him and his name now is HAPPY\_CORRUPTION. i now have an account named bj1315 and i have 26 followers.

HAPPY\_CORRUPTION is an idiot. he thought he could defeat me but yet he thinks im too young well too bad BUCKO.  i will one day have my revenge on him and during my ban i BAN EVADED.

My old neighbors had two dogs that they DID NOT care for. These dogs were EMACIATED and locked up for 22/24 hours a day easily. I took it upon myself to finagle myself into the picture to make sure they had food and fresh water and I took them out to use the bathroom a few times a day. I HATED THESE NEIGHBORS, but I shut my pie hole and played nice because I wanted to make sure the dogs were okay.

Fast forward and they got sick of me constantly BEGGING to feed the dogs/ take the dogs out etc… so I wasn’t able to. No, they didn’t feed the dogs or take them out instead. I asked my mom if I should call the police and I was told to STAY OUT OF IT. Everyone told me to leave them alone, so I did. But I was incredibly guilty about it.

Fast forward again to a few months ago, one of the dogs died. I asked how she passed and the neighbor said, “oh we just found her in her kennel”. I don’t know for sure, but I’m pretty sure she died from being so malnourished for so long.

Heartbroken. I cried. My partner held me as I cried. 

So fast forward to last night. I get a call from my brother, the last dog “Nova” was abandoned in their apartment. No idea when the last time the dog had food or water. The neighbor asked me to take the dog and I WANTED TO, but I have two dogs (65lbs each) in a 1 bedroom apartment. I can’t bring a husky here, especially since my male is very territorial, but I said we could watch her for two days until they figured something out. They said no.

Tonight my brother and my sister who is a vet tech said they were getting the key to the apartment that the dog was left in and they were going to take care of her until tomorrow when they were going to take her to a shelter. 

I’ve handled Nova before. We were super close with each other she’s such a sweet dog. But when she’s locked in her kennel she’s super aggressive and will growl and bark etc. I tried to tell my sister this, and she said (paraphrasing) ‘she knows what to do she’s a vet tech’

Okay so we get to my moms apartment the neighbors is right next door. My sister and brother are on their way with the key. I tried the door and it was unlocked. I walked in the living room and Nova’s in the kennel right in front of me. I let Nova out, got her fresh water, gave her some food from her food container and took her outside to go use the bathroom. She was so excited to see me! We went for a walk to the dog park like we always did and she walked perfectly on her leash like I taught her. 

My sister saw me at the dog park at the apartment complex and started screaming at me, because I “treated her job like a joke”.

I was told that if the dog had bitten me it would’ve been impossible to find her a home at the shelter, but if she bit my sister it would’ve been okay, because my sister is a vet tech…? 

My sister is visiting from out of state and never met Nova before and my family never believed me when I said these dogs were being neglected. They believed me today.

I was excited because I had a math test that morning and this appointment meant I would miss it and have 2 more days to study! I am absolutely loaded with schoolwork at the moment and even a little thing like this helps to tremendously increase the quality of the work, and bring down my stress. I constantly brought up the appointment with my mom over the next week or so leading up to the appointment, saying things like ‘don’t make a habit of pulling me out of tests haha’ and ‘but I get to miss the math test cause moms taking me out of school!’ And making other jokes like these. I spent my time working on different schoolwork, since I was under the impression I had plenty of time to study for the math exam. To be clear, I still studied- just not every single factor that would be in the exam. I’d say I have 2/5 sections of the test left to study for by now (which I would easily be able to fit into two days). Today (Monday) my mom mentioned that the appointment was at the in-school dentist truck that comes by once a year. These appointments take less than 10 minutes, and I will almost certainly have to do the test tomorrow. I got mad, saying ‘how did you not tell me this! I haven’t finished studying and now I’ll probably fail the test!’. My mom said it was rude of me to be mad because she would never do this out of malicious intentions and it was clearly just a mistake. I’m conflicted because I know she wouldn’t withhold this information from me on purpose, but what this tells me is that she doesn’t listen to me (as said previously, I made a lot of jokes about this over the last week and she never corrected me then). This is something I bring up with her every so often because she can have trouble paying attention to me when we have conversations- she almost always interrupts me to talk about herself, acts disinterested whenever I tell her things, changes the subject to something else in the middle of my sentences, or starts talking with my siblings in the middle of my sentence. We even made a piece of paper once stating the conditions of respecting others during conversations- she stopped following it after about a week.

I worked Friday in retail and my voice got worse. Saturday I let my friend know I was sick and if he didn’t feel it was good to hang we can reschedule. He chose to hang. Since I only see him 1-2 times a month I didn’t think it was a big deal. Nether did my wife as she cooked for us so I thought. 

Issue: Essentially my wife feels I chose my friend over going to urgent care. Causing her mentally to justify cancelling our Sunday meeting with her ex. I did not tell her to cancel. 

I asked her if she was mad at me and she said she was upset she wouldn’t get our daughter a day earlier and felt I chose my friend over urgent care giving her a reason to cancel and make me the bad guy.  When I called her out that she made the choice she got upset stating I’m not validating her feelings. 

I just felt that hanging with my friend had nothing to do with cancelling the meeting.

We sorta grew up together but got close around high school. We went separate ways during college but we still kept in touch.

He moved recently and now lives a few hours away from me. He comes to visit me whenever he can and we try to make the most out of our time together. 

I’d like to add that he’s one of the best people I know. He’d cut off his hand and give it to me if I needed it, and I’d do the same for him. He’s also a pretty funny guy.

My only issue is that he uses the word “retarded” so easily. I always point out to him that he shouldn’t use that word in place of “stupid” or “dumb” or whatever. He says alright and brushes it off, but it’s not long until we get back to having this conversation.

He visited me yesterday and he told me a “funny” story about how his friend started acting “autistic” in public and laughed. I told him nothing about that story is funny. He tried to justify it by saying things along the lines of “yea but, he was moving funny and making weird noises, isn’t that autistic?”. I told him to explain the joke again and again and he couldn’t see the problem with it. I told him that if, anything this story was offensive and disgusting. He thinks I’m being dramatic and running what limited time we have together by trying to teach him a lesson.

I want to add that a few things:
- I get dark humor. Love it. I get how taking offense to something that wasn’t directed or doesn’t relate to me can be silly. I also think only certain people are allowed to make certain jokes.
- My friend and his other friend don’t have any disabilities that I know of.
- I work in the mental health field, and some of my clients are autistic as well as some family members. So I might have overreacted due to how personal I feel about this.

We pushed the wedding back because of the pandemic and decided to do it with all our family and friends there. One of my best friends (let’s call her Jade) was asked to be part of my wedding and she happily accepted. We had been friends since the beginning of high school, but then she had to move away but we still kept in touch. She came to see the venue and hang out with me and the other MOH. A few months later, she texts me saying “we need to talk” and I didn’t think much of it and called her later than night. I thought it was just gonna be one of the normal 5-6 hour catch up conversations we normally have, but it wasn’t. So my wedding, is the same date as a music festival she likes to attend. She didn’t find out the date until about a year ago, and keep in mind, I told her the date of the wedding as soon as I booked it and she goes every year. She calls me to tell me that we weren’t as close as her other friends because I wasn’t living in close proximity to her. She said it was nice hanging out, but she didn’t feel that we were that close. I asked her if she just wanted to be a bridesmaid or if she just wanted to come as a guest but that’s when she told me that she wanted to go to the music festival (that happens every year) and no longer wanted to attend my wedding.

Prereq. I had been working at Dollar general sin febuary of 2022, did allright bevame a keyhokder after a few months, but in october of the same yearmy work started slacking due to personal issues. And at the behest of my manager i step down to cashier untill i can get things on track. Well after some disagreements, bad rule changes, and horrible choices i decided to transfer to a different store. The transfer si yo happen a week from this post. Sorry for the long intro here we go.


 I was about like 20 minutes away from work when my truck told me it was overheating.  
So I pull over on the side of the road and I go to inspect it and sure enough the water on the inside is boiling so I let it cool down for a bit until the water isnt  actively trying to boil out through the cap and the second I twist the cap and it blows off and sprays hot water all over my hand.

   Thankfully nowhere else cause I was smart enough to at least open it away from my face but in that moment I go well shit this is incredibly painful it feels like my hand is melting I decided to call in to work. 
Well my manager and my district manager decided to tell me that at this point if I do not show up for my shift I will be fired. 

    So after going through so much panic already trying to figure out what I'm going to do with my hand, what I'm going to do with my truck I get some water from a nearby house get some petroleum jelly on my hand and I make it to work all the while crying my eyes out because I am in so much pain.

    After about 20 minutes of thoroughly embarrassing my manager in front of customers and other coworkers telling them my horrific story of what my manager made me do I finally get told by my manager that I can go home without getting fired and I'm rushed to the emergency room. Am i the asshole?

I live over an hour away with my bf cause of college and we come to visit for at least a weekend at a time every holiday and maybe some events throughout the year. 

I posted kinda a lot about the situation before on other subreddits so you can take a look on my profile to get more detail.

But I just have a large issue with her communication. She doesn’t try to talk about things that bother her but instead either screams at people or passively aggressively shows there’s an issue then gets mad when we ignore her immature ways of handling it.

She talks to me as if I am her therapist and I hate it cause most of it is about my dad which I don’t want to hear. I have told her this 3 times now but she still rants to me about him. She also always gets mad at my bf and I about our mess. But.. what mess? She usually is mad that my room is a mess but it’s actually just our bags taking up space and cat stuff cause we will bring my cat if we’re gone for more than 2 nights. She also says we leave the main area a mess but she’s the only one who has a problem with it cause it’s things like our laptops. Even my dad one time cut in to ask her what mess is she even talking about. 

She also has a hard time respecting our things, mostly food. We bring some food from home and buy some here cause of their diets and my bf is lactose intolerant. They gave us permission but she always throws out our food after we tell her no. This time she waited until we left the kitchen to throw out what we specifically told her not to. Then blamed it on us when I asked her about it. 

I just feel that maybe it’s best if we don’t visit as often or at least not stay more than a night if we aren’t staying in a hotel. If my mom has such an issue with things we contribute to, and if I am having a hard time not getting angry with her isn’t it best to not stay at their place so much anymore?

We were hanging with 2 of our close friends, also a couple. We were watching football together. 

My boyfriend keeps nudging me with his foot and I start massaging it and he laughs and smiles. He does this a couple more times and I comply until my hand gets tired and I take a break. The team we were watching is one of his favorites and they weren't doing great, but still in the lead. He keeps telling me how much time is left in the quarter. I was assuming he was saying this outloud to everyone or to himself to say wow it's getting down to the wire. He did this for about 30 minutes.

It hit about 9:30 and boyfriend says he's about ready to go. I say oh okay, I'm gonna finish my half of chicken tender first so we don't have to stink up the car with the smell of taking it with. It was literally half a tender and took me 2 minutes to finish eating. I had saved it specifically to finish later in the night, so I rush to finish it, even though it wasn't as enjoyable that way, but he wanted to leave so I was trying to get my stuff ready as soon as possible. I'm putting my jacket on when he says ""well I'm leaving"" and walks out the door. I still don't have my shoes on, but I'm close to being ready, but him walking out felt like it was to essentially rush me to get ready quicker when I'm already rushing. This upset me. 

I told him there was no reason to do that when I exited the door. He made a face and asked no reason to do what? I explained and he said that he had been ready to leave for 25 minutes and I said really? Why didn't you say anything? He responded that that's why he was nudging me with his foot and calling out the time left. I told him I'm sorry I misinterpreted, but he should've just told me with words or just texted me and I would've understood, but because of that I had no idea. I added on that what he did upset me and felt rude as he was trying to rush me as if i was being inconsiderate when i was going as fast as i could. He agreed he should've used his words, but that's all he said. The drive was quiet and I asked if he was angry about something, he said no, I (this seems so cringe now) asked why he hadn't apologized and he said he didn't see any reason to. He said he's his own person and he can walk out if he wants essentially. This upset me even more and we didn't speak or touch for the rest of the night. He's asleep and I can't sleep. 

While it's true he's his own person, when you go somewhere with someone you leave with them, right? Especially if that's the person you're dating. I was just expecting more courtesy out of him in this moment as he is usually very respectful and kind. There's nothing I hate more than being rushed by someone, but I was rushing my ownself for him, so that we could get home sooner. So I wasn't annoyed at the rushing to leave, I was annoyed by his sudden exit without me. It left me standing awkwardly in the living room and our friends gave me weird looks and I returned them.

It’s not in a malicious manner but it’s almost as if she’s always checking me out and it’s creepy. She’s very critical and judgmental even to my husband. She talks to him as if he’s an incompetent child and he says it doesn’t bother him that she is this way but it’s beyond frustrating to hear the way she speaks to him.

We just stood with her for a few weeks while our house was undergoing renovations and now that we’re back home she’s wanting to come over all the time to hangout with baby. She will make passive aggressive comments about things being messy or how we choose to do something with our son. I told my husband that I don’t want her to come over anymore because I don’t like feeling uncomfortable in my own home and he got all pissed saying that I’m being dramatic.

We don’t have any kids together, but he has a 10-year-old daughter from his last marriage, Emma. Dan and his ex-wife Eve, both get equal time with Emma. Dan and Emma have always had a good relationship, and I love Emma to death… she’s a great kid.

On the other hand, Eve and Dan don’t get along and she has never liked me… and I understand the resentment, Dan has said that when they were together that he was not a great husband to her, and their divorce was tough on everyone involved.

The problem started when Dan was worried because Emma was acting like something was wrong, but she wouldn’t tell him anything.

I eventually talked to Emma, and she told me that over the holiday, her cousins had made jokes about her chest/body and told her that she needs to wear a bra. She thought that her training bra would be fine with the shirt that she wore that day, but that the cousins still noticed her chest and made fun of her. She didn’t feel comfortable telling her dad what happened, because, in her own words, she “felt gross.”

I did the best that I could to comfort her about what happened. I told her that she isn’t “gross” but rather that she is perfectly normal, and her cousins were just being awful. She seemed to feel better after we talked for a while, and I told her she's always welcome to talk to me about ""girl stuff.”

Later I told Dan what she said, and I asked him if it would be weird if I took Emma out to buy her a couple of bras with different support/padding, along with new clothes. He said that he didn’t think so and he even offered to go himself but said that he would be clueless, and it would probably be awkward for both of them.

So, the next day I asked her if she wanted to go, and she was up to it, so I took her. We didn’t get her anything crazy, just some clothes and underwear to last her until she promptly grows again in a week.

The night before Emma was supposed to go back to Eve, I (stupidly) decided to text Eve to let her know what had happened, that Dan and I had handled it already and that while Emma was okay, that she might want to check in on her.

Eve sent me a super long reply, saying that it was not appropriate of me to have “body conversations” with Emma, and that I had crossed a pretty serious line. Eve said that in the future, she wants Dan and I to let her handle all body conversations and situations with Emma… because these things should be handled by her mother… something she said I would understand if I had kids of my own.

I told her that if I had known this was important to her, I would’ve reached out to her and let her handle it… but I was only trying to help Emma, a child that I love dearly.

It was pretty clear that her feelings were hurt that she missed a milestone with Emma and that she doesn’t trust me. Dan says that she’s just inventing problems, but I can’t help but feel like even if I had good intentions that I might have accidentally overstepped.

Anyway, sole quick context. this year me and my friend, Sarah (fake name) decided to move to a big city for college (we grew up in a little town)
Things were not so easy for her, you see, she comes from a very low income family. She was raised by her grandmother, and she always struggled with life.
She managed to apply for art school in a public college here.
At first we traveled separately and she lived with another friend of hers and I got a pretty cute but very small apartment near by my university. 
Three months later she contacts me saying she got quicked out and she needed somewhere to stay, I personally LOVED to live alone but she didn't had nowhere else to go so I couldn't say no. 
Since then, it's been pretty difficult to live with her. A lot of dirty dishes, food in the sink, feet powder all over the floor, coffee powder all over the kitchen, a lot of her hair loss literally everywhere, her underwear in the floor and noisy alarms at 4Am that she doesn't bother on turning off. 
I'm honestly tired, I'm tired of her and having no privacy, I'm tired of waking up at 4 am with her unnecessary alarms when she doesn't even wake up until 10 am. I'm tired of seeing my apartment full of unorganized stuff, she's my friend, i don't want to ruin her chance of staying on the city and finishing college, but even after I've talked to her about the mess, she doesn't seem to be changing anything.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4832446,public,top,self,AITA for wanting to quick my roommate even if she has nowhere else to go,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6mtsi/aita_for_wanting_to_quick_my_roommate_even_if_she/,all_ads,6,,,

My friend - who I live with - sits in our bathroom for approx 2 hours per day. She’s told me before she has IBS but I know that’s not why she’s in there…

My bedroom is right next to the bathroom so I can hear people coming in &amp; out, and I can hear her going in, then she sits just watching TikToks for like 2 hours after “doing her business”. I often just resort to going out to a shop or bar so I can run my errands and also use a bathroom because I can’t at home!

There’s been several times where we had plans and she made us late because she was taking a long shower - her first shower in months - before she was ready to leave the house. And even before that, she sat around in the bathroom on her phone for at least an hour.

I (and other housemates) have told her that it pisses us off because we can’t shower &amp; do our teeth etc…But nothing gets through. She has depression and doesn’t leave the house - so she only comes down to sit in the bathroom and watch stuff on her phone, then go back to bed.

Her lack of leaving the house means she doesn’t cook or eat proper food, it’s complete takeout. So yes I may seem like a bitch, but I struggle to have empathy after 3 years living with her when this behaviour has been constant. She has always been like this and I’ve never seen her eat a fruit or vegetable or home cooked meal - crucify me if I’m judging!

Of course I check on her and try to help but she’s also problematic in the household because I simply want to brush my teeth when she never leaves the bathroom.

This didn't bother me too much - since she would always give me her credit card to pay for them. One day though she forgot her credit card, so I offered to pay for them with my own money; which she accepted!

After that things slowly started to change. Though she still payed for it herself from time-to-time, she kept asking me more and more often to buy her cigarettes, and more often she kept asking me for my money to pay for these cigarettes. The problem is, at the time, I was saving up to move to the city so I could study, and cigarettes are not cheap! The brand she liked was $40, and there would be moments where she'd ask for cigarettes multiple times a week! Not to mention that I was always paying $300 in board money every fortnight to help with things like food or bills around the house.

""Sometimes I get too stressed, and the smokes really help"" Was her reson when I asked her about why she spent so much money on it.

I was getting really worried about how many cigarettes she would smoke in one week alone, I didn't feel comfortable anymore about using my money to pay for the cigarettes anymore, so I started saying 'No' or 'I can't afford it' - and she'd get upset. Saying things like ""I keep a roof over your head"" or ""can't even help your mother after all I've done for you!"" And ""I don't have much money, and you just got paid!""

It made me feel horrible, and sometimes I caved and bought them for her. I've moved out since then, but I bring this up now because she's messaging me again for money - which I suspect is for more cigarettes.

And on those occasions she usually likes the result.

So here's where I may be the asshole: often when I'm doing a coffee run on my own, I'll add a single flavor shot or a bit of milk to her coffee, even if she doesn't ask for it.  To be clear: if she specifically says that she wants it black or that she doesn't want any flavor, I will of course honor the request.  But if she doesn't specify, a lot of the time I'll see if there's an interesting flavor, and if so I'll add a shot to her coffee as a surprise treat (and I won't clarify in advance whether she wants that).  In those situations, I'd estimate that about half the time she likes it and is glad I did add the flavor, and half the time she (\*mostly\* kindly and nonconfrontationally!) asks why I didn't just get her a black coffee like I know she likes.

I am struggling on what to do about inviting my FIL’s new fiancé to our wedding. This woman ( I’ll refer to her as Sarah) has been with my FIL since before I met my now fiancé, which was over 4 years ago. 

This is not the first time I or my fiancé has had issues with Sarah. She is generally rude, insulting, and has minimal social awareness. Not to mention, she and my FIL manage to get into screaming matches whenever we around them. These actions are something that has deeply affected my fiancé, as Sarah has also said very unkind things about his mother. Every single member of my FIL’s family has stated they cannot stand Sarah, but my FIL is steadfast in defending her. 

While we were visiting my FIL’s family over the holiday, we were staying at his family’s house with he and Sarah. Sarah had been making comments and having arguments with my FIL the whole trip, but everything really came to a head the last day. Sarah was upset we (my fiancé, FIL, and I) came back late (11pm) from a dinner she did not want to attend. Sarah had been trying to reach my FIL wondering where he was, and when that didn’t work, started calling my fiancé and I instead. I answered trying to be polite, but was promptly being screamed and cussed at and was told to return immediately. Being an adult woman, I was shaken. 

When we arrived back, Sarah had locked herself in her room and was arguing with my FIL through the door. After she finally came out, she came to the living room to chastise my fiancé and I further, and he told her she had behaved inappropriately in her phone call to me. This sent her in to an enraged episode, where she started screaming, cussing, and slamming doors at all of us. My fiancé and I were so uncomfortable and upset by this that we got a hotel for the night. My FIL continues to defend these actions, and we have not spoken to him since this happened.

Now, we are faced with the difficult decision of how to handle the events surrounding our wedding. I was already planning on keeping Sarah and my MIL as separate as possible, due to the things she has said about my MIL and how they upset her. Now, we have discussed uninviting her from all wedding events, or just the showers/ rehearsal dinner. Originally, my FIL requested Sarah be included in the ceremony and enter down the aisle with him. We weren’t crazy about the idea, but felt that it would be disrespectful to not include her, especially since my fiancé wanted to include my MIL’s partner. Overall, we know everyone (except my FIL) would be happier and more at ease without Sarah in attendance at our wedding. The drama that seems to surround her is not something we want to deal with on our wedding day.

The door being blocked has never happened before in 7 years which is why it was weird to me. 

We’ve never had a no p*rn rule but we do have radical transparency across devices. We have each others passwords, permission to look through whatever we want (we were both cheated on in prior marriages this is what works for us) 

Out of curiosity, I asked him what the content of the game was. He opened up and told me that it was a town where he was role playing a basic dude banging every college age girl in town. 

Now the fantasy itself isn’t so bothersome. This is two adults of an adult age. It’s a video game so they aren’t even real people. 

But I’m really fn bothered because my stepdaughter which we’ve been raising together (19f) is the age of these girls and he said he didn’t see a problem with it…

This is his biological child here. He’s literally old enough to be these characters father IRL. I got really upset because I think it’s creepy. If he was fn milfs I wouldn’t have an issue… but college girls? 

Am I just totally off base here to feel upset? I had to spend 30 minutes explaining to him why it was creepy and I don’t think it really set in.

His excuse was that he never really got to experience what it was like to sleep with so many girls and that he wanted to explore that part of his life in a way that was easy (he has trouble with women) and safe and wouldn’t be disruptive to our marriage. 

I am literally so creeped out I don’t know what to do. We’ve built a whole life together and are raising three kids together.

I would blame my weight, but it started when we first moved in together. I definitely have the higher drive of the two of us. He blamed my higher libido on my ""father issues,"" which really hurt. I've only had 3 partners in my life, which I don't believe qualifies me for the slut of the year award. We didn't have sex during our honeymoon.  I occasionally suggest we have some quality time, but I'm not able to ask him directly for sex. He totally shuts down.  I'm not able to make any sort of sexually suggestive or assertive actions without getting frozen out.  He apologizes and makes excuses when I do bring it up.  He will engage in a discussion about it, and he will apologize. But then nothing comes of it.  I last talked to him about it 2 years ago just after New Years. Before that it had been five years. The last time we talked about it, I cried every day on my way home from work and then for most the evening for months before I finally had to engage him in a discussion.

 Am I an asshole for wanting to bring it up now? He's constantly an amazing husband, I'm an awful wife and I'm lucky he tolerates me.

Yes, I still live with her because housing is completely unaffordable. I left for military service for a while, and upon returning I had no job and wanted to complete school. My fiancee (36) also lives with us. He has had difficulty with his family too, and is essentially NC with them, as well outside of holidays and birthdays. 
We pay my family to rent a room, pay for our own food, pay for food for them, clean, etc. We are very grateful that they have allowed us to rent from them. We just stay in our own area of the house, or are not home at all due to our university studies.

My mother finds every excuse to try to get under my skin. She knocks on the door and tries to talk to me while I'm taking an exam for school (I put a sign on the door eye level black bold writing saying ""TAKING EXAM PLEASE DO NOT KNOCK""). When I use the bathroom, immediately it is her ""turn"" to use the bathroom regardless of what time of day it is. I have her typical schedule down, but outside of that it is when I use the bathroom that she suddenly needs to shower. This could be at any time of the day on a day off. Like clockwork for years. If I spend too much time in the bathroom due to a bowel movement, she berates me through the door saying things like ""your patients will die when you are a nurse if you keep using the bathroom like this,"" or ""oh my god you're in the bathroom again?"" She also conveniently forgets that I pay her rent at the beginning of the month, and every month by the midpoint she tells me I didn't pay her. I pull up my bank statement (without view of my account balance deliberately because of how she used to have access to my bank accounts as a kid) to show that I actuall pay her. She doesn't plan properly and asks me to run errands for her while I have study group sessions for exams, or during school, and will try to guilt me saying ""it's for this person's baby shower,"" about someone I don't know. She demands that I help her wrap a present when I'm cooking dinner for the family and have raw meat on my hands. This is just examples of recent things, but my entire childhood was like this too.

I go out of my way to not have conversation with her and avoid her most of the day. She has caught on to this and makes her conversations as extreme as possible to try to get under my skin and start an argument.

My fiancee is great and calm. He takes the brunt of her nonsense, and I am eternally grateful.

She has always been this way and I have never felt good about myself. I have tried to please her by trying to be the best but she always has something to knit pick about me. I recently went through a break up with an ex of 7 years in August.  I admit i have been depressed and not taking care of myself but i still clean. I just havent cooked in months. Whenever i do cook my mom complains about my cooking so I have stopped and let her control the kitchen.  Today we were driving somewhere and my mom pushed me over and over and started to unload about how she felt she had to do everything for me. I stopped the car and asked her to get out. She slammed the door and called me a stupid bitch. I left to let things cool down. When i returned a few hrs later she was still fuming and wanted to argue. I had enough and asked her to shut up repeatedly until finally saying "" Why did you marry someone you didn't love? Why did you have kids you didn't want? You complain about being lonely but you drive everyone away. You are the problem. Im sick of living with you""  That broke her and she started sobbing. She said i have permanently severed our relationship. I know i am old and should move out by now

Recently he went to his travel agent to book an all inclusive resort (upon my request). I of course planned everything.

I asked his mom and my dad to come. MIL worked but my dad decided to come. 

I made sure everything was planned down to the last detail. We got there and we're having a great time!

Day two and we decide we are going to the disco at night. I had been drinking since ten, swimming in the ocean, and handling all the mental labor. We went to the disco, and I was the first one out on the floor. I got tired so I laid down at the boothes set up for everyone. 

My spouse came up and told me he needed to get me back to the hotel because ""people were talking"" about me minding my business catching my breath at the club. 

I left. My husband has been riding me all day about drinking and partying despite me being tired and doing my best to .ake sure he and dad had a good vacation. I just walked away. After a while he followed me and said he only said that to get me to get up and drink more. I slow clapped in his face after he wouldn't listen to me about how that hurt to demonstrate what a bang up job he did in aspiring me. He called me a bitch and stormed off.

We are not financially able to care for our child so my mother has temporary custody until we get our own place(which is nearly impossible right now.)

She (FMIL), was really nice to me when me and fiancé got together, as I was pregnant at the time, so I thought that once the baby was born she would continue to be decent to me. I was horribly mistaken. I had to have a cesarean so it made it hard to move and bend over so fiancé and FMIL helped me a ton. Then she started taking him to bed with her after I told her I would rather him sleep with me and fiancé. She HATED that. This went on for eight months. I just didn’t have the energy to fight being a new mom and neither did fiancé. Which brings me to now. 

She once threatened to have our son taken away from us for taking him to West Virginia to see my father. She said it was “child abuse” for our child to ride for five and a half hours with at least twelve or more stops to change his diaper and let him stretch his legs. 

She believes she is entitled to fiancés days with said child since fiance and I don’t live together. She constantly refuses to listen to our parenting and blows us off when we tell her that the days child is there are not her days. I recently told her that fiancé and I would prefer if child stayed home and fiancé came to see him here so there is no interference with her trying to parent our child while we are parenting him. I feel as though it’s borderline obsession over our child.

She absolutely lost her mind on me. Started telling me that I’m a whore and a bunch of other offensive stuff. Fiancé tried to explain that it was for the hood of our child and that we didn’t want to exclude her completely. But now I feel as though I should.

My mom has done a lot for me during this pregnancy. I've tried my best to stay in contact, be appreciative, and keep her in the loop. She does a lot financially when and if I need it. She is lovely when it comes to physically doing things for the people she loves, but she has a habit of then using those things as ammunition during arguments.

My parents' place is the only place I can stay other than my sister's place, but she has her own son and works a town away. It's just easier for me to crash at their place than burden her.

Today, I had plans to eat with a friend my age who had a baby roughly a month ago. My mom knew that I'd be leaving around 5 pm to go to dinner, but that I hadn't got very much sleep.

Due to a tough night before, I planned to take an hour nap before leaving. I tried laying down in the living room because I knew she was busy in the bedroom, but my dad was babysitting my nephew and I wasn't going to ask for their fun to stop. 

So, I went back to the room to tell her I'd like to take a nap. She scoffed and said it was her room and I can wait on her. Instead, I went to the next room and huffed when I laid my head down.

Suddenly, the doors slam and she storms down the hall. 

I didn't react.

She goes to my father to yell at him about how disrespectful I am. 

I didn't react.

She sees I left a cup on the table and yells that she will pick up the mess I made.

I didn't react.

She explains she's glad she won't have to go to the medicaid office with me. She won't do favors for someone who disrespects her.

This time, I slammed the door and went to the original bedroom.

I understand I could've chosen not to react to this either in hindsight. However, we have been struggling very hard with medicaid. I need medicaid in this service area and this is the only way I will qualify since my license and those bills are still sent to this address.

Basically, I cannot do this without her. 

She storms back into the room and starts screaming about how she won't be disrespected in her own home and doesn't owe me anything. I didn't raise my voice. She was already stressing me out and I really didn't want to start crying knowing that feeling of stress can go straight to my son. 

I told her I won't be doing this and I won't have a screaming match. She continued to scream and so I just said ""don't go then, I will figure it out,"" to which she said I wasn't capable and slammed the door. 

This interaction DID make me bawl crying - I felt my motherhood was called into question over what started off as something so minimal, especially since she knows how hard I've been working for him.

There's more context, but I'm running out of characters. Questions welcome.

Recently though I feel that they have crossed the line.

My brother and his wife purchased a Shiba Inu puppy last year much to the surprise of everyone in our family, because they have always showed disdain for dogs and would never let any in their house.  This is the opposite of my husband and I.  We love dogs and have owned two Pomeranians since we married 16 years ago.  We were never able to bring our dog to their house even when they lived almost 5 hours away, but we totally understood and would find someone to watch her. Their house their rules! One Thanksgiving our usual dog sitter was unable to watch our pup, so we brought her along and had to stay in the only pet friendly hotel that was minutely close to their house (And it was gross) but once again, their house their rules!  

Now that they have a dog, boy have the tables turned! They bring her to absolutely every family function.  And it’s not like she’s a newborn pup…she’s almost 2.  They now only live a little over an hour from my house and my parents house, but they act like they can’t leave her alone for the 6 or 7 hours they are gone.  Their dog has been very aggressive toward my dog so I don’t even have family functions at my house anymore because I know there will be trouble.  When my parents have them over they are annoyed that they bring their dog but don’t say anything because my bro and his wife become so defensive about it.  Also, they just expect my parents to watch their dog at the drop of a hat.

It’s so frustrating because at first I was super excited that they finally opened their hearts to a dog, but they expect everyone to bend over backwards for her, when they’ve treated my two well behaved Pom pups (one has passed) like they didn’t even exist.

I didn’t want the “honor” because I’ve been one before and I don’t want the responsibility or any expectations put on me but what could I say? No? In October she decided she was having a civil wedding in December.  Making the entire family have to change their Christmas plans including having to reschedule flights. 

She is 29 and I’m 38. I went through an awful divorce and custody battle. It was financially and emotionally devastating and I’m just getting my footing financially. For her civil wedding she designated me her witness. Now I have to travel down to Maryland 2 weeks before Christmas and I am not happy about it. 

Thanksgiving we talking about her wedding in August which is in Puerto Rico where we are originally from. It’s peak tourist season and it’s $1000 in  airplane tickets for me and my sons. Add to that car rental and gas, food, wedding costs (dress, hair, makeup for me for the wedding). She also let me know that there will be no minors at the reception. (Which is understandable I wouldn’t want kids there either) but now I have to figure out what to do with my sons after the ceremony considering that the whole family will be there AND the venue might be a drive away from my parents place. I mentioned this to her and she goes oh we are all getting rooms at the hotel. To which I answered, we are? I tried to get her to be conscientious about her choosing to get married on one of the most expensive months in PR. And she answered angrily you want me to buy the kids f-cking tickets? Needless to say I was pissed by this retort. She apologized after but it’s put a sour taste in my mouth and frankly makes me want to participate even less. 

I will be spending at least $2000 for HER wedding. I don’t want to spend any money. I’ve had unexpected expenses and I am just getting on my feet. I mentioned this to my mom and she just screamed at me and said that I was jealous because I had a failed marriage and that I should do whatever possible to be there.

My (19f) bf (22m) were on the way back from our 2 year anniversary vacation on the ferry when I caught my bf out of the corner of my eye taking a photo of another girl (probably around 15f). I grabbed his phone out of his hand and looked at his camera roll and saw that he was indeed taking photos of this girl. I was furious and immediately confronted him. He looked totally shocked at being caught and claimed she had chatted with him while I was In the women’s bathroom, as if that makes it totally okay to take secret photos of her like a creep. To be honest, I made somewhat of a scene, I was furious and let all of my anger out on him in that moment and everyone in our section of the ferry stared. I called him a creep, a pervert and a cheater which he refused steadfastly before I threw what was left of my tea at him and returned to the car. I didn’t see him until the ferry was nearly at the terminal and the ride back home was dead silent except for a brief exchange where he told me that my “outburst” was childlike and deeply embarrassing. I think he deserved to feel embarrassed.

My MIL has been away for awhile now, so I offered for her to go in the car with my wife, kids, and dog, while I took another car and followed behind. 

While at the Christmas tree lot, very predictably our daughter tripped and fell face first into a large puddle. Also very predictably, we had not brought any kind of change of clothes, so that effectively ended our afternoon of “making memories.”

I carried our daughter back to our car and put her in while my wife and MIL got our son and dog and put them in the car. As we were leaving, they said they had to stop on the way home and then would be right there. I went right home and got a bath ready for our daughter and started prepping for supper. A little while later my wife came in the door with our daughter followed by my MIL with our son. All was good for over an hour until at one point my MIL looked around and said, “Where’s the dog?” At that point i realised that I hadn’t seen the dog since the dog went into the car at the tree lot. 

My wife and I ran to the car, threw open the hatchback and there was our dog laying down in the back. Thankfully she was unharmed and just seemed bored. 

Here’s where I get upset. This is the THIRD time that my wife has accidentally left our dog in the car for an extended period of time. We have been very fortunate that every time she has done so, it has been a comfortable temperature outside and a window has been down for the dog to breathe. So, given that this was the third time, I was very pissed and I let her know it right away. 

My wife explained it was because she had both kids and our daughter was mostly naked because we stripped off her wet clothes before we put her in the car. She was focused on that and not on our dog. 

I decided to go for a walk because I was pissed off and wanted some space. My wife followed me and said she wanted to discuss it at that moment. So, standing outside, I told her how I was pissed at her and her mom because our dog could have died, again, from her not paying attention. She again said that she was busy with the kids and it wasn’t on purpose so I shouldn’t be mad at her. We came to a bit of a standstill and I said I needed to go for a walk so I could clear my head. Her mom was watching the kids in the house while this was happening. 

When I got back, my MIL was gone, so my wife and I talked everything through and came to a resolution. 

However, later on that night my wife was talking to her mother on the phone about what happened.  Her mother firmly believes that I am in the wrong and that I should not have made my wife feel worse for forgetting the dog, that I had no right to be angry, and that I should apologise to her, my MIL, for being upset at my wife when she, my MIL, was in our house.
