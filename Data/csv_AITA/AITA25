My boyfriend and I hangout a lot together and something I've noticed is that every so often he'd have to leave me for hours at a time to help his friends and family with mundane tasks. It wasn't a problem at the start I even thought it was sweet he'd drop things to help people. But our schedules started to get more tight so we can't see each other at all on weekdays. I thought he'd start prioritizing our time together so when I'm finally able to catch his attention on weekends imagine my shock when he still leaves me for hours at a time. The worse part is he tells me it'd only take a few seconds but by time I know it the sun has set. I've asked him many times to not call me over if he's just going to leave midway through or just start saying no to people. He seemed to understand at the time but still kept doing it. I held back for so long until I just lost it when he left me almost immediately after calling me over to help his friend with phone issues. 

When he came back I just blew up on him. I told him that it makes me feel so stupid sitting on that sofa waiting for him to come back for hours and the next time he does it I'm just leaving. He told me that I'm right and that he's annoyed by it too. But this just made me more angry and I told him if he didn't want to help just start saying no. He continued saying that if he could say no then he would but he feels like he needs to help them when they asked. He wanted me to blame his friends and family for always needing him. But keep in mind these are always mundane tasks and never something that he needs to do. So I told him to stop blaming them when he doesn't make his boundaries clear to them. So of course they'd keep bothering him. Him being upset about this always makes me so mad because he can just say no. It also hurts since it feels like me and our time together isn't worth saying no for.

I simply left in anger not listening to him make anymore excuses. He's been blowing up my phone for a while saying I'm blaming him for things he can't control. He also thinks I'm being selfish.

I was expecting him to choose a fairly regular name, perhaps even the family name (his grandpa's name and his middle name) but instead he chose a random word from another language that we can't even pronounce properly, but it means something he liked. I wasn't sure he was serious when I was pregnant, or trying to test me somehow, so I agreed to it (not wanting to cause issues.)
Since he has been born his dad has been less and less involved, to the point that he doesn't speak or message me at all and I have stopped sending updates. I used to offer to come by so he could see him (he was a baby so I had to stay with him) and that happened for a while until dad seemingly lost interest (he got ""busy"")
Around my son's first birthday his dad was supposed to help with the party and he completely flaked, was late and left the second he could. I was furious and upset, but now he's expecting a other child I can see we were just not a priority/ old news. 

I want to change my son's middle name to a regular normal name. I hate the ""name"" his dad chose and my parents and family are constantly telling me how stupid it is. I'm worried he will be teased at school. 
One of my friends says I can't do it without it seeming like I want to erase his dad, or that I'm spiteful he's having another child with someone else and that's an AH thing to do. That my son's name isn't a playground for our issues. But I honestly just want the best for my son.

The week after the split I went for dinner with a friend (42f) and we had a blast. I was having fun, we were laughing, and thankfully I wasn’t thinking about my ex and the breakup. We did talk about it though, and she offered to set me up with a friend of hers (53m). I was hesitant, but said I’d be open to meeting him in a low-pressure group setting.

A couple of days later, I was feeling bummed again and lying on the couch, and she texted me and said she’d given him my number and he thought I was cute, followed by “please please say that’s ok”. I was a bit taken aback and just kind of said “yeah ok it’s fine”. He texted me like a minute later to introduce himself and I didn’t reply. I thought for a bit about whether or not I really wanted to meet him and decided I wasn’t up for it. I messaged him and said something along the lines of “I don’t know if (friend) told you but I’m just out of a relationship and I’m not really up for dating.” He said that’s ok and was really nice about it. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I hadn’t heard from my friend. Not super unusual as we’re both super busy and don’t talk all the time or get together often, but when we do we have a blast.

I hope you’re not mad about the (guy) thing but I’d love to get together.” She replied and said “I’m not mad but what you did was really mean, it makes it seem like I’m playing around with him.” I told her I was blindsided by her giving him my number and I thought we were going to get together as a group so I could meet him and see if we clicked, and she replied tersely and said “No, I asked if I could give him your number and you said YES”. I said that was technically true but I was in a really bad headspace and that I had felt blindsided. I apologized for not being more clear at the time, but that I had felt pressured.

I don't really like to just meet people once and never see them again, so if we got along well I try to establish a kind of friends with benefits relationship. But I usually don't mention that I'm also meeting other people, neither do I ask about their sex life. 

One of those dates asked me recently when I had sex the last time, and I just gave an honest answer which was ""yesterday"", but it obviously wasn't him, so he kinda got mad and said he doesn't ever want to see me again.

For the past week or so my cousin [38f], her husband [?], and their daughter [6] have been staying in me [16m] and my mom's [55] tiny 2 bedroom apartment while their house is being renovated. I don't think I'd mind them staying over, if they weren't so... for lack of a better word, ""obnoxious"". 

Cousin has taken over the living room by rearranging all the furniture, and declaring that whenever her daughter is napping or sleeping, I am absolutely not allowed to enter the living room, even if it's just for a moment. The only exception is when I'm supposed to go to school, and even then if I make even the slightest noise, like letting my keys jingle, I get scolded by her the moment I get back home for being ""loud and rude"". They also seem to think they have free reign over the house. They constantly barge into our bedrooms and to try and claim the beds, because the air mattresses they brought are ""inadequate"", they've used our shampoos and soaps despite the fact that they brought their own, I think they've even used our toothbrushes and clothes. They don't even clean up for themselves after meals, it's always my mom's job and even though I get to help her, I still feel so bad for her.

Here's where our problem arises. Cousin asks that I babysit her daughter after school while she and her husband work, which I don't mind all too much. She's a sweet kid, she loves playing games, having stories read to her, I've even gotten to teach her how to play Smash Bros. Problem is she takes everything up to 100. She plays rough, she likes hitting and screaming and making me chase her around the house, and her tantrums are rough. I often have to hold her back until she's calm enough to console because she tries to break things and hit herself against furniture. After talking with some friends about it, they suggested I start to charge my cousin for babysitting her daughter.

I tried to talk to my mom about it, I told her I'd only charge cousin 10 bucks total every time I babysat her daughter, but my mom is very very against it. She says I'm being really rude by trying to get money out of my cousin when she's going through a tough time. She says my cousin may need the money to pay off the house repairs, and I am not in any place to take it from her, especially when she is so stressed. While I understand that, it's not like I'd be asking cousin for money she doesn't have. She buys fast food and Starbucks for herself every day, sometimes even a few times a day, I doubt 10 bucks would make much of a dent in her budget. Plus, with the way she has been acting, I think repaying me and my mom in some way is the least she can do, but maybe my stance on this is wrong.

At 12h50, I text her to ask if she is going to be there. No answer. 5 minutes later, I go inside and reserve the table. At 1pm, i assume she stood me up and since I'm at my favorite restaurant, I order my favorite food and sit down for a meal alone. 

She arrives 5 minutes late, which is really no big deal even for me but it does show a lack of respect for my time not to have warned me. I welcome her and tell her that since she was a little late, I had already ordered, then recommended the specialties to her and moved on. I didn't call her out hard or anything. 

She started reading the menu but she looked flustered and after a while, she tells me that she only a few minutes late. To which I answered yes, and she didn't warn me despite me asking for an update but that it didn't matter now, she was there and I was glad. 

She went back to reading the menu but after a minute she said that she didn't feel like it anymore because I had made her a reproach. I looked at her with a look of disbelief but she reiterated that she didn't feel comfortable anymore. I told her that I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and that she should leave if she felt this way, which she did.

Ok so me (15f) my best friend “Georgina” (15f) And my other best friend “Kelly” (15f) had and argument last week.
 
So last week me and Georgina went down to the cafeteria and saw Kelly there and waited in line with her to get food so we get to the front Kelly already ordered her food just waiting for it and Georgina ordering her food she gets her food and we have to wait for Kelly and these two girls behind us start rudely asking us to move so me and Georgina tell Kelly that we are gonna go and pay she says alright and we go then sit down after a second or two Kelly comes and sits down too and Georgina is about to sit down but Kelly kicks the chair in her leg as “a joke” and Gergiana gets mad and tell me to sit beside Kelly because she’s not sitting there cause she just kicked a chair into her 
And Kelly gets mad because “it was just a joke” 
and she starts on Georgina and Me randomly like “ why did you leave me alone I always wait for you guys but you never wait for me “ and being rude to us 

things escalate and Kelly starts yelling at me and Georgina because she didn’t want us to leave her and saying we were stupid and we say that we didn’t want to be near those two girls that where being rude to us she didn’t care that they where rude to us.
we say we didn’t mean to leave her then 
Kelly started arguing about another agreement that Kelly and Georgina had 

Now for some background Kelly was leaving Georgina out when she was with her other friends that Georgina wasn’t really friends with but she was never mean to them and Kelly has a long history of leaving her best friends out when she meets new friends 

She brought up that argument they had and Georgina was mad at her for bringing it up and started saying that she left her and stopped talking to her because of a guy and then Kelly started yelling at Georgina saying she was stupid and had a small brain and other hurtful things and Kelly said things like that Georgina was spreading rumours about her that she stopped talking to her over a guy (even tho that’s exactly what happened) after lunch was over she gets up and walks away from us and goes with the other people from our table while me and Georgina are still packing up and then after we are all pack we leave as well 

The next day me and Georgina aren’t talking to Kelly because we are still mad at her 
lunch comes Kelly instead of sitting beside us she sits beside the other people in our table we don’t say anything and Kelly tries talking to us like nothing happened and we ignore her 
And now me and Georgina where talking and saying we aren’t gonna talk to her until she asks us to talk and apologise 

but we feel bad about ignoring her

My sister in law's family is very conservative. Her husband sits while the women cook and serve. In my house, when I (43f) haven't worked I do all the housework, but on the last four years I've been working full time so the work is distributed among all of us. 

They want to come spend Christmas Eve, and I agreed after a fight with my husband. Some years ago I got screamed at by my SIL'S husband over a kids fight on new years eve. I wanted to say if this is how you treat a guest I wonder how you treat SIL and nieces when nobody's looking but bit my tongue. 

My husband says Christmas is for sharing and I should learn to be tolerant. Our younger sons love each other and they are both very timid so I said it's ok for them to come mostly for them. 

But I have warned my husband that if my SIL'S husband starts ranting about "" women with tattoos"" (I have some that are non visible in winter/professional clothes) or ""women who drink"" (I drink a couple glasses of wine on a nice dinner) I will come back and I don't care if I ""ruin Christmas"" AITA?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4806620,public,top,self,AITA For not wanting to host Christmas for hubby's family?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzk30l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_host_christmas_for_hubbys/,all_ads,6,

I’m fifty six and mother to Greg, who is twenty seven. Greg is my only child and he’s engaged to Sarah who is also twenty seven. 

I don’t really get along with Sarah, but I’m civil with her as she is going to be my daughter in law. 

However I asked them the other day if they would consider ever naming their child after Greg’s father, Charles. Charlie passed away from a heart attack a few years ago. 

Sarah rudely informed me that she and Greg weren’t going to have children. She didn’t let Greg speak at all, and told me “I don’t want to carry a child for nine months and Greg and I both have very busy careers so we wouldn’t have time for a kid. Neither of us want to be parents.” 

I was shocked. Greg is my only child so he’s my only hope for grandchildren. I said to Sarah that family should be more important than a career and suggested she could take a few years out of work or become a stay at home mother. Greg is an accountant and Sarah is a lawyer so they have more than enough money. 

Greg told me to leave it alone but I was distraught. It feels like Sarah doesn’t even care about marrying Greg and having a family with him. 

Greg said he would uninvite me from the wedding if I kept pushing so I’ll leave it alone for now. I just hope they change their minds
I think it’s reasonable to expect my son to have a family one he’s married but other family members have said I was in the wrong

My friend, “Rachel”, and I only recently befriended one another because we are housemates with a mutual friend. We have bonded and become very close very quickly. She was cheated on last year and it affected her deeply and how easily she trusts people (boys and girls alike). I was recently broken up with and am in a complicated situation/still in love with that guy that has been affecting me mentally so we often go to each other for support and advice. I am also mildly on the spectrum and have adhd so i have a hard time reading subtle social cues and am often times accused of flirting with people when i’m not. Most people don’t know about my neurodivergence which I believe includes Rachel. I also have a tendency to befriend guys more easily because i am less intimidated.

So a week or two ago I was on tinder and I saw Tim. I’ve never been attracted to him in the time they’ve been talking and he comes over fairly regularly. In the moment, our other roommate (who is best friends with Rachel from last year) and her friend were both in the room and I showed them his profile. We laughed and agreed that it would be funny if I swiped right and also to know if he did too. I swiped right and thought nothing of it but didn’t think to tell her at the time since she’s prone to stressing out about things easily

Fast forward to a few days ago, i’ve completely forgotten about it when I get the notification that we matched. At this point, he has come over several times and we’ve talked very platonically but we’re both engaged in the conversation. Rachel suspected flirting and has asked both of us if we were into the other to which we both denied.

I don’t think she believes us but I’ve been limiting conversation with Tim since she asked. When we matched we both said hi and chatted for a little bit and Rachel was brought up and how he misses her. I didn’t think anything negatively in the moment because it was a platonic conversation and I generally swipe right on people I know. 

The conversation ended relatively shortly and we both went to bed. Fast forward to the next day, idk why but she asked me if I had matched with him. I had planned on telling her later that night after her midterm but did not yet have the chance to. I told her the truth and she was understandably hurt as she really likes this guy. She asked why i would swipe right and i tried to explain to her but she didn’t believe me. She has since told me that “she can’t be friends with someone who could so easily do something like that to her” and my heart broke. I’ve talked to some other people about this and they don’t think i’m all that in the wrong here but i can’t tell. so AITA?

I basically run the household. My mom works third shift, so she sleeps all day. When she is awake all she and my step-dad do is play video games. I've woken up for school around 5:45 am to my step-dad still playing. (He doesn't have a job) I'm the one who cooks dinner almost every night. I'm the one who has to initiate chores bc they won't. If it gets bad enough they will yell at us, but that is it. 

Now on to the post.

My mom and step-dad left today around 11:30amish maybe even earlier to go get oil for my moms car. They just got home (1:50pm). They walk in carrying some groceries, and food from a restaurant. I was kinda upset bc we never go out to eat as a family, and when I cook we don't eat as a family. So I was a little upset. But then I heard she got her eyebrows done and her nails. That made me really mad. I would jump at any opportunity to get my nails done, but never can bc my mom either ""doesn't have enough money for that"" or doesn't want to drive me. She told me it was a last minute thing. But it still made me mad. 

All while this was happening I was texting her making sure they were safe (we got hit with some bad snow so it wasn't the safest to be driving). 

So while I was worried about them, she was happy as a clam getting her nails done, knowing I ask her all the time to take me and that I would be upset.

Me (24m) and my girlfriend (23f) have been in a relationship for 4.5 years. We have had our fair share of issues but we still plan on marrying each other when the time is right.

Coming to the main point of this post, my girlfriend is going through a particularly shitty time in her life.

On the other hand, my life has never been better.

My girlfriend can't do most of the things she wants to, because her situations don't allow for it. She can't get out of her house much (or altogether) either due to the same reasons.

Now, she expects me to not do stuff on my own because she is stuck and can't do anything either. For example, go to consecutive parties with my friends when she can't join us, smoke up, etc.

I've tried my utmost best to understand her situation and make efforts to not upset her more than she already is. Like skipping a few events, not go out without her many times in a row. But when I start doing these things, I always end up feeling like I have to put arbitrary restrictions on myself for nothing.

Today was one of those days and I said to her that I don't think that I shouldn't enjoy myself when you're not with me; and that I'll continue to live my life how I want.

Her main point was that I shouldn't do any of it because her life isn't going at all good and seeing me enjoy myself just makes everything worse for her.

To this I said that this is a you problem and if our situations were reversed, I wouldn't stop her from doing anything.

However, when I come back in the house, she tells me the baby’s not going out, that I should’ve used common sense, when I went outside to setup the stroller, I should’ve known its too cold (baby has gone out in similar weather before). 

She then yells at me that she had to pump milk and that I just dumped the baby on her, that if I was angry about having to put the things away, I should just leave.

It was the last day of our exams and previously we had made plans to hang out with each other because we were so busy, we couldn't talk to each other properly for so long.

For context, BSF and i are friends for like 8 years, we went through thick and thin together. But like 3 years ago, we got separated into two different departments at school and we both made other friends in our respective fields. She got new best friends, and I got a bunch of new friends I hung out with, but she remained my best pal still. In her new group of friends, there are a bunch of people I'm not comfortable with because when we were younger, we were very close and we had a fallout, with me and BSF sticking by each other's side until we got separated. But I always try my best to be good to them regardless, even though they ignore me and make me feel like an outsider which I accept I am but at least I would expect my BSF to actually try to make things less awkward for me when she is the one who invites me to hang out with her in their company. She never comes when I invite her btw, or she just asks me to come over to hers when I initiate but those girls have got to there every damn time.

Now, I would very much prefer it if she invited me to hang out with her alone instead of making things awkward for both me and her friends but for some reason, her friends are always there. I can never have her to myself for a moment and we slowly drifted apart. She changed a lot in their company which honestly, I wouldn't have care about because people grow up, if it wasn't for the worst. She had so many dreams regarding her studies and career but now she barely pays any attention to that and focuses more on partying. She got a boyfriend, a red flag I warned her about but she thought I wasn't happy for her and stopped telling me about it until they had a very nasty break-up for the very reason I first mentioned.

Anyways, everything has changed and I'm not sure I even recognise her anymore. I've tried talking to her but her friends ALWAYS have to be there. The latest plan I made with her was my last attempt at trying to reach her because I'm sick of crying every time she leaves me behind for them. I was afraid she'd bring her friends along with her on the last day too so I texted her asking about it. She just cancelled, told me she was going somewhere else and assumed I wouldn't want to go. She asked me to postpone our plans which I was VERY sad about and then she went out with her friends again. It hurt me so much I don't even want to talk to her again but yesterday she reached out to me to set a date for our plan. 

I actually want to cut her out of my life now but then I think about our good old days together.

Context: In my early-mid 20s I was part of a 4-member friend group. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, I was secretly in love with a man we all knew, but I didn't share it. (or with ANYONE in my life except two close family members) Things with that man escalated to the point that we were dating by the end of the year. I immediately told all my friends, most of whom could see it coming because I talked about him a lot &amp; we spent a lot of time together. Ashley was the only friend offended that I hadn't told her I liked him, but I reassured her that only two people in my life even knew that fact. She forgave me &amp; we moved on. I have ZERO indication that any of these friends also liked him.

When I married him, I asked these friends to be my bridesmaids. They agreed &amp; arranged my bridal shower, attended my bachelorette party, etc. In this particular 4-person friend group, the other two friends never indicated any hurt feelings.

Shortly after getting married, my husband &amp; I moved out of the country for 9 mo. All friends &amp; family were happy for us. I stayed in touch with the friend group (including Ashley) as best I could, but we had moved out of the country, &amp; were EXTREMELY busy the entire time, so upkeep with relationships at home slacked off. ALL my friends &amp; family understood this.

&amp;#x200B;

Once home, I met up with my friend group in person &amp; all seemed normal. This was Oct 2019. There was an incident where I jokingly made fun of Ashley for Kpop guys she liked. Literally the next day, I thoroughly apologized for it. We had a short, kind discussion, and she readily forgave me for it and we moved on.

In Nov, I floated the idea of trying to get together again as a friend group, but it was the holidays, we all got busy, and the meeting fell through.

I apologized in Jan about that not working out and asked if we could try again. Other friend happily agreed. But radio silence from Ashley.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the last time I ever heard from Ashley. She has since cut me out of my life &amp; will not respond to messages. About a year later I tried to meet up &amp; she stood me up &amp; has avoided me for three whole years.

The group kind of fell apart. I'm still in touch with the other two friends, but we're not close anymore. However, none of them have actually cut me out of their lives.

It's only Ashley who has completely shunned me. If there was something I did that may have offended her, we discussed it and she forgave me, so it makes no sense that she would have revoked her forgiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if she was bitter that I got married and she's still single, but she was happy for me, planned my bridal shower and was one of my bridesmaids! It makes no sense that she would retroactively be mad about it. And there's no way it was the joke about her liking Kpop guys because I apologized for it and she literally forgave me.

She raised me in a very luxurious lifestyle. She paid for 100% of my tuition and living expenses and gave me an allowance when I got out of school and was struggling. She gave me the down payment for my apartment. She gave me everything.

My Mom is also… not always nice. For example:

* When I was a kid she would find something to yell at me about nearly ever day. Her favorite things to call me were lazy, selfish and ungrateful.
* When I was a teenager and did something she didn’t like, she would threaten to send me away to go live with my father - in another state where I had no friends, and who we both knew didn’t want me. 
* When I got a couple of B’s in my first semester freshman year, she threatened to cut off my tuition because I was ""wasting her retirement money"". (I talked to the financial aid office and they put together a loan package for me but she never followed through.) 
* Whenever I did something she didn’t like, she would say I didn’t love her and I hated her and she was done with me.

She wasn’t like that all the time. She would shower me with praise and gifts one day and then scream at me the next.

Now she only has outbursts every 8-12 months or so. They are pretty awful when they happen, but mostly I just cry for a few days and then life goes on. Most of the time when I see her now she's happy to see me and she's very nice. But I'm getting married soon and I’m starting to stand up to her when she gets mean. Then she sent my fiancé a few really awful emails, which absolutely can’t go on.

So I wrote her a letter saying her behaviour has to change or I won’t have a relationship with her. She had to go to therapy, and she had to let me email her therapist some examples of the text messages and emails she sends. My Mom either lies about, or doesn’t remember, a lot of her actions. I don’t think therapy is going to do her any good unless her therapist really knows about her behaviour.

Mom said she wouldn’t let me contact her therapist. So I gave gave her an ultimatum. I won’t communicate with her until she lets me email her therapist examples of her own texts and emails. I blocked her on everything and told her to tell my aunt (who talks to both of us) if she’s ever ready to let me email her therapist. If we are still No Contact at the time of my wedding, I would not want or allow my mom to be there.

My parking neighbor to my right is parking in the middle of two parking spots. This provides him with a good 3-4 feet of room to swing open his doors without hitting another car or getting door dings on his car.

After moving in to a new apartment building I noticed for about 2 weeks that he does this everyday so I assumed that the reserved spot which he was parking over was not reserved. So I started parking my car slightly to the right and onto the parking line (and perhaps sometimes a few inches over) since there was plenty of room to my right cause of how he parks. I figured this would also give my left parking neighbor a few more inches of wiggle room and give me a few more inches of wiggle room. 

I thought that my parking neighbor to my right would not mind since he parks in the middle of 2 spots. Well this morning I get a call from my leasing office saying that I need to stop parking on the line cause it’s causing my neighbor to park incorrectly himself. This is not true cause he was parking this way even before I modified my parking behavior. I also found out that my right neighbor is actually paying for 2 parking spots and so I guess that is why he is parking in the middle of two spots. Even with me parking on the line or a few inches over the line there is still a good 3 feet between our cars.

He went and complained to the leasing office about the way I park and they threatened to tow my car. So my question is… AITA for parking on the line since I noticed he was parking in the middle of two spots and thought this would help space out parking for all of us including my left neighbor? Or is he the a**hole for complaining to the leasing office despite the fact that he has ample room on both sides of his car even with my car on the line? I understand that he is paying for two spots so he is entitled to his full two parking spaces but I thought he was being petty given that there is no negative impact to him; however I am conflicted in my mind as to who is in the wrong here so I thought I would post this and get some opinions!

For a bit of background, I'm (20m) really sarcastic and always have a side joke for whatever my friends can say, for example:

""Im hungry"" R: then eat some food
""Im about to not go to class today"" R: Well nobody is stopping you, and other similar side remarks, that vary from being more lighthearted to sometimes being a bit too strong, from my POV. 

My friend (21f) was having a hard time in an exam and she was obviously pissed. She is known to be... Difficult, to everyone that may respond or say something she thinks is ""talking bad to her"" or doesnt like. After she was done, we had another class and she said that she didnt feel like going, and this is how it went:

Me: ""Then dont go, nobody is stopping you""
Her: ""Did I ask you? If im not talking to you then dont answer me""
M: ""Dude you do know that you're not pissed at me specifically, and that im not talking bad to you""
H: (screaming) Yeah you are, you dont have to talk aggresively to me, and im not talking bad to you
M: But Im not, this is literally how I talk to you, all of the time
H: (screaming again) Then you need to learn how to fucking talk better to people

Side note: (When I say talking bad is the tone, dont know a word in english for that) 

After that I just left her alone, but I was so fucking pissed tbh, I believe in no way or form I hurt her sating that and he fking exploded on me in front of all our friends.

After some time, I grabbed her aside and talked to her about it and now we're on good terms. Her excuse is that she is like that and that I should know when not to do those kind of remarks, and that she knows shes in the wrong and is working on not exploding like that. Thing is, thats a flat out lie, in the time Ive known her shes ALWAYS been like that. I know I shouldnt be forcing my point of view in her (which is: yeah i know youre pissed, but thats no excuse to talk to people like trash either), but we've had fights like this many times already.

We are short staffed and if anyone is out, it affects everyone and everything. 

I was scheduled to go on vacation yesterday through Monday. On Tuesday, my coworker told me he was not feeling good so I told him to go see the doctor. He told me he had a headache and runny nose.

He ended up taking the rest of the week off, with this happening, I knew my coworkers would struggle badly so I took it upon myself to cancel one of my vacation days and help out. Nobody asked me to do this, I did it myself due to my boss helping me out and being an overall great boss. 

I was pretty upset at my coworker because while he did seem sick, I feel he was faking the severity. While on my break, I see him get tagged on a Facebook post that he's at the beach. He's smiling and next to his girlfriend. 

I immediately take a screenshot and send him a message asking if he's really at the beach, he replies and says yes, not to say anything but that he was out of personal time. 

I tell him that I canceled one of my days because he was ""sick"". He doesn't respond so I send the screenshot to my boss. 

Maybe an hour later, I get a mass email saying that my coworker is no longer with us. My coworker calls me asking me if I told on him and I said yes, that it wasn't fair that he gets to sit out lying that he's sick. He calls me an asshole and a snitch and blocks me on Facebook. 

Alot of people are calling me selfish but it really wasn't fair that I had to cancel my day when he could've been here helping.

I've been trying to maintain professional boundaries with him but he has a habit of oversharing and trying really hard to get into my personal business even though we do not have that kind of report. He hugged me without my consent at one point and I shut that down yet he still is trying to get close to me. Even being a little nice to him gives him permission to get too close to me again so I've gradually become less and less talkative and now I rarely make eye contact. He became very fixated on my percieved emotional states so every time we work together he can't help but to ask if I'm okay.

He also has a history of anger management issues and brings up really uncomfortable topics at work that makes most of my other coworkers (all women) feel uncomfortable. He's been very open about his trauma history so I get where it comes from but I also have a lot of my own trauma so I know it's not an excuse for what he's doing. 

I reported him to my immediate supervisor however it seems they're friends so he hasn't been taking my concerns seriously. He did talk to this coworker only after the second time I reported this issue to him.

The first time I reported him was when he yet again tried talking to me about my personal life and I tried explaining again that I don't feel comfortable with him asking me those things. When he refused to understand I told him to stop talking to me.

The second time was when he approached me while I was working and he said ""Are you done being grouchy with me?""

Both times I told my supervisor and he said that he's just awkward and he's been really stuggling emotionally because of his mom. It's all making me feel bad for report him in the first place but at the same time when I talk about it with a trusted lead she's very much on my side.

Okay so bare in mind I had the worst morning with being rained on then no space in the work car park. 

I then turned up to my meeting late then and just felt fed up at that point. And I have anxiety and hate people watching me walk into meetings so I walked straight over to my normal seat and just sat down. The meeting was in full swing so I just listened. 

My manager was sat on the table in front at the far end. I didn’t say morning to her and stared at the speaker of the meeting as I was feeling frustrated and just figured my good morning would come across rude anyway and huffy. I said hi at the end of the meeting though but I wasn’t my usual self I was just a bit “off” in my tone. Not rude more fed up.

Wife said she wants a puppy, I explain that I don't want the extra mess and responsibility and that I really don't want a dog. Reason being is that I already have to share our home with the cats she was given and she does little to clean up their smelly trays and mess.

We have 2 children who are my everything, I want them to have a nice home to grow up in. I can't have this because there is always animal mess and hair everywhere, the puppy has added to this too.

I spent lots of time taking up flag stone In the garden to lay some lawn down and give the kids a nice place to play. This nice new grass ended up as a quagmire of dog poo and pee. our kids never got to play on the grass I worked hard to give them.

I got all this out in conversation recently and said that I'm considering separation, she can keep the house as its the children's home.
She said I just need to stop getting mad about the dog and the mess, put everything down to my thought process.

Apparently I'm the problem here even though she repeatedly begged for a dog knowing it would make me miserable.

Sure I know I can be the A-Hole but I have been tolerating this for too long.

My close friend and I have a pretty weird relationship. We both have mental health issues and have taken it out on each other at times, sometimes necessary, sometimes totally unnecessarily and spitefully (I will admit, at times, I have played a part in the unnecessary and spiteful get backs towards her) 

We had a massive falling out in March. Her black cat, who she really did adore, passed, quite young in April. 

My partner, spoke about brining a kitten home for our family as he worked on a job and no one would take this kitten and they needed a home for it, we did want a pet and it was good timing really for us. He is black and has a bit of white over him. 

My friend, gets really upset and spiteful towards me and brings a lot of things up from our past when she feels we are in the midst of an argument, so, if I'm honest, I hold a lot back towards her at this current moment in time because, it is usually used as ammo against me at a later date, and, I just can't hack it anymore. 

We have seen eachother maybe 3 times since our big falling out in March. I've not really posted the cat anywhere since he was a kitten (and, she didn't follow me on social media at the time of me posting said cat.) 

I admit, I didn't really bring it up to her, because, she was and is still absolutely devastated about her cat passing, which is totally valid and I respect her upset towards losing a big part of her life. Each time we have met she has expressed how upset she is by the cat being gone and, I didn't want to just turn and say 'hey, look I got a black kitten!' and rub it in her face. I have tried to support and comfort her each time she has mentioned it. 

Flash forward to today, I posted my kitten, who is about 8 months now, on social media stating he was a mamas boy and she messaged me like 'wtf, when did you get a cat' and went off at me, bringing things up from the past yet again and basically said I should be letting her know key important parts of my life, even though we honestly, barely talk and both have had massive things go on in our lives recently and not messaged, not that, that bothers me either because, heck we are all busy! I don't hold a grudge against her for not updating me or feel like I'm that much of an importance to have the entitlement of knowing the full ins and outs of her life.

I've had a friend, who we will call Sarah for anonymous reasons. She's 21 years old and she acts like she's 14 at best. I've known her for 12 years and she used to be my closest friend but for the past 2 years I've noticed a change in her behaviour. 

Whenever I see her, she talks about herself and only herself and whenever I try to talk, she immediately talks over me and interrupts me, which she knows I hate people doing especially when I've waited for them to finish their conversation. 

Well as I've grown up with her and she was my only friend I felt close enough to take with me on some daytrips however she never paid which is fine, we were kids. But in last few years when we've gotten our own money, she never piad and I confronted her about it and she always says she can never afford to pay me back or that she'll pay for a Mcdonalds in return which isn't the same.

Well I've been in a relationship for over a year and I've decided to take him places instead and he pays for his end of the money as he's aware I'm financially struggling, though I do try and spoil him when I can, and in the Summer we decided to go Swimming as a lil date idea and it was fun. Well my friend started to have a little meltdown over nit being invited and insisted she go next time despite it potentially only being us 3.

Well because me and my bf both graduated this year we decided to go to a few daytrips to treat ourselves and she wasn't happy with me doing those either. But when I invite her places she expects me to pay for everything and I don't find that fair. 

She has only invited me to 3 places during our 12 years as friends and she goes out for meals every Sunday with her family and she pays yet she doesn't invite me. Now let me clear up, I have invited her with my family for meals more times that I can count and she promised she'd take me the next time but next time came, nothing...

Im hurt by this and I've confronted her about ut several times yet she promises but never actually does it. I feel used for my money and kind personality because I usually give up and let her do as she wants because she's so draining...

To make this brief. I M23 had issues with my dad after my mom died and my stepmom came along. I hated a lot of decisions that were made, but what has left a long lasting impact was taking my college fund to pay for my stepbrother's surgeries. Unfortunately, he's dead (died last year at the age of 16 from a chronic heart problem). I put my distance but still see my grandparents and uncles, aunts, cousins etc.


With the holiday season coming up, dad started talking to me through some relatives - close relatives. He went on about his overwhelming feelings of lonliness, his upcoming divorce andinvited me to spend christmas with him because he's alone and heartbroken. As a response, I told him I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives back my college fund in a form of a christmas gift. He and the others didn't like my response. He thought this was harsh and my relatives said that I was a judgemental, petty, greedy asshole to say this to him after he's lost so much. They said he did all he could to save his stepson (my stepbrother) life which they described as ""noble"" and that he doesn't owe me a thing. I went home after a big argument with my uncle who came at me for what I said.


Now I feel like shit.

I am very protective of my wife but not to the point where I make decisions for her. I’m protective in a way where I will protect her from strangers, friends, family, and sometimes herself. My wife has spent most of her life living for other people in her family. In fact it was one of the reasons why she almost didnt agree to date me.

When I was ready to propose, I went to her mother who loved me like a son already, her father who hated me, and her step father who is very conservative (not political wise, but this is very important) and showed them all my mothers ring that I planned on using. Her mother and stepdad gave me their blessing , her father hated me for asking and was incredibly disrespectful and she said yes and a month later we eloped so we can save for two big weddings; one in the Philippines where she was born and raised and one in New Orleans, my home town. Thing is we didn’t tell anyone about this but those involved in the elopement, so then we didn’t have to hear any negativity while we prepared for our lives together.

Problems really started to rise when her mother said that her immigration status could have been messed up by marrying me too early. That’s when we told her and my wife’s step father and that’s when I seen his true colors. He accused me of using my wife for financial reasons and threatened to ruin my career in the military and purposely sabotage my wife’s immigration process because we kept it from them but claimed it was only to protect himself. He’s been disrespectful towards my wife and I ever since and I don’t know how many more mental breakdowns I can watch her have while I’m not able to be close to her for a while. She has had three anxiety attacks so far. It’s been two days.

I’m not perfect and I acknowledge that.  The extent of my mistakes in our relationship has been me being distant at times, and liking instagram photos of girls I’m friends with, which she didn’t like.  

For starters, I began going to therapy about a month ago.  Naturally, I’ve spoken to my girlfriend about it.  I told her there’s a chance I might have a number of disorders.  My girlfriend responded by saying she thinks the therapist is wrong and that there’s no way I have any of said disorders - basically saying I shouldn’t trust the professional and that I should instead trust her and her zodiac signs.  This pissed me off because going to therapy was not easy for me, and she’s basically putting these thoughts of distrust in my head.

We have done some long-distance sexting too.  I sent a picture of my JOHNSON and she said she is practicing no fap and not to take it personally, but she’s not looking at it.  I know she’s not cheating and I don’t really take offense to it honestly, but I do find it funny how I’m the past, when I didn’t look at some pics she sent, she came after me and clearly got upset by it, saying that I’m ungrateful.  It feels like I’m always the bad guy.

The last and most recent thing is unbelievably petty and immature.  We were arguing about music.  I sent her a song of a female artist I like and without listening to it, she said it’s cringe and that I only like it because I’m listening with my dick.  I told her that her comment was incredibly disrespectful.  She then said that I’m the disrespectful one and basically completely ignored how I felt.
She also got mad when I told her that Harry Styles, despite what she believes, is actually not nearly as iconic as Michael Jackson.  Lmao.

Me and my best friend at the time (let's call her Pam) went to university together and if I'm honest the only reason I went was out of guilt but the has nothing to do with this. Well the weekend we moved into the dorms she wanted to meet up with this guy (Steve) she had met at an anime convention the week prior. Me being a shy, awkward 19yr old that had never left home before or been out drinking before just wanted to stay in but she (and my family who were on webcam when she asked) convinced me to go.

Long story short is me and Steve got on like a house on fire and she spent the night getting drunk and bragging about how she had slept with someone the night before. I'm not sure what she was thinking but there you go.

Me and Steve were talking non stop for the next two days before Pam started asking Steve if he wanted to hang out again. At this point he had told me that her previous behaviour was a major put off and I knew I needed to talk to Pam because well...I really REALLY liked Steve. Something worth mentioning as well is, up to that point I had never been interested in relationships due to my own insecurities and no one being that interesting to me.

So later that day me and Pam were talking about Steve and I was shaking. I hate conflict to the point that raised voices make me want to throw up and I was terrified I was going to destroy our friendship. I VERY tentatively said that I liked Steve as well and I knew instantly that it hurt her feelings. I immediately started back peddling saying I knew she liked him too and would never try to get with him because I didn't want to lose her as a friend, but she stopped me.

She told me that in the last 6 years we had known each other she had never once seen me interested in someone else or light up as much as I had been doing. She said she knew I liked him and would step back because she wanted me to be happy and that I deserved it.

Not gonna lie I cried and hugged her after that.

Me and Steve started dating and after about a week Pam started having issues. She would start harming herself (at this point I was already used to the bloody messes) and throwing herself at anything that breathed. She said she was sick of everyone being happy when she wasn't and I spent all of my time with her. I had to stop her walking into traffic and other things so many times that honestly, I did start thinking of harming myself but never did because I was scared of hurting others by hurting myself (namely Pam).

In the end Pam left university after the first semester to be with a guy she would end up marrying and I'm thrilled that she's happy now. We stopped talking after she left as well. There was no fight or anything, I was busy studying and Pam never messaged much.

10 years later Pam's still married and Steve and I are going strong with a little boy and one on the way despite a mountain of drama (another story).

""Im hungry"" R: then eat some food
""Im about to not go to class today"" R: Well nobody is stopping you, and other similar side remarks, that vary from being more lighthearted to sometimes being a bit too strong, from my POV. 

My friend (21f) was having a hard time in an exam and she was obviously pissed. She is known to be pretty much a butthole to everyone that may respond or say something she thinks is ""talking bad to her"", after she was done, we had another class and she said that she didnt feel like going, and this is how it went:

Me: ""Then dont go, nobody is stopping you""
Her: ""Did I ask you? If im not talking to you then dont answer me""
M: ""Dude you do know that you're not pissed at me specifically, and that im not talking bad to you""
H: (screaming) Yeah you are, you dont have to talk aggresively to me, and im not talking bad to you
M: But Im not, this is literally how I talk to you, all of the time
H: (screaming again) Then you need to learn how to fucking talk better to people

Side note: (When I say talking bad is the tone, dont know a word in english for that) 

After that I just left her alone, but I was so fucking pissed tbh, I believe in no way or form I hurt her sating that and he fking exploded on me in front of all our friends.

After some time, I grabbed her aside and talked to her about it and now we're on good terms. Her excuse is that she is like that and that I should know when not to do those kind of remarks, and that she knows shes in the wrong and is working on not exploding like that. Thing is, thats a flat out lie, in the 3 years Ive known her shes ALWAYS been like that, and its driving me insane. Ik i shouldnt be forcing my point of view in her (which is: yeah ik youre pissed, but thats no excuse to talk to people like trash either), but we've had fights like this many times already where she explodes for almost no reason whatsoever.

We've all been friends since elementary school and generally get along really well, asides from some occasional disagreements every once in a while. One of these disagreements is the fact that Jeremy is very obsessive over money. If he lets anyone have a dollar or two for a snack or something, he'll immediately insist on being paid back.

Some important info is that he doesn't work. Whenever he needs money he just asks his dad for it. I don't hold this against him, it's not like I'd be working my crappy part time job if I didn't have to. Another thing to add is I drive pretty much everywhere we go because I have the nicest car, and I enjoy driving (Jeremy can't drive, the rest of my friends do).

While Jeremy's behavior is annoying, in the past I've tolerated it because there's nothing wrong with wanting to be paid back when you let someone borrow money, it's just annoying. Recently I've had to cut back my hours at work because school work is more challenging. Because of this, Jeremy had been getting on my nerves more and more. It all came to a head when he loaned me 3 dollars for a drink at a gas station, and immediately began badgering me to pay him back.

This made me mad, so I responded that if he didn't ease up on his obsession over money I'd start charging him gas money. He responded that fair's fair, and told me to go ahead and he wouldn't complain. So every week I keep a note of how many miles I've driven him and my friends, and figure out how much it cost based on the gas mileage of my car, and then divide that number by 5 and send him a text with how much he owes me. To his credit, every week until this week he's paid up without complaint.

This went on for about a month, until one day Jeremy found out that he was the only one paying for gas money and went ballistic. He called me a selfish asshole for singling him out and said he wouldn't pay for gas anymore unless I started charging everyone else. I told him that he's the only one that'll make me pay him back for borrowing a few dollars, and since none of my other friends are obsessive like him, I'm only going to charge him. Then he said he won't pay, so I told him if he doesn't pay I'm not driving him anywhere, and he never responded.

He went to my friends and they're pretty split. They say it's not fair for only him to be charged for gas money, and said by charging him I was just doing the same thing to him that I hated him doing to me. They said that while his obsession over money is annoying, it's usually not that big of a deal and it's easier to just let it slide. I stood my ground and said that if Jeremy wants me to drive him around he can either continue paying gas money or stop obsessing over money, and half my friends are saying I'm acting like an asshole (2 are on my side).

It has been a couple years since he's been there and he recently got his visa, and since the beginning of his documentation process, he suggested we did the same thing for me.

I didnt get to see my dad much growing up and have built a much stronger bond with my mom. Even though we don't get along all the time, me and her have been together troughout my life. I wouldn't say i don't have a good relationship with my dad, but it's not the best since we both don't know much about each other. We've always talked trough video-calls and met (sometimes) once a year, and when we did he was busy with work, although he would make time for me.

Also, my dad remarried and his wife doesn't really like me. To the point of this story: when I was in high school my dad started saying that he wanted to take me to the US because it has great opportunities,etc. I was uncertain so he decided for me and we started the process. Fastforward a year later I graduated high school and got into uni! but at the same time my dad said that the last part of the process was coming up, and I had to go do the interview and all the other parts of it. Really stressful year... I have already gone through all that and next year I'll travel to the US so we can finish it. The thing is, i don't want to stop studying now, nor do I wanna take a gap year when I have the means necessary not to,and as I have said, i don't know if I want to live there.

The probem wouldn't be his wife or the living situation, we can manage that,but I wanted to be able to make this decision for myself, i feel like I have no agency.

I threatened to expose the questionable things I know about their family because they told me they would make life difficult for me if I didn’t cooperate. 

My brother is now dealing with the fallout from what I did and my family are demanding I apologise for his sake. I’ve refused to and I told my brother I hoped he got fired which has made me unpopular with my family who now think I was rude to his boss on purpose to get him fired.

Okay so bare in mind I had the worst morning with being rained on then no space in the work car park. 

I then turned up to my meeting late then and just felt fed up at that point. And I have anxiety and hate people watching me walk into meetings so I walked straight over to my normal seat and just sat down. The meeting was in full swing so I just listened. 

My manager was sat on the table in front at the far end. I didn’t say morning to her and stared at the speaker of the meeting as I was feeling frustrated and just figured my good morning would come across rude anyway and huffy. I said hi at the end of the meeting though but I wasn’t my usual self I was just a bit “off” in my tone. Not rude more fed up. 

WIBTA? Do you think it makes me really asshole ish to just ignore them completely ans not a knowledge their existence?? I keep feeling awful for it.

I have started a job that requires me to sit a lot of exams which has gotten me stressed. I had my first exam last week. I sat the exam at home and once I was finished I went into the sitting room to tell my girlfriend how it went.

I was excited because I think I have done a lot better than expected so I was telling her about it. While I was doing this she was sat on her phone scrolling tik tok and other social media. When I entered the room she looked up then straight back to her screen without even asking how it had gone. Then when I talked to her about the exam, she nodded once and didn't even look up.

This was disheartening so I left the room and she came up and asked me what was wrong. I explained I was upset that she doesn't seem to care how my exam went and didn't seem to listen to me when I was talking about it. Her response was that I knew she is proud of me and that she was listening but she wouldn't listen to the point that she didn't respond at all and the whole me knowing she's proud of me isn't really true when she isn't showing it.  I tried explaining to her that it was clear she was ignoring me since she didn't respond in the slightest and she called me an AH for not believing her and accusing her of ignoring me.

my grandparents are like tom and jerry , they absolutely despise each other . Grandma treats grandpa like shit. . 

recently grandma fights with grandpa everyday and then starts crying and telling me how much she hates him . I am a person who gets severe anxiety with this type of situation , it keeps revolving in my head the whole day and i don't know how to comfort people which ends up like me feeling awkward what to do . 

i have often heard grandma bitch about me and lie to my aunts even when i talk politely to them and have not said anything she tells my aunt . 

i tried avoiding this situation by sleeping till 6 am to 1 pm since i have entrance exam for college and i can't focus on study when i feel anxious but everytime i step my foot on living room to eat she starts crying , it makes me feel guilty and my thoughts revolved around grandma for the whole day .

It has been a couple years since he's been there and he recently got his visa. The thing is, since the beginning of his documentation process, he suggested we did the same thing for me.

I didnt get to see my dad much growing up and have built a much stronger bond with my mom. Even though we don't get along all the time, we have been together troughout my life. I wouldn't say i don't have a good relationship with my dad, but it's not the best since we both don't know much about each other. We've always talked trough video-calls and met (sometimes) once a year, and when we did he was busy with work, although he would make time for me.

Also, my dad remarried and his wife doesn't really like me. Well, to the point of this story: when I was in high school my dad started saying that he wanted to take me to the US because it has great opportunities,etc. I responded with uncertainty, yes it would be nice to live somewhere else but I also want to keep studying where I live and choose where I wanna go. He didn't really seem to listen so next thing I know he already started doing the documentation process, and I just went along with it (which I regret).

Fastforward a year later I graduated high school and got into uni! but at the same time my dad gave me the news that the last part of the process was coming up, and I had to go do the interview and all the other parts of it. Really stressful year... I have already gone through all that and next year I'll travel to the US so we can finish it. The thing is, i don't want to stop studying now, nor do I wanna take a gap year when I have the means necessary not to,and as I have said, i don't know if I want to live there. 

The probem wouldn't be his wife or the living situation, we can manage that,but I wanted to be able to make this decision for myself, i feel like I have no agency. I've been thinking to disclosure this to my dad when I'm there. I'm feeling guilty because he really bent over backwards so this could work and paid a LOT of money.  Everybody tells me that this is a great opportunity and I should grab on to it, so i feel like I'm just whining about something stupid and being a privileged baby.

I have been working my way through it for a bit less than a year and my mum knows this was my idea - I even asked her to help me knit extra favours for some family friends who were not on the guest list.

Today my mum tells me that her friend (who I never met) made us our wedding favours - they are sewn hearts which makes me think my mum asked her to do this, as it's a very similar concept to what me and my partner had thought of. 

Now, it is obviously a sweet gesture, but I don't particularly like the fact that this was done without telling us (nor do I like the fabric pattern, tbh), I have worked on our favours for ages which means all of that work is now useless, and the friend made 30, so there would still be some missing.

I'm not very happy with my mum as she has a habit of taking over small details, thinking it's not a big deal, and it isn't, but it's more the principle of this being done without letting me know.

I met G in college &amp; introduced the 2 of them. The 3 of us became so close that he was part of our weekly girls nights &amp; our local bar knew our orders cuz we were there so often. Suddenly, K &amp; G start hanging out without me. I was jealous at first cuz they wouldn’t even ask if I was free. I got over it the first few times cuz I’ve hung out with both of them, without the other. Then, it started happening more often &amp; felt like a secret. So, I began having bad anxiety over it. 

For context, I was bullied in school &amp; have had bad luck with friendships ending poorly, despite my efforts to be a good friend. I was manipulated &amp; used for 12 years by a girl I thought was my best friend (K was used by her for a couple years too). As a result, I have intense trust issues within friendships, especially with lying &amp; friend groups. I’ve never felt like I belong &amp; K knows this. 

I reach out to K about my anxiety surrounding her &amp; G. She assures me there’s nothing to worry about. Nothing changes though, they still hangout without me &amp; seems to be more frequent. So my anxiety rises. 

The 3 of us go out one night &amp; I see a hickey on G. So I secretly text K, she FREAKS out — like physically &amp; verbally. I think nothing of it. G later asks me if there’s anything I keep from K. I say no, that she knows every detail of my life. He then asks K, she gives him a harsh look &amp; practically says the same. 

A couple weeks later, no change. They’re still excluding me (blaming my sleep &amp; work when I’ve tried to compromise times we can hangout). So, I get a bad gut feeling. I text K about it, saying “wtf?” &amp; explain all my anxiety. She beats around the bush, trying to get me to meet them for breakfast so we can all talk IRL. In that moment I KNEW something was up. So I told her to tell me then &amp; there, she calls me. 

I accuse them of fucking pretty much rightaway &amp; she says “not yet, but we’ve done other stuff”. The hickey was from her. I go OFF at her about friendship &amp; lying, how we don’t do that — cussed her out &amp; said some things I’m not proud of. 

I talked to G in person &amp; he had a “it’s my life” attitude, despite K telling him my past. He said K wanted to be the one to tell me, which I get &amp; respect that he honored it. 

For months, nothing changed — they hang out 3-4 times a week without me. I kept getting anxious &amp; annoyed (this is my BFF &amp; close friend I never see). G started getting annoyed with ME &amp; tried to make me feel guilty for getting sad over not seeing my friends. 

6 months later &amp; not a lot was resolved. I still experienced past trauma brought up &amp; K tells me she wants to ask G to be her BF. I tell her I’m happy for her &amp; support them, but I don’t see them getting married. I knew it was harsh &amp; I reiterated that we’re all very young so I didn’t see it at the time.

I, 17F, have an older brother “Ben”, 21M. He’s in law school six states away and ngl I miss him. Since college and rent etc are so expensive he doesn’t visit home very often, only on holidays and special occasions since travel home would cost him a lot. It was our dad’s 50th birthday last weekend and Ben decided to surprise him with a visit home. We’ve been planning it for about a year now and Dad was so happy when he saw Ben at his party!

Here’s where the issue starts. Ben was home for four days and he asked me to go to the cinema to watch a movie. I said yes bc I wanted to hang out with my big brother while he was here. 

 The problem is I had asked my friends (Cara 17F, Elias 16M and Dana 16F) if they wanted to go see that exact movie about a week prior. They ignored it in our groupchat and I figured that meant they didn’t want to go.Elias responded but said he was at a family gathering that evening so he couldn’t go which I didn’t mind.

But I posted on Snapchat about seeing the movie with Ben and Cara and Dana blew up at me in school the next day. They said we already had plans to go see the movie and that I should’ve gone to a different one with Ben. 
I said they had never told me they would come and they gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. 

Elias said they were wrong for being mad but said I should apologize to keep the peace. They’ve been my best friends for years and I don’t want to blow up our friendship over something small. I did invite them after all so maybe I should’ve followed up.

Kevin got engaged recently and everyone is fan girling over it. He came in and bragged about how his fiancee knew he had the ring and was snooping, so he hid a ring box with a very realistic large fake spider as she hates spiders, and was laughing about her reaction.

Madison and I are pretty friendly so I mentioned that I feel bad for Kevin's girlfriend as he seems abusive. She said it was a cute story and he's clearly crazy about her. I just shrugged and said I would personally never except a proposal from someone with such red flag tendencies. Madison snapped at me that I was probably jealous as what girl wouldn't want Kevin, and he was just being cute and playful and my boyfriend is a skinny dork.

I was furious. I stewed for a day and then sent an email to HR as I feel personal insults cross the line. Madison was called in for a conversation and Kevin decided to have a talk with me. He said I should have gone to him instead of HR over Madison (what???) and he said he didn't appreciate me judging his relationship. Then he laughed and said ""it's ok I know everyone is jealous of \*his fiancee's name\* who can blame them.

My baby was only 1 month old so I stayed home to keep her healthy (bride and groom were fine with it). I already missed my other brother’s wedding (he eloped) so missing this one was very hard on me. I wanted to be as involved as possible and get to know the bride’s friends and family. I love the bride like my own sister and friend (we’ve taken weekend trips together and both gotten along well since day one). 

I was in another wedding 2 months before theirs that was local and did everything. Bridal shower, bachelorette weekend, in the wedding, while very pregnant and had an amazing time (hello, built-in DD!). I also had an extremely easy pregnancy and wanted to be involved in every part of both weddings. 

Back to my brother’s wedding. Months ago I received the polls to select bachelorette time and place preferences, and the tentative itinerary for the selections. At no time did I ever say I wasn’t going to attend, and had discussions with the bride about how excited I was (I even checked out local medical centers in advance in case there was an emergency). Bachelorette weekend was nearby not across the country. And I was excited to meet the bride’s closest friends! 

After December (bachelorette was set for June) I heard nothing at all from the bride’s sister who organized everything. The next I heard of it was at a party with the bride a week before the bachelorette where she was saying she’d miss me next weekend. I was pretty shocked because to my knowledge I was invited as I am a bridesmaid and was invited by her and her sister. I assumed the sister was super delayed on asking for Airbnb deposit money and bad at planning things. 

I was very hurt and didn’t immediately say anything to the bride because: 1. Bride is very genuine and not a malicious person so while I don’t know for sure, I don’t think she was aware that I had been silently uninvited and I don’t think she would have made such a big decision for me 2. Bride’s sister has jealously issues towards the bride and is often very nasty to her so what I most suspect happened is she excluded me entirely and lied to her sister 3. My brother (groom) does not like her sister because of how nasty she is to the bride. He also holds grudges for years so I’m afraid telling either the bride or groom the whole story would lead to fights and problems that he wouldn’t let go of for a very long time.

Would I be the asshole if I asked one of them anyway? Someone has already hurt me and whether intentional or unintentional, I’d like some closure and answers, even if that means hurting someone else’s feelings in return. My mom keeps telling me to drop it but it’s not going to stop bothering me so I want outside opinions.

He got arrested the day of my engagement and he called me 3 days later, he was crying asking me if he could be in my life again cuz he doesn't know what to do without me in his life.

I had already asked someone to walk me down the isle because my dad was absent for so long. He said all the rules were completely fine with him. Then he called my sister to complain. She told me he asked ""why can't I walk your sister down the isle like wtf. And why can't ***** come?
