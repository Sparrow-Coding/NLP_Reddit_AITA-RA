We got married during covid and last week we took our first family vacation will all the kids (we both share custody with our exes). I have two boys from my first marriage (7 and 6yro), and my wife has one boy from hers (7yro). The boys get along great. We have a baby together (1yro girl). 

At our vacation, we took dozens of pics of the kids, obviously. Then I told my sons to pose for their mom (we were away for 10 days and she asked me for a picture of the boys). My wife got mad and said I shouldn't exclude my stepson. I told her I'll take a picture of al the kids as well, I just have to take one of my sons for my ex (their mom). 

I took the picture, sent it to my ex, then we took a bunch more pics of all the kids, as we have for the days before. When the kids were asleep later, my wife confronted me about the picture I took of my sons, and I told her I don't think it was a big deal. I've taken a bunch of pics of all the kids, of just our girl, od just the boys, of the kids individually etc. 

She said I'm excluding her son, and I told her that's not true. I love my stepson, and she knows it. She then yelled at me and said he (my stepson) has enough issues with his dad and shouldn't have to beg for his stepdad's love as well. 

I told her I think she's really overreacting, it was just one picture and none of the kids even gave it a second thought. We ended up having a fight.

I [F32] I met this wonderful man 'Philip"" [M36] 2 years ago. We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son ""Billy"" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.


I have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).


The latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them ""ignorant"" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.


Now they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd ""automatically"" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.


We went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy.

My husband and I and our 2 kids moved in with my sister ""Camila"" days ago after we'd lost our old apartment. She's older than me but is single and has no kids. Only pets and a ""new"" boyfriend. He's probably her 3th-4th maybe in just one year.


So last night, at 10:30 .PM the door rings and I go downstairs to see who it is (my husband was in the living room watching football, kids were already in bed, Camila was in the shower). I open the door and find her new boyfriend standing there. I said hi and he said he brought some snacks for Camila. I said that was nice thennasked if he was planning on spending time with her and he said yes since they agrred to meet at her place. Inthen asked if he was intending on spending the night and he looked at me confused and said yes. I felt a bit uneasy and told him I'd prefer it if he not spend the night since first of all, it's already 10:30 at night. And second of all, Camila's room is right next to the kids' and I didn't want their sleep to get interrupted by any kind of noise. He must've understand what I meant by noise but said that ""I didn't have to worry about it"". I asked him to please just hang out in the livingroom for a while then go home but he started giving me an attitude and flatout asked if me and my husband ever have s when the kids are home. I was astonished by this but refraied from answering as it seemed like a very rude and personal question. We got into an argument then my husband got involved and told him it was best that he leave. He left but must've called Camila because she came running downstairs and started arguing with me asking why I kicked her boyfriend out like that. I corrected her saying I did not kick him out but was just trying to ask him to not spend the night and potentially disrubt the residents sleep. Camila lashed out sayinf it wasn't my call to make and that it's her house and her boyfriend was basically her guest. My husband apologized but still agreed with me that her boyfriend was being disrespectful showing up late at night and causing a scene and responding rudely when asked something. She stormed off after calling me and my husband the ""rude"" and controlling ones and in about 10 minutes, she came downstairs dressed and ready to leave. I asked where she was going but she ignored me.

We're good friends, but whenever we organise plans, it's always me reminding him about them, and honestly, it gets annoying after a while to have to both organise everything and then make sure he's aware of what's happening. 

I've mentioned to him a few times that this hurts me, as it makes me feel as though he doesn't value our friendship enough to remember when we're hanging out. I also don't think it's asking a lot for him to just jot things down in his calendar, so he's aware of what's going on and when.

I should say at this point that he is not neurodivergent and is a project manager at work, so knowing where he needs to be and when he needs to be there is part of his job. 

A mutual friend of ours was in town last night, so a month ago, I booked us all a table at a nice restaurant. I told my friend when I booked the table where we were going and what time to be there. I also reminded him about it two weeks ago. 

This week, I decided that, for once, I wasn't going to remind him again, either during the week or on the day. I figured he's a grown man: if he wants to be there, he'll remember, or he'll ask me.

Needless to say, he didn't show up. Our mutual friend and I had a good night anyway, but this morning he messaged me asking if the meal was tonight (as in Saturday night) or next week. I replied, saying it was yesterday and that he'd missed it.

He's now really pissed off at me for not reminding him.

We’ve exchanged stories about abusive past relationships and family troubles (casual 2020 lockdown conversations).  
   A little background, we live together now unfortunately. They were both popular, and peaked in high school. I will refer to them as Thing 1 and Thing 2. 

    Thing 1 is going through a messy breakup, and her ex-boyfriends best friend conveniently and flirtatiously shows up in my inbox. Chicks before dicks so I immediately inform her and she goes as far as calling the guy and telling everyone he wants to hook up with me. She encourages me to hook up with him because according to her other female friends he is really good in bed. I say fuck it, why not, I don’t regret it. She had 0 problems with her other girlfriends hooking up with him, and despite me being 100% honest about my intentions to have a solely physical relationship and protect her privacy while doing so she is deathly bitter towards me. 

I got really drunk one night and threw up on her carpet and told her that her ex boyfriend problems are all her fault at this point. I was frustrated because she was being so aggressive towards me ever since the reality of me hooking up with him set in. Everyday she’s yelling at me like she’s my mom for house chores/bad habits. Mind you She is still talking to the ex nearly everyday and refuses to block him, but swears she wants nothing to do with him. 

She starts talking about me to thing #2 saying I’m a hypocrite. I know this because their superficial friendship serves as an excellent game of telephone. They both talk shit about each other, thing 2 thinks #1 one is embarrassing and cringey to bring around new friends. Thing #2 thinks #1 is a selfish narcissist.

My sister and I don't get along that much, and between the three of us, I was the one who was always left out. This incident happened during the weekend. It was 1 AM, and I was asleep until I heard the water faucet in the bathroom running. ( I currently sleep in my grandparent's room alone, and the room has its own bathroom) When I went to check who opened the faucet, I saw my second-oldest sister filling the mop bucket with water. I asked her what she was doing she said that she was going to mop so she was filling the bucket with water. I got annoyed since it was 1 AM and was telling her to get out, but she didn't, and she just stayed silent and continued filling the bucket with water. I got progressively more annoyed, and I started raising my voice. 

My eldest sister went into the room and told us that we were too loud and that we might wake up my grandmother. I was trying to explain what was happening, and she said that I was being entitled. I got angry and was telling them to get out. I started to give little kicks (which I didn't put much strength into) for them to get out, and when I did that, my eldest sister got angry and started kicking me for real. She kicked me right in the middle of my chest, and it hurt a lot that it was hard for me to breathe for a good minute. After that, I kept crying because it hurt, and they said I was being dramatic.

I (M13) was friends with L[13] for nearly 10 years, he is autistic and is extremely hated in my class but we will get into why soon.

For some Context my best friend let's call him M(M13) is always forced to do whatever L wants, for example one day he said can you buy me this shirt, Shirt was £15. 

Obviously M said no but L took a massive tantrum and got banned from the store because he knocked down an entire aisle worth of stuff.

There are 4 major incidents for why I hate him and I will order them from bad to worst.

1. Saying the N word multiple times and believing he should have a pass even though he isn't black.

I think this part is pretty self-explanatory, basically I was hanging out with L and my other friend I(13M) and all of a sudden L goes,

L: Do you want to hear a joke?
I: Sure
L: What is another name for fried chicken?
Me &amp; I: What
L: *says the n word three times*

Now I is black so he took a major offense to him saying the word and just stood yo and left, I confronted him and he said that the rock said the N word multiple times so why shouldn't I?

Somehow word got around and L can't go anywhere without being called Rascist

2. Attacked me because I sat next to my best friend.

This one actually happened twice but they basically have the same rhythm.

I'm in technical class and I go to my usual bench to see that L is standing there, I go over and see that he is taking out my stuff and dropping it on the floor, I obviously get passed off and go..

Me: What are you doing
L: this is my seat now, move it OP
Me: Your not going to make me move anywhere.

All of a sudden L pounces at me with q block of wood and hits me on the leg with it, I am pretty weak so I couldn't fight back that well, Then the teacher separates us and L got a detention.

3. Tried to stab someone with a chisel

You read this right, someone tried to steal L's seat and in response he grabs a chisel and tries to stab him around his liver, this story does go way deeper around a month of story but I'll explain very quickly

The boy fights back and uppercut him somehow not breaking anything, L's reputation was even deader now, He stayed off for 5 weeks and constantly bragged about his ""victory"" and when he came back he was beaten up.

4. Accused me of saying the F slur and admitted he tried to get me in major trouble

He all of a sudden started spreading this around, he then admitted it was all lies and got suspended for a day.

I recently got rid of him from my life but he still is in most of my classes and now is calling me an asshole

He dumped me cuz my mental health caused problems in the relationship, &amp; I wasn’t making any improvements. The entirety of our time being broken up, he’s had access to everything he had during the relationship (staying with me, my car, my money, sleeping with me, etc). This is cuz I still had feelings for him, &amp; cuz of financial reasons. 

This past month, we’ve been hit with a pregnancy loss, having to repair/replace my phone twice, a car repo, a possible eviction notice, &amp; I lost the ability to work at my job. All this stress took a toll on me, &amp; affected my sleep significantly. That’s what started the fight. He brought it up, saying that I should really try to reset my sleep schedule. I agreed, stating insomnia was an issue I’ve had my whole life, that maybe I should try to get back on a psych medication that helped in the past, &amp; pointed out the timeframe of when I noticed it was getting bad again. I thought he was trying to have a conversation about it, but he stated that he didn’t need to hear excuses, he just wanted to point it out &amp; I need to enact some discipline. He also stated after each thought I spoke that he “really didn’t care” &amp; I’m going to do what I want anyways. 

I got defensive after that cuz of a couple reasons. I was confused as to why he even brought it up “out of concern” if he really didn’t care. When trying to explain that I was just thinking out loud, he was interrupting me. That’s incredibly triggering cuz of how I grew up &amp; my neuro-divergency (I don’t say this to excuse or justify my behavior, just for context). I felt the way he approached this came across as me being irresponsible, &amp; staying up all night for fun. When really, I am so exhausted &amp; spend hours on end in the dark trying to sleep. So, I started yelling over him. After enough times of hearing “I don’t care, shut the fuck up”, I lowered my voice, stating that he was committed to misunderstanding me. 

He walked towards the bathroom while I vented my frustrations out loud to myself. When he came back, he said that he was officially pissed off. He threw his bins that hold his clothes, yelling about how I do too much &amp; cause a whole scene out of nothing just to validate my own feelings. He told me to pick them up, so I did, &amp; threw them again before knocking all of the clutter off the table (it’s a studio apartment btw). I picked everything up multiple times while he continued, stating how he was going to act childish to teach me a lesson. He said he was going to keep doing this until he felt better, &amp; I gave him an answer of what I learned. Eventually, I said that he’s acting this way to mirror me, &amp; show me how unnecessary it is when I yell over little things.

We have a 8 yo son who is deep into karate. 

More background - when Covid hit, I resigned my position to help him with distance learning and generally be closer since daycare was no longer an optio and she was needed at the hospital. When society reopened, I kept the domestic role which increased with the unexpected arrival of another baby last year. I take the kids to school, daycare, karate, cook and do my best to keep the house tidy.  While I have suitable savings from a rental property I sold and we keep separate accounts for discretionary spending, we are financially dependent on her.  It's far from perfect but it's how our life together has evolved.

I take 8 yo to train five days a week, we travel out of state to competition, the works. Last month he was invited to a specialized performance camp that takes place this weekend. I briefly discussed it with my GF before signing him up and paying the fee, believing we agreed it would be beneficial. I would do all the driving (probably half a tank of gas when it's said and done) and come home between sessions to help with the baby and weekend chores.

We also have family pictures scheduled this weekend...there is about an hour between the end of camp and our appointment at the studio. Tight window, but I believed we can get it all done. 

She informed me tonight (after our son had attended the first session) that it's too much, I didn't clear it with her and that I don't care about the stuff she had planned. I pointed out that she always packs the weekends full of odds and ends, playdates, birthday parties and whatever else she feels. 

She got extremely angry very fast, said everything has to be about me and eff everything else. I lost it and yelled back that nothing is about me anymore, it all revolves around her schedule and the kids. At that point, she threw a sponge at me, started hitting the fridge with her fist, then repeatedly slammed a chair against the floor until it splintered and finally sliced the cushion with a parring knife while I stood in silence holding the baby. She has high blood pressure issues, so I just shut up. Fortunately our 8 yo was showering and didn't have to witness this and be honest, I was pretty scared. 

Later she went through all of our texts for the past month, reading them aloud to ""prove"" I hadn't discussed it with her, though this conversation took place IRL on several occasions.

I am in disbelief,  I never thought she would have an issue because the karate camp is ultimately for our child.

He now has no way to get to work and he begged me to start picking him up and dropping him off when his shift starts/ends. I told him that I would only do it when I could and I would expect $20 a month to cover gas. I thought this was a pretty sweet deal since an uber or lyft would be about $20 per ride. Instead of being grateful he moped and insisted that I drive him to and from work no matter when his shift started. I held my ground because I refuse to miss my college classes on his account. 

Anyway, the trips to and from got pretty boring so I started interchangeably listening to podcasts and music while taking him to and from. My roommate is a pretty religious guy, but so far he's kept it to himself so it was never an issue with me. He started by complaining about the types of podcasts that I would listen to, citing that they were too vulgar. He would scoff and cross his arms whenever someone swore. I thought it was kind of unnecessary and silly but whatever, not a big deal. Yesterday things escalated when I put on some rap music, my roommate gave me this scandalized look and started demanding that I turn it off. 

It was one thing for me to drive him around to work, it wasn't fun for me but I don't want the dude to lose his job. But him making demands about what I listen while I do him a favor struck a nerve. I told him that this was my car and if he didn't like it, I'm sure an uber driver will let him use the AUX cord to listen to whatever he wants. Roommate started ranting about how I'm ""what's wrong with people today"" and how I needed to get square with god. I just ignored him, dropped him off, and told him through the window that he would need to find his own way home. 

I ignored his angry texts and sure enough an hour after his shift ended he slammed our front door and threw some insults my way before stomping to his room. We haven't spoken since.

However, I wasn’t always like this, I always make sure to give my siblings freedom to enjoy their youth bc I was young, and I had my fair share of moments where I snuck out and drunk with my friends in high-school.

Before my sister left off to live in the city with her mom (different mom from mine), she has said that she was talking to a couple of guys. I told her there was nothing wrong with it as long as the guys she’s talking to are in her age group as she is still a minor. This was the time her following on Instagram increased due to her increased popularity on tiktok (content not suitable for her age btw so most of the followers were guys). As her followers grew, she’s been going out more and more bc she meets the guys she talks to thru Instagram. 

Months after, I had also gone out to live in the city for my masters degree (law school. I found out that she had been going to bars all while underage. I didn’t want to snitch on her as she was feeling lonely after having been broken up with her ex so I didn’t meddle know the situation as I thought she was mature enough to handle herself. I also felt bad that if ever I’d snitch on her, she’d be in a much worse situation. I already did my part as a sister of telling her what’s right and what’s wrong. And I had my own problems to deal with bc I’m studying in law school and I didn’t need any more outside problems.

Months after, my dad grounded her and got her phone (not related to the snitching btw). My dad found out about the guys that she was hanging out with and she was sleeping with and some of them 3+ years her age. She had also been lying to her mom that she’s been hanging out with me all while not. She had gone to my place several occasions without me knowing (according to her friends), probably to show her mom her grab location and lie that she was with me. I told my dad all what happened and that she had lied about her age to get into bars. I also showed my dad her tiktok as she might be more susceptible of peds due to the content that she’s posting. Basically, I only snitched on her when my dad asked me about what happened to her. 

I have not talked to her for a while as I felt like I was used for her to get out. My dad initially thought I was being a bad influence bc I was the one going out with her when she faked going to my place.

My sister has been staying with us for a year since she studies in a college here in the city. Recently, my wife and my sister suddenly realized they haven't ever competed against each other. Apparently, they decided they would compete with each other in a few games to spend quality ""family time"". They get along quite well with each other so I wasn't worried at first. 

We also have an eight-year-old daughter. My daughter too considers her mother a ""beautiful woman"". Now, I don't deny the fact that my wife is extremely good-looking but my daughter somehow jumped to the conclusion that her mother was going to win because she is much hotter than her aunt. When my wife was defeated by my sister in a pushup contest on the first day, our daughter was visibly upset.  The next day. my wife again lost in arm-wrestling and my daughter, who was watching the contest started accusing her aunt of ""cheating"". She kept telling that ""mamma can't lose to you because she's prettier than you."" Surprisingly, my wife jumped to her opponent's defense and told our daughter that she needs to accept the fact that she lost fair and square and pretty women can also lose.

After a string of defeats in diverse games including chess and video games, I told my wife she was losing deliberately. My wife replied that she was losing legitimately and I was being unfair to my sister by not praising her abilities. I admit my daughter might be living in a fairy-tale world but it is extremely difficult for an eight-year-old to see her mother defeated every time. I admit I was quite frustrated too because I wanted my wife to win. Today, there was a swim race between the two of them. At the end of this embarrassing contest, my daughter was naturally upset because her mama lost badly. Instead of consoling our daughter, my wife gave my sister a hug and a kiss. My daughter kept asking me ""Why is mama kissing aunt after losing?""

I found this a bit too much to bear. I don't know why my wife is not trying to win for our daughter. I have noticed that my wife herself felt quite embarrassed after losing badly but she pays no heed to our daughter's feelings. Instead, she seems more concerned about her victorious opponent. Also, my daughter was concerned about her mamma kissing her aunt. I find this kissing superfluous and have often asked me wife not to offer my sister a kiss after losing.

FE: female employee 

I bought one of those Lego build your own photo sets, pretty excited to build it. 

The transaction goes as follows:
Me: hi, these look pretty cool, how much do they cost?
FE: the price depend on the size and amount of head in the picture. For example a one person in a size of 1x2 would cost $80, one with two people at a size of 2x3 would cost $130.
During her explanation she points to a sheet that had the sizes and head count, it did not have any listed prices there but I assume that was due to photos being diffrent and that if something had less people but wanted it bigger there'd be different costs.
Me: ah ok, can I get pets done?
FE: you sure can I'd recommend at least the 2x3 size for it, but think the 3x3 would be better. If you can send the photo to this email, then I can start the digital edit.
Me: awesome, how much extra does the 3x3 cost?
FE: $60 more than the 2x3 so $190
Me: not bad, how long would that roughly take?
FE: About 20 minutes

Once done i went with the 3x3 and  confirmed that is was infact $190. 

She had to print out the instructions her coworkers printer (who was serving another person). Once ready she confirmed that it is $190, I paid and then left.

I later received an email from that employee, explaining that it cost $90 dollars more than was charged. The price paid was for 2x3 and not the 3x3. She I could either pay the extra $90 or return to exchange for the 2x3.

I reply: it was unfortunate that the error was made however I was quoted $190 for the 3x3 and confirmed it three times, as the price was not displayed going on to charge me extra would be a breach of Consumer law. I went on to say that it's the employees duty to accurately represent the prices of their company and that it should be something discussed amongst themselves and not an issue that I need to pay for. 

Later I received an email from the owner; they are sorry the employee is still new, but another employee had corrected and informed me of the price ($280) prior to me being charged and that the new employee hadn't updated the eftpos hence the error in price. They go on to state that the law is if a price is displayed they cannot charge over that however the price of the 3x3 was corrected and explained to me.

I shot off a reply saying they had better get their employees story straight and could confirm mine with the shopping centres security cameras, as I hadn't interacted with the other employee nor had the price of $190 been corrected. If the events of the other employee correcting the price was true then it would of also stand to reason that they made sure the eftpos and till would of been updated, but that it didn't occur hence the issue. I gave them the time I was there so they could check the security footage. I offered to write out a full statement of the interaction but have yet to hear back.

I'm starting to feel like an asshole as i should of just paid and not made a mess.

I got hired at this company to fulfill a specific function at which my now former colleague, whom I met in passing at a different company, was the lead and basically was to pass his responsibilities to me as this wasn't part of his job. The guy is incredibly smart, but can come off as curt and distant, but after getting to know him I came to find out he was fun to work with. I wasn't able to be ""fully trained"" due to technicalities outside his control or mine. He wasn't telling management what was happening, so everyone started to get suspicious after 12 weeks of me not being able to do my work. 

Then, this woman, whom got a female colleague of mine fired by spreading lies, started complaining behind my back about me and him. I was out for 10 days due to minor health stuff and so this woman executed work that I was supposed to be performing and failed, so she had a meltdown and reported me and him to high tier management, accused his team of ""fraud"" and implied I was being ""protected"" and she threatened to quit.

I come back to work, and this guy is not talking to me and for three days in a row I am getting questioned with the implication that he called me incompetent. So, on day four I expressed that I can't do the work if this guy doesn't allow me to in a virtual meeting (just 5 people, including him, no higher-ups but his boss was there). Long story short, I hurt his ego/feelings, so he flipped on me and I guess tried to get me fired (according to his team whom I am friends with) and kept throwing jabs at me. This woman, not satisfied with the chaos she created, kept spreading lies. I also avoided being around him because I would get upset.

I talked to a good friend of mine (she knew him) and she mentioned the reason he wasn't saying anything about my performance was likely to not make me look bad. Also, the fact that he talked to me at work was rare since he doesn't trust people easily. So, I felt like shit and tried to talk to him the week after but he refused.

I guess the pressure of work combined with the drama pushed him over the edge and he put in his resignation weeks later (He was going to quit, but not this soon).

I caught him off guard three days ago and sincerely apologized and he explained that he didn't initially know if it was me failing or something else and he threw in an apology for something. (I was incredibly tired and didn't hear what he said, I just heard ""I apologize""). I feel like I was partially responsible for him leaving like this.  I definitely saw him happier after that conversation, so there's that.

Like I said, this guy can be brutally cold and hard to talk to, but is genuinely a nice person once you get to know him. I have never betrayed anyone that has treated me well and I felt like I inadvertently ended up doing that.

This has become something of a weekly ritual for us, and in turn helps us spend more time together especially now that I work in the day time and don’t see her as often as I used to when I was a full time student in college. 

I could tell that she had been upset with me all day today but couldn’t for the life of me figure out why. To my knowledge I had done nothing to slight her and it’s typically not like her to not say something is bothering her. Still, I couldn’t find the proper time to address the issue seeing as I was busy babysitting my nieces and nephews.

However, when I went into her bedroom tonight to do our weekly TikTok bonding ritual, she was stiff and short with me. I was going to ask what was wrong before she snapped at me claiming that I had “called her old and frail” and was “flirting” with our mutual friend (34F).

For context, my mother and I had gone to our mutual friends house yesterday (We’ll call her S) and S was telling my mother about how if they started a business S would prefer me instead of her. S said that my mother is on the older side and since I take care of her and her health is already bad it made more sense to use me as a business partner instead since I’m much younger and in better health.

I don’t think S meant anything bad by this at all because it’s true. S and I are constantly worried about my mothers health and S never said it in a mean or malicious way, she was simply stating a fact.

I agreed with S that since I’m a lot younger and I take care of her already, maybe it would be easier for S and I to run the business if it ever came down to it.

As for the flirting portion, S has been known to flirt with me all the time. I never reciprocate because it makes me uncomfortable and she has a family of her own. So I have no idea where my mother got the idea that I was flirting with S.

I was confused when my mother told me why she was so upset with me and I assured her I never once disrespected her in that entire conversation. She insisted that because S called her old and frail that I was also calling her those names for agreeing that I take care of her. 

I was beyond upset and asked her if those words had ever left my mouth and she said that they hadn’t. I told her if she had a problem with what S said, then she needs to be upset with her not me. I got angry and yelled at her not to put words in my mouth because it’s disrespectful of her to do so especially considering I’ve been taking care of her for three years.

The only thing she said to me was that that wasn’t how she took the conversation before we both went quiet, so I simply left the room and am now having a crying fit.

Still, I’m not sure if I’m the asshole or not for not sticking up for my mother when S called her old.

Both parents work. His ex, Sheila, has custody of the child. Jim has visitation. They were never married. 

Jim was complaining about his ex, saying that she never lets him see his son. Every time he asks for the boy, his mother tells him that the child has an activity planned, which, to be honest, he does. Tutoring, sports, etc. Baby mama ""holds him to a calendar"" ""why does he have to make an appointment to see his son"" and ""why is he paying child support when he can hardly see his son""? And, ""this is why fathers don't stay around"". He won't plan around the calendar, because, ""I'm his dad. I shouldn't need a schedule"".

I told him to go and get custody of his son. Even 50/50. That would solve his issues. Jim said that he works, so can't take him for that long. I pointed out that the mother works as well, 40 hours like him, and she's managing to be a full time parent. Jim retorted that she was only able to work full-time because of the boy's activities. So, I again told him to get the custody agreement changed, and make some life changes to be a 50/50 parent, and he would have a say in the boy's activities. Jim refused again, saying it was ""easier for everyone"" this way. 

I laughed. I fell out of my chair, and laughed myself into a headache. I told him that these are the consequences of parenting the ""easy way"". The custodial parent makes most of the decisions. Sheila has the child 24/7. Jim tried to argue that he pays child support. I cracked up again and said that his child support is payment for the convenience of not having to physically raise his child, and to get out of my face with this bs. Jim said something about something and left.

She has exhibited behaviours such as complaining when one of our parents buys her relatively expensive clothing that she doesn’t like it after all, misplacing/losing items such as her keys, headphones or phone, as well as not appreciating the time, money and effort that others put into solving her problems. 

For context, she spends about half her time with her father, and a few weeks ago she forgot some books at our mother’s place, and asked me to bring them to her the next morning before she had to go to school. I woke up at 6:30am to bring her those books when I didn’t have to that day, and at the agreed-upon time she doesn’t show up, and after calling her says “Whoops, sorry, I actually start class at 9 today” and she had no intention of letting me know or coming to pick up the books. In the end I left them at my workplace for her to pick up.

This week again she has asked her father to drive to our mother’s place to pick up certain things she forgot which are apparently very important and she needs them urgently. That would have been a whole hour’s drive for my dad, but neither me nor mom were at home so he couldn’t do it. In the end she asked me two days ago to take these things and bring it to my workplace the next morning so she can pick them up before school, which I did, again waking up earlier and doing her a favour. 

Today I went to work and realized that she simply did not pick up the bag I left for her. Meaning that she cajoled our whole family into bending over backwards to get her her books which are apparently urgent enough for her to bother everyone about them, but not enough for her to pick them up herself!? 

Everyone has been sick of her flakiness and have been thinking of ways to discipline her, and today I feel the strong urge to tell her to pick up her books by tomorrow or else I’ll just throw them away myself. I don’t *actually* want to do it, because it is extreme, but I also feel like she might really need a reality check to see that her actions do have consequences in the real world.

Please keep this in mind for later. The other day I was walking my dog (a 4 year old Shih Tzu who is extremely well behaved) around my apartment building as my mom was busy and she doesn’t allow me to leave the apartment complex alone unless it’s necessary. I have a few friends here and they all adore my pup and know his behaviour and him really well.

My friends told me to unleash my dog so that they could play with him in the playground (which I did) and went to sit in the corner watching them play with him. He loves playing fetching games so they threw a ball and he ran to grab it. After a while of playing I leashed him again and took him near a water cooler as he looked thirsty. There was a group of ladies sitting nearby where the residential area starts. I tied up my dog a few feet away from me while i was getting water and suddenly I heard a child stomp his feet near me. 

I looked at his direction and he was trying to scare my dog as it looked. Right in front of my eyes, my dog looked at the child out of instincts but didn’t do anything further. The child screamed like a dying cat and started running away which resulted in him falling halfway. His mother rushed to him to pick him up before storming towards me and started shouting at me like I committed some crime. She said things along the lines of ‘why would you walk your dog inside a part of the building where you aren’t supposed to” And “If you can’t handle a dog than don’t get one and don’t walk it around kids.” Firstly, Karen. My dog was more than 10 feet away from you and your kids. You were too busy chatting with your friends and couldn’t take care that your child is going near a dog. My dog is again, well behaved and calm. But if she has an overreactive child who can’t keep his hands to himself than she should have minded that.

I would have understood if my dog reacted aggressively, but what he did? He looked the child’s way. That woman started threatening me that she will take action and what not. I didn’t say anything at that time as she already created a big scene and I didn’t want to attract anymore attention. I did however let her know the ‘highlights’ of what I saw. But she still chose to scream. I just walked past her, untied my dog and walked away. My friends later told me

That a lot of people were siding with her. And most of the people who were siding with her weren’t even at the scene. I wouldn’t be surprised if she made up her own version of the story and feed it to them. But now I don’t know what to do.

I (15 female) have been texting my crush (17 male) for a few months. It was nothing serious and he never asked to hang out. However, recently his behavior changed. Every time we saw each other he tried to talk to me more and I had a feeling that he liked me, and one day he asked me to hang out. I obviously said yes because I'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time. Everything went fine on the ""date"" and we talked a lot. After that, we went out a few times and it was really nice, but nothing happened between us. We only talked. I was okay with taking things slowly, so it didn't really bother me. Anyways, a few days ago he asked me to go to a circus show with him and I said no. The reason I said no was that I didn't think I would feel comfortable at the show and I would rather do something I enjoy, but I didn't tell him this. I just told him that I didn't want to go because the last time I went I didn't have fun. He tried to convince me but I didn't change my answer and from the texts he was sending me, I could tell that he was upset. I tried to be nice when I refused him, but he took it really personally and started answering my texts really dry and leaving me on delivered for a long time. After I talked to my friends, I decided that I should tell him to hang out before the show so we see each other and he understands that I wanted to go out with him, but not to the circus. He answered after a long time and he didn't seem very enthusiastic about hanging out with me, but he agreed. I was very upset with his behavior because he took it so personally and he got mad from the fact that I didn't want to go to the show, and instead of talking to me he became dry and took a very long time to answer. He hurt me with this behavior because I really care about him. When we went out, something was obviously off but we talked about random things so it didn't become awkward. I was supposed to ask him if he was okay and tell him that I was upset that he left me on delivered for so long, but I didn't want to make things even worse. Now I regret not doing that because I won't have another chance to tell him that. The thing is because of the last few days I started doubting everything and I don't know if he's interested or not, because maybe he got so mad about not going with him to the show that he doesn't want anything to do with me. He never texted me after I got home and I don't think he will because I feel like he's no longer interested. I feel really bad about how everything turned out because I care a lot about him and I'm very upset that things aren't good between us.

Basically my sister never cleans up after herself after she uses the toilet or the bathroom in general. She will leave literal shit splashbacks (if that’s what you even call it) on the toilet seat and I’ll have to clean it every time I want to use the toilet, leave toothpaste/saliva in the bathroom sink and not rinse it out (which is gross and makes it hard to clean out later), leave her hair everywhere in the bathoom even though there’s a bin right there, etc etc etc. I don’t know if she just doesn’t care about making a mess in a shared space, if she’s blind, or does it to piss me off, but whatever the reason is I’m fucking sick of cleaning up after her for YEARS. I thought initially she would grow tf up after me always telling her off or asking her to clean the bathroom, but she never did. It’s like she’s a two year old kid and I’m her mother. 

Anyway the main thing is that today after like the millionth time I asked her to clean the bathroom after herself, she once again said no and that she didn’t make a mess. So for the first time I threatened to post a picture of her mess on social media and basically expose her. She said “I don’t care, post it.”, so I did. Except I didn’t post it so everyone could see, I made it so only she could view my story. Later in the day she hadn’t viewed my story which pissed me off, so I messaged myself on my other account and swiped up on the story (I changed the viewing permissions) saying “Ew wtf was that __? Gross.” Then I edited the picture to make it look like her boyfriend’s account, and sent the screenshot to my sister.


Later today after my mom spoke to my sister, she came into my room yelling at me saying how could I do such a thing, etc. I explained to her what I did (I only posted so my sister could see, that the screenshot is edited and not real) and that the whole reason I “posted” this was to make my sister think “I don’t want others to know I’m like this, I’ll start cleaning up after myself so she doesn’t embarass me again”, so she went and told my sister. 

My sister and mom were talking and my sister thought that her relationship with her bf was over, and that I’m the reason she’s so depressed, etc. My mom once again got mad at me saying I should never do that and that it’s bullying, that I’m an asshole, etc. I don’t think I’m an asshole or that I bullied my sister, if anything I think that’s what she is, but my mom wouldn’t hear any of it. What other option did I have?? Am I really the asshole?



Tldr: I “posted” a pic of my sister’s uncleanliness in the bathroom online to “expose” her, but I made it so only my sister could view my story.

We both have children from our previous relationships. He has a 14 years old daughter that we'll call Lu and I have a 16 years old son that we'll call Ethan.

I have a 1 bedroom home with a basement that I turned into a bedroom for Ethan so we couldn't move in our home and while Jack has a 3 bedroom home he said he needed one of the rooms as an office since he WFH so we had to find another home. We decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has 4 bedrooms. One master bedroom, one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms. The master room is obviously for me and Jack and the smallest room will be his office. The issue is the other two bedrooms.

Growing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so I assumed Ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for Lu.

Ethan loved the room. A few days ago I was talking to Jack and told him how excited Ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit, he looked at me confused and said that room is for Lu not Ethan. I told him that it's not fair because Ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college Lu can get that room. He said that's not gonna happen because Lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldn't lose this. I was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that Ethan can survive it too and Ethan's last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for Lu it'll be a downgrade. I told him it's not fair that just because my son didn't have a big bedroom before he can never get one.

To make the matter worse I was talking about buying new furniture for Ethan's room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for Lu too because this whole situation is ""very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better"" he offered that he could buy new things for Lu and Ethan can use Lu's old things. I blew up at him and asked him if that's how much he cares about my son? He gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture? He thinks I'm an asshole for ""expecting his daughter to suffer for my son"" but I don't think that is ""suffering"".

Myself and my partner bought a do’er-upper house around 6 months ago. We both ripped up the carpets and old flooring, then I done majority of the dirty work and 1st fixing as I’m in the trade myself. 

I have have worked so hard to get the house to a stage where it can now be painted/cleaned etc, these are jobs where my SO can comfortably do  without me being there. We are hoping to move in before Christmas.

Around a month ago I put in our calendar for this coming weekend to give the house a good clean together as both of us were free. Around a week ago, a event popped up on my phone, it was for my SO to go out for a coffee with her friend in the morning. I thought okay fair enough a coffee won’t be that long then we can spend the rest of the day working. Then yesterday another event pops up for a beauty treatment in the afternoon. 

When I saw it on my phone I got pretty frustrated as she’d be only be at the house for 2 maybe 3 hours. I dropped her a text to say I was frustrated and that I feel like she doesn’t respect me because she’s booked in these events knowing we were together at the house and that it looks like he doesn’t seem bothered. I added at the end, ‘I know you have a short lunch so don’t worry about replying until later’.

Before that, I spent a week establishing a friendly rapport with her. Everyday, I'd smile and chat with her for 2-3 minutes before going my way. I never touched her, never stared at her, just minded my own business.

Today, I decided to talk to her in private and tell her I wanted to have sex with her. If she said yes, good. If she said no, I won't waste my time further and go look for someone else.

But the moment I mention the word ""sex"" this girl  flips out and refuses to listen to me.

Her response was ""What the hell? Get lost!!""

She absolutely refused to listen to me and didn't even let me apologize. I'll skip the details, but I'm no longer welcome at the gym. She seemed to be on the verge of tears

I told Kate about what he sent to me 3 months after and she told me I was being dramatic because “if you were really hurt you wouldn’t have waited 3 months” I was extremely hurt, and her and i fought about this for 2 weeks. All of our friends new what happened and we’re on my side which made her and Alex even more angry. 
I eventually apologized to her, because I just wanted it to be over. Biggest mistake ever. 

After that she never talked to any of us, not even a text. and only hung out with Alex at school (we have before school, lunch, and spare together) me and my friends were so freaking hurt. So when me and my 2 friends (our mutual friends who new about the situation) were planning on going dress shopping for our high school grad, we didn’t include her. 

We went dress shopping and it was so fun and we even got our dresses. One of our friends posted the photos and 10 minutes after, she left all group chats and unfollowed (not blocked) all three of us. 

2 days after it happened she finally texted me back. She blamed me for leaving her out and called me selfish. And I told her she hadn’t talked to us for 2 weeks so of course we left her out. This conversation lasted 2ish hours but this was the gist of it. The conversation ended with her blocking me and now she hasn’t talked to us in 3 weeks.

We are each others main support system. We don't go to the same college but grew up in the same hometown. It takes about three hours to get back home (plus I don't have a car). This Thanksgiving break, I planned on my mom picking me up on Saturday. My boyfriend's dog got put down on Friday. Over the past month, the dog has had many health scares and his parents had said that they were going to put him down just about every weekend. Every single weekend I was there for him. Whether I took the bus or I caught a ride, I was there. I comforted him each time. Last weekend I was there again, for his dog's last birthday. I took a long bus ride back to my hometown to see him when even his best friend didn't come. I got in deep shit with my parents for spending too much on bus tickets.

Last weekend we confirmed that Friday was the day his dog was being put down. Grief works in different ways. Personally, I like to be alone at first. This is why I didn't immediately start planning to go with him. I thought maybe he'd like some space. If he asked me to go visit him Friday I would have come. I love him so much and want to be there with him whenever he needs me.

He called me Friday afternoon and asked if I could call his best friend and see if I could get a ride with him that night. I said that my mom had already planned on picking me up Saturday. I asked him what he wanted me to do and he said that I could do whatever I wanted. So I decided to go on Saturday. I figured I could comfort him after giving him some space to mourn. I thought this was okay since he asked me to choose.

Friday night he calls me and is mad at me. He says I should've known to come down and see him. I mention that I really wish he had just told me directly instead of just hinting at what he wanted. (I now wish I had just left this alone because her obviously not in a great state of mind). He basically feels as if I abandoned him and that I care more about myself than him.

We had anal sex yesterday but I was the aggressor throughout while my wife was remarkably passive. I only remember her kissing me back a few times on the lips when I initiated the kiss - that was pretty much it. Once I penetrated her she pouted and started complaining about the fact she always loses to me in everything. I offered to stop but she asked me to go ahead as she wanted to keep her word. Once I finished, she turned a bit red and asked me whether I enjoyed it. I said yes but remarked that she didn't seem to enjoy it much. I heard her mutter ""I am a loser"" under her breath and she pouted again. I tried praising her beauty and also drew her attention to the fact that she is about to become a mother for the second time. She seemed more bothered about the anal sex rather than about the baby. Only when I proposed dining out did she smile and celebrate the fact that we are about to become parents. Later, when I asked her whether we would have anal sex one more time, she replied in the affirmative. However, her behavior made me feel as if I was doing something unfair to her.

On Monday one of my kids came in saying he had lice over the weekend, my heart dropped. If I had a penny for the amount of times I use the phrase ‘personal space’ in a day, I wouldn’t need to work! So I knew it wouldn’t be a sole case and likely would have spread already. We called and emailed all parents to inform them and ask that they check and treat to prevent the spread.

As the week goes by slowly most of them start itching. 80% of the class now have nits. All week I’ve been putting treatments on and thoroughly combing through my hair as I have very long hair (it’s been tied back but there’s a lot of it). Wednesday night (after working for 12 hours) I found a nit and was up until 2am trying to sort it out, having to go into school on 3 hours sleep to sit next to my 1:1 who still has the lice.

Our DSL has said apart from calling and emailing the parents again there isn’t anything we can do. We aren’t allowed to send them home, we aren’t allowed to treat them or look at their hair, we have to trust the parents are sorting it. We’ve already had multiple safeguarding concerns so I don’t have much faith they’re sorting it, and 3 of the children came in with haircuts because their parents think this will fix the problem despite us educating them on how to fix it.

Last night I found 8 eggs in my hair despite doing 4 treatments over the week, scraping my hair back and combing through it every day. My anxiety is triggered to the point I’ve cried about it daily. I cannot keep spending money on treatments and spending ALL my hours outside of work (when I work 2 jobs) trying to resolve this issue when the parents aren’t doing it and the school aren’t helping. I now have to spend my weekend ensuring I have EVERYTHING out of my hair, and yet I’ll have to go back in on Monday and potentially infect myself again.

I suppose what im asking is what rights do I have in this situation? Im not supporting the kids as I should because my anxiety is so awful and they’re constantly invading personal space due to their additional needs.

Important note here: K NEVER remembers their house keys when we go out. They will even knock on the door when they get home from work if they think I’m home, and when I ask where their keys are, they’ll say their in their car.

Anyhow, about 30 minutes after we part ways, K call/texts me. I didn’t see these notifications until an hour later, since I was at the concert. Turns out, K didn’t have their keys and was locked out. K said they were hanging out with their friends and to let them know when we’d be back. The show was 4 acts, this interaction happened about 1/3 way through. I asked D if we should just leave, they said K could just drive to the venue if they really wanted to (it was just a dive bar, not a hard place to get to). We decided to stay till the end, and it was an awesome show! We got home about 3.5 hours after K initially texted me. When we got back, they were in their car waiting, furious.

Background:

I’m part of a group of friends. There is this girl, Lilly, who started having a thing for a guy in the group, Tom. Tom and I had some conversations on discord that got deep at 2am (you know the ones). In these conversations Tom had told me about past struggles and how those all lead up to him not wanting romantic relationships at this moment, just casual things. 

A little while after this Lilly confessed to me that she liked Tom. Not in a romantic way perse, but she thought he was very attractive. I told her what Tom had told me about his stance on romantic relationships, just so she knew what she was in for if she decided to pursue it. She said she was okay with that.

Fast-forward a couple weeks. Lilly and Tom have a little fwb/situationship going on and Lilly starts to actually like Tom. She gets frustrated, because Tom is not giving her the kind of attention she wants, even though (as far as I know) Tom made his intentions clear from the start. She starts to go between blocking and ignoring him to being over at his house two days later.

Fast-forward again. I go to hang out with a few people in the group, including Tom. I think Lilly was having one of those moments where she was having difficulties with the situation. She requests not to hear about the hangout, no photos in our group chat, etc.

After a few drinks, Tom and I kissed. It was just five seconds and after that we went to separate rooms and went to sleep. I decided not to tell Lilly, since she did not want to know anything about the hangout anyway and she already didn’t seem to be in the best headspace. I felt a little bit guilty about it all, but also not really, because it’s not like Tom and Lilly were dating. I feel like Tom can do whatever he wants and so can I. I confided in a friend, Michael. This friend decided that he would tell Lilly anyway, even after I explained my reasoning for not wanting to. 

Lilly was super pissed, messaged me to call me a bitch and then blocked me on multiple platforms. I texted her and explained what I said above, apologized for hurting her feelings, and said I’d like to talk about it. To this she said she didn’t want to talk to me or Tom and that she hopes we enjoy our time together. What pisses me off is that she decided to talk to Tom the very same evening she told me she didn’t want to speak to either of us, but still has me blocked and refuses to speak to me.

Honestly, I feel like this should really be between Lilly and Tom. Or that we should at least be able to talk about it, since we are adults. 

It’s a shitshow. I can see where I might be in the wrong, but not why it has to illicit such a reaction. It’s not like I made out with Lilly’s boyfriend of three years. I drunkenly kissed a guy who has made it clear that he wants nothing more that casual relations with Lilly.

It ‘screams’ in panic if it’s in somewhere (anywhere) it can’t get out itself, it will come in of its own accord, but like I say if we close the door it panics. 
we have other cats so can’t get a cat flap or our own cats would escape (house cats for their own safety) 

When it gets pets in the morning after sleeping in it’s shelter it feels warm to the touch but there’s definitely that worry there, am I worrying about nothing or should I be concerned?

We are very happy and doing well on nearly every aspect, except that we seem to get into disputes over money more often than I'd like to.

For some context, I have worked since I was 13 years old because I was raised with the ""if you want something, you'll have to work for it"" attitude. I pay for everything myself; school, rent, food, subscriptions, etc. I have lived on my own for a year and a half now. Every now and then my dad sends me some money because he wants to (we barely had any money growing up, so now that my dad is financially better off he wants to send me money, which is never more than €100).

Right now, I work about 20 hours a week, alongside fulltime higher education. I've nearly finished my bachelor's degree in teaching, which I'm planning to pursue as soon as I can. I am also certified to give medicinal advice (which means I get paid more at my current job).

My boyfriend has not worked in a while. His parents help him out financially, even school, which he barely attends. It's not as if he cannot get a job, but he isn't taking any action to get one, claiming he doesn't have enough time. A few years ago he would very successfully stream and he still talks about picking it back up, but it's only talk and no action. He has asked me to borrow money several times and has also given me reason to believe that he's jealous of my monthly income. I pay for his groceries every now and again because he's amazing and I don't mind paying for his stuff, but I've been noticing recently that when I'd ask him to get me something from the store that he would bring it up that I'd have to pay it back. When he does get access to money, he makes interesting decisions, like buying a huge aquarium which he never set up.

It's starting to stress me out that my financial freedom seems like a hassle to him. I've asked him if he wouldn't want a job before but he says he doesn't have time, which I personally think is a bit ridiculous? He'd only have to provide for his own groceries, the rest is all taken care of.

We don't live together but we live very close to each other. I don't make enough to provide for both of us, keep in mind I'm only 20 and I make minimum wage.

I love him a lot, but I fear that his lack of discipline and ambition is driving us apart.

(Idk if it’s important to mention how he has that anti-peeping screen protector). I didn’t care about other poorly lit photos of lesser extent. But no, lights were on, body was clear as day.

I assumed that he’d switch out of that one of me ESPECIALLY if he made plans to be with people. Later I met up with him and a couple of his friends to go eat, we’re messing around and one of them grabs his phone. Of course I freak out?? I didn’t want them to see the lock screen because of what was there??? I had assumed he didn’t let them touch his phone beforehand?? But no, they saw it earlier when I wasn’t there, and he told me to let go of the phone because they had seen it already.

He said setting that as his background would be protection from others looking at his phone? I didn’t care because that doesn’t mean you set my ass as your guard?? IT’S PRIVATE. Ofc I got really embarrassed when he told me to let go of the phone, but it wasn’t until after his friends left that I started to speak up.

The walk back to my house was me telling him how humiliated and embarrassed I felt because he thought it was okay to let his friends see a photo of me like that. He starts getting quiet as I unfold after his friends leave so I don’t get much feedback either. I kept repeating myself, intentionally making him feel terrible about it because it hurt me. I know this is wrong of me to do but it was in the heat of the moment. Halfway through our walk he crosses the street and I thought that meant he was just going to walk home by himself. So I just lean on a fence and cry, lost, did he even understand the severity of the situation?

Startling me, he appears behind me, and we continue to walk with tension. I also told him how I didn’t appreciate that his friend had stolen my drink and threw it out. My reason to be upset raises because of this, and how it worsened my mood.

After splitting, and he’s home, he starts texting me how he feels really bad, but I don’t better the situation by saying things about the terrible pain in my leg from work, how it felt when I let go of the phone because it was too late, I just wanna drop it the situation (being dramatic).

I can’t sleep, it’s a stressful night, I feel terrible, it feels so shitty being exposed like that. Yes he understands afterwards what he did wrong, he apologized after too.

Our parents were deeply unhappy but “stayed together for the kids”. My sister and I were not close when we were kids and back then my sister used to get annoyed when my parents took my side in things since I was the youngest (this is important later). 

My mother was extremely codependent and even as a kid used me as a therapist for her problems with my dad and his family. This left me with a lot of trauma that I’m currently working through in therapy. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and avoidant personality disorder, to quote the major issues. 

I left my home and went low contact with my parents in 2015 and moved to a different country. This also brought me closer geographically to my sister. We reconnected and I was happy to have somewhat of a relationship with her, for the first time. 

My sister knows about my mental health issues. She used to be a bit dismissive of them at first but later refrained from making such comments again. When we sometimes meet up she makes comments on my weight but I always dismissed it even though it hurt me but I was just happy to have a relationship with her. 

Fast forward to present day: I’ve been with my current boyfriend for about 9 months. We are completely in love with each other and my social circle is aware of it (we post photos together online, which is something I never do unless it’s serious). My sister has seen these but never met my bf. 

My sister’s fiancé proposed last month and they’re getting married in a month. It’s a small wedding of 30 people. She stays in touch with some relatives back in our country and has invited them to fly over and attend the wedding. However my boyfriend is not invited. I was upset but okay it’s her wedding. But I have really bad anxiety in social events and i stay away from meeting random people unless I’m with someone I trust. I decided to tell my sister if we can reach some compromise on this because I really can’t attend the wedding without my bf, especially with our parents (the major reason for my trauma and who I haven’t seen in years) being there. She is adamant and says no, due to only 30 people being allowed and that she has already decided on who the 30 will be. I politely said that in that case I won’t be able to attend her wedding and left it at that.

So turns out, my sister went and told my mom that I wasn’t coming to the wedding because I hate her (my mom) and not because of my bf not being invited. My mom texted me this and I am furious she would lie about the reason I’m not attending. My mom confronted my sister and asked if I can bring my bf and my sister exploded at her saying she always took my side in things even as a kid. I didn’t realise my sister was affected by this at all until now. Still, my mom thinks I’m overreacting and that I should just attend.

Later that night I passed the living room and he asked if I enjoyed my ice cream and that next time he won't share when he buys something good. I didn't answer I just thought it was really childish of him to act like this over ice cream when he is in his 60s. today I woke up and the first thing my mom tells me is did we enjoy our ice cream? I told her we gave her a cup and she said that it was only after she asked and that we didn't give our dad and that we always eat off their money.

We were all super supportive and offered to help in anyway they needed, everyone was fine with it. We all agreed to do a secret Santa and decided since most of us have families, budgets and other things we’d like to do with our money, we would do one gift a family.

The expectations for the gift was $70 minimum, a little pricey, none of us are making 6 figures to say the least, but we agreed since it’s just one gift and it’s all in good spirit. 

Last week, Greg decided that everyone needs to bring a gift for one another. Keeping the $70 min. This obviously flustered some people as a lot of them have kids and even those without $120 for a couple is pretty expensive. Pretty much everyone was against this and well roundly agreed that they would like to stick to the one gift per family idea and keep it at that.

Greg fucking lost it. Told everyone it was their house their rules (oh yeah the part is at Greg’s house) and if they didn’t like the rules to just not come at all. The thing is, the party is company mandated and we have to come, and even worse, Greg blew up on our wives when they voiced their concerns, telling our wives to not come or bring our kids. 

I told Greg their expectation and attitude was unprofessional and ridiculous. After this, no one backed me up, everyone just resorted to more of less keep the peace type talk, or just stoped being involved completely, but I feel like Greg was way out of line of how he spoke to everyone and disregarded everyone’s limitations.

Partner's brother strongly dislikes me. He doesn't say a word to me at gatherings and completely ignores me . He doesn't come over our place when invited and just overall doesn't tell my partner why he doesn't like me. I feel like it's because during arguments or disagreements etc he would be my partners person to vent to. I try to explain my side of things and have apologized for other things I've done and he doesn't know everything or even know me. He misunderstood alot once I found out what he said about me. I tried to explain to him and say I apologize for the wrongs I've done as I'm a human being and also bettering myself. And half of our disagreements are just misunderstanding, my partner and I. 

Now I'm really triggered by this as I was bullied as a kid and shunning was one things kids did to me in my small private school class. It was horrible. I explained this to him as well and want to know how to fix things but I don't think he will respond or care to mend our relationship. Is it reasonable for me to not be near him and keep my kid away from him too? I feel like it will hurt him one day knowing how much he hates me and he didnt even show up to my son's first birthday (went to hang out with gf on the day) and I feel like it's also to avoid me. He doesn't really make Time for my son but he is nice to him when he's around at a gathering
