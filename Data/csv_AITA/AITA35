I'm 53M and my wife is 51F. 

I began writing books a few years ago under a pen name. (Can't use my real name. My family who I'm estranged would leave hateful comments under my books and tarnish its image.) My wife and I have always wanted to start a business, so we made an LLC for our publishing company and she has always been right by my side designing covers, contacting formatters, marketing and helping a ton.

Those books struggled, so we switched into a new pen name and genre. I felt readers of this genre would take better to a female pen name, so I came up with one and asked my wife to be the face of it. Everyone thinks she writes the books, but I am the real author.

I thought this would be a great way for my wife to flex her creative talents, too. She's been into art and general creative things her whole life, but has really never got to pursue them as she's the breadwinner of our family and is super busy as a mom.

My wife was initially reluctant, but she's come around. But she is still struggling with being ""the author"" and all the marketing that comes with it. I don't get why, because my wife is not shy, but when it comes to talking to customers and putting herself out there, she is not as outgoing and inviting as she could and *needs* to be. Handing cards to people on the street, introducing our books to cashiers in line, anything to get the word out there...she does it, but she can do it *more*.

And though she helps a ton with the business, and says she wants to turn this into a million-dollar company, I feel at the deepest level, her commitment and excitement is not there. I've brought this up to her, but all she says is ""what do you want me to do?"" and insists she is 100% here, but I don't get that from her.

I have tried to be patient and encouraging for a long time, but after a farmers' market visit where she was too reticent and shy with customers, and I (gently!) told her back in the car how to perk up and why she needs to, she broke down and started saying I'm trying to make her someone she's not.

I get that she was frustrated, and she later calmed down. She knows she needs to step up and do this, and she is getting better. But these breakdowns happen every so often.

We live in a two bedroom townhouse, bedrooms upstairs and a small living area downstairs. My husband works from home and his office is set up downstairs as well. We recently got a new couch downstairs that is pretty comfortable and easy to fall asleep on. I feel asleep down there once. But my sister frequently falls asleep downstairs and will even go up to get her pillow and blanket to sleep down there intentionally. Every time I come down in the morning and see her asleep on the couch it pisses me off. This morning I woke her up kind of abruptly and just told her to get up and go upstairs. She gave me attitude (fair, since I woke her up not very nicely) and bickered as she slumped her way up. 

I don’t know why her sleeping on the couch bothers me so much. My husband comes down to work and she’s there sleeping. She’s a heavy sleeper, but I feel like I need to tip toe around her while she’s passed out in the middle of the room. I think subconsciously I’m lashing out because I’m sick of her taking my space and privacy. I love my sister and we do get along. I like having her around for the most part. But she’s been here for over 14 months and it was supposed to be temporary until she found a roommate. I can’t argue with my husband without her hearing it. I can’t be intimate with him unless she’s not here. I can’t make us dinner without her needing a plate. We can’t sit and watch movies at night without her 2 feet away. 

I feel guilty for being sick of her. She’s just a kid working a job that doesn’t pay well enough for her to just move out. Important to mention too, she does pay us rent.

This past June, we had the opportunity to see each other &amp; instantly clicked. This time, he had time to grow up a bit and connected with family who grounded him (he had a unique upbringing and left his family at 16).

Here’s the issue. Because of his tiktok following &amp; awesomely outgoing personality, people are drawn to him. I’m not naive to the fact that that’s why we even connected. I am very aware of ways people can hide things or even keep others on the back burner in relationships in case things don’t work out. In Sept., i looked at who he follows on IG &amp; wasn’t into it.

A few weeks ago, he was showing me something on his SC &amp; I thought I saw the name of one of the chicks he unfollowed. I went to her IG &amp; saw that he liked her most recent photo (2 months after unfollowing her). When I called him out, he casually told me he probably did so on accident &amp; that she was a girl that he and his brother had met &amp; she liked his brother which i was confused about since she followed HIM. He blocked her off IG &amp; I just moved on, feeling a little crazy.

I've been working at my job for about 5 years now and currently I am working from home full time. Because of this I get to hang out with my wife and our dog for most of the day. I normally take a 5-10 minute break around 4 or 5 times throughout the day so I can play with my dog. When I do that if I get a work message I just let people know I'll be a couple minutes and then I'll get back to them. I've been doing that almost every day for the past couple years and it hasn't been an issue until recently.

My coworker Mark occasionally asks for files or needs me to review something and if he reaches out during our playtime I tell him the same thing as everyone else. However he's started to complain that I am doing this. 

The most recent one was he asked me to review some work for a project that he claimed was urgent and needed it done immediately. However my review is the third to last step for the project and the final two steps are also quick to do. The project also did not need to be completed until the 20th. I told him that I was in the middle of fetch but I would review and sign off on it in 30 minutes. He then pushed and said it was an emergency and it needed to be done now. I told him we don't really have work emergencies and we'll finish the project today but there's still 2 weeks until it's due.   


For reference I've been working here for almost 5 years now and Mark is close to a year here, and I am the senior most member on our team so I know our processes pretty well. I haven't had any complaints from other people about this and my work is always done on time, so I don't think it should be an issue for anyone else if I spend some time with my dog. But he continues to complain that I was slowing him down and should've done it right away like he asked.

My fiancé &amp; I had to leave our rented flat &amp; were in the process of looking for a place to buy, which luckily we’ve done &amp; we move out in a few days. I’m extremely grateful to them for giving us a place to stay &amp; they won’t accept any money from us.

I can be irritable &amp; I speak my mind when things annoy me. When we moved in I found myself waking early as future IL’s were loud. MIL is a GP, FIL is retired but gets up at about 7am, earlier than MIL gets up. All bedrooms are on the same landing so all very close. When I worked in retail sometimes I was up before 6 so on days off or if I’d a later shift I relished a lie in, this was impossible as IL’s would talk at full volume, FIL going up &amp; down stairs heavily &amp; I was waking &amp; not getting back to sleep. I asked my fiancé to ask them to please be quieter in the morning as it was inconsiderate, they are very religious I thought surely they were all about being polite &amp; considerate. my fiancé is disabled &amp; doesn’t sleep well, &amp; IL’s it worse. It took him ages to say anything, for awhile it was quiet but he recently had to say it to them again as they had a conversation at full volume right outside the door before MIL went to work which woke us both up.

FIL has had a continuous bad cold (not covid) for quite some time now but wont do anything to try get rid of it. He got a cold from their grandson who they watch every week &amp; have had stay for a weekend twice since we moved in. FIL is TERRIBLE at covering his mouth, he coughs so loudly &amp; just splutters everywhere. My fiancé &amp; I got it from him &amp; stayed in our rooms. It seemed to lessen but he’s coughing even worse now. He saw a doctor who said they think it’s the same cough as before. he stayed in his room all day yesterday, MIL slept in another room &amp; we used the downstairs bathroom while he used the upstairs one so it seemed like steps were being made. This morning he said he’s feeling much better but he’s still coughing. FIL is wandering the house as if he’s not sick.
I have said to my fiancé that FIL should be taking cough syrup, something to help but nothing is said or done. Since the pandemic fiancé &amp; I sanitise our hands when we leave the house &amp; I said FIL should do that around the house but he doesn’t even use a tissue to cough into. FIL said he may go to a meeting in person later, I told my fiancé &amp; said FIL 1) shouldn’t be walking around while open mouth coughing and 2) shouldn’t be going to a meeting where he’ll probably pass the cold on. All my fiancé said to him is to keep his distance.

I don’t want to get sick again. We are moving in a few days which will be busy &amp; I start a new job next week. every sickness takes it out of my fiancé &amp; his recovery is much longer due to his disability so neither of us want him to get sick.

I was texting fiancé about it &amp; he said I was being harsh &amp; a bit of an asshole.

Tuesday bought the turkey called an talked to MIL ""Amy"" for about 30 mins. On Wednesday I cook and start brining the turkey, Thursday I call Amy to confirm bringing the 1 turkey (couldn't find 2 within weight limits for the smoker) over tomorrow.

Amy confirms the turkey/pie delivery an mentions she was feeling under the weather today but that's it I wish her well and we end the call. 

Friday evening my S/O goes to take the supplies over and make a last minute grocery  run he calls and says ""hey everyone over here at mom's is sick, she didn't even want to let me in the door saying ""okay be quick an leave were sick"" he asks her to clarify an turns out her ENTIRE household has been sick with flu ALL WEEK LONG.

He asks what he should do b/c when he tried to say something to her at first she got an attitude saying Terry was feeling better, the smoker would kill the germs, she's not cooking etc. I told him to bring the turkey home after he left the grocery.

I call Amy myself asking why she didn't tell me anyone was sick, she gets an attitude with me saying the same things she did to my Joe I cut her off an say ""I didn't know all yall were sick that's not what you said yesterday Joe is bringing the turkey home better safe than sorry"".

Her death was unexpected and to say both my dad and I were devastated is an understatement. She was the love of his life and took it really hard, however in 2016, he introduced me to what he called his ‘friend’ Dale. Dale was the same age as my dad and they were hanging out a lot but it seemed like more than friendship. It took a few months and my dad confessed they were dating. He came out as bisexual and said he was nervous about my reaction and whilst it surprised me, I have fully supported them. The two are now 52 and have been together for 6 years.

SIL got really stern and said I should include her anyway cos of ‘family.’ I said that it’s MY family and yeah Daisy is my niece too but she isn’t cousins with my other nieces.

I turn 18 in less than a week, so my grandmother gave me $2k worth of inheritance. It was originally supposed to be over $5k, but my mother gave most of it to her fiance before she passed away. I received the money yesterday and told my dad and grandma that I would save the money for a used car. Today my grandfather told me he needs the money to pay rent.

I don't mind helping with rent, and I do often, but he already owes me over $1,200. I told him that at this rate, I would never be able to get my license or move out and he said, ""It's either that or you can go live with your dad and I'll check myself into a retirement home.""

I know I should be happy to help, but he's pushing 80 and has been sick lately. I can't afford to take care of both of us and the cat, much less afford to move forward in life.

We lived together at the time (in his house) and it took me 2.5 months to find a new place.  During the time I was still living with him, he became an entirely different person than the man I dated.  He gaslit me continuously, and played all sorts of mind games with me.  My friends (most of whom are also his friends that he introduced me to) all know this.  Now, I fully believe that I have no right to tell anyone who they should be friends with, and not once throughout the whole breakup did I ever insinuate to anyone that they shouldn't be friends with my ex.  Most of the women I'm friends with say they don't want anything to do with him on a personal level, but their husbands are all friends with my ex, so their options on cutting him out are limited (which I completely understand).  

Now, the woman (30F) who I'm probably closest with is not in that situation.  My ex introduced us, but her only real connection to the group was my ex, she's not in a relationship with anyone else.  She has repeatedly told me that she has no interest in continuing a friendship with him because she doesn't want someone like him in her life.  At one point, she was declining party invites at his house so that (in her words), ""he wouldn't be encouraged to continue a friendship with her.  And she hoped she could just fade into the background with him"".  She has continued to say she doesn't want to be around him all the way up to this week.  But, there have been a few instances where she has voluntarily been around him recently.  She house sat for him while he was out of town.  She said she did it because it was free money and she got to see his dog (which I do understand).  She's also going to his birthday dinner this week.  She says she is just curious to see the dynamic of the group now, so that's why she's going (which I also understand).  

I kind of want to ask her about why her actions are now not matching up with what she is continuing to tell me.  I have zero problem if she has decided she wants to be friends with him, that's her choice and she knows that.  She can 100% be friends with us both without a problem.

 First some context. I live in a camper van woth my dog. About 6 months ago I left a 10yr abusive relationship. I was broke, had nowhere to go with my dog. My bestie offered to take my dog in and was really kind helping me out. She even bought dog food and gave me meals.

Six months later she asked me to move in, I've got work, paying my way (paying 1/4 of the rent and bills) shared food, clean up after myself and the dog basically doing all I can to be a good housemate. I don't actually live in the house (I do have a spare bedroom with my clothes and shoes) I camp outside in my van that's self sufficient with solar power and camp kitchen.

Saturday morning she tells me she's having some friends around after work (she's a bar tender and finishes work early morning) I say all good but that I have rehursals all weekend and need my sleep.

She arrives home with her mates around 3am waking me up. I don't worry about it and sleep, she then opens my van door at 4am  and jumps in my van waking me asking for smokes. I tell her no and that I'm trying to sleep.

At 4:30 I'm woken again by thumping music. Her and her crew have set up drinks, music and drunken shenanigans right outside my camper van in the smoking spot.

I admit I had enough and firmly told her and her friend they were being very inconsiderate and should know better. I said I take care when she's sleeping in all day to not wake her and that she wasn't showing me that same respect. I said she had the whole house and another patio to party and that I'd appreciate if she moved her mates there. Then I went to bed. At 5am she txt me something to the effect of ""so sorry didn't do it on purpose"" later that morning when I was awake I replied ""it was a bit much at 4am but I understand all good.""

To me the matter was settled but she replied that I over reacted chewing her out and was out of line as its her house.

I replied that at 4am my reaction was normal and listed why I reacted that way (they'd eaten my food, broken glass everywhere, she knew I was sleeping ect) and that being spoken to was a consequence of her actions.

She replied in a very long message throwing the kindness she's shown me over the past 6 months back at my face. From feeding me to helping with my dog she reamed me out with very personal attacks and swear words. She went back to when I arrived at her door and even when she helped grab my stuff from my old place, she used it to ask what my conciquences where....? She said cause she fed me and the dog I shouldn't be upset that my cooked plate of food was eaten and that my dog shits in her yard... I just. This all feel so stupid to me but I don't want to go back.

SD says she lives in her car, in SS’s backyard, but is living with us most of the time.  

They expect me to buy the groceries, clean up after they cook breakfast, cook them dinner and clean up after, feed them leftovers for lunch and clean up after that. In three years, they’ve never once cleaned their bathroom or the kitchen or anything else. They refuse to lock up when they’re not around or at night putting my home and family at risk. They refuse to close doors or turn off unused lights or electronics.  They leave their stuff laying everywhere and no one is to touch it.  Any request I make or any action I take is treated with contempt from them and anger from my wife. They say I use the wrong tone of voice and that if I pick up their stuff or turning off light or close door I'm passive aggressive. They dismiss my issues with “it’s not a problem for me” or “you just don’t want us here” or “you just don’t like my kids” or I’m just “square”.  They tell their mother they don’t feel welcome or give her the cold shoulder which perfectly targets her deepest fears.

At the end of their winter vacation last year each of their cars broke down and they each called my wife because they didn’t have enough money to get them fixed.  My wife has been steadily draining her emergency fund for several years and SS and SD have each taken thousands of dollars multiple times while they take months off work and their mother works full time to pay their way.

SD has no plans for independence or progress in the future.  Instead, she’s saving her money for a party trip to Europe with her friends while we’re paying her room and board.  My wife has said nothing to SD about this.  It seems this is all OK.

SD got a cold.  The first day she asked her mother to make her chicken soup and her mother did. The second day her mother brought her take-out soup for lunch. The third day her mother made a doctor’s appointment for SD.  Took SD to the doctor. Went into the exam room with SD. Went and got medicine for SD. 

In addition to making me a doormat and offending my values, this also puts a strain on my relationship with my kids.

It seems to me that my wife isn’t just enabling their dependence, but she’s actively creating their dependence. I understand the deeper reasons why she does this and want to be compassionate about that.

My husband (S, 39m) and I(39f) have been happily married for 11 years, together longer. We have 2 young kids, 6 and 4 y.o. For the past 4 months, we have been in a temporary LDR due to a major transition in S’s work. This also required a big move. My kids and I moved, and S was supposed to join us shortly. Unfortunately this period stretched out longer and longer, until we hit 4 months. I have been the primary caretaker for our children, while S was working across the country. 

During this time, the kids and I struggled with the transition as they adapted to a new school, a new community, and much more. We had some minor health problems, which added to our stress during this time. It’s been a lot. I tried to keep it positive, and planned fun activities for the kids, visits to see my in laws, and of course handled all the daily chores/cooking. I tried to give my kids all the love and stability I could during this time. Fortunately my in laws have been wonderful, and supported us with love and visits. 

S was not able to visit as much as he wanted (distance and cost), yet I was happy for him as he was able to enjoy some relative freedom to go out with friends, eat out, go to concerts, movies, games, etc. I encouraged him to do all these things! Being apart gave me time to think, and I told him how when we were reunited I would need a)some time for myself, and b)him to be more engaged with our kids (ie not on his phone constantly). He agreed and we looked forward to reuniting. 

S was finally able to join us, and while at first it was wonderful, he slowly increased his time glued to his phone, and pressured me to do everything together “as a family”. Especially all care involving the kids. I was doing just as much as while he was gone, but even more now. I’m a people pleaser, so I went along with it. Today we were in the car so I could go to the gym. I had already put it off, because he had errands he insisted we run together. At this point he informs me I had to finish in max 20-30 mins so we could pick up our kids from school. I calmly suggested perhaps today he could take on that task, and I could burn off stress without any time pressure. He kept pushing back and questioning how 20 mins wasn’t enough for me, and negating everything I said, at which point I’m ashamed to say I started screaming how I also needed personal space and time to myself, and him pushing me to constantly do everything together when he has had the last 4 months essentially off from being a dad was making me feel suffocated. I parked the car, got out, and stormed off (to the gym).

I live with my mom since the divorce (2013), so spending more time with her, I spent more time with her side of the family, that’s why we are so close and all of them will be present at the dinner

Besides that, more guesses means a more expensive dinner that my father and stepmother will have difficulty to pay.

I presented all my reasons to why they are not welcome on the dinner by me to my mother, she claimed that I was being selfish and my grandparents (witch are invited to the dinner) would be uncomfortable since my mothers family are all present and forced me to invite them.

Last week, my fiancée invited her friends over to our house to have some drinks and have a night for themselves. I went to a pub with a couple of mates to let them have their alone time and all that. Once I got home, some of them were still there.

It was fine and all, but at some point, I noticed some of them giggling and shooting glances at me. I thought it was strange, but the thought escaped my mind. Yesterday, a few of her friends came over again, and some of them said something uncomfortable to me. I will not write it again.

It made me very uncomfortable, and after they left, I spoke to my fiancée, who told me that it was probably because last time they had their reunion, she TOLD them a lot about our private life, in DETAIL. Look, I don't understand this insane need to share private stuff.

I'm a very private person, and I really don't like this shit. I told her flat out that it was absurd, and she crossed a line she shouldn't have. She, however, says I'm being an asshole and overreacting, that it is normal to talk about this kind of stuff with friends. 

Look, I don't talk to my friends about that, and I EXPECTED her to do the same. Now we're in this situation, I don't think I'm an asshole for just wanting my own privacy, but she obviously thinks I am.

Okay hi !! hope everyone is doing well i (21F) got broken up somewhere in July with my ex (23M). Ngl i wasn't the greatest.Due to my BPD n deep rooted trauma i would split horribly or have outburst. it's no excuse to how toxic i was towards him but after the relationship i healed and grow and realized how to stop and cope with yk triggers! (he's also not innocent but has a bad victim mentality like his mother) anyways! I use twitter as a diary in a way (who hasn't) so i would tweet that i miss him (not even including his name) and would use memes too (not even directed at him so idk who told him he's special that it's for him) 

except for 1 meme (it said how he's special to me but stressed me out to the point of not eating)
which wasn't a lie bc during our relationship he told me he had rlly horrible mental problems where he would physically do stuff and it would get really bad and i would be stressed to the point of not eating and losing sleep to comfort him or to be there for him (i went an entire year of barely getting over 6 hours of sleep bc i was scared something would happen if i fell asleep and he claimed he would have bad thoughts WHEN i'm sleeping which made me not sleep)

anyways i am expressing how i used to be toxic but learned my ways but that i can't help but miss him yet dislike him at the same time. 
he texted me last night telling me to ""stop spreading lies on twt"" but when i didn't reply back he resent the msg saying ""stop spreading lies abt me"" but deleted the twt part.. he blocked me on twt and it shows he is stalking my twitter quite literally .. 

i find it funny tho when he said that when he's the done the same on his twitter/instagram ? but i also thought it was okay for me to express how i feel/felt and just letting it out especially on twitter where others can relate to me (and so many have and it makes me feel nice i'm not alone) idk maybe i'm in the wrong but it's like who HASNT done that and i'm allowed to express how i feel and i hold myself accountable (my friends knows this too)  

knowing him he probs sent it to his friends and because he's a big people pleaser he just listened to them and then sent me the msg :/
doesn't matter i haven't replied but

Hello, 21F here, and my mother is slowly dying due to stage 4 cancer. She had a brain hemorrhage around thanksgiving and now cannot move much, but still can talk. She is a bit confused at times but still herself. 

I don’t want to spend my whole day there or much time with her because she’s insufrible. She begins to yell at me for the smallest things in front of others. For example, i went to get her food, but since the restaurant was 20 minutes away there and back, plus in times square where parking is near to none, it took round trip around 40-50 min. so came back to her yelling at me, saying i can’t do anything right. 

another example: My father was there and asked me a question. I began to answer and she began yelling at me saying i’m so selfish for talking to my father. My father tried to explain it was a simple question and she began to say oh you’re defending the princess. She is the princess i forgot we csnt say anything to her. Yelling this while confined to a hospital bed. She has always been horribly me and hateful towards me my entire life. 

I don’t want to waste my days driving 2 hours to her and 2 hours back. I have finals and rather be grieving in the comfort of myself or my friends. My sister 30 F says i’m gonna regret this, how it’s my fault I get hurt because I have unresolved issues with her. She is basically guilting me for not being around all the time. As if i don’t visit, yet I do just for about an hour at a time, last week i was spending my whole day there she just began to be abusive and mean again and it has a negative effect on me and my mental health. Which i’ve tried to explain to my sister but she says its not my mothers fault it’s mine for having personal unresolved issues and i’m letting her die alone. In my pov, if you do not want to die alone, then don’t be so abusive towards people trying to help you, sounds harsh but it’s how i feel.

So I(45M) have a son(18M), we’re very close and we have a very healthy father and son relationship. His mother and I are divorced, and have been divorced for a long time and I got custody of him when he was a kid, however a week ago, he came out to me as transgender. He told me he wanted to be a trans woman and that he had been dealing with these thoughts for a long time and he was too afraid to tell me because of fear of not being accepted. I was so shocked and confused at first but then we had a long conversation, and I told him I don’t want him to transition because of I’m scared of him not only changing his physical appearance to be something that he’s not, I’m also afraid he’ll deal with hate and harassment. I’ve seen the dangers of what had happened to trans women in our world and I don’t want my son to experience any of that. I told him instead that he can crossdress as a hobby but he got very upset and told me he didn’t want to crossdress, he wanted to identify and present himself as a woman because he felt he was one. I also help manage his bank account so I personally don’t want him to go on HRT. We had a heated argument(which honestly has not happened before) and then he stormed out of the living room. I was just in shocked because we’ve never had a heated argument before. I personally don’t know why my son wants to be a woman. He’s 18, he does online college courses, he has a stable job, and a few friends he talks to. He’s pretty introverted(He gets it from his mom) but we still have a very close relationship. I have done research on trans topics, and personally I don’t think you can ever change your biological sex even if you consider gender a social construct because males are male and females are female. What I’m more worried about is my son having to deal with hate and harassment or getting harmed in the future for being trans, because in the eyes of the public he’ll be seen as man pretending to be a woman. I just don’t want my son to physically destroy his body and pretend to be the opposite gender/sex when he’s not only to crumble and deal with negativity on a daily basis, AITA?

Disposable. The values refer to the currency of my country

   I (33M) dated Karen (31F) for a few years. She became pregnant with Ava (6F). Karen has primary custody of Ava.

   I met my fiancée Lia (30F) 2 years ago, she has 2 girls (Julia 8F and Sophie 7F) from a previous relationship. I recently proposed to Lia and we've been living together for a few months now.

   I live in a nice apartment with 2 bedrooms and an office. Ava now has to share with J and S and has been throwing tantrums ever since, refusing to sleep in her room and fighting with J and S, crying the whole time. I explained to Ava that the room now belonged to all of them and that she should share it with her sisters. J and S went to public school and now I pay for a good private school for them. (3k for mont each)

   Karen comes from an extremely wealthy family, and while I'm doing pretty well, I don't have as much money as she does. Karen had been talking for a few years about putting Ava in the same school she and her family went to when she was old enough, and this year she enrolled Ava in this school and my daughter keeps telling her sisters how great her school is and make J and S sad.

Lia asked me to take Ava out of school next year and put her with J and S or send the 3 girls to the same school. I told her I couldn't afford the 3 and that Karen paid Ava's tuition (it's about 10k a month and I make about 23k a month). Lia was really upset and called me AH for favoring a daughter and that it wasn't fair for Ava to go to such a fancy school and J and S not.

   A few days ago, Karen threw a sleepover for Ava and invited several of Ava's friends. I found out on Instagram. Abby was furious that J and S weren't invited. Talked to Karen and she said Ava didn't want the girls there and wouldn't make her do anything, then hung up on me saying the SD was not her problem.

   Friday, when I got home, I found Ava hysterical because Lia had told her that she was leaving school and that she had to invite her sisters to parties or she couldn't have them. I calmed Ava down and took her to her mother's house and had a big fight with Lia. On Saturday Karen came to my house and said that she would file a lawsuit to prevent Ava from having contact with Lia, that I couldn't ""play house and harm my daughter"" and that if I wanted SD to have the same living conditions like Ava I shouldn't be a loser and marry a loser and that Ava wasn't going to pay for it, that Ava doesn't have sisters, that Lia should accept that Ava will always get better things because she can afford it and we can't, etc. There were a few more arguments and Karen walked away saying I was an AH.

   My parents found out about the fight and are saying I'm an AH for treating random kids like my daughters and ruining my relationship with Ava. Ava doesn't want to talk to me and cry saying that I replaced her with J and S.

I totally forgot, because this month is very busy and we've got some things going on which are on my mind (hospital stuff).   


While i was finishing up my work i got a text message from my mom, asking at what time we'll go to Gpa's BDay party. I messaged back saying Sh\*t, i totally forgot, but i'm affraid we can't go, because it will be past bedtime for our LO by the time we arrive, let alone when we'll get back home. (LO can make a lot of noise for such a little human, thanks to being high sensitive).   
My mom replies ""well, just go for a short while"". At this moment I am getting annoyed (because I already explained why). So I replied ""I'm finishing up work now, take a shower, get LO out of daycare, start cooking and by that time it's LO's bedtime"".   
I got a message back ""Well, then just go sunday. They want to see a healthy LO."" But i already had other plans on both weekend days. I didn't reply, thinking this was the end of it.   
Later i received ""Do you know if you are coming tonight?"" To which I didn't reply again, because I was making dinner.   


At 9 in the evening I got ""I think it's not OK you didn't go to Gpa's BDay and you didn't tell Gpa &amp; Gma. they were waiting for you. you should’ve called them"". By this time i was already asleep.   
Around the same time i also got a text from dad saying ""congrats with my dad's BDay. you know, your Gpa's. this is not how i raised you. it's a shame."" When i read this i was furious, so i didn't reply.   


Thing is, i messaged my Gma with the BDay wishes after i told my mom ""oh shit i forgot"". (i don't have the phone number of Gpa, cause he would only send me racist stuff, so i deleted his number years ago).   


I decided, you know what, damage has been done. I can't reverse time. Yes it was stupid to forget the birthday.    
So I wanted to call Gma &amp; Gpa the next morning to say happy BDay, and i hope you got a lot of presents. However, right before i wanted to call, Gma texts ""You forgot your Gpa's birthday yesterday"".   


I agree i should’ve called. But really, couldn't she tell him ""hey, i got a happy BDay wish from your grandchild"". If i got a Bday wish from someone for my partner, i tell him ""hey Happy birhtday from XYZ"". But apparently that's not how it works. 

  
The next day was my MIL's Bday, my parents were invited too. They wanted to bug me about the whole thing again, but I told them this is not the time and place for this discussion.   
The next day (Sunday) my mom calls me, right as i'm changing a diaper (a big one), so i didn't pick up the phone. She calls again as i arrive at another birthday, so I didn't pick up the phone again. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening she calls and says she’s not angry (but mentions again i really should’ve gone) and she's affraid i'm mad at her. And she can't handle the feeling of me being angry at her.   
She got to this conclusion because i didn't pick up the phone.

For context I have been friends with another woman (Sara 44F) for nearly five years and recently I decided I no longer want to be her friend.

So I occasionally will join a friend's(Ron 50M) podcast and we discuss drama going on in the community we're involved in. This day in particular, the jerk (Matt)we were discussing came up onto the podcast and began spewing lie after lie, painting himself up to be the victim of a 10 year long smear campaign. He brought up Sara, talking about her. I didn't defend her and she got mad. She blocked me on everything. I tried to apologize several times, explaining that I didn't want to disrespect Ron by getting into a screaming match on his podcast. She chose not to accept this. I truly am remorseful for not defending her but I did try to apologize and explain.

I decided not to discuss it publicly, I stayed quiet, giving her the time and space to cool down. She would come to me eventually and we could talk it out in private. Instead, she did her own podcast episode, shitting all over me to people in the hopes of garnering sympathy. She thinks I chose Ron over her and that just isn't true. But she is soaking up all of the attention she is getting while painting me up to be the asshole of the situation.

She is airing things about me, while holding gifts she had given my kid that I never asked for, over my head. Whenever I am on podcasts now, she comes into the chat, spewing more vitriol at me and trying to rally people to her side. She is incredibly toxic and childish and I made the decision I no longer want to be her friend. 

Others on the podcast are saying I'm in the wrong in the situation, even though I am not taking Sara's bait and refuse to fight with her like she wants. She just wants an argument and I refuse. 

I am done. I already deal with a lot of toxic people in my life, I don't need her adding to that.

We currently split financial responsibilities for rent, utilities, groceries, etc. 50/50. I’m in grad school and he makes nearly double my salary, but I thought an even split was fair because we would be sharing the workload around the house.

The issue is that I find myself doing a lot of that work, especially when it comes to the mental load of a relationship. He’s working a lot at his job so I am often the one cooking, cleaning, laundry, anticipating what we need, picking up groceries/going shopping for both of us, planning dates and get togethers with friends, etc. 

I empathize that his work is more physically demanding than mine, but I also work full time as a graduate student and sometimes I feel burnt out having to do all of the housework too. He has been bragging lately about how many hours he’s working and how much his paychecks are and how he wants to spend them. I’m happy for him because he always seemed to struggle financially when living alone. I get paid a set amount every month and can make ends meet just fine, but I never think about things I could buy myself because I can’t afford it. 

I have asked him to contribute more to some of the things I do for the household, and he will do it when asked. But having to ask is another thing to add to the mental load because I’m the one that has to anticipate the need in the first place instead of him noticing something needs done.

I sometimes feels like maybe I’m asking too much. That I should be grateful I’m saving money by living together. But it feels unfair that he is benefiting more from this situation. He is not only getting the financial benefit of splitting bills, but me doing the household work he would have been doing if he was living alone.

We have a baby that is almost a year old. I have two kids, Rory (12M) and Emily (12F), of my own. My husband has two sons from a previous marriage (13M). My kids had to share a room since they were born born but once I got married, we moved to a bigger house and they could have their own rooms. My daughter was happy about it but my son had a really hard time adapting to this. He didn't like being alone and he got scared a lot, crying all night and peeing himself, but he eventually adapted to the new reality and has been more stable.

A sister of my husband is getting married in Hawaii and the whole family is going there for a big destination wedding. The idea was for the kids to share rooms by sets of two. Emily would have to stay with my one of my husband's nieces. Rory would share with one of his stepbrothers and the other one with another cousin.

But that didn't work. Rory says that he doesn't want to share a room with none of his stepbrothers because they smell bad. He told me to allow him to stay with his sister but Emily doesn't want that. The only other option was to put him with one of the other male cousins but he warned me that, if it turns out that they also smell bad, he would refuse to stay in the room once we were there and go sleep on the rainforest.

Finally, I begged for my husband to pay for another room so Rory can be alone and I wouldn't have to suffer anymore of this. But now, Emily is mad because she says it is unfair that her brother will have his own room but she has to share with a cousin she doesn't know. I think she should understand that her brother has a harder time in this kind of situations that her and not make everything even more difficult for me. Emily is a really social and extrovert girl, she didn't complain about this issue before. I feel she is just being petty but now she is angry with me and I don't know what else to do.

The first meeting went GREAT! Nik told them I was Greek (as he was Greek and my mums side is) and they reacted by trying to ask me things in Greek, it was overwhelming at first.

I respectfully let them know I am not familiar with my mums side BUT I am always willing to learn. Although disappointed, they all understood. To impress them however, I learnt the language enough to have small conversations, learnt how to cook the food they showed me and just celebrated them like they were my own blood family.

Until a question got raised one day, WHERE my parents were and who raised me. Not going into it but they were not happy AT ALL with the small information I gave them. After that I was treated TERRIBLY, any attempts at Greek they laughed at but if I stopped learning then they could talk about me in front of my face, which they frequently did expecting me not to understand until I did understand. They called me disgusting nicknames and even blamed me for things that I didn’t even do! I was the punching bag and although at first Nik didn’t do anything to help, he soon started stepping up for me! All this was instigated by Thea who is the most narcissistic person you could meet, very like Instagram fake and two faced. Another couple years go by with this bullying and his mum realised that either she joined them in bullying me or she would lose her son. She really buckled down when I had my first son Atticus and though she didn’t stick up for me, she also didn’t join in with them anymore. 

So one day Niks cousin brings home a girl, lovely girl, now this cousin is queen bee Thea’s kid and she was showered in attention and love. She isn’t Greek but they didn’t mind, months go by and they try teaching her some Greek and it was all going well until she also shared that she went through the same state system as me! I was so worried for her but they all just smiled and laughed and said that “we’re you’re family now”.

Something in me snapped.

I had to excuse myself, with a smile on my face and sat out the front until my husband caught on and we left. We live in the same street as my MIL so she followed us home soon after and went to have a little go at me for leaving without giving yiayia a kiss goodbye.

I’m a very calm and patient person normally and I went OFF. I brutally unleashed on her 10 years of rage and didn’t hold back! 

My husband told his mum to go home and then told me I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating college in May and have started to think about who I want to be at the ceremony and celebrate with me. Immediately I knew that I would not want my father to be there.

A bit of background on my father… he was never emotionally present throughout my childhood. He would always just be on his phone when the family was out doing things, when he does have a conversation with me it's very brief before going back to the phone, and I just generally felt unloved by him. When I was a junior in high school he cheated on my mom, which resulted in my little half brother. I don’t see him that often and frankly don’t want to establish a relationship with him given our age gap and I don’t feel like I should be obligated to have a relationship with him. Oh yeah and my father also never went to my high school graduation.

However, my mom has moved back in with my father and has taken over as a sort of “second mom” to my half brother (His actual mom is a heavy meth addict currently on probation in some other state). When I went over for thanksgiving recently, my father didn’t even try having a conversation with me, when he did, it was playfully insulting, which I didn’t find funny given we don’t have a close relationship at all. I find this situation very very weird, given that my father is still texting many women from his phone (accidentally had it open during dinner and I peeked, not my best moment)-- which just tells me he hasn’t changed. 

I really don’t want to invite my father to my graduation. He will likely be on his phone, my half-brother is so young he will get bored and rowdy ( he is very loud and doesn’t behave often), and I just never felt like my father has shown any interest in my life. Also, I plan on inviting my older brother who hasn’t spoken to my father in over 5 years and don’t want there to be any tension at my graduation. I much prefer having my brother, who has always been there and supported me, over my father.

However, my mom is upset and asking why I don’t love my father. I told her and she got even more upset at me, saying she doesn’t understand how I changed so much and making me feel guilty.

Using a glass or another water bottle (there's several) doesn't pour as nicely, she liked this one. I'd asked her the other day not to use for this after she shared that she'd found it, but found her using it again today, and she tells me again it's great for filling the water.  
The bottle's not particularly valuable but my girlfriend gave it to me so I'm not quick to just swap it for another. Anyway, it's the most standard design you can get (metal bottle, screw cap with a slender opening) and I ask is she not able to just got a similar one if she's found this works best for her? She says she looked but couldn't find any. I'm baffled, like I said, it's the most commmon type out there. I tell her I saw some in the local supermarket during the week. She says they're not the same, they've colours on them (mine's stainless steel) amd they'll weigh more or they're plastic. I saw some that were exactly like mine, but with just a colour wrap over the metal. She says they're not the same. I go and find one on Amazon and buy it. When I tell her it was easy to find one, and that she has one arriving for her soon, she says she meant it was ""hard to find one local"".  
There's a huge argument in the middle of all of this. She tells me I'm being so irrational, ""like someone on the spectrum"". And she says at times like these she questions where she went wrong as a mother to raise someone who can be so selfish. She says she felt the moment she used the bottle there was going to be 'some problem'.   
I suggest that perhaps she's being the selfish one, demanding I share something I have a (I think) reasonable request to keep as my own, and there's some projection going on here; that often I feel my 'no' is not valued and it feels more like she's insulted I won't give it to her. She disagrees with me simplifying it down to it being a situation where I won't 'give' something to her and mentions she feels I'm the child who is most likely to say no to her.  
I get that this is over something small. But the argument still made me a bit lost as to whether I'm being an asshole sticking to my original needs?

The dog bit the lower part of my face and I needed facial reconstruction surgery. Ever since I have had a fear of big dogs and everyone in my family is well aware of this. 

My brother (27m) and his wife (25f) love dogs, they have a Yorkshire terrier and have recently adopted a pit bull. They invited me, my partner and our parents to stay at their house for a couple nights during Christmas. 

I told them I would like to but can’t since I would not feel comfortable being around their new dog. 

My brothers wife seemed to take this personally and started ranting about how pit bulls have a bad reputation but their dog is sweet. I told them I’m sure their dog is great, and I have nothing against specifically pit bulls, but big dogs in general. 

My brother said he thinks I should face my fears with their dog since they are sure he won’t attack me. He also asked me if I was content living my life in fear. I said I don’t live in fear because I never willingly put myself in situations with large dogs, and I defended my fear saying it is totally valid. 

My brothers wife went on to say that I shouldn’t let my bad experience with one dog speak for all dogs. She also related this to disliking one race of people because of one bad apple. I told her this was offensive to say since people and dogs are obviously very different. 

I held my ground and they finally relented, offering to leave the dog in the kitchen with the gate up while I was there. Truthfully I still would not be able to relax like this and I told them so. 

They said I was being difficult and got mad at me. They hung up on me (FaceTime) and have not contacted me since. My mom called me and said I was being unreasonable since the dog could stay in the kitchen, but I know myself and I know I would still be on edge the whole time. My partner is on my side and thinks my brother &amp; his wife are the AHs.

I’ve done this before, and everytime the worker laughed and found it funny too. I thought it was a nice break from the serious customers who just wanna get their coffee and go, and that they appreciated someone giving them some entertainment mid shift. Clearly I was wrong and I apologise for that. 

I walked up, asked for a drink, paid for it, and gave her a name, Aneed Morhed, which if your accent doesn’t really work for this name (mine doesn’t which is why it worked so well) It sounds like I need more head, in the area’s native accent. 

Once my drink was ready, she read out the name, and immediately realised what she had said. I raised my hand and started walking towards her to collect my drink, but she got this furious look on her face and hurled the drink across the room, with it landing at my feet and splattering all over my shoes. 

I just yelled “what the fuck?” at this, because obviously now I’d need to clean up my shoes, which were Vans, and also because I paid for my drink already. I walked up to her, and apologised, saying that I thought it was a harmless joke and that it wouldn’t piss anyone off, and clearly I was wrong. She accepted my apology but told me she wouldn’t be making another drink for me. 

I got pissed at this, because I paid for this and Starbucks isn’t cheap, plus she had ruined my shoes as well. I asked to speak to her manager, who then apologised for her and told her he’d remember this. 

I feel bad, because Starbucks workers already deal with a lot of shit, and now I got one into trouble for something that I 100% caused.

My husband (36M) and I have decided we are done having kids. Kids obviously use a ton of stuff, and I don't want to have to store everything and wait around to see if someone might want it in the future. I have some nice items that were hardly used for either of my kids, like a bed side bassinet, that I was thinking of selling. Kids are also expensive and I don't work because my entire paycheck would have gone to childcare anyways so while we are ok, we definitely don't have any extra money lying around.

Many of the things we got during our baby showers or were handed down to us. So is it poor form to sell things like that? I'm definitely not out to nickel and dime. We have passed on clothes to a friend who has a kid in between our two and will continue to do that. We just donated several bags of newborn clothes to an organization that gives them away for free to families in need. Someone gave us a bunch of kid towels and washcloths that we don't want/need so we will be offering them to a local animal shelter. It's mainly more of the 'high ticket' items like the bassinet, swing, eventually strollers, etc.

I guess I feel like it's not really an AH move since they are ours, but I feel slightly guilty at making a small profit off of others generosity. 

If there were people in our life that needed or wanted certain things, I would happily give them whatever, but we were the last of most of our family and friends to have kids so it would probably be at least a few years before others we knew would have children.

He asked me would I come in, and I told him I was in no fit state to come in to work and that he'd have to find someone else to cover, I could not possibly face customers in my current state. He told me he didn't care if I had been drinking and that I was needed so I had to come in. 

I told him I had been drinking, but I had also been chewing jaw for the better part of 12 hours and had taken a line just before answering the phone. He still tried convincing me to come in and I told him no, he'd have to find someone else.

My boyfriend works at an organic grocery store and uses natural products and I honestly do not find his hygiene up to my standards in general, but that includes the use of natural products like toothpaste without fluoride that don’t work very well. I put 2 and 2 together, that his mom had always looked at their teeth and she didn’t encourage good hygiene by promoting this behavior. After he commented about his mom checking my teeth, I said no offense but I definitely wouldn’t trust her to check my teeth. 

He seemed on guard immediately and asked why? And here is where I think I may be the asshole. I said I didn’t understand how she could dispute fluoride working with the scientific evidence that it does, and implied that if she was the only one who’s ever looked at his teeth he may want to see an actual dentist. It was obvious he loves her very much, was offended and thought I was being arrogant. He said that I didn’t know what I was talking about, because she had worked with dentists her whole life.

I'm a single mom and even with their help, I am constantly in mom mode and never really get time for just myself. A asked me a few months ago if I wanted them to plan a time to keep all the kids for a few hours so I could have some ""me time."" I was ecstatic and told her I would absolutely love that and to lmk a time and day. I didn't bring it up again and she didn't either for about 2 months. One day, out of the blue in September she gave me a date and told me they'd watch the kids from noon-6pm and I could go do whatever I wanted. I made plans, then the night before she told me she wasn't feeling well and wanted to reschedule. Which was fine. October was a nightmare due to family illness and hospitalizations. (Not family that lives in our home.) And I really stretched myself thin trying to help. U noticed that I was kinda burned out and said he would talk to A about keeping the kids for a day. A week or so before Thanksgiving, A and U sat down with me to go over their calendar to figure out a day they could keep the kids. So we planned one again for black Friday.

I agreed and got them dressed and all ready to go, then just before they left she suggested maybe taking them out tomorrow instead since she worried they'd be bored shopping today.

I told my friends that I'm uncomfortable with the jokes and they said they won't do it anymore, but my friend who I will call Jane, has a boyfriend and he absolutely makes me uncomfortable saying he'll make me ""straight"" and stuff. I told Jane about it and she just laughed it off saying he's just joking, I brushed it off and we never spoke about it. But not long ago me and my friends, which includes Jane and her boyfriend, were hanging out after school just to do some fun things. I have this one guy friend, which I'll call Eric, who I really see as family and we talk a lot. So when we were hanging out I was talking with Eric and laughing, my friends boyfriend was making jokes, again. He said out loud to all of my friends ""Wow, I didn't know you turned straight again!"", Jane was laughing at the joke while no one else did. I said to him that it wasn't funny and I already asked him to stop cause I was uncomfortable with it, Jane then defended him with saying ""Jesus, no one can't take a joke anymore. If I knew you were gonna be that soft I wouldn't have invited you."" At this point I had enough and said to Jane ""I hope you and your boyfriend fucking break up and that he leaves you for someone else!"" she got very mad at me and even began yelling. I grabbed my shit before leaving and said to Jane ""It's just a joke, it isn't that deep."" and left. Eric went with me and he said it was well deserved. We both went to an ice cream shop and catched our train.

Although only a deposit was due ahead of time, I paid in full ($175 I think). The morning of the session my daughter was sick and we let the photographer know we couldn’t make it. She said the session would be good for a year. However, almost right after was 2020 and the whole photography session slipped my mind until August 2022. I know it’s been over a year since my original booking but I thought maybe I could still have the session due to unforeseen circumstances (for the entire world) or at least get the money I paid past the deposit back. 

I messaged the photographer in August shortly after she posted on Facebook and got no response. I forgot about it again and then she posted on Facebook again recently advertising sessions so I messaged her again and got no response. It’s been a couple days but I have to imagine she’s seen the message since this is how she would get new business.

My last message to her was just asking her to respond to me, even if it’s just to say I forfeited my money and should go elsewhere. I understand I will probably never see any of this money again but it’s annoying to be ignored.

I know a guy who is a real piece of shit. He's the worst kind of person in every sense of the word. Rude, entitled, obnoxious, misogynistic, selfish...the list goes on.

His entire income relies on him selling hard drugs to people, and his side hustle is in breeding dogs. He's not a registered breeder, and the dogs in question are bred time and time again with no regard for their health. One dog was even prolapsed so bad that he artificially inseminated it to successfully trigger pregnancy.

The dogs are French Bulldogs, which lets face it, shouldn't really exist due to their breathing issues and inability to give birth without a C-section. When somebody questioned his ethics, he responded 'they're not pets', which all but confirmed his view on them being mere tools for his benefit.

I detest every fibre of this mans being. He brags of a lavish lifestyle and he's intensely materialistic.

I want to report him, because why should he live a high life obtained via the exploitation of dogs and vulnerable drug users when everyone else has to struggle with their legitimate income?

The thing is, he has a family. A fiance and 4 daughters. I firmly believe that this man deserves everything he gets, but I worry about the consequences for them. She's a nice woman, and no kid deserves to grow up without a father even if he does tempt fate by leading a life funded by illegal activities.

For context to my question, I (36F)have been friends with another woman (Sara 44F) for nearly five years. We have been through a lot together. I thought our friendship could weather any storm but I was wrong. We have taken time apart from each other in the past when we gotten into fights but this time, I feel completely 100% done.

So I occasionally will join a friend's(Ron 50M) podcast and we discuss drama going on in the community we're involved in. This day in particular, the jerk (Matt))we were discussing came up onto the podcast and began spewing lie after lie, painting himself up to be the victim of a 10 year long smear campaign by people on the internet. Ron and I didn't believe anything he said but we let him talk for close to two hours, making the podcast all about himself and how everyone else is an asshole for the things he's done to people. He brought up Sara, talking about her. I didn't defend her and she got mad. She blocked me on everything. I tried to apologize, even circumventing the block by going onto a secret twitter account I have, just to apologize to her. Ron and I had fallen out over a year ago but we decided to be friends again and I explained to her I didn't feel like arguing with Matt just to entertain people who are addicted to the drama and that I was grateful to be friends with Ron again and didn't want to disrespect Ron by starting a screaming match on the podcast. She chose not to accept this. I truly am remorseful for not defending her but I did try to apologize and explain.

I decided not to discuss it publicly, I stayed quiet, giving her the time and space to cool down. She would come to me eventually and we could talk it out in private. Instead, she did her own podcast episode, shitting all over me to people in the hopes of garnering sympathy. Most of the people riding her wagon right now have said some awful things about her in the past. They have made fun of her weight, they have said awful things about her children and threatened to call CPS on her. Some HAVE called CPS on her as a way of hurting her. But she is soaking up all of the attention she is getting while painting me up to be the asshole of the situation and threatening to air dirty laundry but in truth, she intends to make things up because she doesn't really have anything on me that would upset people. 

She is airing things about me that aren't even that bad, while holding gifts she had given my kid that I never asked for, over my head. Whenever I am on podcasts now, she comes into the chat, spewing more vitriol at me and trying to rally people to her side. She is incredibly toxic and childish and I made the decision I no longer want to be her friend. Others on the podcast are calling me the asshole in the situation, even though I am not taking Sara's bait and refuse to fight with her like she wants. She just wants an argument and I refuse. She is further making the decision easier for me to cut her off completely out of my life. I am done.
