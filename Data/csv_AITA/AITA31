We only check it if the other persons asks us to check a message or something like that. So I’ve always been really shy, and especially with singing in front of other people. I love to sing, but I have a bad stage frightening, my husband knows, I’ve never sung in front of him because of it, even though he’s asked me a lot of times. It’s just something I can’t do in front of ANY ONE! So today he was on my phone showing me something in the messenger app, when he saw a random dudes profile pic and asked who he was. I said let me check, pressed on the conversation and it was a producer I wrote to in 2019. We had a small conversation about me sending him a video of me singing, and then I had sent the video. I snatched it out of my husbands hands quick! I see that it might have felt weird since I never do that, and I quickly deleted the video and told him it was a video of me singing. He got mad, and said why did you grab it like that and delete it? And he says he feels suspicious that if I can share everything with him about myself, and be my self 100%, why would I delete the video that quick? I said because I’m really shy and know that you would have pressed play and that I don’t ever wanna see that video again, because I’m kinda embarrassed about it. He says he believes me, but that he feels it’s weird, and to be honest, I don’t feel like he believe me at all. He also said he didn’t know if it was in fact a video of something else since I got so agitated and deleted it so quick. That makes me mad, because why would he marry me if he thinks that I’m gonna lie or send something like that? And besides, he could read in the previous messages I was gonna send a singing video.

I reluctantly said ok.  Thinking they are going to patch things up and she'll be back home in a day or 2 (as has happened several times in the past).  Well it's now middle of November and she's still living in my guest room.  Her mom doesn't want her back, said she breaks house rules, wanted to put her in a group home.  She has followed all the rules here, but she's not my kid and I don't like having her around.  For one thing, it feels like I have a guest over all the time and I can't relax in my own home.  Also, I don't like her personality, I get the vibe that she's greedy and uses people. The other day, she was laughing to my daughter that she gets boys to take her out to dinner and buy her things (pretending that she likes them).  I told her sternly that she shouldn't use boys, if she doesn't like a boy in a romantic way she should tell him honestly and not string him along for free meals and presents.  Not only is it a shitty thing to do, it could cause her problems in the future.  Yesterday she said we should buy matching pajamas (me, my daughter, and her) and take ""family photos"" in front of the Christmas tree.  I don't see her as family.  If I sent Christmas cards with that photo, none of my friends and extended family would know who tf she is.  I barely knew her a couple months ago.  She wasn't even my daughter's best friend, just one of her many friends from the neighborhood.  I resent the fact that she's not my kid, now she's glommed onto our family and expects me to treat her like a daughter.  Also asking where we are going on vacation.  Expecting me to buy her things all the time. Uggh.

WIBTA for telling her she can't stay here anymore?  She would have to go live in the group home.

My mother and I came home from grocery shopping and a very nice guy helped with the water at the store, and the Lyft driver helped us get it in and out fo his car.

I’m aware that the title sounds really bad and i used to feel bad for thinking this but i reached my limit and i don’t think i feel any empathy for my brother anymore.

 I (19F) started to consider him(24M) a parasite because he basically does nothing all day he only plays video games and smokes, he forbids any of our family to enter his room even to give him the clean clothes that HE puts in the laundry basket for our mother to wash and iron. 

He always leaves a mess everywhere he goes and if he spills something he doesn’t even bother to clean it up and if you ask him to do that he either says he’s going to do that later or gives you an attitude mocking your voice wile he does so.

 He ALWAYS leaves the toilet dirty after he’s done with it (you know what kind of dirty) and we have been asking him to clean every time for i don’t know how many years but nothing changes, same goes for smoking in the house, we always ask not to do that because none of the other members of the family smokes and we don’t like the smell and it gives us headaches, mind you we have two balconies so its not like he has to go out of the house to smoke.

You can’t have a decent conversation with him because he turns everything you say on you and get angry is you don’t agree with him ex. one time he screamed at me because i didn’t want to try on a shirt that he bought that was really big even on him ( he is 1,92m/6’3 and I’m 1,75m/5’7), he got mad because when he asked me why i just said i didn’t want to wear it, according to him its not a valid excuse and he ended up arguing with me until i just couldn’t take it anymore and just closed myself in to my room. 

He doesn’t work and he is supposed to be studying but in three years he gave only one exam and mind you he still ask our parents to pay for the tuition (they are still paying because they are scared that he is going to rub in their face that they didn’t give him a chance of an higher education, yes he has done it already for other minor things like gift).

In one of the most recent fighting I also said directly to him what I think and that if he wanted nothing to do with us then he should move out.

There are other things but this post is getting too long and it’s not like I’m the perfect daughter, i too don’t work but at least i help around the house and help my parents when they ask me to do something. So for earlier this week i talked with my parents about the situation and asked them to kick him out because it was getting out of hand.

I'm 26. Lucy is 23 and I've gone through a lot of the major life milestones that she has. We went to the same college and both majored in business and economics.

Lucy has approached me with advice about careers and majors and I've been very blunt, but only because I care about her and her future. I've gotten angry and impatient with her before, but I've always apologized. I've only had good intentions with her.

Recently, Lucy approached me about changing careers. She and I were both in the same business career after undergrad, and she told me that she feels that she does not like it / isn't passionate about it.

I told her that no adults feel passionate about their jobs and that if she wants, she can get an MBA to switch to another field within business. I was in my first job out of college, hated it after 2-3 years and then pivoted through my MBA.

But then she told me that she wanted to do medicine instead. To be clear, Lucy was premed when starting college but it kinda made her miserable. She wasn't efficient at studying for her organic chemistry classes and would grind for hours to get mediocre results (B's). Her GPA in STEM classes was 3.56, and she hasn't taken many of the required STEM classes either.

She excelled in economics, however, earning higher grades than even me - I tutored micro and macro. She only earned A's and A- in those classes.

I basically gave her the same lecture as I did when she was in undergrad, where my health economics class taught me that being a doctor isn't financially worth it and how doctors deal with lots of bullshit from insurance and people telling them how to practice. 

I added that our uncle ""Frank"" was kicked out of his group practice for not meeting metrics and that Frank and his family struggled for years when he couldn't pass boards (Frank went to medical school abroad) as additional context as to how medicine can be hard for even the most competent.

I added that if she was not good at science then, why would she be good now, and to just get an MBA if she doesn't like her job and she got upset with me.

I generally just want everyone to believe in what they want, within reason. 

I live in a small town, and have a friend who has grown up very conservatively and who’s always been apart of the church. She’s recently decided to re-dedicate her life to the Lord, which I support her in, but she won’t stop trying to talk to me about Christianity when we’re together. She’s asked me about my beliefs before, and has challenged them because they contradict hers, and I’ve told her this makes me uncomfortable but didn’t really take offense at the time. She insists she “just wants to understand” what I believe in, but I don’t think this is the case because she then tells me that Jesus exists and I should have a relationship with him, go to church, etc. Lol. I’ve kind of just changed subjects or flat out said “no” and she’d back off. 

Yesterday, she was talking about how the end times are coming because all of the signs that are talked about in the Bible are there. I told her that if the rapture does happen, I doubt it will be in this lifetime (not that I didn’t believe in it entirely - I don’t presume to know that it will or won’t for a fact happen). All of the “signs” she pointed out have happened before, at more dire conditions.

She immediately said, “but you understand that if it does happen soon, you’ll go to Hell, right? You aren’t going to Heaven because you don’t have a relationship with Jesus and you haven’t accepted him in your life. I just love you and I want you to go to Heaven.” 

I snapped and told her she can’t just say shit like that to people. I told her I don’t believe that I’m going to Hell, and that my beliefs are just as valid as hers whether she chooses to accept that or not, and that I know she loves me but she has to respect me too. I said that I feel like she equates agnosticism with being confused, lost, etc. and that she wouldn’t argue with me if I outright said I was Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or any other religion - to which she insisted she would, which I think is even worse lol. I think she’s very sheltered and doesn’t realized how inappropriate that is. I told her it makes me deeply uncomfortable. The whole time, her sister was chiming in and backing her up/defending her intentions, and my friend started tearing up and said she wont bring it up anymore in a very hurt tone.

Their members have IDs named after a station such as 東京駅. Last Thursday was a public holiday in Japan. She says ""let's play together!, I'm gonna play until the morning!"" I login and then suddenly she says ""my Master tier friend is gonna carry me, so I'll play with you after we lose! So wait for me ok!"" I said ""sure."" Then just played OW2 with my friend. It's now 5am. She's still online and she messages me ""oh you were still awake?"" This triggered me and I replied ""됐어"" which just means ""forget it."" A few days later, I apologized for getting a little angry. Although I feel like I didn't do nothing wrong. I just blocked her.

All was good until I fucked up, which I completely admit was my fault. In the evening I tell ***girl B*** let's play again.

His bio mom died when he was a baby but his stepmom has been in his life since before he can remember. Apparently when he was a kid they were really close but ever since he was 9 she has treated him as lesser than her bio kids (1 from a previous marriage and 2 with bf’s dad). 

My bf has always tried to get her approval but she has always blamed him for everything, demanded he take on a bunch of adult responsibilities from a young age including being the live-in babysitter for his 2 younger siblings, and insulted him to the point that his self-confidence is nonexistent. Despite telling me many times that his mother’s mistreatment of him hurts him, he still tries to make her happy no matter how impossible it is. Since I became his gf, I have also been subject to her mistreatment and she would often use me to punish him (eg I wasn’t allowed in the house and he oftentimes wasn’t allowed to see me because she knew it would hurt him). 

His family has never celebrated his birthday (even though they do a big party for every other member of the family) and the first time his stepmom has even wished him a happy birthday was this last year when he had already moved out of the house. 

Now onto the issue: my bf and i have been on really opposite schedules and have barely spent any real time together in the last month or so. His parent are going to a show tonight and they asked him to sleep at their house tonight so that he can watch the kids and he accepted because it’s her birthday. Because of our schedules, this means we won’t see each other at all for like 40hrs after I’ve already been asking him to spend more time at home. This Sunday would be the first day in weeks that we could actually spend relaxing together, but he wants to go to his stepmom’s birthday celebration. I asked him if he could do something with her another day so that we can spend the day together, especially since she can never be bothered for his birthday and I’m the only once who actually cares about making him feel special.

I made some friends while living in campus during the summer bridge program. One of those friends were girl A and girl B. We had good convos and jokes to crack. But from my other classmates, I heard that they were talking about instances of how girl B gets offended easily at some jokes or mannerisms from other classmates as well as girl A. I heard that when I was creating a discord server for my group within the summer group. I decided to invite only my friends but not girl A and girl B because of the memes or jokes(some dark) might be found offensive by them. So to avoid any conflicts, I just invited my friends. But somehow, girl B discovered I had a discord server and DECIDED to confront me about it in private. In order to no offend her any further, I said “you could have asked me” and then I HAD to apologize AND INVITE HER TO THE DISCORD SERVER and girl A too. Now, freshman year starts. I begin to suspect that girl A has a crush on me but is very timid to talk to me. So whenever the three of us would meet, I would tease girl A to open up a little and make some conversation. When I didn’t tease with her, she didn’t talk as much as when I did. I also tried to make jokes and troll them on group chat. Everything seems fine. Until now. Now all of a sudden, girl A leaves our message group chat and my discord server without saying anything. I ask girl B why A left and she said that it was because my jokes went too far or were too intense or sometimes me and girl B talked a lot of about Computer Science and she felt left out because she doesn’t know much about the details of them. She also said that A left was because every time I teased her, girl B would join as well. So now, girl B proposed a meeting to discuss what jokes are considered too intense or offensive and how to include her more in convos. I think that is unecesaaey because I already apologized to A. But B said that “ things will permanently change. I just hope that there will be no hostility or resentment between the three of us."" So she's basically saying that our friendship will end if I don't meet and discuss the stuff EVEN WHEN I APOLOGIZED TO GIRL A. The apology consisted on my acknowledgment of ""intense"" or ""offensive"" jokes( none were racial, sexual, sexist. etc.). I said that I will teaser her less and I will try to include her more in conversation(conversations I will try to make more broad for her to discuss with us). I talked about this to my friends and some said that I should just find new friends because what they're doing is ""too much drama"" but not sure what to decide.

Today, I finally saw Blue and asked her why she was mad at me. She was initially snarky but then quickly told me she was mad because I keep leaving her at parties. I apologize for hurting her and ask her if she could give me an example because I don’t remember the nights. 

Blue said that one night we went out and while we were moving to the next party she decided she did not want to go anymore. So while me and my other friend went inside to the party she waited outside on a bench, but didn’t tell anyone she wasn’t going inside. And I didn’t notice she wasn’t with me because I was so drunk (I feel really bad for this). And the other story she had was basically the same with her not showing up to the party and deciding to leave without telling us. 

She got mad because I would get too drunk where I didn’t notice her leaving so I have been cutting back on alcohol and not getting as drunk when we go out. 

I obviously feel really bad for leaving her and recognize how unsafe it is but at the same time she just leaves without telling us yet expects us to come find her. I have apologized to her for it but feel she’s not taking some of the responsibility.

I’m not a huge dog person, but I find dogs cute and am always happy to see them enjoying the large field behind our complex. 

But here’s the problem. A few months ago a new neighbor moved into my building. I suppose our schedules line up because whenever I leave my apartment she’s always there walking her dog. Her dog is huge. I don’t know much about breeds so I won’t speculate, but this dog’s body looks like it’s pure muscle. This dog is also highly aggressive. Every time someone walks by this dog growls, barks, snarls, snaps, and yanks at the leash. She visibly struggles each time to hold her massive dog back. 

A week ago I was trying to get to my building but she and her dog were blocking the narrow ramp that leads to it. The dog started the usual growling/barking while the woman tried to make room for me to pass. She had her phone in one hand and the leash in the other (usually she needs two hands to control her dog)

I barely took a step forward before the dog broke loose and started running towards me. I froze and the dog managed to jump up onto me, snapping at my face. I pushed away using my palms and a knee and managed to push the dog off, quickly dropping to the ground and curling up into a ball using my hands to cover my neck. 

I’m not sure how long I was like that but the dog kept making noise and snapping at my clothes. Eventually the owner got the leash back and tugged her dog away. 

I got up and this woman started screaming at me that I assaulted and kicked her dog. I was still frazzled so I barely managed to explain that I was afraid. She called me a pussy and said that her dog was friendly and would never hurt anyone, I was overreacting. The jumping on me was to give me kisses. By that point I was furious because no?? That in no way seemed like a friendly dog coming up for kisses. She cursed me out and said I didn’t know shit about her dog and that she’d have to take him to the vet because I could have hurt him. I gave up and went to my apartment, not wanting to argue about it and not wanting to be near her dog that was still fighting against the leash. 

Now we still see each other and she’ll periodically call me an asshole or bitch if I visibly flinch at her dog’s barks. 

I feel like I did what I had to do in an unsafe situation but worry that I hurt her dog. I’d never hurt an animal and it pains me to think that I could have. She never told me if I actually hurt her dog (vet visit and whatnot) so I’m stuck in limbo worrying. Was I the AH for pushing this dog away?

She wants me to quit work early and come see her and help her. She has asked me to get off work early and was talking about how sick she was and bad she felt.

I kind of shrugged it off, which I see now could be an issue like I didn’t care, but I have to work on Friday and she told her job she would “work from home” today but obv isn’t. I don’t feel like I should be expected or have to come help her because it was her decision to get drunk and trashed and she can live with that decision, rather than me getting off work early and having to “baby sit” or take care of an adult. Now if she was actually sick, out of her control like a cold or flu, I’d no doubt drop everything tohelp her and would feel obligated to help her out.

I'm quite close with them although we don't speak often and we had a few issues at work so we always have lots to discuss, apart from the fact that we attend the same course.

Today my bf had a job interview and we went to the gym but only had around half an hour to do weights because time caught up with us. Two days ago we had just talked about the issues between us to settle everything in hopes of minimising arguments between us and to avoid doing stuff that annoy/hurt one another. When I saw my friend I went to speak to them and I told my bf to give me a moment and to start without me. I ended up speaking to my friend for longer than I thought and only had ten minutes left to train but my bf had started.

When we finished I saw him acting all strange with me and I asked what's wrong. He started swearing (which we agreed not to do anymore when upset with each other) and told me that I am inconsiderate for taking so long conversing with my friend. I told him I'm the one that missed out on the workout. He said no because I waited 10mins for you and I told him that I told him to start off without me and he was upset at me still saying that I should have told them that I need to go. I told him I did not think of that because if he came to me and told me we need to go because it's time for his interview, I would have left even if I didn't manage to train anything. I didn't think about myself I just focused that he does his workout with the little time we had and that he got to his interview in time, but instead he got upset at me for speaking too long and for not stopping the conversation. We did have a minor argument in the morning but before I met my friend I was speaking to him normally so that we don't go back on our promises.

Regardless he broke two today including shouting and swearing at me while we argue. When I pointed this out he said that he has every reason to and that my problem is that I don't notice I made a mistake and I told him that throughout I was thinking of him and he told me that it was not true (I don't think he heard me saying he can start off without me). I had his interests in mind and while I should have stopped the convo to train with him like we always do, it didn't come to mind because I knew we were constrained with time and was just thinking about him making it, plus that I hadn't seen my friend in a while.

I haven't said sorry because I feel like he overstepped when taking into consideration what we promised each other to better our relationship. Our agreement is that whatever happens nothing that we don't like should be done (such as the shouting, swearing, etc.) because it is not justified at any point.

I (19F) studied nuersery during high school cause that's a thing here in my country. Today was my ceremony where they were gonna give me my degree and everything. I invited my dad and my mom. My dad has always assisted to all my ceremonies along the course of my studies, but my mom on the other hand couldn't be present not even a single time because of her condition (she's an alcoholic). So, I stayed up till 5 am or so doing work for college and at 3 am or smth i wrote to my dad that today was the ceremony so he wouldn't forget. As I said before, i stayed up til 5, I was pretty tired and y just didn't hear the alarm and i woke up at 11 (the ceremony started at 11:30 and I live like 50 mins away). I told my dad that I would be a bit late and he texted me things that made me feel prettybad such as that I stayed up late wasting my time as I ""always do"" and that I'm irresponsable, among other stuff. I started crying because I'm on my finals on college and It's been so stressful, and the fact that my dad didn't even asked just made me explode, so i texted him that he was selfish and that he could've asked why I stayed up late istead of assuming. Later I called my mom and i told her that I wasn't feeling okay and that she should go home cause I wasn't going. After this, my dad called me an insensitive and horrible person for hurting my mom this way, taking away from her the only chance that she has to be present on a ceremony. Later my brother called me and told me that I was a shitty person, that I ruined everything and that my mom would be drinking again because of me. It was a bad move not assisting the ceremony? honestly, i feel bad for my mom cause she was so excited, but I didn't wanted to go and see my dad's face cause he's always looking down what I do.

She wears a lot of short skirts and crop tops, I love jeans and sweaters. I’ve known her since we were both 10 and she only started dressing like this in the last 7 years or so. It made me uncomfortable in the beginning because I feel like she shouldn’t be showing so much skin, she gets creepy comments from guys and they stare at her so it made me worried for her safety. I also think that people who dress like that don’t really respect themselves or they just want attention, so by dressing like that she would give people the wrong idea about her. I’ve asked her to change her outfits before we went out together a few times because of this, but she refused so now I just deal with it. She doesn’t seem to care who she makes uncomfortable with how she dresses. 

I recently got married a few months ago, and she came to visit and stayed with me (we live in different states) but this was back when my husband was just my fiancé. She brought up my being uncomfortable with how she dressed and asked if I wanted her to dress differently around my fiancé. I honestly hadn’t thought about it but I was glad she brought it up and said yes, if she could dress more modestly I’d appreciate that. She dressed a little more conservatively (for example wearing a leather jacket so her arms and stomach were covered, but with a short skirt and fishnet stockings) and I realized that part of why I didn’t like how she dresses is my own insecurities. I don’t always like how my body looks (I’m heavier than her) and she’s always been the “pretty” one who gets more attention. 

But now she’s saying that it feels like I’m still not happy with how she dresses, because I walked behind her while we all went down a stairwell so my husband couldn’t look at her from behind. I didn’t do that on purpose🤷🏻‍♀️ 
She said she doesn’t think it’s right that I’m “policing” how she dresses or that it feels like she has to adhere to a dress code whenever she comes to visit. She tried being more modest but it’s just not “her” and she feels uncomfortable and like I don’t trust her or my husband.

So I let him know something along the lines of: hey, you’re the one out of line here, both figuratively and literally. 

But of course, in typical boomer fashion this guy has to blame someone else for his own wrongdoing. 

Then this guy goes on to make the overdramatic gesture of barely squeezing into his car because of the door not being able to fully open. My departing words were “Hey, if you don’t park so poorly in the future, you wouldn’t have this problem.” Afterwards I went on my way just wondering why this fella thinks I’m the asshole when his own shitty parking landed him in that predicament.

Since then both sides of my family have been dysfunctional but I tend to spend most of my time with my mothers side. Since this divorce happened christmas has been entirely about gifts… some christmas it would take 4-5 hours to open up all the presents. Now im not complaining about recieving gifts, I just have always wished we did more things than just making christmas about gifts. We dont take family photos, bake together, cook together, go out and do holiday activities…. nothing. My mom in the past has done all the cooking, baking and decorating on her own time… the family comes over opens the gifts, eats and leaves. 

Im now 26 years old and realized I dont enjoy spending christmas this way. My mother mentioned to me her spending limits for christmas, which only included gift buying. I explained to her i was unhappy with how christmas has been in the past and I suggested we use that money towards doing something together as a family instead. My suggestions were dog sledding, winter winery tour, and going to see the nut cracker play. I also suggested having an ugly sweater themed dinner and opening table crackers for dinner like other families do. 

These suggestions were not taken lightly and my mom got extremely defensive. She called me the other day out of random and started the conversation off that she was upset that I thought our past christmas were terrible and shes a bad mother…. but i never once said they were terrible and that she was a bad mother.  I simply just didnt enjoy them being entirely about gifts and not about family time. 

My sibling has gotten involved saying im being extremely ungrateful for what our parents do for us. This has caused tension in our family. My mom is now saying that shes not getting me anything for christmas this year since ive complained about christmas just being about gifts and she doesnt feel like it has been about gifts. 

All my point was is that why are we spending outragous amounts of money on gifts but not allocating any money to bond as a family. I would appreciate 1-2 meaningful gifts with good memories instead of 10+ pointless gifts.

He (23m) lives 3 hours away, so it’s not that far but it’s still a struggle. I’ve been seeing him every other weekend so far and it’s been working out fine, I wish I could see him more but it is what it is for right now. Eventually, we’re both going to meet in the middle and live together but that’ll be months from now. 

His family always does their Thanksgiving a week after the actual day. So he had plans to come here for Thanksgiving and spend it with my family. I was excited, he was excited, and my family was excited because they absolutely love him. Plus, this was going to be his best chance to meet some of my close relatives that either don’t live near or are always busy. 

He talked to his mom and she told him that they were going to do Thanksgiving on the actual day this year. She didn’t give a reason, just told him it is what it is. He missed their Thanksgiving last year because he couldn’t get off for it as it was a week after the actual holiday, so she basically guilt tripped him into saying he would stay there instead of spending the holiday with me. 

When he told me, I was devastated. I had been looking forward to it, and him not coming meant I would have to wait an extra two weeks to see him. I tried to act like I was fine, but he told me to just be honest about how I felt, so I was. I told him that it seemed awfully convenient that the one year he had somewhere else to go, they wanted to do Thanksgiving on the day, and that I wasn’t happy about going an entire month without seeing him, and that it wasn’t fair and that if they got away with it this time, they’d do it again on Christmas and that would just be repeated every year, and he’s putting me in an impossible position because I’m either going a month without seeing him and spending a holiday without him or I’m the girl who stole him from his family on Thanksgiving. 

He wasn’t angry, and he agreed with most of it. He told me that he was going to talk to his mom and tell her she’d just have to see him next Thanksgiving. He’s not that close to his family anyway, so he said this wasn’t that big of a deal, and he’d rather spend the holiday with me. But my mom and sisters told me that now he’s only coming here because I guilted him into it by crying and going off, and he’s only doing it to make me happy, not because he wants to. They’re saying I should have just kept my feelings to myself and went without him instead of acting like a selfish and childish brat. 

I apologized and he was perfectly understanding about everything which made me feel even worse. I told him that if he wants to spend Thanksgiving with his family he should and we can just see each other another day, but he still wants to come here. He promises everything is fine but I’m just not sure.

I ended up bursting into my sibling's room, and yelling out “YOU HAVE TO PICK A GENDER.”

They looked confused, so I repeated.

“you have to pick a gender. there is no such thing as gender fluid. you were born a girl so you are a girl, that's it.”

Basically I'll work til 7 one day and have to come back at 5am the day after. 

 I work 7am Wednesday,  which is nice because then I can rest and be lazy after work.  

There's this coworker I'll call Elly. Her name is spelled Elly but pronounced Ally.  I don't like her, when I first started and read her name tag I pronounced it incorrectly and she made a big thing.  I know it's dumb to hold a grudge but in general she just acts like she's all that.

I was off Wednesday and decided to check the scheduling app. I had a shift swap request  from Elly. She wants to flip my 7-3 for her 2-9.  

A few things irritated me about this. She didn't ask and just sent the request like I was just supposed to do it, there's zero benefit for me to do it, and I'm not even available that late. 

Then yesterday she came up and asked if I've been on the scheduling app.  I said yea. She said ""oh. Well can you do that swap?"" I said ""no."" She said ""why not?"" I said ""my schedule is all over this week, I'm not off til Thanksgiving and I don't want to work that late the day before."" 

She said ""but I have to drive to see family, I don't want to be first driving there at 9 at night. It's 2 hours away. Please?"" 

I said no. 

She brought it up a few more times and said ""she'd do it for me"" (I call bs).  Then made some comment about how we help each other at company and said to someone else she wished they hired nicer people or something.  

There's several people that also start early that day, but I'm the only one she's pestering which is annoying

Here's where I might be the asshole. I'm not available that late, but I could theoretically do one shift. If she was a work friend or something I'd probably do it. I just don't want to make that sacrifice (work much later, have another shift I don't like) for her because I dislike her.

People who overheard were split about who was in the wrong, which made me even more irate... Here's what happened many moons ago.

I (21F) was at a party with my boyfriend ""Ben"" (20M). At about 1AM, I decided it was time to leave, but I had had a bit to drink, and didn't feel comfortable walking home alone (this was before UBER, and cabs at the time were pretty pricey, so we generally walked everywhere or took the bus-- bus had stopped running by this hour). I asked my boyfriend to walk me home (about a 15 minute walk one way), but he didn't really want to leave. I told him I would wait for another hour or so, if that was better, but then he started telling me that it wasn't fair of me to ask him to do that. He was planning on spending the night at the party house.

His reasoning was that if he walked me home, then he would have to walk back and then HE'D be walking all by himself late at night. Now, we did not live in a particularly bad neighbourhood at all. And I'd stumbled home drunks many times before in my youth, and never worried. However, for whatever reason I just didn't feel safe doing it anymore. I realized the risks were there and that immortal feeling you have when you are younger was beginning to fade. I told him that he would very likely be totally fine, but the risk was higher for me. Again, not a dangerous city, but every once in a while you'd hear about a woman being attacked and rarely would you hear about someone getting mugged, although to be fair, it does happen.

We got into a huge fight and he accused me of having double standards and said I couldn't push equality on one hand, and then claim he was required to walk me home on the other. It turned into a big thing and ended up being the reason we broke up.

I suppose I can kind of see how it isn't fair to expect someone to walk me home because I feel unsafe and then expect them to do it themselves... but at the same time, I feel the risk was higher for me. Also, I was mostly just hurt that he didn't WANT to walk me home.

Today I messaged them that the date is off because they, for nearly four full days, didn't make any inquiry to or suggestion at which HOUR we would want to meet up. Instead: dead silence.
I quit the last long term relationship because it was always me who had to organize about everything (including my partner's birthday party), and I'm honestly totally fed up to be the one who has to come up with all details. After all, I already provided the day and the place, is it asking for too much if the date suggests a time?

This has generally worked out, so we all just go along with it.

My wife and I are both 28 and have one child together, and we've been together for about 8 years now. We went through a separation for about 8 months, before working through it and coming back together. My wife did go through a mental health hitch which preluded our sudden separation, but received treatment, attends therapy, and is in leaps and bounds of a better place. She's working, productive, happy, healthy, and the best mother I could ask for my kids.

Back in the early summer, we found out that my wife is pregnant, which was extremely exciting as we're in a great place, and we always wanted 2 kids. About a month in, we lost the pregnancy. A few months later, we tried again and were successful. We decided to keep the pregnancy on the down low, in lieu of the risk of another miscarriage. We didn't tell anyone either time and planned on making the announcement on Thanksgiving.

I'm part of a group on Facebook where people give things away, and I saw a baby item that would be extremely useful. I have no mutual connections on this group, and it is private. One of my sister's friends, however, recognized me and saw that I was asking for a baby item. So she reached out to my sister, who called me. 

She demanded to know if my wife is pregnant, and lambasted my ""poor life choices."" She threatened to tell my family for me, and warned me against making any announcements on a holiday because ""my parents don't deserve that shock."" She feels that, because my wife went through a mental health issue, she was not fit to have another child.

I blew up on her and told her that she should not have asked, and not to tell anyone, or her relationship with me would forever be on ice. I told her the reason we've kept it down was that we lost the last pregnancy, to which she responded ""well maybe you should have kept it off of Facebook if you wanted it to be private."" In lieu of the looming threat of her telling everyone for me, I called my family to tell them, and they were ecstatic about the pregnancy. I told them that my sister and I got into a fight. 

During the first pregnancy with our child, my sister tore down the crib that we built and were storing at her guest house (pending a move)

The next day, I talked to my mom, who suggested that while my sister was wrong, ""we're both adults, and we need to get it together"" or Thanksgiving is off. I have no intentions of apologizing, nor does she, so now, Thanksgiving is canceled.

I know. I know. I’ve posted about my shitty roommate before and this is another post about her surprise surprise. 

Story time : I had like a health kick and I bought one of those like magic bullet blenders bc I was convinced I would make smoothies every day. I did NOT but I use it to make sauces and dips for myself and guests. I said my housemates could use it to make whatever they wanted as long as they cleaned it after. I woke up this morning and I saw my roommate outside our bathroom with some clear gloopy liquid in the blender cup that I think is aloe vera. She’s super into homemade hair remedies and she uses my blender often for sauce and soup so I didn’t think much of it and I’d just woken up so I was groggy. 

She was putting it on her palm and rubbing it on her hair and I was like okay not super weird. I go into the bathroom, pee and come out and I see her shoving chunks of her hair into the blender and rubbing it against the sides to get all the liquid into her hair. Her hair was oily and filled with dandruff and she was rubbing it IN the blender. Hair grosses me out so I went what the FUCK out loud.

She looks at me and kinda laughs like I said something funny and goes like ha ha don’t worry I’ll wash it after and I was like that’s not the point, I drink and eat from there. She kinda rolls her eyes and says “yeah all the smoothies you make?” And keeps laughing. I didn’t laugh and she goes what’s the big deal you don’t even use it I said I’ll wash it. 

I also go to therapy for. She flippantly made some comment like it’s fine go to therapy about it and I got super upset. 

Here is where I may be TA : I hate yelling or screaming so I just went to my room and sobbed for like 10 minutes because everything just got so overwhelming. I’m applying to grad school, withdrawing from Xanax, graduating a semester early and tutoring kids with a ten and a half hour time difference. Her boyfriend told me I was probably overreacting because of the reasons I just listed and I was just overworked and me crying made her feel like she was being gaslit. He also knows I’m not on financial aid from college and made a comment about how I was just touchy because I don’t have a maid here. 

The sheer unfairness of THAT made me more upset because I regularly clean up after them (even when they cook meat despite the fact that I’m a vegetarian because I just hate the smells). I don’t even mind cleaning up after her because the mess bothers me but she leaves bacon grease all over the kitchen I clean every damn day and this man has the audacity to tell me I didn’t have my maid here.

I know I’m overworked and tired and I’m also significantly younger than all my housemates. I just turned 21 and they’re all late 23-24 so I could just be being childish.

Sometimes, my cousin (y'all probably know about him already) and his parents would come too. These visits would usually end with the adults sending us kids away so that you could have their alone time. The 4 of us hung out a lot when we were little, but as we grew people and our interests developed, we stopped hanging out as much. Now here's where the problem begins.

 My parents just told me that they're coming over to visit us tomorrow. By they, I mean the family friends with their 2 kids, 2 more family friends with no kids, and my aunt, uncle and cousin. This means that  there are going to be 3 kids, all boys, running around the house doing who knows what. Now the problem isn't with them coming over. It's with my room.


 I've had some bad experiences with people coming into my room and breaking my stuff. Therefore, I don't like it when other people go in there. It's nothing against anyone. I just don't like it when people go into my room. When I told my grandparents this, they were totally on my side. They said that it was my room and my decision. When I told my dad however, he had a different opinion.

 He told me to stop being a selfish brat and that spending time with them was the polite thing to do. I told him that I was scared they would end up breaking my stuff and that I could just hang out with them outside my room. He then told me that the kids would go into my room and that was final. I told him that wasn't fair and ended the conversation.

I had put forth to my wife that she puts far more effort on FIL than she does for me.  Context, we've been married almost 20 years.

For his bday, we had them over on a Saturday evening and she made a special recipe lasagna and cupcakes.  I picked out something for him from one of our daughters activities, and she picked out something modest he'd wanted.  All had a nice time.

For my wife's bday, she sent a fairly comprehensive list of ideas including web links for shopping.  I bought her a $150 clothing item from her list (bought in person) and took my daughter (6) shopping to pick out a bunch of things at Target that my daughter just knew mom would want.  (Possibly true, she's 6).  We got her favorite take-out and I got these special cookies she likes from this bakery that only does cookies.

For my weekday bday, I gave two simple ideas because I wanted to see what she would come up with.  One was a $38 book, the other an inexpensive ($8-13) consumable item I purchase by the dozen &amp; use monthly for a (music) hobby.   The book, admittedly, comes in many varieties.  The link was correct, but apparently what shipped was incorrect.  For dinner, I'd told her a few days prior we could just hit this random food truck at a brewery.   

Info:  Our gifts are usually kind of modest, we tend to just buy what we need at the time.

But on my Bday we had a sizeable snowstorm.  Wife called and texted for us to be ready and just ""come out"" so she didn't have to turn her car off.  Unfortunately, I was juggling a child fighting about TV, homework, and snacks, a dog that wanted to eat and go outside, and some reports I had to submit for work.  I'd have preferred help to ""just come out.""  I figured everything would be closed with the storm and of course it was.  I think she really did want to do something, but anticipating closures and long waits, I just told her to take us home for frozen pizza and a game on TV.  Desert was her favorite cookie place again, which I'm pretty indifferent on although I admittedly didn't like two of the specialty cookies on this day.

When it was time for presents, I got the book, the consumable, and nothing really from my daughter.   
 She said I was ungrateful.  (So, AITA?)  The book was wrong and she couldn't even bother to see the cover, the color, the logo didn't match the link.  She said, ""I just clicked the link"" and therein was my problem:  You cared so little, you didn't bother to check it?   I told her to send it back, I simply cannot even use it (ultimately, it is a book of music for a different instrument).  I don't really want a replacement, that's fine.  I also sent the cookies with her to work which was maybe rash; in retrospect, maybe my daughter would have wanted them (although she doesn't need the sugar).

But i'll make the story short.

So i (16M) went up to my room an as usual my brother (19M) who we'll call Richard was hiding in my room as some sort of practical joke. When i was young, think 6-11 my brother would always hide in my room to scare me or do something annoying to bug me and get me mad. I would always get mad and obviously as siblings do i'd try to fight him.

Back to present day my brother still does this but i've learned to ignore his antics and just react bluntly, he did his joke got out of my room, no harm no foul.

And this isn't a secret, everyone in my family knows this. So i kick the door, only this time there more resistance and i heard my brother say ""auw."" 
When i heard my brother say this auw i opened the door, ready to apologise. I muttered out under my breath a ""are you ok"" while looking at his nose since he was rubbing his nose.

After a few seconds i concluded that his nose wasn't hurt badly, no bloody nose maybe a bruise at most. But still he lashed out saying ""how stupid are you to kick your door close while my face is obviously there."" i agrued back saying that i didn't know his face was there and maybe if he'd stop bugging me once in a while stuff like this wouldn't happen. Then feeling my anger rise i closed the door and he opened it saying ""i'm not done talking to you."" I just responded that he could talk to the door and shut it in his face.

She would repeatedly/purposefully crossed boundaries I had in place for myself and my son just cause she could get away with it (would take my son around people I was uncomfortable with him around). After major series of events, hub and I decided that it would be best for all of us to go nc with her, not as a punishment but for us to find peace and to focus on my deteriorating mental health from the constant guilt tripping and gaslighting. I have been no contact for just over a year now.

&amp;#x200B;

Onto my sister. She is considered the golden child who could never do no wrong in the eyes of my mother (and the entire enabling side of the family). She will full on attack someone who she doesn't feel is up to her standards as a person. For example, she will attack me based on my appearance, weight, and claiming that I am lying about being disabled and using it for attention (I have repeatedly shown those who have asked my medical records to prove it). Her reasoning as to how she knows I'm lying? Because she's a medic in the Army and I guess that means that she knows more than my entire medical team I have been with since my diagnosis. Due to her consistent abuse, I completely stopped speaking to her when I was 16 and at 18, I went no contact. A few years ago, I extended an olive branch when she went on deployment and for a while, we were okay and thought that we had moved on from childhood arguments but when I began withdrawing from my mom, the abuse not only started again but had escalated to where I eventually blocked her as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I have received messages from other members of the family telling me that ""enough is enough"" and I ""need to let it go cause she's my mom"" or ""everything was a misunderstanding with your sister"" and I have ignored them all because I truly just want the peace in my life. Recently my sister got engaged and has mentioned to my father that she would be open to sending me an invite but knowing how she is, it's her way to manipulate him and make him think that I am this bad person who is refusing to go to her sister's wedding even though she seemingly wants me there (she really doesn't, she has repeatedly said).

&amp;#x200B;

After saying no, we do not want an invitation sent and whether there was or not, we would not be attending as there is no relationship with a majority of the people that will be attending, including with the bride and groom and I don't want to walk into a scenario that will be unhealthy for my family or my mental health as well as one that will be filled with unnecessary drama. Now I am receiving messages not only about me being a horrible daughter for what I did to my mom (I'm sure they only know her twisted version of the story) AND for not being there for my abusive sister's wedding.

Things were said by both of us that were foul and uncalled for, however; the final straw was when he was calling my youngest son ""it"" or ""that other thing"" and telling me to get a new father for him. During the court process his visitations for our eldest were taken away (we never went to court for custody for our youngest) and eventually he signed over his rights to both of our children. This was 2 years ago. Several months after our divorce was finalized a woman (who I knew he cheated on me with and knew he had a child with) messaged me and we became fast friends and our boys have a wonderful relationship. A few months ago, against court order, my ex-husband reached out to me and told me that he was having a baby with someone new. He told me that he wanted our boys to know that they have a half-sibling (he doesn't acknowledge their older half-brother as his child) and has begun to sing a different tune when it comes to our youngest child. He states that he wants to be back in our boys' lives and be there for them as a father. I don't trust in intentions, because I've heard this story before (""I've changed"", ""I'm not the same person I was"") only to be shown that he, in fact, hasn't changed. I have no intention of telling my boys that they will be having a new sibling (another boy according to the text I received).

Anyways, let’s just start

So, I grew up in a Catholic household because my parents came from Poland, and most of the population of that country is Catholic/Christian. 

So I was born in England and and raised in Scotland, growing up in a cold environment is not it, and I don’t really visit my family in Poland much because of covid and how high the prices are to get to Poland.

So as I was saying about growing up in a Catholic household, we would go to church almost every Sunday(it was a polish Catholic Church) so I had my communion and was baptised(I think).

So one day on the weekend(I think), I asked my Dad,(41 male): “what would you do if I’m atheist?(someone who doesn’t believe in God)” so, he looked at me and said something similar to this: “well, anyone who doesn’t believe in God will go to hell and burn there.” 

Then I found myself trying to explain to him that many people don’t believe in God or follow different religious like how some people practice Islam or some people are Jewish or someone people are Sikhs or maybe people don’t believe that God exists and much more.

But you know what he did?

He ignored what I said and continues to say that if you don’t believe in God you’ll go to hell or something like that

It gets worse from monday to friday, because the smell intensifies and on wednesday its already so bad, I want to puke and it makes my head hurt. 

Now, he's been told by people about it. He didn't believe anyone telling him that. One time he brought his t-shirt to another coworker and asked her if she can smell anything because he can't. That's ridiculous, but whatever. He's been told many many many times, and usually when he is told he smells really bad, a week after you can't smell him, because he might be putting effort into showering, but it doesn't last long. And at this point my manager said, she doesn't want to make him feel bad enough so he wouldn't leave, since we're short on people.

I (20f) am out right now with some friends. I know two of them very well, one of them I started talking to romantically recently and the other two I’ve never met. All of them, besides myself, are in a friend group so I feel a bit left out.

I have pretty bad social anxiety, have trouble trying to keep conversation and more of a listener than a talker but there were often times I felt like I was the sixth wheel. I won’t lie, I spent some time (around 3 hours) after feeling left out by going on my phone or going off alone to shop as I was more comfortable that way. The guy I’ve spoke to has barely interacted me despite me communicating this with him, he apologised but still didn’t talk to me when I offered us to go for a coffee. My friend who is in a couple with one of the strangers can’t talk to me much because they’re in a couple and the other stranger has interacted with me somewhat.

I'm sure I already know the answer to this because I feel awful about it but I have two different scenarios over the last two days to discuss.

1. My friend who has talked to me about him maybe having autism and us discussing our mental health in very deep context got furious at me last night because I asked if he was diagnosed with BPD and or Autism, out of curiosity. (He regularly talks to me about his depression and I talk to him about mine which has caused two large issues in sept..). He asked why I asked, and I told him honestly because he has a look in his eyes that I've seen with my other friends who are confirmed autistic, it's kind of an empty look and he got extremely offended and said ""you don't ask someone that"". Friendship ended.
2. This person I've talked to for months shared a meme and I commented on it, saying I think that it's funny because even though he's the exact opposite, he knows what it's like to be a redneck and hick. He got extremely offended. This is someone who has in detail seen me naked multiple times and we almost had sex etc. So I thought we were close enough for me to say ""hey aren't you deep down a redneck because you've lived in the west?"". I grew up in the west and we always took being called rednecks etc with pride because we were. He's got a southern accent, as does my father who grew up in North Carolina and is very open about being country etc. I didn't know it could even offend someone because most people are proud to have come from the country. I explained why I said that (I'm from west, we did a lot of 'redneck' stuff), he said he hated his hometown which I never knew.  Again, friendship ended.

I know people shouldn't make assumptions about others, but these two are people who I have discussed these subjects with or thought we were able to be open like that. People that I am friends with know how I speak and often playfully insult me constantly etc so I'm not sure why now all of a sudden I am offending people left and right. AITA?

Whenever my brother has an event going on, (whether a play, concert, etc) we are always forced to go to it including myself. Verses me, whenever I had events like soccer games, baseball games, reward ceremonies, races, etc I can’t name you one person who has shown up in my family to support me. I guess I’m suffering from being the middle child but truthfully I don’t think it is fair. 
A few months ago I ran a 5k race at my college and nobody in my family showed up. I did very well in the race and never got anything from my parents. Rather a “good job” via text. However, when my brother has something going on, I am forced to go always. When I made a point saying that I should have the right to not go when nobody supports me for the stuff I do, my parents simply say “that’s not comparable”. Which is extremely ironic considering my mother used to run races and marathons and we were always forced to go. I really don’t want to go to the concert but I literally am being forced to go as a 20 year old. I personally don’t think it’s fair and I know if I don’t go, my parents and grandparents will shame me and tell me to “support my brother”.

Am I 15f the asshole for being upset that my friend 16f posted our private conversation on here story? I didn't think I was the asshole in this story but the more I think about it the more dramatic I think I'm being. So me and my twin sister have been friends with this girl, let's call her Sarah, since 2016. Sarah lives about an hour away and goes to a different school from us so we barely get to see her, so instead we text her regularly. 
Yesterday me and Sarah were texting about our crushes and types and I said something weird and rude about black guys (we're both black btw). I immediately regretted what I said after reading it again and I realized what I said didn't even make sense and I didn't even mean it. I worded it very wrong Sarah was jokingly telling me I was weird for saying that and I tried to back track and reword what I was trying to say. My sister's iPad was near me and I saw some responses from Sarah saying I was whitewashed and it seemed like they were making fun of me about what  I said. I'm already very insecure about people talking about me behind my back and the fact that it was my sister and best friend doing it made it worse. I brought it up to Sarah in a lighthearted way because I didn't want to upset her and told her that I didn't mean what I said and to tell my sister that because I knew she wouldn't listen to me. Sarah did that and I thought it was over until later that night my sister was laughing and told me that Sarah had posted what I said on her story. I started crying and tried to not make it noticeable because I didn't want my sister to make fun of me and tell Sarah. 

I was deeply hurt by Sarah's actions so this morning I sent her a long paragraph text about how she made me feel and at first her response was just ""ok"". This made me feel even worse, but she later added that she said sorry (she actually didn't) and she told my sister I didn't mean what I said so she doesn't know what else to say. She also said she deleted the post  and my name wasn't even in it anyway. She then told me that what she was talking to my sister about me wasn't anything serious just jokes. I told her that even though my name wasn't in the post I still knew it was me and it was embarrassing that she posted it but I thanked her for deleting it. I also told her that even if she and my sister were joking it still made me insecure that they were talking about me in the first place. She apologized and I told her it was fine and she apologized again later  again said it was fine. 
I just wanted to put it past me and after school I was starting to think I blew the whole thing out of proportion. I tried to text her somethin to start a lighthearted conversation but she said ""OP please not today I don't wanna talk to anyone"" . It made me feel really bad I felt responsible for the mood she was in. I'm starting to think I was just being sensitive and overdramatic.

I ended up getting a drunk call from my dad who was out with his friends in the morning and my mum didn't bother to call, but texted me saying ""I'm now old enough to know I should be working harder"". I was already annoyed at them for this, but I was still excited hoping one of the would come visit me at school and take me out for lunch or something as a gift. In the end, neither one got me anything as a present nor did they visit me, so I assumed they were just busy. 

I didn't mind too much, but a week later I got to visit home for a break. I was quite ill at the time and the first thing my mum did was laugh at me and told me I was really useless since I always came home sick. When I got to my room I saw she left a plastic bag with a pillow inside it on my floor, and told me it was for my birthday. This really annoyed me since they've given my older brothers nice clothes or expensive rare pets as birthday gifts (on the actual dates of their birthdays). The price tag didn't bother me too much, but it felt like she didn't put any thought whatsoever into it and got it as an afterthought.

This really hurt me and I want to voice this, but I'm feel like I am being entitled and spoiled. Every time I look at the pillow it makes pisses me off and I just want to get rid of it.

Plumbing issues, cabinet cracks, drawer stuck, doorbell burnt, etc. I have to deal with it, calling warranty, setting up appointments then conveying the results to my parents. To be honest, it's rather annoying that it became my responsibility. Now, there's a leaking problem, but me and my younger sibling are going on vacation next week, so I asked my mom who the technician should call when I am not around (hoping she would say my aunt or my cousin who lives nearby). Nope, she replied, ""You, who else, does your parent speak English to you?"" That sarcastic attitude ticked me off. I responded, ""when you purchased the house, did you not think about the responsibilities afterward?"" To which she said, ""If I had known both of you don't want to take care of the house, then I wouldn't have bought it.""

I had this thought while chilling with my boyfriend so I texted my friend, who helped me dye my hair last time, and asked if she thought I could dye it with the amount I had left. 

My boyfriend saw the texts and immediately shut down. He gave me a weird look so I asked him what’s up? He never gave me a vocal response just moved his head in the direction of my phone. I tried to ask why he thought it was a big deal but he just stayed quiet. I gave up and just went to scroll on my phone. About 20 minutes later he gets up to got upstairs to the game room and I ask him if we are going to talk about what happened. He said no but only after I asked him three times.

Recently on my brothers ex wife’s side of the family, so Pauline’s biological mother’s family, there was a sudden and very tragic death. This family member that passed left behind a wife and a school aged child. 

Over the years Pauline in particular has been very close with this woman who is now a widow, almost like a second mother if not even closer to her than her own biological mother. 

Pauline has now decided that she doesn’t want to go home to her mother’s family for Thanksgiving because it would make her sad to be around everyone mourning the loss. So she has decided to go to a friends house so she won’t have to deal with the sadness. We live across the country so coming here isn’t an easy option for her.

She let the widow know that she was still dealing with the loss and didn’t want to go to their thanksgiving because it would make her sad so she would be going to a friends house. Of course, this has upset the widow as well as other family members who think that she is trying to avoid the family who is still mourning the recent loss because she doesn’t want their sadness to bum out her holiday rather then be present and supportive during a difficult time.

When my brother told me about all of this and I believe he was looking for support for his daughter. However, I agreed with his ex wife’s family that she was being selfish not wanting the ‘sad vibes’ of the family to ruin her thanksgiving. I told him that many things can make thanksgiving sad including not have a father or husband to spend it with and then having family members you though cared about you not show up because they don’t want your sadness to bum them out.

My brother is now very upset with me and demanding an apology. So I’m wondering AITA for telling my brother that I think his daughter is behaving selfishly should I have just agreed with him?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4803637,public,top,self,AITA for telling my brother his daughter is selfish for avoiding mourning family,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyo3xb/aita_for_telling_my_brother_his_daughter_is/,all_ads,6,,,

Today it was pretty intense and came out if no where. We were having a good time, and then my boyfriend jokingly kept calling me stupid. He calls me names all the time as a joke (e.g. stupid, fat, ugly, etc.) And while I know he's joking most the time, it still messes with my self-esteem because he rarely says anything nice to me. Maybe like once every two weeks or less. I've told him that the names get to me, but he tells me he's only kidding and I need to get over it. He also always says I'm too sensitive because I'm an ""IPad Kid"" and I barely pay any attention to him. I'm 23, but I work in a high stress and highly sociable job. I'm extroverted, but my social battery will run dry at the end of the day and usually when I get home I just want to be left alone and play video games or watch things on my phone. He sometimes tries to spend time with me, but will usually try to cuddle in ways that are uncomfortable to me. I always tell him, and he's gets upset and leaves, telling me that all I care about is my phone and I watch the same two videos everyday. So the argument basically followed everything up above once again as I was driving home from breakfast. I also messed uo saying the word self-esteem (I have a bit of a lisp from an overbite) and he mocked me for it. I told him if he has nothing nice to say, don't talk to me. I later tried to go up to him and socialize only to be told that I'm a bitch a to fuck off. He also discovered our rabbits eating their new bed I bought them and when I told him not to put the bed back in the room they stay in, he threw it in there and said ""go get it yourself bitch"".
I've tried to go up to him and socialize and fix things but he tells me to fuck off. He's unplugged the internet to annoy me, and honestly I'm just so tired.

A bunch of us are staying with my grandparents right now. We're doing a combined family reunion and Thanksgiving thing. My sister and I are in bunk beds in our dad's childhood bedroom, lol.

I'm going to give the exact figures, for full transparency. My grandparents have a really powerful sound system. They usually have it at 20, which is insanely loud, to me (they are HoH). 13 is the perfect volume on their TV (imo) usually. Last night, around eleven, I wanted to watch TV. Since the house was dead quiet, I turned it down to eight when I turned the TV on.

My sister came out and said the TV was too loud and woke her up. I said I would turn it down. I turned it down to five, which was pretty quiet. I was confident no one would hear it. Ten minutes later my sister came out and said the TV was keeping her up. I said I'd turn it down again. I turned it down to four and could still hear, although it was so quiet the wind outside would drown out the occasional dialogue, and it wasn't windy outside.

My sister came out again and told me I was keeping her awake. I sighed and expressed doubt. I said her voice, and she wasn't being loud, was twice as loud as the TV. If I turned it down to three I wouldn't hear anything. I acknowledge my sister has good hearing, but she isn't an X-Man. No way she heard that TV.

She said if she didn't hear it, how did she know I was watching it. I said because I'm still out here, so she knows I must be. She asked why she would lie about hearing the TV. I said I didn't know. Finally, I said I would turn the closed captioning on and watch with no volume, but I didn't want to hear another peep out of her the rest of the night, or I'm turning it back on to the quiet volume.

She called me an asshole and went to bed. True to my word, I kept the volume off. This morning she was in a bad mood at breakfast and glared at me. I think she's having trouble sleeping because of the small bunk bed and just chose me as the outlet for her frustration, but was I being an asshole by watching TV with the volume on (quietly) at a late hour?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4803631,public,top,self,AITA for watching television at night?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyo1kw/aita_for_watching_television_at_night/,all_ads,6,,,

I am aware of how wired the title sound so let me explain

I recently met a new friend, she has switched school and is now in my class.

At the beginning everything was alright, she was nice, funny, polite and overall a great friend.

At least until a week ago, she came out to me as a lesbian, alright no problems my best friend is a lesbian too I supported her. But since then she begin to change, every time she hear me talk about my boyfriend, even if it’s not to her she start going on a rant about how gay couple are better and straight people are gross, which rude.

I started distancing myself from her and my friends have notice and asked me why, I told them.

Now my group of close friends are kind of popular in my high school so when I told them they decided to tell other people too. Word got around and now about half of the school know, and no one will talk to her.

She found out that I told people about how she talk and has started harassing me, yelling at me at school, texting mean things and stuff like that.

I don’t fell like I did anything worng but like I said in my last post (if anyone even saw it) I tend to not feel guilty about almost anything, so I need to know.

As for some background: My parents, mostly my dad, are very controlling. They are supporting me through college and won't let me move out at least until I graduate and get a stable job. I'll be done with school in like 3 weeks and I have a job lined up but I already know my dad is going to do everything he can to make me stay home because he wants me to work for him with his paint and body side hustle.

Anyway, my dad disagrees with tattoos, I knew he wouldn't approve of tattoos and I have a lot of them. They are all hidden though, small ones and most of them are on my torso. I like tattoos, they are a really cool art form to me, that's why i get them. And i havent told my dad about any of them because I know he would get mad.

Recently, he found out about a few of them, and he found out about one on my sternum. And now I legit feel like he hates my guts. When he found out he told me that I was raised better than this, I know better, I'm a bad person making bad decisions, I'm an idiot for getting tattooed on my chest, I'm a disappointment. And honestly, I expected to get chewed up, the whole reason I never told him about the tattoos in the first place. He thinks I got them because I disrespect him, even though they have nothing to do with him, I got them to make me happy.

So now, I am avoiding him. I get up early and leave and stay out late or lock myself in my room because every time he sees me he looks at me with such hate and disgust and tells me how much of a disappointment I am. He tells me that I don't care about him and that I am ruining the family, everything is my fault. Literally every time he looks at me or when we're in the same room.

There is no use in trying to have a conversation with my dad. Whenever we ""talk"" he tells me that I don't care or have no respect. He wont let me apologize. He just shuts me up and says that there's nothing I can do to make things better. That I am just being even more disrespectful for arguing even though I'm trying to defend myself and tell the truth. I just have to sit there and take the insults. This is how all of these disagreements have been my whole life.

I feel terrible, I am constantly in emotional pain and have a constant frog in my throat all the time that makes me feel nauseous. I can't stop crying.
