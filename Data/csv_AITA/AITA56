My roommates (m&amp;f) have a habit of leaving the front door of our apartment unlocked and unattended. I've mentioned many times it makes me uncomfortable unless someone is in the common area hanging out or something. If they're in the common area, I don't care.
My TV is out there for everyone to use. But with the door being unlocked, I have felt unsafe with it since I can't afford to replace it. The door being unlocked has happened so many times, and I finally told them that if it keeps happening, I'm going to have to move my TV into my room to have my own peace of mind. 
Since I told them that, it happened a good couple more times and I kept thinking to myself ""you know, it's daytime, they're getting used to it, one more chance,"" and I'd just locked the door and carry on. 
The issue came when last night, everyone was in there rooms, I couldn't sleep. I got up around 4am to go get water. I walk into the living room (no one in it), and the door is unlocked. It was 4am. Way different then daytime. And that was my last straw. I immediately moved the TV into my room and didn't say anything. 
When asked the next day, I said ""oh the door was unlocked at 4am and no one was in here, so I felt safer with it in my room from now on."" And there was some arguing saying it wasn't when I know it was, because I locked it afterwards, and then silent treatment.
And I feel guilty because I don't want them to hate me, but I couldn't keep having my boundaries disrespected, as I've respected all of their's, and I don't feel safe having it at risk anymore. I feel like it was my right, and it's not even to punish anyone, it's just to protect my thing that I worked hard to purchase.

We both work full time. I do commercial construction. My wife is a sales manager at a popular make up store. I go to trade school class twice a week, 2-3 hours per night. My work schedule is 7a4p.

We typically do a good job of splitting the household chores. I’m in charge of feeding our 3 animals in the morning and walking the dog before and after work, and before bed. I clean the cat litter, cook 5 days of the week (the other 2 nights either we eat out or she cooks), and do 90% of our grocery/household shopping.

We do our own laundry, but take turns doing towels, blankets, etc. She helps with the dishes when I ask. She dusts and does random chores.

She really hates grocery shopping, so I assume the role. I don’t enjoy it, but I do it. As for cooking, I do have dietary restrictions (GERD), so I understand completely why she doesn’t leap at the chance to cook. However, the food I buy for meals is always something I can eat, and there are times when I even make her something special in addition to what I make for myself. 

My dilemma is this: when I ask her to cook on a weekend that she has off as I can be more flexible with meal times, because I’m tired from cooking all week from a physically demanding job (I also have RA and though it’s usually well-controlled, I do get flare ups if I overexert myself during the week), it almost always becomes an issue.

I'm a 24-year law student.

I got out of a 4 year relationship in August. I knew this girl since I was 12, and we grew up with one another. She chased me for a long while, but out age gap (a year and a half) was awkward for me since we were about 3 grades apart as children. I had a very bad track record with dating, and knew that she was a virgin, inexperienced, etc. I did not want to have anything to do with her until I knew I was in a good enough space to do her right by her, and be the person she deserved. We went on a few dates, and became official in 2018. I thought this was going to be my last relationship. I struggled by her side a lot. She had to drop out of school for a bit because of her grades and went through a depressive phase. I was there for her, and never complained about anything she needed.

We got to a point where she just stopped putting in effort. I knew she needed the love I could provide for her more than I needed it from her, and it caused our downfall. I got angry a lot because I could not comprehend why she wouldn't put in effort anymore. I did not like who I became, either. We broke up, and it was the hardest decision I ever had to make for myself. 

I found out she started sleeping with a few guys just a week after we broke up. I felt emasculated and that I was less than dirt. I'm currently going to therapy to fight my own demons and become better mentally. I started going to the gym and I think I look better but I’m still grinding.

I got on a few dating apps to find a FWB and honestly? I can’t do that. I had a single hookup and didn’t feel great afterwards because I wasn’t in love. I'm fairly certain I'm demisexual and can only really attach to someone intimately before considering sleeping with them.

I’ve been on dates before and there wasn’t much of a spark there. This new girl feels different. She ticks off so many of my boxes in what I look for in a partner. Things are still new so I’m not getting my hopes up, but we enjoyed one another’s company and the fact that this could turn into something real is a bit scary. 

I have a lot of healing left to do, but I’m also excited? I’m concerned about being an AH to this new girl, but I was upfront about my past and that hasn’t seemed to change anything. I’m also concerned if I’d be disrespectful to my ex by getting into something relatively quickly after the breakup. I’m not trying to force anything to happen, but we have a tight-knit cultural community so I’m sure that she’d find out about it fairly quickly. 

I just want to be happy, but I also don’t want to be an AH.

about 5 months into our relationship my boyfriend lied to me about some job he wanted. he said it was a friend who said he should apply but it turns out it was an old fwb he had and for the first 3 months of our relationship he had lied about being in a relationship with me to this girl and she had very obvious feelings for him. he didnt tell me and he thought he would get away with getting this job from her but i found out and it hurt me deeply. 

i was going to break up with him then but he told me he was going to block the girl and not take the job. he asked my opinion and i agreed that if he didnt accept the job then it would be okay. 

he did neither. about a month ago i found out he was still texting this girl and again, we almost broke up but he blocked her in front of me and said he would go to therapy. but finally, a couple weeks after i caught him texting her, he quit his job (5ish months after he initially promised he would)

he wanted to start finding a new job and he asked what i thought and i told him honestly that i dont really want him working at the moment and he agreed and then today he told me he accepted a new job. it was really upsetting for me because this was now the second time he asked my opinion on him getting a job and then went exactly against what i said again. 

he’s gotten other jobs that i haven’t said a word about so i’m not against him working i just didnt think it would be smart for him to work while he needs to study (he goes to a very hard school and he’s failing a lot of his classes) but it turned into a fight and now we’re talking about breaking up again. 

also dont ask why i havent broken up with him sooner. i’m dumb

Needless to say we both realized that we are awful to each other and decided it would be best to split. She living in out shared apartment for a bit before moving to a new place with her new partner (27M) and I moved in my new partner (23F). During this divide we separated items and came to an agreement to split the deposit which I would reimburse her for some of it since she was moving out. (This is also a $1500 deposit so a decent amount to split)

Fast forward a few months and they want the money. In the course of those months I had to clean some of the stuff left behind and deliver to their family, she didn’t pay the utilities the last month, left a dye stain in the tub unremovable, and all throughout our relationship and especially with us living together I paid for most things (I paid around 70 percent of the bills since I made 22 an hour full time and she made 16 and hour but refused to work full time despite many arguments needing her help and her calling me greedy.) After that and the consultation from my friends and family saying not to pay her I said I would stick to my work but reduce the amount to a decent amount that covered all she is due to $500 a $250 decrease. I send the money and they want to penny pinch every reason stated and more. So I said give me a day and I will tally everything down. However I have more in plan.

Her new bf is also her supervisor which had a crush on her the longest time (i can go into more backstory but rn unimportant) and she got together with him despite it being company taboo. I have kept my mouth shut but they penny pinching and way they approached it is my snapping point so tomorrow I am giving them a summary of expenses she incurred over our 6 year time together and reporting them to their main manager.

In fact, simply ingesting certain bacteria can result in much more than diarrhea and vomiting (""food poisoning""). If you look online, you'll see that ""While many of us associate E. coli with food poisoning, you can also get pneumonia and urinary tract infections from different types of the bacteria."" (WebMD)

This is why most of us would never use the same sponge for cleaning our dishes AND cleaning the highly-nasty insides of our sinks. However, my boyfriend routinely uses the same sponge for both tasks and gets very cranky at me for objecting. Apparently, he doesn't share my concern, and he feels ""criticized"" if I express my unhappiness about the fact that he keeps ignoring my pleas to use separate sponges for separate tasks. I've tried everything. I replace sponges constantly. I bought a special sponge holder for the dish sponge. I've tried reasoning with him. I've asked him to respect my fear of illness, infection, and death  He ignores all of it. 

Tonight, I re-washed a pot with the correct sponge after he had used the foul sink-sponge, and he got nasty about it. For some reason, he doesn't think this is a big deal. I haven't yet mentioned the remaining aspect of his habit that also bothers me: he uses the sink-cleaning sponge to clean other surfaces like the stovetop or counters, which means that he regularly sprays toxic chemicals (intended for heavy-duty cleaning), uses the sponge to scrub and wipe those cleansers, and then uses that same sponge on the dishes. I consider this disgusting and dangerous. Not only do I want to avoid eating all kinds of bacteria that can get me, my boyfriend, and our children incredibly sick, but I also don't want to be eating cancer-causing, multi-surface chemicals. And yet, he thinks it's no big deal to take the same sponge that he uses to wipe down the sink after preparing raw seafood/poultry, that he stuffs down the drain to clean gross residue, and that he uses with chemicals containing benzene and ALSO use it to wash the dishes on which we eat our meals.

 My older brother by 6 years started in fights with my parents when I was 5. The quantity and severity of the fights has changed over time but it’s ranged from daily to once a month and from mild disagreements to top of the lungs, door slamming, property destroying altercations. On several instances my brother has actually grabbed me and held me down. And it’s not like I have to really piss him off for this to happen. Any slight thing could set him off. Naturally, I have been wanting to live in an older brother free house for a while.

When he got back from his year abroad and went to college out of state, he became too depressed to stay in college and had to come home after just a few months. This pissed me off, I was told by my parents I would never have to live with him  again. 

Next, my parents’ plan was to get him a therapist and good medications and when he was ready, to send him back to college. At this point the fights were just as bad as ever. 

He didn’t get any better but my parents told me that they would buy him an apartment where he would stay until he could return to college in the fall. However, he became too depressed to live on his own. 

This was also when his problems with alcohol abuse started. Anytime my parents would by alcohol, he would get blackout drunk. He wasn’t addicted, he just showed signs. He also denied that he had a problem. 

 In the spring of 2022, he started working a job that my mom had gotten him through her work. (Massive fights still occurring every week mostly between my dad and him). 

In early September, he got extremely drunk and puked all over our very nice and expensive couch. My parents bought a new couch and he didn’t receive any monetary punishment(or any punishment whatsoever)  this would be the first time that I really started feeling like my parents were not doing enough.

Next was the event that pushed everything over the top, my brother physically grabbed me and held me to the ground. Admittedly, I did make a rude comment about his weight and apologized. 

This traumatized me so I ended up staying at my grandparents house until…

The next plan was that he would go on a ~60 day trip to Europe (funded by himself) When he would come back he would live in an apartment paid for by my parents. He ended up coming back after just over a week b/c he was too depressed and stayed in an airbnb with my dad. (Paid for by my parents)When they were home picking up stuff they had a big screaming match. 


Now he’s doing a ketamine treatment. He’s living at home and supposed to be moving into an apartment(paid for by my parents). This is now the fifth time that I have been promised that he would never live at home again, only for him to move back in. 

Do you notice a pattern here?

It was all being planned by his friends and I was part of the group planning the itinerary. We had zoom calls, meet ups, etc. I had every intention to go and to support my brother. 

His fiancé Ella (29F) then planned her bachelorette party. Prior to sending out invitations, Ella called me for advice about her trip. Ella said she knew this was upset my family(my family is very close), but my sister will not be invited as she is going with her friends and not a family trip. I was kind of shocked because my sister was a BACHELORETTE for the wedding….so how can you not invite her… 

My mom did pressure Ella to make my sister a bachelorette because she always wanted to be a one and has no sisters. Honestly, many people dislike my sister so thats why my mom will make sure she’s always included in plans. Ella went on to explain how she regrets allowing my mom to “guilt and bully” her into making my sister a bachelorette, but she can still make her trip right by inviting her closest friends. I was floored. How incredibly rude to do to the family you’re marrying into? Ella also explained since their wedding is non-traditional, titles, roles, etc did not matter. She kept defending her “right” to invite who she wants to her trip and said she didn’t invite her own sister because they also do not have a close relationship. I still felt like my sister should be going because she has known her for 8 years. Ella even said my sister would RUIN her trip based off past experiences. Which I will admit she has ruined a few nights out with her drinking. But she is FAMILY.

I decide to tell my parents what happened. My mother was devastated and began crying that her daughter wasn’t invited. This into a lengthy fight with my family towards my brother because they wanted to convince him to change Ella’s mind. She was pretty fucking set on her decision. So I dropped out of his trip.

I told Brian I obviously can’t go on his trip since our sister is clearly being left out. If I go and she doesn’t, it would absolutely DEVASTATE my family. I could not have long term resent with my family so I chose to skip it and protect my family. 

I am writing now because the bachelor trip was months ago but my relationship with my brother and Ella has not recovered. We used to hang out on weekends but clearly we don’t speak anymore. Ella apparently feels I betrayed her trust by telling my parents about our phone call. She has been distant ever since this happened. I was just doing right by my family. I had no issues with her but did not agree with my sister being left out. 

My family is perfectly fine that I skipped the trip and I was able to support my sister. During the wedding my mom even tried to talk to Ella about this and ask she let everything go, but I don’t know what happened with that.

Colby has been unemployed for almost 2 and a half years now but he always promised me that ""he'll pay me back when he finds a job"" and he always told me that he ""appreciates"" the fact that I'm working hard at my job to ""provide for myself and him."" But it's been 2 and a half years since he last had a job, and everyday all he does is go to the gym, go out with his friends or when he's at home he just lies around and plays video games.

I brought up his lack of contribution a while back and we got into a heated argument. He later apologized and said that he actually got a side job and just forgot to tell me and that he wants to treat me to a nice dinner date as a thank you for being the most amazing girlfriend and in celebration of our 3 year anniversary that was coming up.

So yesterday, we decided to celebrate our 3 year anniversary at a high end restaurant. Everything was going smoothly and we were having a great time until the waiter came and gave us our bill. My boyfriend said he forgot his wallet in his car and told me he'll be right back. Well I waited for almost an hour and tried calling him but there was no answer so I just paid the bill myself and took an uber home.

Later that night I called my boyfriend and he said he was sorry and that something ""came up"" and he just left. This wasn't the first time he's done this, so I told him that I feel like I was being used and that it was over. I threw all his things out of my apartment and refused to let him come back in that night.

3 children together and Me and my husband (37M )

found out I was infertile. This was a huge shock on

better off with her own kind"" or ""Aren't you guys

thanksgiving and hung out in the backyard. I was

started to make small talk. I was kinda of confused

my daughter. As she was talking she mentioned if I
ever thought about giving my daughter back up and
getting a white child. I was completely taken aback
and replied calling her a fucking bitch and started to
get my stuff to leave. That's when she stood up and
said ""her kind is a disgrace and a ching Chong like
her doesn't belong in this family"" I don't know why

TW: mentions of DID. 
This is probably going to be long and complicated, but I will do my best to ensure this makes sense while also being sensible. I (22F) met my boyfriend Alex (23M) at a PTSD support group, It’s now been six months of us being together. Early on in our relationship, Alex shared with me that he has DID. For anyone who doesn’t know, DID is dissociative identity disorder, which many people incorrectly refer to as “multiple personality disorder”. He explained to me that he, Alex, is the dominant alter. That means Alex is the one who is mostly at front. The Host, Bren (the FIRST person) doesn’t really front very often. I never really got to know him as well as I knew Alex and the others, I’ve met most of his alters and I get along pretty well with most of them. 

Bren has been fronting progressively more. As a result of this, I’ve been getting to know him better, as a lot of the time the switch would happen when Alex and I were spending time together, there were nights we’re he would be fronting for hours and hours and we’d spend the entire time talking and laughing together. A few nights ago, Bren fronted while I was with Alex again. Alex and I had dinner plans, but Bren suggested that we stay in and bake cookies together until Alex returns. It ended up being another one of those nights where we spent hours and hours together. At one point, Bren and I were talking about his experience in school and he told me why he never fronts as much. Bren told me he has never had a real friend until me, but then he also told me that he has never been in love before… until me. 

I was caught off guard, I wasn’t sure what to say for a second so i just didn’t say anything. That’s when Bren leaned in and kissed me. Bren was kissing me. I tried to mentally process what to do, but it just kept going and going. The night ended with Bren and I falling asleep on the couch. We never did anything other than make out, i know doesn’t change much.. but Bren has the same lips that Alex has. 

I knew I wouldn’t be able to lie or hide this from him, so I ended up telling Alex everything. He was heartbroken. He told me that he’s been cheated on before but that this was the ultimate betrayal. I am so confused and lost and I feel awful because I know this is wrong but some part of me feels like it also could not be. He told me he needed to process without me.  

This isn’t your typical cheating situation and the worst part is that there is no one other than Alex or Bren who I could talk to that would TRULY understand this kind of thing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lose either of them. But i also don’t think this is a run of the mill cheating situation, so as awful as i feel, i also I believe I deserve a second chance..

and while doing an internship there i found a puppy stranded in the woods right next to the main building so I did what every normal person would do and crawled through spiky flowers and a uneven terrain to save the puppy which would not stop crying because he was all alone. The said puppy went to an organization right next to my university, and they asked, well before there are any applications to adopt would you like to be the first one to stay with the puppy? 
I replied that i needed to talk to my parents because A I still live with them and B I have a cat

So when I got home i spoke to my dad asking about it and he said well you could bring any animal home as long as you take care of them.

Later that same day I spoke to my mom and she said she wouldn’t mind but to sort of get a grip on the fact that we have a cat and our cat wouldn’t like to share his home with another animal especially with it being a male puppy. If it were a girl kitten it would be perfect.

So I gave it some thought and on the next day i went to the organization and I told them that i wouldn’t keep the dog, because of my cat at home and because i’d be afraid they wouldn’t get along (I told one of my friends about finding the puppy and he adopted him so happy ending for him)

Fast forward a couple weeks and I see someone from the organization and they tell me they found a litter of kittens and I asked, is there a girl to keep my cat company? they said yes, can i go see her? they also said yes, so after seeing her i was terrorized because someone dumped them on a corner of the street, and burned their paws and whiskers, I’ve never seen a kitten so scared and terrified of humans as her and her brothers and in a blink of a second I made the decision to sign the papers and bring her home.

She was scared of my cat because she is a kitten but my cat is a persian and he doesn’t hurt a fly. And since bringing her yesterday they actually get along pretty fine. (My cat is neutered)

When my mom arrived home she loved her, like she instantly said that it was a perfect addition to our home, since our cat is lonely, young and some probably needed some company to play.

My dad on the other hand didn’t like it, when he got home the first thing he said was “what is this sh*t?”
and after I recalled his words he said “we dont need another mouth to feed, nor sand to poop nor vaccines to take care of this stray kitten” 

I replied that i would pay for everything that she needed and any damages she might do since she’s still a baby.

My father said to get rid of her or he will, and I replied do it, its not like im close to finish university and leaving this house and by doing that I’ll ignore you for a long time like you you’re ignoring my request of keeping her until im out of here.

My hubby (M75) and I (F57) have been married for nearly 30 years (together for 32).  He was divorced when we met. 

Over 7 years ago we had a falling out with his youngest.  The prior year her kids went to her maternal grandparents with their aunt L (hubby’s oldest).  The grandfather had abused my hubby’s ex and two of her siblings when they were younger.  It went on for years and the grandmother turned a blind eye to it.  While they were there, my hubby’s oldest went outside with the grandmother and when they came back in, grandpa was holding the 3-year-old by the head shaking him and yelling at him.  L told her mother about it and they decided not to tell the boy’s mother, K.  The following year, L did tell my hubby about it and swore him to secrecy.  He told me though.  K was going to take the kids to visit the same grandparents the following day and I thought K should know what happened as not to leave the kids alone with the grandfather.  Hubby did nothing,  so I told her.  She thanked me profusely.

L and her mother were furious that their secret was out.  K confronted her mom and asked why she would keep such a thing from her and her mom cried and blamed me for telling.  Next thing I know, K is mad at me and won’t talk to me.  She gave her dad an ultimatum…her or me.  L gave him the same one.  Since my hubby didn’t divorce me, they decided that he picked me over them.  We have tried several times to end this, but they are not receptive.  Even hubby’s son and sister have sided with them.  His mother has too and said that it wasn’t “my place” to tell.  Maybe, maybe not.  But I don’t keep those kind of secrets.  For anyone.
Flash forward to now.  L and K are still unwilling to give up the drama.  My hubby was diagnosed with cancer 8 months ago.  He had major surgery 7 months ago and has been doing chemo for the last 6 months.  L and K have not called him at all.  C came back to the state to go to L’s daughter’s graduation 2 weeks after hubby’s surgery.  No phone call.  No visit.  K was back last weekend.  No call.  No visit.  His own mother hasn’t seen him since we told her about the cancer seven months ago.

AITA for telling K to keep a close eye on her child during her visit to the abusing grandparents?  Do people keep these kinds of secrets even though a child could end up getting hurt?  Just to protect the abuser?

To quote I texted her; 


•I do not appreciate you putting the cart on top of my jackets. Yes I should've hung them up but I was in a bit of a rush this morning. 
You insisted we buy the little shopping cart and split the payment. 
You had all your stuff from your car piled in there while your parents got you your winter tires. 
I placed it back in pretty much the same place that it was in when I came back to the apparent before I had to run out again and head to work. 
I placed it there since I did not bring all of your things out; just what was trapped underneath your jumper cables (that I could not easily bring out) when I brought you your jumper cables to help start your car this morning. 
I placed it open there when I came back before leaving because since you needed it to bring everything in; I figured you would need it to bring the rest back out. 
Furthermore on the point of helping you jumpstart your car this morning. I especially do not appreciate you kicking my car (on the bumper which I am currently holding together with duct tape seeing as i am tight on my finances) and pounding on my windows and you ignoring me when I asked for a thumbs up or a thumbs down when I asked if it started or not. And then I do not appreciate you absolutely ignoring me once you had your car running. 
I have told you this before but I'm not an expert on cars. Literally I told you that the last time you needed help jumping your car. I don't know what your angry pantomiming means. 
Yes it took a few minutes (10-ish) for me to come out; but as I told you when I picked up your call; I was going to be a few minutes. I was using the bathroom!
I am currently VERY angry/disappointed/mad at you. Please. Give me a bit of space and time to calm down.•

I was running on fumes from working customer service all day so I might’ve snapped at her for being the last straw. 

My girlfriend works from home and has the exact same hours every day but my schedule changes literally every week. We are both neurodivergent and have been living together for going on 2 years now. This is not the first time we have gotten angry at each other but it’s the first time that I vent texted it to her as we usually talk it out after she gets off work or when comes out for dinner and before I go to bed.

(not litteral brother but I treat him as such) We would play games including those teamwork ones or we would get in a call. He would invite his girlfriend (his wife in the online world, ik it's stupid but I respect them) in calls or games but she's only been able to enter our calls and during that, she would usually be studying. 

When my friend leaves the call and I'm left with her, she asks me stuff that makes me question is my friend is treating her right. I notice is her voice that she gets jealous but of course won't just assume that. 

The recent conversation we had, before me and brother would hop in a game (it's complex one so we need full attention) , he went afk and I was left with his gf in the call. She asked me 'how to get his attention/ how to entertain him'. I got concerned why she would ask me that so I told her what I knew and then asked her is she's alright with my brother but she said she's just curious. I didn't want to be nosey so I just shut it. The same day, I was playing the game with my friend and she joined the call and asked for him. But he told her to wait. I insisted that he should join her and I was gonna leave anyways but he told me he will after the game which took us about 10 mins. 

I told him that his girl was asking me those questions and he jokingly said it's weird that I'm being asked how to please him but I said I was serious and it's probably him not giving her attention (in my eyes) but I didn't want to assume that.

A few months ago tho, me and my other very trusted friends exchanged account passwords (yes we trust each other that much) but fortunately I didn't know my password so my friend just gave me his. I told him that I deleted from my phone after but seeing how his girlfriend is acting strange around me, I decided not to. I wanted to check their conversations but I feel like I am violating them. I feel guilty for even having the account. I was just worried about them even if I shouldn't be especially they have been together for a year. 

I understand that it is a violation of their privacy but I'm just trying to make sure my friend is not doing something stupid especially that I have problems with attention from my last relationship. His girlfriend is like a sister to me except that we don't talk that much so I'm just straight up concerned for the questions she gave me.

Backstory: I am F (20) who just got out of a domestic violence relationship that I was in for a total of 3 years. My ex SO M (20) was extraordinarily narcissistic and emotionally manipulative to the point where I ended up getting hit and filing a police report. The hit was an “accident” but there were no apologies made, or even a simple “Are you okay?” Instead the argument continued and our relationship finally hit rock bottom. He left the apartment but demanded that I leave as well so he can post his new supply up. He took the car in said situation, and I have not driven in over 2 months because I simply have not even been able to see the car or get my things out of it. 

So, I’ve finally moved out with my cats and gotten a new apartment. Everything was in my name already, not theirs, so it was pretty easy to swap over. Here’s the kicker: we own a car together. He wants to sell it and get another one and give me whatever money is left (there’s not going to be any, have you seen the used car market?). After all the shit he has put me through, I’m voting no on that one. I paid a down payment. 

Best case scenarios are 

1: I call the cops and tell them the car is stolen since I am the primary and he is the secondary and my name is on the registration as well. Tags are in my name, so I can get the car impounded, then get it out and get it rekeyed. 

2: I wait until nightfall to get the car and go get it rekeyed since I still have my keys, and then change the insurance to my name and never deal with him again.

My (30F) ex-boyfriend (25M) is currently living with me. He had moved in with me but it wasn’t working out so we broke up and he is expected to move out on the 12th. It been horrible to say the least. I only have a twin bed currently and he never got a bed after moving in so he has been sleeping on the floor in my room on a bunch of heavy blankets so it’s tolerable. I had reminded him that he needed to buy a bed but he never got around to it. I had been letting him sleep in mine here and there but he is a pretty big guy and my dog also sleeps with me so it has been pretty unbearable for me. 

I have a 2-year old dachshund. He is mostly potty trained but tends to sometimes mark his territory on clothing and blankets only if they are left on the floor. I have tried to train him not to do this but his breed is known for being extremely stubborn. It’s gotten better but not perfect. I take him out before I leave for work (around 8AM) and when I get back home (around 2PM). I had told him about this prior to moving in, and reminded him a few times but within a couple of weeks, he left the door open and the blankets on the floor and my dog peed on his bed. He was understandably pissed and I offered to wash and pay for all the blankets. It ended up being around 30 dollars to wash. 

After that, I reminded him a bunch of times and had picked up his blankets and closed the door numerous times. Yesterday, I was out with my mom for my birthday and he texts me after getting home saying, “Where am I going to sleep? There is piss all over my blankets and there is stuff all over your bed?” (I had done a load of laundry and it was on my bed). I was pretty frustrated and just replied “Wash them?” It led to a huge fight where he said it was my dog and my responsibility to make sure he didn’t pee on his blankets to which I said that I took care of it the last time but I had reminded him many times to take them off the floor and close the door.

Just six months ago my precious baby was born. Im very blessed with the people around me that’re helping us along the way. Especially my parents-in-law that live very close by. My MIL is very invested in the new baby and babysits every now and then. She wanted to be a grandma for quite some time now and is very very excited the time has finally come. I was always also very excited about their excitement. I felt that my baby was so loved already. 

But here’s the thing. She is a bit too excited and invested. She sees the baby about once a week. We drop him off and she babysits or we visit their house with the baby. Either way she is always allll up in our business. Commenting on how I feed him, on how I dress him, on how I engage with him. Its so mentally draining.

I am the youngest of 5 children (oldest to youngest: S, B, S, B, Me) and growing up, I never had an issue with children who were younger than me.  I’ve never been one to want to be the center of attention which is surprisingly different for being the youngest.  I’m fairly antisocial so I don’t like talking to people especially my extended family.

As stated before, my family is very family oriented.  My oldest brother was the first to get married (in 2012 I think) and just recently announced he and his wife are expecting their first child over Thanksgiving weekend.  I’m not too nervous about their kid because I don’t see them quite as often as I do my sister who already has 2 kids.

My sister (not the oldest) got married in 2015 to an amazing guy who makes her very happy and they waited until 2019 to start having kids.  At first, I was really excited to be an uncle.  Due to some religious obligations, I didn’t get to see her kids in person for 2 years.  She gave birth to her first child right after I left for those obligations and gave birth to her second child a couple of months before I got back.  Because of legal reasons (the church not wanting to get in trouble), everyone under those religious obligations have to be extremely careful around children.  During which obligations, I began to just avoid children entirely so I wouldn’t get in any legal trouble.  

When I got back from these religious obligations, I began to experience something I didn’t expect.  I don’t know if there’s a specific name for it, but basically, I’m deathly afraid of being left alone with children.  My sister on occasion has asked me to babysit for her but I continued to express to her that I can’t do that.  My family have become completely obsessed with her kids and think that I was being rude by not helping her, but it hasn’t just been during those instances that I don’t want to be around her kids.  It used to be mostly a fear of doing something wrong that would get me in trouble, but I feel it’s more evolved into an annoyance because my family are literally obsessed with these kids.  My oldest sister and parents spoil these kids like the world would end if they didn’t.  They talk about them nonstop and will stop what they’re doing if they get a recorded video of the kids from my other sister and her husband, just to watch the video, even if what they’re doing should take precedence.  

Like I said, I don’t like being the center of attention, which is why I’m not classifying this as jealousy, but rather an annoyance because they place these kids above everything, practically setting them on a pedestal and worshipping them.

As a gardener and forager, I eat a majority plant based diet, have dated a wide range of vegans, so I've got no issues with veganism unless it's tinged with obtuse self righteous classism. They tell me, ethical but they don't  harass others who do eat meat. They then proceed to talk shit about meat eaters. I thought it was a hilarious pivot but I wasn't annoyed. As I'm well aware of the climate impact of meat eating by society at large, I just added to the conversation (yes yes I know...while carving up meat for a holiday I only celebrate because I'm with family.) As I ate, they began commenting more and more about my choice to be a part time consumer of meat. I'd already explained myself so I just sorta laughed it off and said, well waste is terrible and that I planned on sharing the rest of the left overs with some neighbors. 

I guess, I should have never opened the conversation up because they brought it up a few more times as I was packing up food and it was causing heated discussions amongst other family. I just sorta vouched for everyone while not dismissing the environmental impacts. 

Anyway everyone is holding their sweet lil baby and I am too of course...REFRAINING from my usual jokes about eating their chubby lil thighs (baby hams are so cute), because I am certain the vegans would hate that. Then they say, ""you're so good with all the kids here, do you plan on getting pregnant and having children?"" 
I immediately, without hesitation say, ""Absolutely not, for me it's unethical to have kids when so many are still orphaned or are in foster care."" I'm one of 9 kids--it was terrible--we were in foster for a short period of time, it sucked for so many reasons. I would sooner adopt/foster. I get people want to continue their family line, or have a child that looks like them so thay they bond better and so on, and they can do that, but for me, it's a no, dawg. 

Anyway, everyone goes dead silent and my other sister in law, shouts, ""Dude you're such an asshole. You don't realize how important or hard it is to have your own kid!"" Then I get roasted, so my partner is too busy laughing to come to my defense.  And here I was thinking the vegans would be on my side about ethical actions and they pile on and say, ""You just said that because we're ethical vegans!"" I'd been backing those two up all night!

I used to have to protect him from my mom whenever she got mad and ended up being the target for abuse whenever she got mad or angry. 

This made me become a very loud and explosive kid, if I had something on my mind, I would say it. My brother on the other hand was the opposite, whenever someone asked him a question he would always turn to me to answer it for him. He was not independent in the slightest. I didn’t realize this was a problem until my therapist pointed it out and since then we’ve worked on him making decisions for himself.

Besides this, he has also said that he wishes he would stay young forever, which concerned our therapist. Eventually a few sessions later the topic of sex and romance came up, I have had one girlfriend and one boyfriend in my life along with one crush. My brother on the other hand has never had a crush, ever. He isn't disgusted by sex but rather is disgusted by the thought of him having it with someone else- even before the abuse he had absolutely zero interest in romantic / sexual relationships. 

Later when I was sitting on the couch with him, I explained to him what being asexual and aromantic is. I told him everything I knew about it and made sure he knew his identity was completely up to him. I asked him if he felt that way, and he said yes. I was excited for him and happy he had found a label for himself that he was comfortable with, so we told our therapist about it. 

My brother has made it very clear to our therapist that he does not like talking about girlfriends or sex, yet he does it anyways. Our therapist then proceeded to say that he doesn't think my brother is aroace and that this is just a part of the whole ’wanting to stay young’ thing. Which is fine, whatever. He can think what he wants to think. But what I have a problem with is him constantly and purposely bringing up the topic of sex and romance when my brother says he is uncomfortable and/or doesn't want to talk about it.

When I tell our therapist to change the subject he accuses me of trying to force labels on my brother, which I am not doing. My brother has made it very clear that he made this decision himself and does not seek validation or permission from me when it comes to labels or dating.

Since then our therapist has been treating my brothers identity as a problem and something that needs to be fixed, which we both find quite offensive and annoying.

Recently my roommate (23M) has started regularly putting a speaker outside my (22M) bedroom door playing the song Swedish Pagans by Sabaton on full blast. At first I was very confused and asked him to stop, to which he replied ""I thought you loved this song"" and just kept playing it.

He started texting the FULL lyrics of this song to me once every 10 minutes for a few days. After repeatedly asking him to stop I blocked his number. I tried confronting him multiple times about all of this and asking him what was up, to which he brushed it all off and said nothing was wrong.

Flash forward to last night, I make a big dinner and invite my friend over to eat with my roommate and I. We're all at the table about to start eating when my roommate pulls out his speaker and puts on Swedish Pagans on full volume. We kept asking him to stop or turn it down but he wouldn't. After a while I had to take the speaker from him and turn it off.

I asked him why he was doing this, and he finally said it was because I was humming the song too much. He said he counted 63 times that I hummed it. I didn't even realize this and told him I wished he would have just told me directly. He said that it should be ""common sense"" that I realize this is annoying. I told him I would stop humming or singing the song completely.

The next day, he keeps playing the song outside my room. I confront him about it and he said he wants to make me understand why it's so annoying that I kept humming this song around him.

I had a birthday party before that weak with some of my friends and with him. It was a group with 9 people (including me). He didn't know 2 of them.

The trip was going well until my daughter asked me for the last cupcake and I gave it to her. It turned into a big thing because my friend Olivia’s daughter saw her eating it and wanted one too but there were none left. 

Her daughter was crying because she couldn’t have a cupcake as it was late so we couldn’t get any more. This also caused the other kids to notice and a few of them were upset too. Olivia said I shouldn’t have given the cupcake to my daughter knowing there wasn’t enough left for the other children and that I should’ve at least checked to see if anybody else wanted it to be polite.

For me, that's when people make sounds when they eat, namely in the forms of lip smacking and talking with their mouths filled with food. Everyone in my family, besides me, makes sounds while eating, but they're also cacophonous and kind of disgusting while eating as well. They lip smack. They slurp really loudly. They drop their utensils in the bowl, rather than gently placing them down, resulting in a bunch of loud clanging. They talk with mouths filled with food, and they like to talk loudly, so you can see all of the mushy goop of food in their mouths. One of them has this habit where they have bits of food roll off onto their lip and just leave it there, unless someone points it out.

I've politely voiced that their behavior bothers me in the past, and they tried to stop, but they always come back to doing everything because it's most likely something they do without thinking. So, I'd decided to lean on the wise saying, ""You can't change others, but you can always put in the effort to try and change yourself."". The last thing I'd want is to openly offend them (especially on purpose), make them uncomfortable eating with me, or hurt their feelings, so I put in a lot of effort to try and accept it and not let it bother me. I've tried for several months now, but I can't, for the life of me, get all of this to stop bothering me. So, last night, I'd told them that I've tried time and time again to learn to be okay with it all, especially the lip smacking, but I couldn't, so I refuse to eat at the same dinner table as them.

The response was pretty negative and harsh, but I didn't expect them to take it well, anyways.

Myself and my partner only recently moved into our first place together a few months back. We both work pretty full-on, hectic jobs and the past few months have been absolute non-stop in terms of social life, new ventures and general workloads increasing. 

Both of our families live on opposites sides of the country, so for the past few years we have alternated between houses to try and keep it fair. Neither of us really like the travel (and neither of us really have great families so there is always some kind of tension or debacle each year so it gets stressful just thinking about it.) This year when it was brought up, I suggested we spend our first Christmas here and start our own traditions, seeing as its our first Christmas together in our own place. Plus both of our jobs have been manic lately so it'd be nice to just chill out and relax. (We're both on the edge of burnout.)

Surprisingly, they shot it down, stating that ""people don't really start having Christmas alone together till they have kids.""....?   wtf?

Now, I know they get to take two weeks solid off over the Christmas period, which is fine, they work hard at what they do. But I work in retail and I have to work between the Christmas and New years period, which means I really don't get a break. Work's been absolutely crazy lately, especially in the are I'm in, given the economy right now.  It's a flat-out job, both physically and mentally draining. (I love the job, but staffing issues have made it really stressful and problematic and I've been taking work home more and more just to get it done lately).

I though having a nice and relaxing, cosy holiday together would be nice but they just flat out said that they're not spending it here with just the two of us, that that was silly and they want to spend it either in theirs or my parents.

I'm tired. I am on the verge of a mental burnout and really, really just want to chill out this year and not have to deal with... people.

I(28M) work as an electrician and recently found myself in a predicament with my grandmother’s neighbors. I visited her early this month at her request to check out a faulty outlet. In the process of diagnosing and repairing her issue, I found stuff of greater concern.  This was her new backup generator system that was not up to code in the least. Of the many issues with the workmanship, there were two unforgivable ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first was no interlock/transfer panel on the main breaker unit. Having one is legally required for these systems as it prevents backflow. The second one was the widowmaker connection on the generator. Widowmaker cables are both not up to code and are illegal due to the electrocution hazard. This led to me documenting everything before speaking to my grandma. She was understandably upset and wanted everything to be brought up to code. This led to her asking if I could handle everything for her which I agreed to do. The first thing I did was try to get the original contractor to fix their work. The contractor turned out to be her Neighbour's son Mark. I called Mark and asked him to come by as there were problems with the system. When he did I painstakingly pointed out every violation that had been made with the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, I gave two options, either refund the work and be reported or repair it to code. At first, he refused and denied any code violations until I pulled my license out. He then quickly changed the tune and agreed to repair the work. Before letting him even start I asked for his legally required license. The moment I asked this he tried to lie about how he doesn't need one. I  had none of it and sent him home saying that we expect a refund and he will be reported for unlicensed work. I stayed true and reported him which led to inspections from the electrical company and others. Things came to a head this week when he was not only fined but arrested as well. This was confirmed by his mother who called my grandma asking to speak with me. When I did she was not happy and said some spicy things before I hung up.

I’m on mobile so forgive my formatting.

I (20sF) work at a bank, and about six months ago I recommended this guy I used to work with, Paul(20sM), for a position. He interviewed and got the job; it’s entry level and he was trained from the ground up.

However, I’m feeling a little friction. I started on the bank a year and a half ago, and after a lot of jumping through hoops I’ve secured a promotion. To get the promotion I had to exceed on sale goals, work extra hours, and keep my operational knowledge flawless. It was a very hard process that took a lot of coaching and growth.  It’s worth noting that I did have a rough start in the beginning of my career, as I’m not as naturally detail oriented as the job needed and I could be forgetful.

Paul did not have the same difficulties I had in the beginning and is doing well. He has made no mistakes as  large as the ones I made and I think he has a lot of potential. Recently he has been talking about getting the same promotion I had in the near future, and my boss agrees. This has really been irritating me. Here’s why:

I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get this promotion, including increasing my sales and taking care of all the technical duties of the branch. Paul’s sales are dismal, and I am frequently correcting his paperwork, and interrupting him giving members incorrect information.I have the authority to assign him work, and I do. This specific work is dull and might not be effective, but corporate wants us to do it and if it isn’t done it reflects poorly on the whole team. He refuses to do it, stating he doesn’t believe that the work is useful or productive. I agree, but that doesn’t mean he can ignore it. I struggle to have him complete a fraction of the work I complete. For every 15 tasks I complete, he completes one, and that is only because I have to badger him. He does important paperwork wrong incorrectly every time, despite the fact I’ve taught him how to four times. This may seem petty but the branch will get a citation and the members account closed if this paperwork isn’t done correctly, so the fact that I continue to have to correct his work and clean up his messes infuriates me. Today he tried to teach a new employee the wrong way of doing things, and even with me badgering him he still did it wrong! He constantly dismisses me and my knowledge on a subject, mansplains my own job to me, and will frequently argue with me on operational tasks in front of members or new employees. Yesterday, outside of work hours, he called me bossy. 

I want to discuss all these matters with my very understanding boss, and tell her that Paul still has a lot of growth to do before he’s ready for a promotion, but I don’t want to play into toxic company/rat race culture by putting my fellow employee down.

Being in this program is like being soldiers in a battle together. You spend 24/7 doing nothing but trying to survive. Due to this, all of our fellow students will feel like siblings for life - whether you love or hate your siblings. There is definitely some of each.

That is Natalie and I first met and became close - by spending an excessive amount of time studying together and helping each other, first with small groups and then alone together. Then we started doing activities here and there in our small amount of free time like going to movies, first with groups and then alone.

Both of us figured each other were around 30 and both were surprised by each other's age. We both look around 30 and people assume we are the same age. Actually, I am 24 (big and bald, with a beard, and a deep voice) while Natalie is 39 and could probably pass for even younger than 30.

It's clear we like each other which is how age came up. The age difference is way bigger than either of us assumed. We are still interested since we made a really strong connection before we realized the age gap, but this threw us for a loop. If it matters, neither of us has or wants kids.

The problem is I made the mistake of confiding this in my mother because I thought she could give me good advice in the situation. First my mother was outraged and disgusted and said I was sick in the head to look at a ""menopausal woman"" that way and accused me of lusting after her own friends, which is very much not the case. Then she said Natalie was creeping on a child and should be expelled from the program. However, it's difficult to look at me (rezembling a grizzly bear) and call me a child with a straight face so that didn't last long.  


So then she turned the blame around back to me, saying that I had led Natalie on and she probably wants a child and I'm taking away her last chance to have one, and making her believe in a future than can never happen.

Let me preface by saying that this man LITERALLY does not know how to cook. If it werent for the women in his life, this man would literally exist on ramen, McDonalds, and gas station food. Hes tried and failed miserably. 

Not a problem. I generally love to cook and I think I am pretty good at it.

However, he has gotten into this pattern of saying he is going to ""buy me dinner"" and then....come home with the ingredients for said dinner for ME to cook and clean up after. Or worse, have me spend an hour on the phone talking him through a shopping list.

We both work full time and I get that our jobs are monumentally different. (I work from home at a computer all day. Hes a union concrete layer.) I can see at the end of the day how it should be expected that he can come home and be able to rest....but sometimes I have days where my mind is literally mush. 

Today was one of those days. He texted me on his way home and told me to get ready because he was treating me to a steak dinner. I told him, very plainly, that today was NOT the day. That if he wanted to take us to Applebees or something, I have a couple of gift cards. He said, ""no problem.""

And came home with the fixings for a steak dinner....that Im expected to cook, serve and clean up after. 

I refused. He got angry and said ""Im doing this for you. If it was up to me Id just have a sandwich from the gas station.""

I told him I would have rather had a sandwich from the gas station than be expected to spend 2 hours cooking after I spent all day dealing with fallout from work.

He called me ""ungrateful"" and posted on social media, without context, about how I refused the ""nnice dinner he bought me"" after he worked all day. Now I have his mother breathing down my neck and all of his friends calling me a spoiled B-word because I refused to cook and ate leftovers instead.

The stars aligned when I made it and 2.5 years later we have 200+ people in it. Occasional bickering, but overall pretty nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue: I keep a very hands-off approach to moderation in said discord, but one of the few things I will do is remind people that, since this group is technically unofficial, you can't reserve the public spaces of the building there. As often as once or twice a week a tenant will post something like ""I'm reserving the lounge for this friday"", to which I will respond something like ""there are no official reservations here, please talk to management"". I am trying my very best to cover my ass in the case that someone shows up to an occupied common area, says they called dibs on the unofficial Discord server that the people there don't follow/know about, and a fight breaks out. Or, in what could be a sadder turn, someone shows up and *successfully* kicks someone who got there first out by claiming dibs.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think my reminders are reasonable given the situation, but I have gotten push-back several times from tenants. It feels like my reminders are annoying, but I know I'll regret it the second I don't say anything and a fight breaks out over it.

&amp;#x200B;

For a little more context:

* I try to phrase my responses as politely as possible. I occasionally say things like ""thanks for letting us know you want to use the room"" to imply that even though it's not official, their interest is noted and it might help secure the space.
* I typically don't say anything unless they explicitly imply that they think their reservation is valid here. So I won't anything to ""just to let people know I would like to use the lounge friday night"", but if they use words like reserve/dibs or they say ""I'm using the room"" very definitively, I will chime in.
* I've already tried various means to prevent people from claiming spaces there. I've pinned messages, changed the channel description, nothing works. People will post ""I'm reserving the room friday"" when the most recent post in the channel is me shutting down another res. A lot of people aren't on there often and don't care to actually learn the space.
* At least once someone has told me ""we get it, stop telling us"", despite people still doing it. I told them why I do it, and that I will keep doing it as long as people keep trying.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: People in my (very big) building group chat try and reserve the public spaces, and I repeatedly shut them down because the chat is unofficial and I want to cover myself/avoid conflict. People seem to kinda hate that I do it so often, and I genuinely don't know if I should just give up on the reminders.

My daughter(Emily) is biological and my son(Liam) is adopted. We brought him home from China when he was 12. He fit into the family very well and i honestly barely remember what life was like without him. He’s much closer with his other sister than Emily but they get along. And Emily is also very close with our older daughter.

Our family friends who live down the road also have adopted kids. They’re son(Jack) lived in an orphanage with Liam since they were babies and were best friends. Jack was adopted when he was almost 10. His family advocated for Liam to be adopted and we eventually came around.

Since Jack and Liam were reunited they are still good friends. They are in very different circles at school so a lot of their friends don’t realize they’re friends but they hangout a lot and go to camp together during the summer. They sometimes refer to each other as brothers.

Towards the end of 8th grade Jack and Emily started “dating”, (in quotations because middle school lol) we thought they’re relationship was very cute and we supported them fully. Recently they went through a rough breakup. Emily thought that Jack’s friends were making fun of her and Jack wasn’t standing up for her but he denied it.

Jacks mom and I are close friends and we obviously take our own kids side so we agreed just not to talk about it. 

The other day Liam left and texted the family group chat that he was hanging out with Jack when I asked. Emily and him started fighting and she’s not speaking to him. She thinks that he’s her brother and he should be on her side no matter what. And she’s mad that he’s not “protective” over her like most brothers are.

He says that he is but it’s complicated and he’s not gonna ditch his only life long friend because of stupid relationship drama.

I see both sides but I definitely agree with Liam. Emily is very mad at me about it. She thinks I should be forbidding Liam from being friends with Jack. The family is currently split and my husband said is also saying that we should consider making a compromise.

The flat has two ensuite rooms, so we both get our own shower. However, the shower in my room gets absolute shite water pressure sometime around midnight -- I have no idea why this happens, or when it happens; it seems to happen after 11 PM before midnight every day. The landlord said it's probably because other people in the building are also using water, so I'd assume I couldn't do anything about it. As a result of that, the heater doesn't properly heat up the water.

A few weeks back, the flat below complained that my shower leaked into their flat so I used the shower in my flatmate's room exclusively.

Tonight, I came home from music practice (personal) at around 11:10, given that I can only book rooms for an hour a day at my university and I try to book an hour in the evening so I can get in 2-3 hours of practice when nobody books the room after my session. This is pretty common for me, especially when I have a performance coming up. Other times, I might be in my room studying and would lose track of time, but that's on me.

When I tried my shower at around 11:30, there was no hot water again, so I went and ask my flatmate if I could use his shower. He has previously told me to use his shower before 11 ideally since he wants to use it between the 11 to 12 window, and he's told me the same thing tonight. However, I've rarely seen him shower during this window, and he doesn't even sleep until at least 2 or 3 in the morning.

I hate how my mom always has to have me and my sister as a good example to show off to the rest of our family. One of my relatives suffers from hair loss, and they have problems seeing themselves as ""pretty"" with a wig, they don't like wearing one. 
In response to that, my mom thinks it's a great idea for me to wear one so I can make my relative feel comfortable about wearing said wig. The issue is: why does it have to be me? Why not my cousins?? Why not my mom?

 My mom compared this to when ppl shave their heads to make cancer patients who went under chemo and had hair loss, feel comfortable. 

The thing is I've always been put on the spot in my family, I don't interact with them much, they see me as the shy and anti social girl. This just gives me so much anxiety because I'm already so self conscious on how I look, and I can't imagine wearing a wig (not a normal one, a COSPLAY wig I own) around family. I'd be the odd ball. 
She proceeded to say that she's not ""forcing me"" to wear it, that it'll only make my relative feel better, but the thing is I already feel out of place when I visit my family out of state.
 I've never rlly felt like I belong because my parents would always try to get me to be so extra, I got sick of it.

(You might be wondering why I mentioned cosplay wigs, I cosplay as a hobby, so my mom used this against me and word for word said: well I don't see why it'll be a problem since you happen to wear your cosplay wigs whenever you want here at home. It's like a costume,  it's the same thing."")

My mom now made me feel bad about not wearing the wig, when I really never even get a choice to begin with. I'm just so done feeling bad about myself.  
I tend to get bad anxiety and depression when the holidays are close because i have to constantly step out of my comfort zone and interact with my family, being an introvert, it's so hard for me, I hate seeking attention.

My husband of 14 years died two years ago. The last five years of our relationship were frought with medical issues and loads of stress. He was assaulted and suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2017 and was never the same again. He'd been on prescription pain medication (morphine and Vicodin) for nearly a decade. The assault made that all worse. I couldn't understand why he'd become so paranoid (accusing me of having affairs) and so angry and abusive. There were several times when he had threatend me with physical harm or death. I finally got him into professional care with one of the best research institutions in our area where he was diagnosed with PTSD and the early stages of dementia. He had overdosed on opioids once and after great effort, was able to return home. Less than a year later, his anger escalated again. I moved out with the hope of finding a care facility where he would be safe and I could sleep without fear. During that time he overdosed for his final time.

This is a long introduction to my question, but you all needed the background. There's more to the story, but those are the basics. For the past two years I've kept in touch with his sister. She needed time for closure and I tried to provide that for her, inviting her on a couple outtings to spread his ashes in places that were important to him and making a few visits to her. Right now though, I feel like I'm done. I need to move on. If we hadn't been related through marriage, I never would have known her. She's not the kind of person I'd have chosen as a friend. Our interests and backgrounds are vastly different. The only thing we have in common is her brother, my former husband. Every time we talk, that's nearly all we talk about and I'm just done rehashing all the horrible, traumatic memories. I'm ready to move on and really don't want any more contact with her or other members of his family. I feel like I've given up so much in caring for him through his injuries and illnesses. I'm just ready to move on. My husband and I had no children together, so I'm not depriving any offspring from knowing his family.

Last year one of our females escaped. Huskies have a strong drive to run so these things happen. What I didn’t expect was for her to turn up pregnant with non-pedigreed offspring.

We managed to give away most of them, except for one. Maybe because he doesn’t have the most desirable looks. I haven’t had time to find a taker for him, and I noticed my daughter (6) playing with him a lot and even gave him a name. I think she likes him because he’s so different from our other dogs. His coat is short and has an underbite, so he obviously stands out. I didn’t bring him to a vet but he otherwise seems fine.

The problem is that he is approaching sexual maturity, and obviously as a breeder this is concerning. Should he get access to any of the females, they’ll start producing more mutts. Business wasn’t great in recent years and we can’t afford more lost litters. My wife brought up having him castrated but I am totally against this. I’ve never taken away a dog’s manhood and never will. It’s just a personal conviction of mine.

The point is I never planned for my daughter to keep the dog, and I need to get rid of it soon. Culling the herd is a practice as old as time. As breeders we take pride in preserving the integrity of the breed. I hardly have time to manage our real huskies, much less look after a mutt. I’ve already had his mother retired.

I get that my daughter’s upset, but I want to teach her that we can’t have everything we want. I also want her to respect dog breeding, and one day carry on the family legacy.

I scheduled a day when the pup is to be culled, and told her start saying her last goodbyes. This didn’t go over well, resulting in a tantrum, crying, and locking herself in her room with the pup saying she’s running away, etc. I decided to just let her cry it out. Now she’s refusing to eat, but we know she’ll get hungry eventually. I already promised her a puppy from the next litter, but she insists “Bruno” is somehow special. She’s just a kid so I know she’ll get over it.

Well, yesterday I got a phone call from one of her friend’s moms, saying my daughter was crying to her friend about the dog, saying all these things about how she’s disappointed in us and accusing me of not trying hard enough to place the dog, etc. Of course she herself is not willing to take it. She said my daughter will have “trauma” but she’s not a breeder and obviously doesn’t get it. I think her friend and her mom are just enabling her to drag this out.

I’m pretty confident in my decision. To me it’s just one of the unfortunate complications of having a child in this business. However, if people really think I’m the asshole and word continues to spread about how terrible they think I am, that no doubt would be bad for our image and the business.

Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I'm kind of the extrovert of our little group, even though I'm a serious introvert in public or around new people.

We decided to have a Friendsgiving day after Thanksgiving, and only about 3 people (including me) RSVP'd. So we decided to do our classic ""invite someone we don't know to see if they'll vibe with our group""

On Thanksgiving day, I found out one of the ""new people"" one of my friends invited was an ex of mine. I knew they were still friends and it doesn't really bother me, what they do on their time isn't my business so I didn't mind it, but me and him had gone NC bc we had a horrible breakup and honestly didn't want to see each other ever again. 

I didn't want this to be our way of seeing each other again, and I definitely didn't want any drama from either of us, so I told my friends and the person I invited that I wouldn't be coming to avoid drama. Apparently just declining to show up was drama enough. 2 of 3 of my close friends (one couldn't come) said I was being irrational and petty by not putting aside our past differences for the night and just be thankful.

Well apparently he passed the vibe check in my absence, because I was also told that they plan to invite him to our Friends-mas (already WIP) and maybe some casual hangouts. I told them as long as he'll be at events, they can count me out. It's a choice we mutually made in the past and I'm not going to change it just for them.

I'd hate that he could be the thing that makes me lose my friend group, but it's like they're choosing him over me, and it kind of sucks.

He sent me a message and we caught up. I told him I was married and had 2 kids with the love of my life. We talked a little, but it felt kind of forced on my end because we weren't close before. I continued to answer every few months, my kids and spouse being brought up every ""session"".

A few months ago, completely put of the blue, he started to message my spouse. My spouse answered and kept it short because the two have never met before...

This last time seemed different though. I brought up my family and everything was more forced than normal. Eventually, he asked how I feel about him and I made it abundantly clear that I just think of him as a friend. He responded with a long lovey message and made it obvious he has had feelings for me since highschool.

I was dumbfounded and said I didn't know how to respond. I responded trying to be nice a few hours later, but all he cared about was how I felt about his proclamation of love. I finally told him, after 2 days of avoiding the topic, that I didn't have feeling for him and I was happy with my spouse and kids. I wished him a wonderful life filled with amazing people, but I couldn't be in it.

I (32f) and my husband got married about five years ago. At that time we decided to have a child-free wedding and told our respective families of our wishes. We reiterated our feelings on the matter twice verbal and once in written form (the invitation). However, I guess up until the actual invite our families assumed that we were joking, would change our minds, or allow a special exception for their specific child/children. 

My husband and I remained firm on our stance, and when the calls and messages from family members came in trying to shame us for our choices the arguments just seemed to be endless. When we made our decision to hold a child-free wedding we knew that this meant that some people may not be able to go so when our families started to say that they couldn't come if there children weren't allowed due to lack of child care, my husband and I told them that we understood and would send pictures. 

My parents even went so low as to threaten pulling their financial contribution if we didn't cave in. I was shocked and hurt but told them that at the end of the day it was their money and if they chose this route my husband and I would be forced to downsize and the people my parents especially wanted there would be the first on the chopping block and we would be sure to let them know why. 

My husband and I seemed to be at a stalemate with our families for about a week before my parents came to us with an apology, along with a few other relatives and promised to look into other arrangements for child care. Fast forward to a week before the wedding my husband overheard his family talking about ""the plan"" of secretly bringing the children to the wedding in the attempt to pressure us on the spot the day of the wedding. 

We were furious and in an act of passion my husband and I decided to elope and got married at the courthouse the next day, sending and posting pics while talking about how we ""just couldn't wait any longer."" For years there was a bit of resentment on both sides but we were all slowly able to mend fences, especially after the birth of my daughter ""Elsie"" (3f). 

Back in October my cousin ""Wendy"" (37f) and her husband got married and stated that children were welcomed so my husband and I brought Elsie along. Despite having a nice time my husband and I couldn't help but feel an oddness with everyone at the event but thought it was just in our heads until this past Thanksgiving when I confronted my family about their odd treatment of me and my husband.

My cousin ""Brenda"" (26f) then said how everyone found it so hypocritical of my husband and I to bring our own child to Wendy's wedding when we explicitly forbade her and everyone else's kids from coming to ours, and even eloped to spite our families over it.
