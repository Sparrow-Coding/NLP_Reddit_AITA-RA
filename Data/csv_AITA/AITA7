She is sweet with people but she struggles with leash aggression with other dogs. She also just has a bit of anxiety, and lots of energy in general. We are aware of these issues and we are working on them, especially when we take her on walks. Aside from 1 incident (when we were first learning about her leash aggression), she has never bitten another dog on a walk because we are very careful.

We also live with a roommate, Chris. Although my partner and I share 1BR and 1BA, and Chris has 1BR 1BA to himself, we split the rent for this apartment three ways equally, because we have Maggie, and a bigger room. Chris is a good friend of ours and we all get along very well. He even watches Maggie on occasion and will take her on walks. Chris' partner has a small dog who visits often, and the two get along and play well because despite their size difference, they have a similar energy level. Chris is very aware of Maggie's behavior problems, and is very understanding of them.

Chris also has a friend with a small, sick, senior dog named Sprinkle. This friend and Sprinkle needed a place to stay for a few nights while construction was happening in their home, and Chris offered our apartment. When Chris asked our permission for her to stay, my partner and I expressed concern about the two dogs interacting, and asked that she bring Sprinkle ahead of time to meet Maggie. Chris agreed, and set up a meeting for her to bring Sprinkle in advance.

We had requested that the dogs meet outside first, but that request was denied. The dogs met indoors while Maggie was on a leash. My partner and the friend spent 1.5 hours introducing them slowly, giving treats, and testing out their behavior off leash. Ultimately, Maggie had too much energy for Sprinkle. Although Maggie was mostly good, one wrong move would be pretty fatal for this senior dog with medical problems. We decided Sprinkle should not stay over.

The next day, Chris informed us that his friend found a puncture wound on Sprinkle, and was taking her to the vet. The vet also required the friend to file a report on Maggie, given that she bit another dog. A few days later, we learned the wound was infected. The vet bill cost $200 and although the friend never asked for money, my partner paid it and she said thank you without any protest.

Am I the asshole for thinking we should not have paid this? Chris knew about Maggie's behavior and should have informed his friend accordingly, especially after we expressed concern and made the request to have them meet outdoors in advance. Not to mention, knowing his friend had an old, sick dog, it was a big ask for us to accommodate her in the first place. Although we agree Maggie's behavior problems are an issue, home is Maggie's safe space. We should not be responsible for making another dog feel welcome, and I don't believe we owe her for a vet bill that was incurred while we were going out of our way to accommodate her dog.

Growing up I have always been the support system of my mother. She always came to me to complain about her relationship with my father, about what my father did wrong, and never seemed to reflect on what she may have said and done wrong too. She tends to think she is always right or the 'victim'.

This happens with every little inconvenience in her life. She calls me to complain about her business not going well, about people ""who did her wrong"", and how ""sick"" she is (She always thinks she might have a serious disease even though her doctors ensure her she is very healthy.)

Last week she called to say she had a headache and that she probably had something serious this time; then a day later she called to say that she had back pain and she was very concerned.

I on the other hand never share details about my life with her, but I have noticed that when I share a problem I have faced at work, for example, her answer is always ""well, what can you do"", leaving me feeling helpless, while she expects me to listen to her talking all the time. She doesn't want my advice, I think she just wants to vent and listen to me saying she is right and others are doing her wrong.

My final straw was when I was talking to her on camera and she said ""I can't wait for you to come to visit, I need someone to talk to"". I said, ""Well, you can talk to a therapist"". And I kid you not she said ""You are my therapist"". I don't think a child should ever be his/her parent's therapist despite the fact that I am all grown up now.

Yesterday I called her early morning while I was going to work. She said good morning, asked about the weather, and immediately started to complain. She said she works so hard but no one appreciates her or her efforts. Being very disappointed with her for so long and being half asleep I said ""mom please it's so early, and you already started your complaints."" She didn't take that well, responded angrily to me, and then didn't contact me all day which has never happened before because she calls me all the time. I didn't call her as well because honestly, I am just tired.

When she called me today I calmly explained how her using me as a punching bag for her complaints and vents is hurting me and my mental health. For the first time ever I told her if she wanted to call to ask how I was doing, what I was up to and so on she is welcome to do so. If she wants to call me just to vent or complain she has to think twice because I don't want her to call.

She didn't really listen (as always) she just said ""Ok, I won't disturb you again"" and has since made only a 4-second call to ask me where I was (she was very sad/angry as I could understand from her voice.)

Now I feel like a huge A-hole for saying all these to her, I feel like I overreacted and I feel guilty as hell for hurting her feelings.

I dont know how to start this so i think i will go straight to the point. English is not my first language so please forgive me if there's grammar mistakes.
My (57F) mom has been stressing about this all day.
For a bit of context,my (31M) brother moved out a few months ago. My parents let him stay at our old home and didnt make him pay rent as the housing market in my country is in a terrible situation especially in our city. Inflation has been terrible too,my brother stopped being able to buy food at some point even. So,my parents stepped in to support him a bit. He has a pretty nice paying job,and i thought he'd be fine. indeed,he can buy most food nowadays,but my brother has always been quite irresponsible financially.
i don't blame him. it took him forever to be able to move out and i know its extremely hard for younger generations to live on their own nowadays. however,even i (15F) began to notice he often spends his leftover money in a bit of an impulsive way,usually on something like headphones or anything like that. I dont really care what he does with his money,but i do think he should save a small bit of it every month.
He also has a young cat who he adopted as a kitty a few months ago.
In the past few months my brother has had many girlfriends. I'm happy for him since he seemed super happy everytime. However,it never lasts. A lot of these women aren't really the best people,or its just arguments between them happening.
Usually after a week or two of dating,he takes them on a trip somewhere far away by borrowing my parents' old car,which is another bunch of heavy expenses on gas and such. For someone who isnt in the most comfortable place financially,I just dont think this is wise especially because in the most recent one this week,it was over 300 kms away from our city. I also dont think this is good for a new relationship.
My mom has tried to sit him down and give him advice,especially on how he should save,and that if something happens to them no one will be able to support him(or me).

My brother and I are not close. It's not just the age gap,we just were never close. However I know he thinks of my opinion as something of huge importance.
I dont adore my brother,but I dont want anything bad to happen to him. And however again,I am a heavily sheltered kid who knows nothing of the adult world or finances. I could really use some advice on this.

In 2018, my husband and I were married, and our photog was his/our friend; we’ll call him James. We didn’t have videography, and James agreed to do still photography for $1000 for the day. He was offered food and drink and breaks, I wanted him to enjoy himself as well.

Before the wedding, my FIL offered to pay for the photography, and we agreed. At some point before the wedding day, James decided to lower his fee to $800 “for a friend”, and agreed it would be sufficient.

After the wedding, we went on our honeymoon, and when we came back, our cat had a series of sudden health emergencies and quickly passed away. On top of our grief was a $700 vet bill, and just back from our honeymoon and wedding, we didn’t have much disposable income left. 

We later received a text from James that FIL had not paid him for the photography on the wedding day. FIL didn’t discuss it with my husband or with me, and we had no idea what actually happened. We were panicked and broke and devastated. 

Needless to say, James was less than understanding. We were scrambling and doing everything we could to pay him and the vet. We explained to him exactly what was happening while it was happening, and he would still hound us nearly every single day while we were grieving and deciding on a burial plan, and doing every possible thing to gather money together. He refused to control his temper or show any empathy, and while neither my husband or I had any energy to exert into an argument with a friend, we were also bewildered as to why a friend would treat us this way. We did not intentionally “stiff” him, and just a short week later, I paid him the full $1000 instead of the $800. 

When I received the pictures, I was less than impressed. He used a lot of “artistic license” (that I did not approve of or appreciate, and was NOT discussed beforehand) to capture intimate and meaningful moments of our reception, and did not follow my direction at all for the “first look”, which was of the utmost importance to me, and he also royally screwed it up.

We haven’t spoken much in the past few years. I’m sure he’s still salty that it took so long to pay him (two weeks - though yes, I know it isn’t an excuse), and I’m honestly still upset that he ruined so many precious moments of my wedding. 

I’ve never brought it up to him; he gave us our gallery and that was that. He recently invited my husband and me to his new apartment to play cards, but I have no interest in going. My husband wants to mend fences, but I don’t. He thinks it’s long past and I shouldn’t be upset about it anymore. I understand where he’s coming from, but wedding photos are supposed to last a lifetime. We only have a handful of hundreds that I actually like, and many better photos were taken from our family’s smartphones.

Just stopping by to get your verdict on something that i am probably very biased on. So let me begin.

I work a desk job for a small company in my city. Due to being mainly desk bound the rules on dress code and such are very lenient. Thats one of the reasons why i love this job so much, it allows me to be me.

One thing you need to know about me is that my hair is long. I was inspired by a video i saw on early YouTube when i was 12. I am now 26. Been growing it since. In my whole long hair journey, shoulder length to my current length (just past my knees), i have never experienced any problems or blockades. Everyone has always been very accepting and complementary.

So my job recenctly just got a new manager. My old manager was a woman, maybe mid 50s (i never asked her age, my mum taught me not to), who could care less about what you looked like. As long as you were working she was happy. This new manager could not be more different. Previously i could wear my hair how i wanted. If i wanted to hang it off my chair like rapunzels tower, i could. Now however there is a new rule that sees me put it up in a bun as long as i am on site.

I wouldnt have a problem with this rule if it wasnt incredibly unfair. You see, the women at my place of work can do what they want with their hair. I cannot.

Part of me really wants to boycott this rule and wear it down to work, another part tells me that this would be a dick move and i should just listen.

First I couldn't visit family much due to the distance. Then I moved to a country that is closer, yet still a flight distance away. But Covid happened, so visits remained rare.

Now that all this is sort of over, I find myself quite happy with the once-per-year visit. I have a big family back home, so it's not like anyone is lonely. But people are starting to get annoyed at me and my initial decision to leave and not return.

Background: We're from the countryside and all live with 20 minutes of each other. There are roads where everyone has my last name because it's all us. My aunt is the mayor, my cousin is the local police guy, my grandpa is the head of the church choir. That's all to say, we're all pretty condensed.

My part of the family jokingly calls themselves the ""soap opera arm of the family"". We had all the things: Teenage pregnancy, prostitution, child neglect (me), affairs with neighbours and co-workers, drug addictions, alcoholism, school dropout (me), missing person report (me), homelessness (me), disputed fatherhood, divorce, etc etc etc. And they hold soooo many grudges, every time I visit somebody isn't letting somebody else on their property because they have said or done something outrageous. It never stops.

I left and finally realised that my part of the family is addicted to drama and too immature to grow up and move on, so I've limited contact. That's why I sort of want to continue the yearly visits and NOT make them more frequent.

My family is not happy about that. They don't understand the reasoning or why I don't call on my own initiative. They also disregard that I use my annual leave, money, and energy to travel there which makes me want to do that even less. I still call my lovely grandparents every month, they do get it, but they are sad I'm not around more.

I feel a bit bad. My family does make me unhappy, but they do it with so much ignorance and so little self awareness that I feel like I'm ""punishing"" them for their characters which seems unfair - they seem unhappy and trapped in themselves, too, but I feel like that's not my responsibility and I've nannied them for far too long.

I should add I only visit for max. one week, but since everyone hates each other, I spend less and less time with individual people because I need to split my time up between them instead of seeing them together. Also, they've been invited to visit me (I don't really want them to come, but they don't know that), but they never have. Well, actually they did once: My dad visited with his girlfriend at the time, but she had a mental breakdown and it was a pretty stressful time.

According to the city, they had given the landlord multiple notices to fix the violations, but he just wouldn't comply. I initially didn't want my mom to move in with us because she's an absolute narcissist, I've seen it throughout my entire childhood, and because I've been with my fiance since we were 16, he's seen it as well. So we were both unsure. Ultimately my fiance said that he would feel bad if my mom had ended up homeless, so we talked and we agreed to let her stay for 90 days in our guest room so that she could find her a place (she currently doesn't pay rent because we want her to save her money for a place) 

However, my biggest worry about my mom living with us has come true. It took practically no time for her to act as if our home is hers. We've gotten into multiple arguments because of her trying to control things such as the way my fiance responds to her, when the dishes are done, or how grocery shopping gets handled. However today blew things over the top for me, my fiance has custody of his siblings *13 F and 10 M* and currently they are out for Thanksgiving break, my fiance is at work so I decided to get some shopping done with the kids. After breakfast the kids and I got ready and headed out. While out, my mom called me about 5 times ranting and raving about the fact that my finances' brother  left his house slippers by the couch and how it was disgusting and we need to teach him manners. I was so fed up so I went home and told her ""This isn't your house, stop acting like it is.

One of the first things we did was make a list of our wedding party. My bridesmaids consist of my sister, my high school bff, and 5 sorority sisters. His groomsmen are 6 of his close friends and a cousin. 

Craig has an older sister, Stephanie (38F), who I get along with fine, but have never been particularly close with. The two of them have fought consistently since childhood. Stephanie and I have very little in common aside from kids the same age. She is one of the most entitled, self-centered people I’ve met, and I don’t enjoy being around her. However, for the sake of our daughters who are both 5 as well as to keep the peace at family events, we’ve never had any sort of falling out or anything of that nature. 

I sent bridesmaids proposal boxes  to the 3 girls who live out of town and met up with the other 4 in person over the last week. They’re all super excited to be part of the wedding party. 

Craig was talking on the phone with his mom last week over speakerphone while she drove, and Stephanie was in the car as well (she lives at home with their parents and her daughters, so she’s around a lot when he calls). Stephanie made a comment about how Craig and I better put her in the wedding, and Craig replied that we were not going to do that. 

Stephanie immediately went ballistic, bawling uncontrollably. She said that if she was not a bridesmaid, neither she nor her daughters (5 and 14) would be at the wedding or ever speak to us again. After arguing back and forth for a bit, Craig eventually hung up. 

When he told me the story, I thought we were on the same page about Stephanie and her entitlement and attitude. But in the days since, Craig has tried to bargain with me about putting her into the bridal party. He said he would put my brother as a groomsmen to even it out (they’re not close either). I said no.

Craig is concerned that this will start a rift with Stephanie that will end up causing him a lot of grief from his parents and extended family. I still said no, and he says that my unwillingness to compromise to keep the peace makes me TA.

Me (32M, Dutch) and my gf (36F, Polish) have been through a lot.
She's had a rough childhood and I've been a spoiled little shit in my childhood. We met 6 years ago and it's been a rough but slowly getting smoother ride so far. So basically, when it comes to interaction like this, I always doubt myself, like i probably/possibly should, but I don't know if I'm going into Munchausen syndrome at this point or if I'm just over reacting. Starting to lose my grip here.
It seems to me like she's really easy on using her ""outer voice"", and it's starting to bug me. As in, that it's unpleasant, and seemingly unfair to be around. And since recently I've started to state it when it occurs. Like she can freely state her opinion loudly but it's fine to judge mine. I'd let her know that she's into this ""raised voice"" mode that's really unpleasant to be around, and she'll tell me that's ""just how she is and she can't control it"".
And in her opinion, it's not something wrong, it's just ""how she is"". So I'll tell her bluntly that it's not pleasant to be around. 
But it feels like I have to be really specific to her in orde to even discuss this.
I confronted her saying that she told me (yeah I know it's a lot of back and forth) that I disagree with that ""you just need to get used to it"" and she denied the entire thing because she didn't say ""you just need to"" but ""why don't you just get used to it?"". Which in my experience comes down to the same thing basically, only it comes packaged in a question. (Where in my experience, it seems like just avoiding the issue.)
So I'll tell her I need time to think about it, and she takes that as something offensive. As in, how dare I need tot take time to think, that means I'm ""practically breaking up"". Which is a response I'm also starting get used to.  The whole black and white thing. It's starting to even wear down on my having to give grey options...

I'm honestly at my wit's end at this point, and I have some vocal audio to the above discussion which I'm not sure if I should release, due to her rights and all that. But honestly, I'm not sure what I can do anymore. We have a kid, we've been working on this relationship for years, and i know she's the sweetest person deep down, and doesn't know what's hurting me, but that's the thing that's starting to hurt me. I don't want to keep going down this road or sadness. Shes going through therapy, and i always thought I was willing to go through it with her, but I'm starting to get lost on where i need to think of myself.

Anyone got any input?

Me \[M26\] and my ex \[F22\] broke up about two weeks ago.

About a week ago, she sends me a text saying something bad happened but she won't say. I pursue her saying she can't say that, and jokingly said ""Youre not pregnant are you?"", to which she replied ""I was"". Feeling horrible, I call her, asking where she is so I can see her.

She agrees, and we have a nice walk and talk, we share kisses/cuddles. She explains how ""chunks were coming out of her over the day"" but didn't want to tell anyone except me and not even a doctor saying that her ""mother goes to the same doctor"". She says things like ""you would've made a good Dad"", ""we might still have a child"", ""we could do this/that"" implying that we may get back together, and even have children.

I loved this woman, when we were together, I made it no secret that I wanted to settle down and have a stable family, as when I grew up I did not have that. She'd broken up with me too, as I have trust issues, and used to accuse her of wanting to cheat on me a bit (a product of my youth which I am getting counselling for), so I still wanted her back.

I started imagining a life together again. I go to work the next day and explain to my female colleagues what had happened. Now my ex used to work with them too, and some know her as well as I do, and a couple suggest she might be lying. Then, her old mentor who worked with her every day for a year, who trained her to be a teacher, tells me when its 1 on 1, that my ex's claim is ""bullshit"" and that what she's saying doesn't add up.

That evening, I ask my ex if I can call her, but don't explain why. She doesnt reply. I ring her. Straight to answer phone. Now i'll admit my trust issues get the best of me here, as I drive to her house. Outside of her house, is her ex boyfriend before me's car. To confirm suspicions, I ring the apartment buzzer for her, and a man answers. My world collapses around me here, as we had originally gotten together from a ONS when she was still seeing her ex, and my suspicions that she was still talking to him in a sexual way were confirmed (she used to just say they were only friends now).

The next day, I ring her, and explain what I had done the previous night, and I ask to speak in person saying she owed me. She agrees to meet me and is happy to say stuff like ""dont worry he just needed somewhere to stay he's just a friend"", I don't believe her but I don't say that as I want to hash it out. Anyway, I meet up with her, and explain to her that even if she had a miscarriage I cant speak to her because what she's doing is hurting my feelings, and I say that I think I hate her. She says why do you hate me, and I said ""because I never know if I can trust you, for all I know youre lying about the miscarriage"".

She calls me horrible, cries, and then storms off. We exchange texts afterwards, and i'm quite harsh i'll admit as i'm trying to cut ties.

I (30f) have a sister ""Anna"" (27f) and we used to be close and I thought we had a good relationship. Then my ex-boyfriend ""James"" (30m) entered the picture. I met him while in college and was completely head over heels for him. I thought we were going to get married, get a house, have babies, and all the other sappy RomCom cliches. He was the second boyfriend I ever had in life at the time.

When my sister first met him she said that she couldn't possibly see what I saw in him and would sometimes show passive-aggressive hostility. My sister was one of the most important people in my life and I really wanted her and James to get along so I encouraged outings with the three of us from time to time. Then one day I got sick at one of the planned outings but insisted that it was okay for James and Anna to go without me.

After that Anna and James became more friendly with one another and I was actually happy. Until one day my parents sat me down and told me that Anna was pregnant and how she was going to marry the father. I was shocked and when I asked who the father was my heart was shattered when they told me it was James. Anna was staying at our grandparents house in another state but when I went to confront James, his sister came out and apologized to me for the situation and that their parents and mine were pressuring Anna and James to marry after they got caught.

I was so distraught and to make it up to me my parents offered to pay for my trip abroad as well as grad school while giving me an allowance. They told both Anna and me that the money was going to come out of whatever they had saved for her college expenses as restitution to me, and said that Anna needed to focus on being a mother first and that school would have to come later. After spending a lot of weeks sobbing over it I agreed to their offer and stopped speaking to Anna and James. Fast forward to now, James has passed away and Anna has two kids to support. She's yet to find a job that will pay her enough and decided to go back to school, Anna is struggling really hard with her finances and asked me if I would be willing to loan her the money and that she'd pay me back after graduation.

I have the money and she knows it but I told her no. She got upset and called me selfish because by punishing her I was effectively going to make her kids suffer as our parents our no longer in a position to help. I've started to get messages from people stating that I owe her for taking her college money and calling me the ""Golden Child"" but I don't see it that way.

We met in an international context, about a decade ago,  then  dated long distance for a  few years   I had a child from a previous relationship so was always clear I could not relocate to my partners country until that child was grown up.  My ex partner moved to my country to continue the relationship. Moving out of the country was also common for people as the country is very small and prospects are good but very  limited. After a few years we married and had a  child. We had always planned that when my first child was old enough we would move to my partners country, at least for a temporary period. We had never really worked out the details of this but it was a general goal. 

A few years later, the marriage broke down. My ex-partner had lied about several major things,  one of which was her sexuality (we had never really had a sexually active relationship), and they  had become increasingly disengaged from the relationship. It was clear the marriage was over,  and after a lot of attempts to fix the issues it was time to move on. I suspect my ex was trying to hold out until we moved countries after which she would end things, or perhaps because she thought moving would fix things.

My ex now wants to return to her home country with our child, and believes I should relocate there in order to carry on seeing our child. I totally understand why my ex  wants to go back. They prefers their homeland and their family are there. They wants our child to grow up in their culture. I feel the same about my family here and our child's relationship with my county.

 However  I don't speak the language in my exes country  (I've tried to learn for over a year and failed). This would make it hard for me to work there in anything other than a manual job and the country is very expensive to live in. I don't know anyone there or have any links there at all.  It would also mean leaving my eldest child, who is at university in my country. If be unlikely to be able to afford flights back often or have a place large enough for them to stay regularly.

They have friends and links here as they have  now been here for a decade.

Our child has never lived in my exes country but has visited a lot. They speak both languages, but are too young to give a clear consistent view on what they would want.

I'm Madeghan (f37). The title is not the actual conflict (no offense to furries); it's just why it happened and the most way I could describe it. I have to describe the dog situation before we get into anything else. Last month, I adopted Pawblo. He's a very good and healthy pup. I had cats and chinches growing up, but this was my first adult pet.

A few days ago, I was getting some sleep sleep while Pawblo sat at the edge of the bed as usual... or so I thought. I was woke by the snarling and tearing. I was hoping Pawblo was just playing with a chew toy, but this sounded different. I turned up my lamp and was shocked to see Pawblo on my desk. I saw him with something made of paper in his mouth. I used to believe that dogs wouldn't consume anything that doesn't have food on it, but alas. He done fully swallowed whatever was in his mouth, and I soon realized it was my floor ticket for a expensive upcoming concert! I'd spent over $650 on it from a re-seller!

At 4AM, I was tired and angry. I hope you understand that how I felt then carried over through the rest of the day and that I mayn't've made decisions I’ll tell you about had I not felt so awful. I wanted something back from my dog. He took something valuable from me and it's not replaceable. Now obviously I couldn't actually have my dog pay me back 'cause that's ridiculous and delusioned, but I'm not gon let money go down the throat like that. My fellow single school teachers understand.

I went to the animal shelter where I got Pawblo to see if I could get any reimbursement. I didn't pay for money (ticket) to be lost like that. Pawblo is super cute and I love him, but am disappointed in the ticket damage. Neutered or neutral, this was the act of a savage creature. I parked inside and went to have a word with the person working there. It was the same Manda who helped me adopt Pawblo.

I told Manda I seriously needed the money, ‘cause though nothing will make up for my ticket, I want it to be like I never had it. In the Ticketmaster Era of concerts, I think everyone's on edge (side note, some woman called Kale took my seat for a different concert). ""I'm sorry, but I feel entitled,"" I said, and Manda responded ""you sure act like it"". This is where I got fed up. I told her to do her “\*\*\*\* \*\*\*, snake \*\*\*, \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*', hatin' \*\*\* job"". This is where Manda got fed up, or at least started crying and called me Ungrateful. I said I’d speak to her manager, but there wasn't one, so I went home to the pooch.

So basically, I didn't get reimbursed of my money, my dog's a goat, and I can't go the concert. I could have my hair done, I could wear my tightest dress, but even with nothing on the table of problems that is money, bet I still can’t go to the concert. It's sold out! I'd probably be fined if I tried to get tickets from a third party thanks to Taylor Swift! So was my reaction to Manda’s comments suitable?

I pay all the bills, and the mortgage as my brother recently stopped paying but that's not the most glaring issue I have with him. He trashed his room upstairs... Then started sleeping downstairs, then locked off and trashed that floor as well denying me access to our kitchen for well over a year as he went travelling. He has now moved into my mother's room which aside from being total bullshit forces her and I to sleep in adjoining rooms with little privacy. I will not accept this arrangement.

While I was recovering from an auto accident I noticed the smell and a leak through the floor into the basement. I notified him of both but he failed to see it as an issue worthy of attention. So I notified my mother who moved back home and with her help we hired a locksmith, cleaned out the majority of the floor starting with the rotting mystery garbage and left it in a state that was somewhat less of a health hazard. 

Brother promised to have the lower floor and his upper room professionally cleaned. Then bought several appliances to put in my mothers room and said he didn't have money to cover mortgage or bills, essentially forcing me to pay for both. I brought up the fact that he was not working and in the absence of another solution he should clean it himself. He has no response to this, I even offered to help him.

I'm sick of trying to get my mother to grow a spine/ see him for who he is. I'm sick of living with a narcissistic abusive manipulative lying asshole who won't clean up after himself. I'm sick of my girlfriend being (understandably) uncomfortable even using the bathroom while she's here and consequently not wanting to spend a lot of time at my place. I'm just done. I'm moving out or he is. The only reason I'm even questioning myself is that I can't pay rent and a mortgage. This would essentially leave my mother at my brother's mercy but he made his choices. She's made hers. I need to start choosing myself...
I feel anchored to my mother and brother by this house but I'm the only one doing anything to keep it! I work full time and I just want to live my own normal life away from them.

She refuses to go to work in the field she's chosen and has made ZERO efforts to pay off the loans. In fact, my wife has secretly created another $20K in debt with payday loans and other high interest loans because she cannot qualify for conventional or personal loans through any banking institution. Her credit has been ruined. Ruined so bad, that I recently had to purchase a home by myself for our family. She promised to pay these loans off by working in her field but she seems to wince at the thought of any real responsibility. In lieu of not working, I thought maybe she would keep the home. Nope. I work a full time job and I am routinely coming home to no meal cooked, an unkept home, and her hygiene is dramatically suffering. Her hygiene has always been a battle. I'm not sure what's up, but recently she sliced my penis during a lazy attempt at fellatio. It required liquid stitches. To boot, she blamed me for the slice because I should have purchased her new teeth. My wife is in her early 40's and I have reached my wit's end. I filed for divorce and I am being depicted as the bad guy. I should mention that in the time it took her to complete her degree, I continued to work, paid off $75K of her father's estate to secure land which was seized (14 acres). I also started a fully functioning farm through the USDA and obtained an ag exemption. I don't know if my wife is suffering from depression but she sure is being a nasty little cuss and has been for a few years now. There's been comparisons to other men and I have caught her taking my boys around men she is attempting to ""seek comfort from"". IDK. AITA for filing for divorce. I told her I am willing to continue down this path of marriage if she commits to getting professional counseling.

I should also note that I have Crohn's disease. It a very challenging endeavor for me to engage in full time work for one job let alone run a farm as well.

We’ve been professional colleagues, working in similar industries, used each other for professional references, etc. We live in different states, about 2000 miles apart. We attempted a brief relationship and it wasn’t in the cards, but we’ve remained good friends.
In 2019, Adam started dating Jody (37F). Jody was in my circle of close girlfriends, but her and I were never particularly close with each other. 
Being a long distance relationship, different stages in life, and different long term goals, they just  weren’t matched well and broke up.
After the breakup, Jody told Adam he was no longer allowed to be friends with anyone who lives in her state (which included me).
Since I am a grown professional woman, I didn’t like the idea of having someone else control who I can and can’t be friends with…I’m not in high school. I met Adam before I even knew Jody existed as a person, and again, I was never super close with Jody. So I remained friends with Adam. It wasn’t in secret or anything. I expressed in our ladies friend group that I wasn’t going to block him just because their relationship didn’t work out.

This apparently makes me an asshole because “women are supposed to support women” and I guess there was no exception to this unstated “rule” in our ladies group…a group of women who are all 35+ years old.
Because of my choice to stay friends with Adam, Jody decided to start making up rumors about me and got me kicked out of our mutual friend group.

In the long run, I definitely don’t want to be friends with women who would enable her behavior toward me, and I’ve found a lovely new group of emotionally mature women who’ve been nothing but supportive.
I understand how and why Jody wouldn’t like that I remained friends with Adam, and I honestly don’t fault her for being hurt for that part.
But, I don’t think I am an asshole who deserved the subsequent treatment she, and others, dished out.

I graduated college, have a job, basic salaries, rent my own apartment, grinding day by day saving for my higher education. My parents do not support me financially, but are always there for me, making sure I’m aware that I could always come back to them if I mess up. Sometimes I buy unnecessary stuffs (paying for video games, anime merchs, etc.), but overall, I’m living a comfortable life. 

There’s this group of friends I talk to on the daily basis, we play games together, had met offline sometimes and in general we’re good buddies. One dude from the group I’d call Ethan, he’s been struggling with money for a while. He didn’t receive any support from family and had been very independent. He would often vent with us about his difficulties, we tried to offer encouragement and buy him small stuffs (outside and in-game) to make him feel better. I guess since it’s a gaming group, it may upset Ethan that we’re able to buy things he couldn’t afford. Personally, I have never offered any help with money (I did buy him things but that’s it), since I know his pride and he wouldn’t want to be thought mooching off his friends, he hadn’t asked me anyway. However, he’s always been a nice guy and we hit off quite well, so no issues. 

Recently Ethan landed a very promising position, where they wanted him trained to be an IT Specialist and eventually a manager. He’s got a well-written promotion plan. I would be honest here that I am a little jealous, since I have been working my way to promotion too, but it would take quite long according to my predictions (we’re both working in tech). So that was what I said, I congratulated him and mentioned me being jealous with him, he’s younger but managed his life so well. Ethan sorta gave a dry laugh, and expressed that I have nothing to be jealous, that people like me can survive and thrive anywhere, when he’d been through hell to get into his position. I kinda kept silent since I didn’t know what to say.

Lately a common friend talked to me privately that I was being inconsiderate. Not only I did not offer financial help when Ethan needed it but also being an AH when he’s successful. This seriously keeps me up at nights. I have always been awkward with social interactions (hence the online friends), but now I feel guilty that I have offended a friend. AITA for being inconsiderate? If yes, then how should I apologize to Ethan? I know money is a sensitive subject when it’s between friends, so I hope I don’t make it worse.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816211,public,top,self,AITA for not being considerate of my friend’s feelings?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z24xxf/aita_for_not_being_considerate_of_my_friends/,all_ads,6,,,,

I recently took up a new position in a new site, within a week of starting I realised one of our plant operators wasn't cutting the mustard.

""Bill"" is constantly late, not just once or twice a week but consistently late, by at least 10 - 20 minutes. The site manager is a good guy, but far too much of a soft touch.

Bill has a hectic weekly social life that involves pool, darts and skittles. I've also heard from numerous sources that despite having to be at work for 05:30, he regularly doesn't get home until gone 01:00.

I've tried warning him that even though I've never been able to smell alcohol on his breath, and therefore unable carry out D&amp;A testing on him, one day his luck will run out.

That day was today, one of the contractors complained they couldn't access the plant he was running because every time they went in there he was asleep. I was able to get to the plant and caught him out like a light. This is despite the fact he is supposed to be running an intricate and dangerous plant.

He had been on site for over 5 hours when he was pulled in for testing, and although he didn't  ""Fail"" the test, the company's zero tolerance policy makes inevitable that he is going to lose his job.

They always judged me, told me what I was doing wasn't worth it or I wasn't going to get anywhere with it. So fast forward to almost the end of the visitation (5:30-8) so about 7:45. My grandpa (who has a hella toxic masculinity) went to give me a hug. I said to give me a second because I went to sent my bags down. Then I was greeted with his un-sarcastic “I get it. You just don't fucking love me {dead name}.” For reference, when I get to it, they know I'm trans, have known, and refuse to support me. I set my stuff down and ran to apologize to him. Note: I set my presents down in the middle of the road practically because I didn't want him to be mad at me. He pushed me away and told me to go back to the car. My aunt walked over and said “my turn” and went to give me a hug. I gave her a hug but something got caught on my ear and I grabbed my ear. I said ow. Thats it. She got pissed and walked over to my grandpa to talk shit about it. She was halfway across the parking lot and I could still hear her. Fast forward again to when Im in the car with my mom and grandma. My mom got mad because my aunt had texted her saying whatever it was she was saying about me. I got an attitude (that I think was well justified) and said “I didnt mean it!

He questioned if I was the one that caused it and I said no. He did not believe me and asked my brother about it right after he got home. “Is this mark new?” Basically asking if I caused the mark considering the fact that I was the only one that drove his car is the last 48 hours. Guess what my brother said? He said no, it’s been there for a while now.

I understand that I’m not a great driver, but it hurts that he doesn’t believe in me. I have gotten into two accidents (my fault in one), but I called him right away after each.

  I've been dreading making this post because I feel that I am actually a pretty big asshole for this, but I'll let you all be the judge of that. My partner really loves backpacking, hiking, camping, the works. Being from the city, it's never really been my thing, but I've been open to going on hikes/hiking trips with him every now and then. 

Despite the many hiking trips we've done these past few months,  the activity never really grew on me and I still don't feel like an outdoors fanatic, my partner's been the opposite. Every day, he's watching videos on hiking/camping, planning hikes every single week, and *constantly* online shopping at REI and other hiking/backpacking brands. Because of this, it seems the only thing he wants to talk about is hiking/camping, that we hardly ever get to ""talk"" about anything else (I mainly just listen to these conversations as I don't have anything to add). 

I have definitely tried to get into it, knowing that he is very passionate about the activity, but no matter how much I try I never really get as interested in it as he is. There are many times where he's planned a full-day hiking trip for the both of us, not really asking if I was even interested or had the time to do so. The first few times, I begrudgingly agree to go, but lately, I've been setting some more boundaries and have been asking him to discuss &amp; plans these things with me first. 

Despite this, he continues talking about future camping/hiking trips he's like to plan for us, and I don't have the heart to tell him that I'm really not interested in these and that I wish he would ask someone else to go with him. We are going on a 3-day camping trip soon, one that he's planned, and I didn't have the heart to tell him no, so we're going, and I'm really anxious. 

To make matters worse, he doesn't have a job currently but he loves buying so much hiking/camping gear, convincing me that we need it, and I'm really concerned that all of the money that I'm making is going into gear/equipment of an activity that I'm not even interested in. He convinced me to buy \~$100 pair of hiking shoes and, being as I grew up very poor, I normally don't feel comfortable spending more than $20 on anything, nevertheless shoes! Recently, he's been asking for an awning, axe, and other camping stuff that I'm almost positive is just a seasonal-/one-activity-usage, which makes me really frustrated. 

Seeing him get packages or come back with new camping gear makes me really angry, and hearing him talk about hiking/camping makes me frustrated. I told him about this before, but it didn't seem to change anything. Considering we are planning on moving back into an apartment soon, due to money constraints, I've been really angry at him. 

TL;DR - My husband is really passionate about hiking/camping, I'm not, but he's always trying to force me &amp; convince me to go on trips with him even though I don't want to.

I have been dating my boyfriend for a year now, we are extremely happy together. (for the most part) He is one of the sweetest men I have ever had a relationship with. He is all I have wanted. But he does have some insecurity issues that have become harder to deal with. 

So about 2 months ago I became friends with a boy from my class (also 17). We had a great connection from day one and I already consider him my best friend. I quite a bit of social anxiety so I do not easily make friends. That’s why he has made such an impact on me. To be clear, we have no feelings for each other in any way. He even has a girlfriend of 6 months himself and they are in a wonderful relationship. 

Since my relationship with my best friend had become stronger I decided to tell my boyfriend about him. He immediately reacted sourly to this information. He began telling me about how all he wanted from me was to get into my pants. I also then explained that I was in a happy committed relationship and so was he. He ignored this fact completely and kept on going about how he (boy bsf) just wanted to fuck me. 

Obviously I was extremely offended, our whole relationship I had given him no ideas or reason that I would ever be unfaithful or do anything to hurt him. I have been my best self with him. 

But what shocked me the most about him reacting like this was because 80% of his friends are female, not only that but all of them are his exs. I did not once show scepticism about this because I trust him with my full heart. 
And he knows how much I struggle with my social anxiety and how hard it is for me to actually connect with someone and maintain a friendship. 

I do not want to end things with my best friend but I also do not want to throw away a whole year with my boyfriend. But this situation has also gotten me wondering if this is just a split in the road or is the honeymoon phase of this relationship slowly ending. Is my boyfriend finally showing his true colours?

His mother and their relationship is a tumultuous one, where she actively chose her affairs over her sons state of being or she would dismiss him and then become overly loving.

Here is my dilemma, say if we are at school and we talk to some girl asking for directions or in the same class, he would just become so bitter because she has a similar face to his mother or speaks like his mother. We would watch a movie and the character would be a mother like his and he would hate the movie &amp; tell me to turn it off. 

But recently I’ve made a dear friend of mine who I’ll call “julie”, who actually looks scarily similar to his mother in her youth. I invited her over to mine multiple times and he would be there sometimes. He would then proceed to give her the cold shoulder and be quite dismissive, to the point where she thinks she said something wrong or that he doesn’t like her. Which I informed her she didn’t but she continued to think she did.

So that night (yesterday, monday 21st nov), I sat him down and informed him that he can’t keep on giving the cold shoulder to everyone who resembles his mother in the slightest. He would deny but it was obvious. I said if he “keeps on despising girls who are similar to your mother, then I will have no friendships”. 

He got irritated and told me that I was “making stuff up in my head”. Then proceeded to tell me that “I’m starting something with nothing”.

My sister and her partner don't have biological children but they have had several foster children. She currently has 1 foster son who has been with her for over a year. He is 16. 

My husband and I usually host at Christmas. We have space and I enjoy doing it. My host on Christmas day and NYE. As well as my sister and her partner, I have 1 brother,  and my husband has a sister. Both have families, my children's cousins are adults now but still attend. My husband's parents also usually attend. 

My sister doesn't want to attend if her foster son isn't invited. Of course I understand that. I realise that it doesn't sound good but I find him challenging. He has unmedicated ADHD and he has a lot of behavioural problems. He has been in young offenders units and he had to go to special schools because no one could deal with him. I don't think he intentionally acts out but he can never sit still and he starts getting up and walking around or climbing on things. I realise he can't control his impulses as well as other people can but he is almost an adult so my patience has a limit. He also swears constantly and even though he apologises after he keeps doing it. 

He wasn't at Christmas last year because he had a mental health crisis but he is apparently doing well now and my sister wants him to come. If he is going to come I'd prefer it was for a limited time because he makes things more stressful for me and my kids are most definitely influenced by his behaviour. Both start to talk like him when they spend time with him. They both idolise him because they think he's cool. 

I suggested limitations to my sister. For example I said I'd rather he wasn't there for a main meal because he can't even sit through a short lunch. I also said I wanted him to leave before any alcohol was available because I don't trust him around it and I don't want him going out and vaping constantly. Honestly I would prefer he came for 1 - 2 hours and went home. I can't relax while he's there and most of the other adults feel the same. 

My sister said I was cruel for suggesting this. She said her foster kid had never had a nice Christmas because he has been in care for a long time and she said he is sensitive to people rejecting him. Apparently he is trying very hard to be calm at family gatherings and she thinks he has been doing well. My husband agrees but he thinks I shouldn't have said anything and just tried to manage over Christmas. My brother and his wife think something similar. I haven't spoken to anyone else. 

My sister is angry but as far as I know she still intends to come for Christmas. I'm not sure what to do next.

Then she passed away. Since we host dinner a lot, &amp; they like our food, his family asked us to starting hosting on years we have Thanksgiving with his side. 

We agreed, but we hate turkey. We hate casseroles. We hate bland, processed foods thrown on top of other foods &amp; being expected to eat the slop because it's a ""casserole"". We  like the gathering of family, the conversation. That's what draws us to Thanksgiving. 

But it's a lot of work! After 2 years of working HOURS over 2 or 3 days making food we don't like, I told my husband I didn't want to do traditional Thanksgiving anymore. It's offensive to spend so much time &amp; money making these things that neither of us enjoys. So we came up with idea that we would do Thanksgiving with a twist &amp; make our own traditions. 

So our 3rd year, we made roast chicken stuffed with beans, chorizo, &amp; lemon, braised in white wine. We made roasted sweet potatoes with bacon &amp; brussel sprouts. I made homemade cranberry sauce with rosemary &amp; stuffed it into a brie, covered it in puff pastry. It was beautiful &amp; delicious when baked. We made rosemary &amp; garlic mashed potatoes &amp; rosemary &amp; sea salt focaccia. We made a vegan Mac &amp; cheese &amp; a bruschetta (for his sister, who is vegan and never enjoys Thanksgiving). I made tiramisu and vegan chocolate pudding. My MIL found out the week before that we weren't having a Turkey or green bean casserole or sweet potato casserole or broccoli cheese casserole.  We didn't hide it. We were excited when we told her. I printed menus &amp; had a whole display going. 

She shows up two hours early day of with an entire Thanksgiving meal. Dry turkey. Casseroles. Pies. We let her set it up with our stuff. I remade the menus and Made labels for her sides. When the rest of his family showed up, they only ate the Mac &amp; Cheese that we made &amp; the traditional things. They didn't try anything else. (Except SIL: she ate all vegan items). 

Next time we hosted, we told everyone that they couldn't bring anything without clearing it with us first. No one asked to bring anything. We made a roasted duck and a chicken. Some of the same sides previously. I made deviled eggs with bacon and chives. There were no leftovers. 

This year, they asked if we're doing a non traditional Thanksgiving again. I said yes. They started asking about casseroles and a turkey. 

And this is where I might be TA. I said that we've already gone over this. I told them if they want traditional Thanksgivings, they could host and we would come and eat whatever they made and have the grace to not complain about it. But if they want us to host, They will eat what we serve. My husband stands by it, but my BIL and SIL think I should just make a small turkey for MIL and her brother to keep the peace.

Him and I met on a game and we got along very well. We're from the same country, but different cities. Now let me explain the title

From the start I knew that he was in many groups on discord with a lot of diffrent people, boys and girls included. Never had a thing ab this, since I had this too. He never really tried to introduce me to any of this friends, because he said that ""it wasn't anybody business"" which i agreed at first but in the same time i liked to let our friends(we had some friends in common) know that we were together.

it all went pretty smoothly till he first came in my city. while he was here, he connected all his accounts on my pc, to try to catch up with everything. Then I saw a girl (who was his gaming buddy gf) writing him a lot and trying to get him to play with her some game. because he was with me he rejected, but what i think seemed kinda weird(i might be a little wrong) was that he just said he wasn't home, not with someone or even say he was with me. she kept asking almost daily but he rejected. i asked him ab her and all he said was that""she s his buddy's gf"" and that's all. it seemed a little odd because he tried to change quickly the subject. after a few months, he came in my city again and the same thing happened. i tried to ignore it and went on with it because i trusted him.

Then he came here for Christmas, and the same thing happened, but this time he was talking a lot with her and everytime i got closer to him, he closed the conversation and entered a game.
i asked him again ab her and asked if he told her that he was with me, or even if she knew ab my existence and he said no. after that i found out that she and his gaming buddy broke up, and she called my bf to talk to him. i was curious and asked him what she said and he just told me that she was talking ab her now ex.

now i asked him if i can see some of their conversation out of curiosity and he let me. there i saw that she was almost always flirting with him, and him just responding (not flirting). i told him that i didn't felt really comfortable with her always flirting and him not taking the hint and he told me that it was nothing. it went on for a few months, and he came to me again and saw him taking to her and asked him politely if he could remove her, as i don't really feel comfortable with her talking to him like that. he told me he can't really do that because ""if they get in a call together what will he say if she would ask him"". i told him then if she text him again, tell her he is with his gf and see if she continues to talk, if she wouldn't, then he could remove her. he did and she stopped texting him, and he removed her.

so, aita for asking him this?

My mom is fine, we have a plan of what to do, but my grandma is a pain in the behingd. I wanna ask them about what they want now, as during christmas getting a gidt or going out to eat will be problematic. I have a budget of $80 to spend in a gift and going to eat out

Problem is every time I ask my grandma what she wants she always gives the same response ""no, i don't want anything"", ""no, save your money"", ""no, i don;t need to get anything, is not necessary"" etc etc etc

Now problem is my grandma is not saying it out of the kindness of her heart tbh. My grandma is... complicated to say the least, and unfortunately, she's both a very greedy person as well as a person that likes playing the victim. Then she would just complain how no one gives her crap or just mentions it later on... is bothering

And also problem is that if you give her something she doesn;t like she also gets kinda noisy about it or lets you know is not something she'd like

I moved out from her house like 6 months ago now (along with my mom), and with that, I also moved past standing her crap, so at this point I don;t wanna go with that ""mother Teresa victim"" crap at all

I was thinking of just going to et with her so she can;t refuse, and give her a card with money in it so she can;t reject it (again... greedy), but knowing her, there's a chance she'll plat the ""nah keep your money"", and istg if she does that i'll certainly comply and just grab the money, and a night out to eat is all she;d get from me

We were together for a year, around 6 months I found myself excusing his behaviour of disappearing for hours on end without any context, no BRB or GTG, just him leaving. It got really bad about three months ago when the hours started turning into him being gone for close to a full day.

I didn't want to see him after a conversation with his grandmother (who he lives with) regarding him lying constantly, which he denied and said that she's just manipulating me. The past two months I've been busy with work. Recently I caught him in several different lies, one being about him skipping school (again, he never goes) to see a friend, (who was actually his girl bestfriend who he used to date and still calls her HIS), and him lying about what he tells people behind my back (he has told me they tell him he NEEDS to leave ASAP). Also lying to my mother who already has multiple reasons to call him out on lying as he's lied to her many times in the past...Lies that were very obviously lies. One of those being me being grouchy towards him for no reason when I only get upset when I have a real reason to be upset and my mother knows that best. In the past he's left me waiting for him for 30min up to an hour and a half and has lied about things he's doing and taking responsibility (which he does not for his actions and blames everyone else) and conversations with his ex. I've told him MANY times how this lying behaviour hurts me and how the disappearing for hours hurts me since I have really bad attachment issues and abandonment issues (I'm working on them in therapy), but what he does is he says he'll change, and never does. He will for a day or two, but then goes back to the same thing and the cycle repeats almost every other week. This is just the basic outline of the main issues, ignoring the smaller issues.

I (F18) has an ex (M22). We did not have the best relationship and during the relationship I experienced horrible abuse. (Physically and mentally). I broke up with him after this and I had a court against him last year, because of something horrible that he did to me, but eventually dropped it, because of finances and school. 

He recently got together with a new girl (F19). When I saw this I sent her a follow request on instagram and then eventually forgot about it. I did this with no ill intent and was only curious about what she looked like. 

About a week later my mom gets a call from my ex’s uncle (m35) saying that I sent a bunch of text messages to my ex bf where I apparently asked him if he told his new gf about everything and that I was stalking his new gf. My mom obviously defended me, but later asked me about it. 

I then told my mom that I did not send any sort of messages to my ex and to tell his uncle that I want screenshots of the messages. And that I did not stalk his new gf, but only sent her ONE follow request and ultimately forgot about it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I ran into my ex at church out of all places. Which obviously made me very uncomfortable in the first place. He then came to confront me and he told me that I am an asshole for asking for screenshots when I apparently know I did send him messages. (Basically trying to gaslight me)

I (27m) have a 7 month old baby boy. I normally stay at home with him while my wife (26f) works. Im currently looking for a job as I hated my old job. I’ve been a stay at home dad for 5months now. I love spending time with my son but it feels like im gonna explode sometimes cause I have to do cooking,cleaning,laundry,change diapers,entertain my son while dealing with his temper tantrums.

Few days ago my wife was at work while I was at home, I was so stressed. The baby was fussy and he wouldn’t go to sleep cause he wants his mama. I put him in his play mat while I went in the kitchen to cool off. I remember coming home to my wife doing this and I had no problem as it was normal. I was calming down when my wife walked in and could hear our son crying in the living room. She asked me why I’m not with him and I said I needed to cool off. She made out as if I was the one that locked him in a room for hours when it was only 10 minutes. She yelled at me for being a “bad father” and not calming him down properly. I tried everything with him, rocking him to sleep, laying him down on my chest, feed him, put on baby shows, play with his toys nothing worked. I told her to fuck off and took our son upstairs.
She’s been telling family members how I left him in the room and that I swore at her, does she expect me to hold it all in.

We got to meet through common friends, so we naturally ended up becoming friends, too. We connected really quickly and would spend a lot of time together. Within the first month of knowing each other, he admitted to have a crush on me, but i had just gotten out of a very messy and turbulent relationship two months prior, so i was in no condition nor had the desire to get involved with someone so soon (and honestly, i didn’t really see C that way) so i didn’t want to give him false hopes of something happening between us in the near future, and i straight up let him know. He was okay with it, and both of us moved on from that. Around three months later, he started dating his current girlfriend, L (F21), a very pretty and sweet girl from our uni.

C became one of my closest friends, i trusted him more than anyone else in my life, and treasured our friendship a lot. That, until one day, he texted me out of the blue saying we needed to talk and asked to meet up after class. He said L found out about his past feelings for me, they argued and it led him to think the easiest and best decision he could make was to cut me off (i wish i could give you more details but he provided no other information on this). I said “if that’s what you want, then so be it, i respect it” and left it there. 

I was angry and sad at his decision, but thought that if ending our friendship was the easiest thing for him to do, then neither i or our friendship mean a lot to him to begin with. I also thought it was a very drastic decision, given that nothing ever really happened between us other than the fleeting and one-sided feelings he once had for me but moved on from. My friends and parents agreed that it was a very cowardly move on C’s side, by choosing the easy way out. My mom even said the entire situation felt really sketchy and believed C never really got over his feelings for me (which i hope is not the case, as it would be really unfair for L). I consider everything could’ve been handled better, through mutual trust and communication, like the adults all of us are, but what do i know, right? 

We went “no contact” ever since (considering we were still in the same friend group i still had to see him, but i kept our interactions short and to the point, all while also trying to not make our friends uncomfortable). Now, C texted me again saying he wants to give our friendship another go. I politely declined and briefly explained why i felt uncomfortable with that, saying that this actions really hurt me and how i felt betrayed by him giving up our friendship saying it was just “easier”. He got really upset and started talking about how im so immature and selfish and i should understand him prioritizing his girlfriend’s feelings and his relationship. I don’t know how to feel now.

Growing up I have always been the support system of my mother. She always came to me to complain about her relationship with my father, about what my father did wrong and never seemed to reflect on what she may have said and done wrong too. She tends to think she is always right or the 'victim'.

This happens with every little inconvenience in her life. She calls me to complain about her business not going well, about people ""who did her wrong"", and how ""sick"" she is (She always thinks she might have a serious disease even though her doctors ensure her she is very healthy.)

Last week she called to say she had a headache and that she probably had something serious this time; then a day later she called to say that she had back pain and she was very concerned. 

I on the other hand never share details about my life with her, but I have noticed that when I share a problem I have faced at work, for example, her answer is always ""well, what can you do"", leaving me feeling helpless, while she expects me to listen to her talking all the time. She doesn't want my advice, I think she just wants to vent and listen to me saying she is right and others are doing her wrong.

My final straw was when I was talking to her on camera and she said ""I can't wait for you to come to visit, I need someone to talk to"". I said, ""well, you can talk to a therapist"". And I kid you not she said ""You are my therapist"". I don't think a child should ever be his/her parent's therapist despite the fact that I am all grown up now.

Yesterday I called her early morning while I was going to work. She said good morning, asked about the weather, and immediately started to complain. She said she works so hard but no one appreciates her or her efforts. Being very disappointed with her for so long and being half asleep I said ""mom please it's so early, and you already started your complaints."" She didn't take that well, responded angrily to me, and then didn't contact me all day which has never happened before because she calls me all the time. I didn't call her as well because honestly, I am just tired.

When she called me today I calmly explained how her using me as a punching bag for her complaints and vents is hurting me and my mental health. For the first time ever I told her if she wanted to call to ask how I was doing, what I was up to and so on she is welcome to do so. If she wants to call me just to vent or complain she has to think twice because I don't want her to call.

She didn't really listen (as always) she just said ""Ok, I won't disturb you again"" and has since made only a 4-second call to ask me where I was (she was very sad/angry as I could understand from her voice.)

Now I feel like a huge A-hole for saying all these to her, I feel like I overreacted and I feel guilty as hell for hurting her feelings.

Taiko wasn't always ours as he was my stepsister's beloved cat. My stepsister was a very immature and irresponsible young adult, but in short she moved out and suddenly abandoned the cat for us to take care of.

The cat is a sweetheart who has never hissed, scratched, bitten anything or anyone. He isn't loud and is cuddly. He spends all of his time in my room or cuddling with me, only sleeps on my bed, asks me for food and doesnt hang out anywhere else in the house. When he's not in my bedroom, he's outside (outside cat) and even comes back home through my room's window. I feed him, alert my parents when something is wrong and a vet is needed. My stepdad does clean his litterbox, though its almost never since the cat does his things outside. ( note, he isnt scared of going outside my room, but just doesn't care for it. )

Ever since Taiko came home, I was told he was my cat and I needed to care for him, and everyone was like: "" How nice, see, you got your own cat now since you always wanted to! "" Which of course I was super glad to have him and do really love him. Now, I do know my stepdad (47) *really* loves the cat, pets him when he can though it's not often. In fact, he loves the cat so much that he used to get into my room while I was sleeping between 2-5 AM just to pet him when he got off nightshift. Terrible experiences.

Anyways, today I evoked the idea of moving out someday and how I'd have to figure out how to take Taiko to another country. My mom says that the cat is my stepdad's on paper and that stepdad really likes him and considers it to be **his** cat. So I was startled and said that Taiko was already abandoned by my stepsister, and it would suck for him to be also abandoned by me if my stepdad keeps it. She basically said that "" He will adapt anyways, we don't need to care about a cat's separation anxiety. You can get another cat later. ""

I think it's both unfair for the cat, and me, because emotionally he's my cat even though he's my stepdad's on paper. I also know my stepdad does love the cat very much, but Taiko chose his owner and I believe it's me. I find it insensitive to say I can ""just get another""

FOR CONTEXT;

I'm close with my older cousin, C, 28, we live together and shes one of my care workers.

I'm in a wheelchair bc I have FA.

my cousin and I both suffered abuse at a young age

a year ago i pulled the plug on my mom after ATBI, it was very traumatic, C was there she saw what i did.

we are on fine terms, i went to bed early last night to cool off, she woke me up this am same as usual offering me to smoke before she went to her second job shes off my clock till friday. i declined so basically shes over it and im still a bit hurt.

i'm supposed to go to TG at her GPs, her mom too

her brother brought up that their mom will try to tlk to her, and C says that if she does she will fight with her mom and hold nothing back.

her mom is the type that WILL make the day terrible for everyone if shes insulted and im not the one to deal good with emotions and fighting .

it triggers me big time

so i asked her please dont do that. well, her brother jumps in and explains that the siblings are just done tip toeing around their moms problems and that if they keep ignoring it she will die and not meet her grand children.

that i relate too Big time bc no one ever said shit to my mom, and now she will really never meet her grand kids.

which is exactly what i said and i hope that they dont feel the way i did about it bc it was really hard and once she was gone alllll that anger was replaced by sorrow.

and i don't want that for her. she said the topic was pissing her off so i stopped and she kept going and tbh i don't exactly remember how it got to this point, i think it was cuz she was still talking about it STILL to me and i thought she must've misheard me bc her reaction was weird to me.

swearing and loud which isn't like her

not letting me explain my POV

so i repeated my point which was that i don't want her to go through what i did. as I'm typing it out i can see her point, like maybe i was insensitive and i realize our parent relationship is different . but i just felt like she was diminishing my own trauma bc she was listing off the horrible things she went through as a kid and saying that i didn't . which is true, in a lot of ways I was lucky, but I suffered too, I know what its like to grow up scared,

to see your mom be hurt, being forced to leave my siblings for a better chance, which is something she said on the list of things she went through and "" i didnt'' ( i didnt correct her i just stayed quiet)

I know what its like to finally escape a dysfunctional family only to end up disabled and end up relying on them and then they die. which was so traumatic i see it when i close my eyes.

I think she should apologize

im 21, btw.

This upcoming Saturday my (27M) friend group is doing our annual Friendsgiving. My best friend is named Claire (26F) and her boyfriend is my other best friend Chris (28M). Our friend group is about 10 people so usually anywhere from 10-15 people come including significant others. 

Claire’s oldest friend is named Jessica. I’ve known Jessica since college and we’ve hung out due to Claire. I like Jessica as a person and before she got pregnant I was interested in her. I never felt like she was interested in me, and Claire confirmed she liked me as a friend. So after Jessica got pregnant she stopped coming around and we faded out. I don’t date moms and I’m clear about this. last Tuesday, Chris, Claire and I went out to a bar and Jessica met us. At the end of the night she texted me and said she had fun catching up. And would like to grab a drink on Friday night. I thought it was just friends grabbing a drink. 

We texted leading up to Friday. 5 minutes before we were supposed to meet she texted me that her sitter canceled and she was calling her cousin to watch her kid. It might be a over an hour till she could get to the bar. I said I’ll just head to place and wait with some people I knew. An hour goes by. She was still waiting on her cousin. So I decided to head home. I forgot to text her and I guess she started heading out. She texted me she was 5 minutes away and I told her I was already home as it was 11. But if she wanted to stop by she could. She said she would like to meet out somewhere. As she was already out, had the sitter and wanted to have fun. I said I left because I had been waiting over an hour at this point. But I’d see her at friendgiving. I got no response.

The next morning I woke up to all the drama. Jessica told Claire that I stood her up on our “date” and then booty called her. My response was that I never knew it was a date. I assumed it was a booty call or a casual thing. I never intended on it being a date at all. Nor did I ask her to get a babysitter and all that. Jessica had complained to Claire and a few others that she spent money on a sitter and Uber for me to “stand her up”. She also sent pics of our convo in the GC to some of the girls. I started getting heat for it. Which is ridiculous because I didn’t even know. 

I’m hosting Friendsgiving. I said that maybe it would be best to just cancel. Well everyone is wanting to have it. I said fine but no Jessica. She isn’t gonna start drama then be welcome in my apartment. I said if anyone has a problem with that then they can host. Nobody said anything. Now Claire is calling me an AH. Chris is just going along with her saying that I shouldn’t ban her. Maybe just apologize in the GC to smooth the situation over. I said fuck that. I don’t apologize unless I think I’m wrong. So until Jessica wants to admit she is the one spinning this bullshit then she isn’t welcome.

i’m 27f. i’ve been married 6yrs to 28m. we were friends for half a year before dating and then were together 2 1/2yrs before marriage. 

during the dating phase, there were some red flags that i wrote off as just areas of immaturity. things like being intentional, taking the initiative, planning ahead for birthdays, even just waking up with a sense of excitement for the day ahead were all things i figured he’d grow into over time. sadly though, i would encourage him or even nag him about making the changes i hoped to see. there were several things in our dating relationship and early years of marriage that i orchestrated because he often didn’t have any ideas or plans in place. 

i quit nagging and manipulating the situation years ago and just let him drop the ball. it was tiring waiting for him to step up in ways that come so natural to me. he has improved over the last year or so, but it’s annoying constantly running into our differences in overall outlook in life. 

he’s still a great friend and has been there with me through some of my toughest seasons. i just try my best to let it go cause i figure baby steps matter, right?

the other issue though is that he’s gone most of the time due to work. he works nights and his weekly schedule can be up to 6 days at a time. 

honestly, the best times i have with my husband is when we are on dates (which is irregular) and when we sit and talk about life. other than that, it’s pretty hit or miss. 

recently, i had an old acquaintance from college add me on social media. he saw a post of mine and responded. he was flirting, which usually bothers me, but we immediately had chemistry. we were talking back and forth for hours platonically but it felt like we just clicked. we’ve talked frequently since then and it’s been the best time i’ve had talking to a guy in years. 

he also has a ton of qualities i want. he takes initiative, has a plan for his life, he’s hardworking, kind, and patient. he also believes in taking care of his wife in ways mine doesn’t really even think about. 

guy #2 ended up going to my profile and noticed i am married. he admitted that he was interested in me and apologized in case he had crossed any boundaries. but i don’t want to stop talking to him. 

in fact, i’d love to date him and get to know him more. 

but idk what to do about any of this because i don’t really want a divorce. my husband and i have agreed in the past that we would stay married even if we had an open relationship. but i was interested in a serious relationship outside of our marriage until now.

She’s applied for medicine at all her uni choices and every one of her choices from GCSEs to extra curricular has been to make her look like a good medical candidate. 

When we were in Biology class today we were discussing allergies. The teacher asked everyone to volunteer if they had any allergies. Mostly it was food related answers and then I said that I’m allergic to a common medicine.

Farida scoffed and said that’s not biologically possible, [I] cannot be allergic to a medicine! I said well I am. She kept insisting this wasn’t true and then the tutor said that I was right and it’s a common allergen.

I was annoyed at her, because does she really like I 1) don’t know what I’m deathly allergic to; and 2) would like about that for an A level class??

So I laughed and told her that I’m glad she’s not my doctor and she should maybe try learning facts instead of assuming she knows everything if she wants to go into medicine.

Our friends are annoyed at both of us for taking over the class with a “petty argument” so who is the real AH here?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816058,public,top,self,AITA for making fun of a friend’s dream career?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z23fy4/aita_for_making_fun_of_a_friends_dream_career/,all_ads,6,,,,

Her parents are flying in tomorrow night and are staying with us until Saturday.  Her sister and her family live a couple hours away so they are coming just for the day on Thursday.  One family member that I specifically asked about was her younger brother, Mike.  

Mike has struggled with substance abuse and gambling for as long as I've been with my wife.  Shortly after my wife and I got married, he conned my wife out of about $5K.  She pulled the money from our shared account without talking to me about it.  The money was supposed to be for a down payment on a house that Mike was going to renovate and flip.  He ""promised"" my wife that he would give her more than double back after he sold the house.  

Well, he didn't even buy the house.  He used the money to pay off some gambling debts, go on a bender, and gambled the rest away.  Cherry on top was that we had to pay to bail him out of jail after he got caught breaking into a hardware store near the end of his bender.  After that, I told my wife I was done with her brother and want nothing to do with him.  She tried to talk me out of it by saying ""he's still family"" and all that BS that enablers like to say.  

He showed up at our house about 6-months after that but I was the only one home.  He said he wanted to talk to his sister but I told him to leave before I call the cops.  He tried to apologize, but I told him that unless he has $5K to put in my hand, I don't want to hear a word he has to say.  I told my wife what happened and she called me out for being a jerk to her brother when he was trying to apologize.  I just don't trust him.

When we were planning Thanksgiving, I was told by my wife that Mike is not attending.  I specifically asked and she said he isn't coming.  But, last night my MIL called for a final chat before they fly out to make sure they didn't need to bring anything else.  My wife had her on speaker and MIL asked if my wife had heard from Mike.  My wife quickly took her off speaker and left the room.

When she came back, she immediately started trying to explain.  She said that Mike had apologized to everyone in the family and has been totally clean for almost a year.  She said he's started his own business and is doing really well.  She said that she invited him to Thanksgiving because it's supposed to be about family and coming together.  She said that everyone in the family has forgiven him, and she needs me to forgive him too.

I told her that if Mike shows up, I will leave.  I told her that I have forgiven her for giving him that money without talking to me about it, but I haven't forgiven him and I don't want to see him.  She asked me to do it for her because it's important to her and I told her that this is a hard boundary for me and if he comes, I go.  

She said I'm putting her in an impossible position to choose between her brother and her husband and I need to forgive him like everyone else has.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4816057,public,top,self,AITA For telling my wife I won't help and I will leave our house if her brother comes to Thanksgiving,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z23fj3/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_wont_help_and_i_will/,all_ads,6,,,,
