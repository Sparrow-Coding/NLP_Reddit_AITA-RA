He used to let me do anything to him, and I mean anything. He'd just let me do whatever I wanted, he loved me even after I would mistreat him.

See, I'm a victim here, I never knew how to express love, so I always saw him more as a dog. He knew this, or at least he seemed to know this. But still, he never once did he lay his hands on me.

So fast forward to 2022, and Devon is back on my radar, but this time, he's with some woman I've never seen in town before. My friends say he seems like a completely different person, and he's happier. The other guy I had filling his place even left me to go be his friend too.
I just can't stand watching him be so happy when the whole time with me he was so meek. I can't imagine what he let's this new girl do to him. Just thinking about it makes me jealous. I even had my friends try to get him to cheat on her, but each time, they told me he'd refuse to join them at the bar and even started ignoring them.

I hate seeing him happy. He should be broken and still caught up on me, I hate seeing him love someone more that he loved me. I want him just to be in pain, I want him to suffer. I didn't expect any of this when I told him ""people like you don't deserve to be loved.""

Currently he is working driving deliveries for Amazon. I however have been looking and applying for jobs for the last few months while staying with my parents.

Since May when I graduated, I’ve been down to visit him approximately 6 times. He has come to see me twice. Once for my graduation party my parents threw, and once for a court date that he got when he was pulled over during the first visit.

Tonight I asked him if he’d plan a visit to come up and see me. His initial response is that, they’re in their peak at work rn, and that he’s not allowed to ask off.

I said ok that’s fine, but can you go ahead and plan ahead now outside of peak season? He said he was done talking about it, and told me to chill and drop it.


At this point I didn’t really understand what was going on (I might be the AH here). So I asked if there was something he wasn’t telling me. I asked if he didn’t like coming here or if he didn’t really see a future together. I know it’s a lot but I couldn’t understand why he reacted this way. In my head none of his reasons made any sense. 

Now he’s not talking to me saying he’s disappointed that I’d ask and say those thing, and that he’s not sure when he’ll have the “desire” to talk to me.

Now I’m just at a complete loss. I feel like most would agree that me asking this is not a huge deal, especially since I was flexible in saying to do it around peak season at work. Maybe I am being ridiculous though as I’m not currently working. I just really do not know.

I have a strict personal policy of not helping customers while off the clock. This means before, after, and during lunch I will not assist customers.

Since I've been at the same grocery store for 10+ years, customers recognize me even on my days off. I've had customers stop me while I was with my husband and child to ask questions. I've been on a personal phone call and customers will still stop me. I will be at another store and I will still get stopped. 

I will also say that I refuse to respond to my managers text messages/phone calls when it comes to work as well. I will also not answer questions from other associates while I'm off the clock. I think it's important to know that I'm hourly and I'm also apart of a union. We also don't have to wear a uniform. We just have to wear a name badge and apron. The moment I'm not working, the apron and name badge comes off. 

So, today I left the register I was at and said bye to my boss. I clocked out and this customer stopped me and started to ask me a question ( I wasn't wearing my apron or name badge). I told him I'm sorry but I don't know but I have to leave. I just left and walked away. He saw I was in a register and saw me clock out but still stopped to ask me a question. Personally I would see that and recognize that someone is clocking off. 

One of my supervisors heard this and had the ""I'm going to talk to you tomorrow look"". But I was technically off the clock and I wasn't rude. Just very blunt. I haven't gotten in trouble yet for being too blunt to customers, but I know that conversation might happen soon.

She started to text me daily sending me memes and pics about her pets and daily life. I reacted nicely but it wasnt clear what she really wanted. Sometimes she chatted with me till night. Then she asked me if I was okay with her writing me this much. She said she is not interested romantically she just really liked me. I said ok. Immediately she opened up about her abusive ex and current relationship problems. Then she asked about my romantic disappointments. I avoided the subject but we texted till dawn. She invited me for a coffee so we met and she talked sh-t about her BF the whole time. Idk if it matters but our hands touched a lot while walking but maybe I overthink it. She showed me that random guys dm her on soc media and her BF is so cool bc he is never jelly unlike her abusive ex, and T had  8+ close guy friends and Bf didnt care. I was like ok.  
Later T wanted to talk to me on the phone because she had issues with BF. we talked for 45 min about the situation that bf is not romantic enough so they went on a date night to rekindle the relationship. During the date night T was texting me and some other guys till they got home. T wanted to buy a sexy lingerie to seduce BF and sent pictures about it to guy friends to ask for their opinion (she was not wearing it). I told her that was not a good move. Her relationship started to go south and T was desperate writing to me every day about her mental state. She stopped taking part in our lessons. T then asked for my opinion. I hesitated but she told me she wants to know. I told her that she destroys intimacy by having a lot of guy friends and chatting till dawn with them. It was Friday night when I wrote this and even then she spent the evening seperate from her BF. T was hanging out with 2 guy friends. I told T that she should be more careful bc people have a negative view on girls with a lot of male friends and they might judge her and advise her BF against being with her. I even sent her videos with psychologist talking about male-female friendships and partner poaching. T got very upset. She questioned me about my intentions and basically called me a control freak. Then I got some silent treatment from her.

I may be the AH, because she told me before that her BF is not jealous of her friends.

But suffice it to say, he’s asked me to do my best to have a positive relationship with his mom. 

There have been a few scenarios over the past year, and I’m left wondering if I’m overreacting and being too sensitive. 

#1- MIL knows I’m struggling with my weight and on medication to help with weight loss. She made a comment at lunch one day that she gained a few pounds and just added in walking and walked the weight right off. Ending with saying “it was that easy!” She also said “always skip the pasta,” as I’m literally eating pasta at the table, the one time that month I let myself indulge a little.

#2- We went shopping where she bought herself a $5k tennis bracelet (after blaming my husbands absent father for why she has no retirement money), drops $500 at Ulta, and then we’re at dinner where she tells me: “ You should dress up more, wear more make up, put on some nice heels. You’ll feel so much better about yourself.”

#3- She asks me 5 days before the wedding if she can bring a random date and bribes my husband with $800 towards our honeymoon. I ended up feeling obliged to say yes. He behaves like a frat boy during the reception and shouts at me “let’s play drinking games.” I pointed out the immature behavior to MIL and she got offended and explained he just likes being the life of the party. 

#4- I hosted Thanksgiving this week. My stuffing was literally baking in the oven. She pulls out a box of Stove Top stuffing, says “I never like homemade stuffing” and proceeds to cook the box on the stove. When it’s done she looked at me, smiled, and said “see, that was so much faster than yours.” 

In all of these scenarios I end up having a serious talk afterwards with my husband explaining that I’m left feeling dismissed and hurt. But I’m doing my best to keep the peace. He’s tried to defend her, but in the end he feels upset too and apologizes that I’m having to deal with it. I’m not even sure what I expect him to do anyway. 

So what’s the verdict?

Last week, I went on a trip to Disney World with my best friend Melne (F32) and her 5-year-old daughter Sue. On our way to Florida, we were seated on an airplane in first class with only a couple in front of us (there oddly were no disabled individuals on the flight). The couple was talking audibly loud and we quickly learned that they were flying to Florida for Disney as well. And their talk soon got very odd. I'll use their names to make this less confusing (more on why I know their names later): Kendall &amp; Jack. The first odd comment came from Kendall. She told Jack, ""I can't wait until I see Mickey Mouse so I can do all the things I ever wanted to do to him."" Jack then responded, ""and I can't wait to poach Donald Duck!"" Melne and I looked at each other bewildered while they continued talking about their semi-maniacal plans for Disney before ordering sangrias from the stewardess. They didn't converse any more besides Kendall saying something about ""the body"" when the plane landed. That was the final straw for me. No way were they going to Disney and doing whatever they were going to do to the character workers.

As soon as we were told we could get off the plane, I opened the upper storage unit and took not only my carry-on but also one of Kendall and Jack's. Melne took her bag and the couple's other carry-on. Kendall and Jack must've noticed that we took their bags because we heard screaming while we were getting off the plane, so we started running. When I say that we runned from the plane into the airport, I mean that we runned. Even Sue runned. We stopped once we got to a bathroom and changed our clothes so that we hopefully wouldn't be noticed. When we got to the baggage claim, Melne and I hid Kendall and Jack's carry-ons in our main suitcases. We oddly didn't see either of them again, but it was still a long shot... they could've had eTickets or no tickets at all yet. At the hotel, we finally opened their bags. We found tags with their names (this is when we found out their names), clothing, hygiene products, and lots of pills. I thought we wouldn't find their tickets until Melne found them in a zipped pocket of Jack's bag! I literally felt like Wonder Woman in that moment... we had saved the people behind Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Rapunzel, Frozen, and all the others. We decided to leave the tickets at the hotel desk for anybody who wanted free tickets. I'm pretty sure two members of the hotel staff themselves ended up with them, but all was well as long as Kendall and Jack didn't get to harass Disney characters.

The issue stems from the fact the family car is a 5 seater. Both my parents drive as does my gf. We called my parents the other night and they told us my brother's(M17) gf(F16) would be coming. Both my parents drive as does my gf. I told them me and gf would not be driving as she wants to drink. 

Today, my gf told me it was weird and rude of my parents to expect her to drive, and I argued that since they were taking us out it wasn't that much to ask. She broke down on me, saying I never support her over them. I disagreed, saying that I had taken her side completely, literally telling them we're not driving instantly and then later asking if they can both drive. She is now refusing to come, saying that she isn't welcome and that the only reason she was invited was because of an ulterior motive, but this literally makes no sense to me as if they didn't invite her the outcome would be all 5 people could fit in one car. 

I think it's not a huge deal to expect her to drive when they are paying for her meal, as obviously brother and his gf can't drive as they are not of age.

Me and my best friend boyfriend’s couldn’t sleep in the middle of the night yesterday especially with all the rabbits. 

It wasn’t that bad until we were saw a beetle or a cockroach, it was big. I couldn’t help but leave the tent and her boyfriend followed me out. Until, I felt the need to itch down my back, showed him my back and he saw a beetle bite. He said he felt something moving under his shirt and he lifted it up to see a weird looking bug. 

We start running towards the showers that are accompanied with the camping site and all of them weren’t working apart from one, which was extremely hot one minute and cold the next.

We both get in, start washing ourselves because we detest insects and we feel yucky. The shower door was opened, we just start profusely trying to get the water on each other and continuously moving the shower head. 

His and my girlfriend walk in and just drop their jaws like we were doing something wrong. I do the awkward face of “it’s not what it looks like” and his girlfriend said “you guys have been gone for awhile, so we were looking for you”. 

My girlfriend doesn’t say anything she just leaves  with his gf and we both come to understand how weird it looks. We went back into the tent and just went to sleep. 

The next morning (the day we are meant to leave) it was immensely awkward, on the ride back it was torturous. 

I spoke with my girlfriend and best friend and they both said they weren’t upset by it, but their behaviour shows differently.

I am very light sensitive, especially at night.  It’s not uncommon for me to get bad migraines from light exposure.  

My neighbor has Christmas lights lining the roof of his house.  His house is a single story building close to the property line and as such, these lights are about fifty feet from my bedroom window.  When my lights are off in my room, the lights from his house illuminate the entire space.  

Last year, from Thanksgiving through March, he kept these lights on a constant cycle of blinking and strobing patterns.  They do turn off at midnight but I often am in bed before then.  This means that as I am trying to sleep (or simply enjoy my space) I am living in a night club.  

Last year, I left a note and got no response.  A few weeks later (in March) I went over and begged him to change the setting.  At this point he said he couldn’t figure out the settings and just angrily turned them off.  I was hoping this year he wouldn’t put them back on, but he has.  

The other member of my household is not as bothered by the lights (because her bedroom is on the other side of the house).  She is very shy and has had negative altercations with this neighbor in the past.  She thinks it would be rude of me to go over and leave another note or to try to speak with him again.  

I am not a grinch, I like the lights when they are on steady— it’s the strobing that drives me crazy.  I don’t have the means to get blackout curtains right now and I also enjoy the morning light that comes into my room and would rather not give that up.  

I have literally considered calling the police some nights when I am desperate and sleep deprived because there is no way to get him to turn them off.  I wish there was some kind of autistic adult advocate I could get to come explain to him just how bad this is for me.

My BIL is very educated in his beliefs and the two of us often go back and forth and have honest debates. I have had my views shifted and I have made him change his ideas before as well. We both are willing to learn and don't just say random stuff we see on the internet. The problem is my older sister (F31) just listens to everything my BIL says and agrees without knowing the facts. I tend to ignore this normally but after Covid it has started getting suffocating. 

This last Thanksgiving I was talking to my dad just about recent events and stuff going on and my sister said that my way of thinking how things should be handled is wrong. I asked what she meant and she just said some generic bs my BIL would say. I inquired more what she meant and she just told me to shut up and stop cornering her with questions. Eventually my BIL came in and finished her thought and she said yeah that's why. I told my BIL that I didn't think of it like that and then explained my POV and I ended up agreeing with his POV a bit more. Later on we were watching the Coyboys game and my uncle and I were talking about the current state of the economy and where we thought it might go. My SIL again joined in and said some very generic things that my BIL would have said and told us that we need to do this or we will be screwed. I asked for more details and she said that I just need to listen to her. At this point I was pretty annoyed and just asked my BIL because I was genuinely curious what she was getting at and he had a lot of facts and data that I never heard of.

I (23nb) love birds. I wanted to be an ornithologist, I’ve had parrots and chickens, my grandma bred birds for show. I don’t have any pet birds right now, so I’ve taken to feeding my local wild birds. I live in a rural area with a ton of wildlife, I live on a half acre, and I’ve had bird feeders my entire life. 

In the last few years (I had moved out at the time, but moved back now, so not sure when), we’ve started getting California Scrub Jays. Pretty blue birds, on the small end, but they love peanuts. My local flock (I’ve seen up to 3 at a time, but it could easily be more) has started to recognize me, and waits every morning for me to give them their peanuts. I do not hand feed the birds, but I do a bit of a call when I put the nuts out, so they know it’s breakfast time. Not loud, softer than I did for my chickens, and I only do it once. They’re awesome birds, and get excited when they see me through the window. I got them a mini picnic bench that I stack with treats every morning, and it makes my day. 

My neighbor is a Karen, the kind that will report you to the HOA, but that refuses to cut her grass and that lets her dog bark 24/7. She ended up ranting at me the other day, and it took her a while to get to the point. 

She blames me for the scrub jays being around, and says their calls annoy her, and that I need to stop feeding them so they go away. She seems to not understand that they were here anyways, and she really doesn’t understand that I can’t ban a type of bird from our yards. She didn’t mention me calling them, just that the birds annoy her. 

My mom is on her side. My mom loves birds, adores the scrub jays, but she says she can understand that their call can get annoying, and says that I should stop to keep the peace. The scrub jays literally showed up in the neighborhood while I lived in my own apartment, and were there before I started feeding them. They’re not just going to go away. I didn’t summon these birds, and I’m not going to stop feeding animals because someone is throwing a tantrum. We live in the woods, there’s gonna be birds.

Am I just being an unreasonable bird person? I really don’t want to take down my bird and squirrel feeders (the jays use both), but my mom is starting to get to me, especially since she loves them, too. I get that bird sounds can be annoying while you try to sleep, but isn’t that par for the course when it comes to rural living? I just, I guess I’m torn.

I text my neighbor I'm like  did your camera's catch anything about what happened to  our  gate?

 Sunday afternoon she calls me and let me know thats it was her friemd i am calling her Karen because of her sense of entitlement. She will give you shall give you a call to discuss what happened. 

Sunday night  goes by no call? Monday no call,  Tuesday i text my neighbor again can you please send Karen information.  I called and left a message I'm like it's been 3 days I've stewing,  she calls, she's like oh I'll come see you tomorrow before work. You know life gets busy, and  I'm like OK I'm trying to  be polite, because my neighbors, dont want to ruin the relationshop with them. But  it's really making me angry but whatever she comes Wednesday morning and she's just like oh well we'll try and prop it up with a rebarb and we'll do fix. I''m like yeah it's a temporary measure sure it's great but I'm like please provide me in writing a solution. I'm expecting her to provide her details of her insurance her license and  and give me more details of what happened.  Thursday She's like I'll come and look figure out Thursday.  Thursday's is a big fog storm so didn't expect much.  Friday, preping for a meeting and i look out the window. 

 I see people at the gate I go to grab my jacket and my rush outside to see what's going on,  well  she with the neighbors had already gone ahead and try to fix the damage  iron gate and propped it back up and it stable now. 

 I'm like you couldn't ring the doorbells let me know you're gonna do this today. The neighbor  asked if it  was okay  i said no and i went to deal with my guest who had arrived.   We got busy with our other commitments of the day.. 

I got an email from her saying well you know we did the best we could  and we good now. 

 I'm like no.  I sent her an email back saying no, the solution's  it a tempaory fix  and i told  her what i was expecting. She writes another email saying I thought the temproary fix was enough and wasn't expecting this from you
.
 So to that email I wrote have 3 options 1 you can pay for that I can get 3 quotes  and you can pay for the damage 2 you can give me your insurance information and they can make a claim  or 3 I get my insurance 
 to pay for it but that requires me calling the cops and having to make a report  and that will put on you in hard sitation.  Failure to stay at accident, not providing  your information and cauing property damage.

We’ve known one another for yrs &amp; started becoming really close for 1.5 years now. When we started dating, he had custody of his 5 yr old daughter Fri - Sun &amp; was very active throughout the weekdays, as well as financially because mom is a deadbeat.

3 months into dating &amp; the moms house was raided by the police. She’s had a history of stealing identities &amp; drug addiction. She has 2 adult children &amp; didn’t raise them either. They broke the door down &amp; found her 25 yr old son at the kitchen table just about to shoot up. Mom &amp; the 5 yr old daughter were upstairs &amp; the police took the daughter immediately &amp; a neighbor took her during the raid. The 5 year old watched her mom &amp; half bro being handcuffed &amp; taken away. Child Protective Services was called &amp; my bf went to pick up his daughter. He was told that he had to take her in for a drug test immediately &amp; she tested positive for fentanyl. A few months later the court has given the mom 6 hours of a court monitored visit per week, with calls on Tues &amp; Thurs but she’s able to attend all the daughter’s extracurricular activities, practices &amp; games, etc. so she essentially gets free visits by just showing up at a game or a practice &amp; my bf doesn’t want to be the “bad guy” &amp; allows them to visit for a little while after these events. She shows up &amp; calls sporadically.

We spent our 1st Thanksgiving together with my family &amp; his daughter had the scheduled Thurs call with her mom. My bf asked before leaving the house if she wanted to call her mom so she wouldn’t be stuck on the phone at dinner or anxiously waiting for a call. His daughter said no. As soon as they arrive, he tells me how much he is dreading the call &amp; that he’s anxiously counting down the time. His daughter didn’t ask about it &amp; didn’t appear anxious at all. She was busy creating Thanksgiving crafts with the other kids in my family &amp; doing kid stuff.

Her mom ended up not calling &amp; sent a stupid Thanksgiving meme instead. My bf expressed how disappointed he was for his daughter and how it was upsetting that her mom couldn’t even call her to wish her a Happy Thanksgiving. His daughter still hadn’t asked &amp; didn’t seem to care. Right before dinner was served, she became tired &amp; sad so he placed her in a spare bedroom to lay down. During dinner he kept expressing how upset he was to me and I tried to be understanding but was getting irritated. It made me feel selfish because I know she’s a 5 yr old child that misses her mother, but at that point I just felt like he allowed his 5 yr old’s mom to basically “consume our holiday”. 

We didn’t finish eating, because during dinner we both got up to check on his daughter &amp; he felt guilty for keeping her there because she was so sad. So we came out, said hurried goodbyes to everyone &amp; left.

I(20f) had family photos done today with some sort of family members. For context, I live with my older half sister and her husband while I’m in college. I participate in holidays with his family as that’s just who they choose to spend them with. 

For family photos, I got my hair braided professionally rather than just wearing down my curls as I have in the past. My sister and brother in law both thought that it looked nice the way it was done.

When I got to the venue for photos (we drove in three separate groups), my brother in law’s parents asked me if that’s how I was going to wear my hair for the photos. I said yes, it took the lady 6 hours to complete, and I loved how they turned out. They told me that they believed that the braids are “inappropriate” for family photos, and that it would be better if I took them out and wore my hair down or straightened. We were already at the venue, and the photographer was waiting for us to be ready, so I told them I wouldn’t be able to take them out as it’d be at least a 30-60 minute process even if I cut them to make it easier.

They got upset and said I should have asked them first before doing such a “nonconventional” style, and that it was going to look strange in contrast to everyone else. During the photos, they had me placed on the end every time I was included, and had multiple photos taken without me so that they could have some “uniformity”. 

At the end of the session, they asked the photographer if it was possible to mask my hair in the final edits so it doesn’t look as strange compared to everyone else. When I tried to get my sister and BIL to back me up, they suddenly flipped the script and said that they agreed it wasn’t that great of a choice. The only people that remained neutral were my BIL’s sister and her husband, who said he has many family members that braid their hair in a similar fashion.

My GF And I are moving, and I asked my parents if I could borrow their SUV to move some expensive electronics I have (Xbox Series X, PC, etc etc). 

I asked my GF to stay in the car to watch my stuff, but i left my car doors open for easy transport. 

I was busy locking up my PC box, and had my Xbox laying on the back carseat, when my neighbors dog ran up to the car and jumped in, and peed all over my Xbox and car seat. I screamed FUCK at the top of my lungs and the dog ran out and back into the house. 

My GF tried to comfort me but I told her to not talk to me for like 10 seconds and stormed over to the neighbors house. I banged on their door and a older women walked out and I told her what happened.

She said ""well you should close your doors when moving"" and I just went off on her and demanded she get me some cleaning supplies since its her damn dog. She went inside to get stuff crying about how she's disabled or whatever. While she was inside I swore at no one. I was angry for two reasons:

1) The fact that my Xbox is most likely damaged (costed $499 before tax)
2) I have to tell my parents that a dog peed on their car seat so they'll be pissed 

The neighbors ended up giving me some stuff to clean my seat and said they would reimburse me if my Xbox was damaged (got their phone number). For the rest of the night i was slamming car doors, yelling about how stupid the neighbors were, and stomping around In a angry mood.

Later that week my GF said she agreed with the fact that it was the neighbors responsibility but that my anger was scary and she didnt like how I reacted. My parents agreed. 

AITA ?

My brother had the worst of it, though, being homeschooled since he was 6 and being smothered by my parents in a million different ways, still to this day.

Anyway, last year, my brother was a sophomore in college, and I suggested he'd do a study abroad program. He's been studying Japanese for years and always wanted to go, so it seemed a natural idea. I had doubts my parents would let him go, but also hopes they had loosened up since they forbade it with me. 

The next day, I got a phone call from them saying they were going to Japan next year as a family vacation. Basically, they heard about my brother and I's conversation, said hell no to those plans, and turned my brother's study abroad semester into a 2-week vacation tourist trap affair for the family. 

Their smothering really bothered me, but I dropped it. But I also made a new plan. I doubted my parents' Japan vacation would really happen (they were and still are very paranoid about the panorama, openly vowing never to go on a plane again), so I saved up enough money for my brother and I to go to Japan next year, just by ourselves. Ideally, he should get the independent experience of immersing himself in the country by himself, but I figured a temporary trip with his sister would be the next best step, as I'd give him more space and an experience to grow without being under his parents' watchful (smothering) eye for the first time in his life.

And so, over the next year, my parents barely mentioned the Japan trip again while I saved up. A month ago, out of the blue I said I was visiting Japan soon and invited my brother to go with me. When my parents found out, they asked, ""What about our Japan trip?"" I said, ""I never heard you mention it again so I figured it wasn't happening."" (And it isn't---they never made concrete plans to go.)

They asked if they could come, and I said I'd like it to just be me and my brother. They said he couldn't go with only me, and I said it's not their choice, it's his. (Which is why I made sure to pay for everything, so they couldn't hold that over his head.) They had been upset and offended all the way up until that point, but that really set them off. 

The plans are still set for only my brother and I to go, but they are very upset with me.

I am in college and live in a house with two roommates, B and C (we are all 19). Our fridge desperately needed to be cleaned out because it had this horrible smell that would seep into any food that got put into it and make it taste weird (""fridge taste""). I couldn't remember who owned what food, so I put a piece of tape on everything that could go bad and texted the roommate group chat to take the tape off anything they wanted to keep. 

C was fine with this, but B texted ""also you may not throw out my food"" a day later, to which I asked them to label what food was theirs. They refused, saying that they had to take a plane the next day. I explained that I would not know what their food was if they did not label it, and that it would take less than a minute to do it. They told me to ""deal with your own problems instead of projecting them onto the fridge"".

This argument continued for a while with the gist of me saying ""please deal with your food it will take literally no time"" and them saying that they wanted to wait until after thanksgiving and that the ""fridge taste"" was caused by the pipes and not food. 

At this point, I'm talking irl with C, who is also concerned about the state of the fridge but did not want to get involved as they are a little afraid of B and did not want B upset at them.  I was like, whatever I'm going to put my food down and C helped me draft a text that was basically ""this is disgusting and I'm going to throw your food out whether you like it or not if you don't label it"". B finally relented and said they would go through the food, but not before saying ""why couldn't you act like an adult"", and then texting me outside of the group chat (direct quote) ""OP this  is unrelated to the fridge thing I'll clean my stuff out tonight but can you please go to therapy or something because you're unbearable to be around, like genuinely and seriously. and you seem very unhappy and i want the best for you""

C assured me that I was not ""unbearable"" and I went in my room and smoked weed but it's a few days later and I just can't get this thing out of my head.

Jess has only said she was busy and Kate is trying to convince me to text instead. She messaged me she'd like to help with ""whatever issue i got"", and i would've fallen for it if it wasn't for the ignoring she did the whole day friday.

Hello Everyone

I am not a native English speaker so no judging xD

I am 25 M, live in Europe for around 3 years now but I am from Central Asia.

My fiancé is 21 F and lives in my country, and we are going to get married next year.

The thing is her brother wanted to do some business and now has a huge debt.

There is some debt from bank in my fiancé’ name too – it is not huge but still it is big for my country standards. I want to help her and she kinda asked for help – because there was a letter from court yesterday since they missed payment day. Just for context I am not a rich guy but I am starting to feel good for around 6 months now, so I don’t have a lot of savings. I can give her money ( I have to work around 2 months for it at max) but I also want to save for our future. I mean it is not her debt but her brother’s. He took the risk of doing business with the wrong people and paying for it. I live by actions and consequences principle. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I am writing it here.

She is upset about it and sometimes cries because of her family – I mean she has very good heart and I really love her…

Originally we had already planned our guest list with the theme/intention of: people who have supported our marriage over the years. 

Previously this year for Husband's birthday party, we did not invite his 2 aunts. I don't have a real answer as to why they weren't invited as he controlled the guest list for his b-day party. The slight answer I did get is that he ""forgot"".

Now because Husband feels bad/guilty for not inviting Aunts to his b-day party, he wants to invite them to our vow renewal.

I don't want them there! I don't feel they were supportive of our marriage and they didn't make the initial cut. This renewal is not a second chance to include them because of his birthday. It's about our marriage. I don't see where they supportive at all. 

I've heard mismatch stories from Husband about his mother taking up for us against Aunts talking bad about us and then it switches to Aunts taking up for us against his mom from talking about us then it switched to neither talked bad about us.

Either way, I don't want any negativity on our day! I don't care about what may or may not have happened. They haven't shown any real love for our marriage, so I don't need any fake love at our vow renewal.

Husband and I haven't talked about it recently. But in my mind, I've already checked out of planning a vow renewal that includes fake loving people.

He also is very particular about how his food is cooked, refusing to eat anything out of the microwave and being strongly hesitant to using the gas stove.

The reason he dislikes microwaves— he says its not because of the radiation, but I think that is it. He’s read the articles that say its harmless, but I think this almost falls into a phobia category, where he knows it’s safe but still is incredibly adverse. 

Normally he doesn’t bother me when I cook microwave meals, but today I went to put my leftovers in the microwave without removing them from the styrofoam box. He stopped me, asking me PLEASE to not microwave styrofoam. 

I’m currently sick and a little fed up with everything right now. I didn’t want to re-plate my food and then have to do dishes after, so I microwaved the leftovers anyways. 

Now, he’s being all huffy. He even left the room when I sat down to eat with him.

After he was kicked out he proceeded to cause a fight and scene over me apparently making him sh**t in the alley (I was mad he came in - which to add I caught him in the fridge and upon further investigation the very little bit of alcohol that was in my fridge was gone) so he didn’t even attempt to use the washroom and other things. I did say to my fiancé he wasn’t allowed at the house or in my van until he apologized because I felt super disrespected - which he didn’t because he said I disrespected him for calling him a child and telling him to grow up.

We're mostly in  agreement about everything except, I've been kind of having an issue  with what she wears especially at nighttime when she unwind and tend to  relax a bit as she says. I think that what she wears is inappropriate.  She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's  just ""her style"" and is what she's been wearing for years. Not just  that, but she'd come out of her room dressing like that to grab water or  use the bathroom. While yes, it was just me who saw her dressed like  that I honestly could not risk having an argument with my husband over  it. I suggested she buys some pjs but she said that she doesn't ""feel  comfortable"" in them.

Last night, I  saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was  dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak  to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up  telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that  and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing,  that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the  sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect  my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my  house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then  stormed off to her room.

We haven't talked since then and she is refusing to talk about it.

And he kept saying that I was the toxic one in our relationship.

All the things I remember is talking about the fight a few days previously. Apparently he thought I was attacking him when I was trying to explain something and that resulted in him attacking me twice as bad. It’s always how it’s been. I ended up calling him toxic and he didn’t like it and called me a bitch. And when I explained to him how I felt like unloved by him (I was crying). He said that I was a sook. 

Let’s go into some backstory of what’s his done. I can admit that I’ve been a little toxic. I tend to lash out when I face abandonment or I ended up crying like a sook (that’s what he says). Here are some of the things we’ve done. Now he says that this is all my fault and not his. 

Our first fight was bc I wanted to watch a barbie movie (not with him just watch one in general). And he called me childish and said it was unattractive. And I told him he didn’t need to be mean. That was the first time he broke up with me. Whenever he’s mad at me he would break up with me. 

He has told me he doesn’t fucking care about my interests. Which lets just say I’m an emotional person with autism and hearing someone say they don’t care about my special interest. I didn’t take it very well.

We had a lot more since. Another was my fault. I started it by saying that he didn’t care (I was in an episode and genuinely think ppl don’t care during these and just need reassurance). I’m pretty good at controlling myself from saying those things but sometimes they’re just really bad. And he didn’t like that and was giving me a tone being like I brought you things etc. i don’t remember much of it. Later that night we had another fight and he then went ‘if you think I won’t care than I’ll show you I won’t fucking care.’ Which resulted in me balling my eyes out badly. After 5mins of crying. He then breathed like I did and then told me to shut the fuck up. So I muted myself and cried myself to sleep on call. 

He told me he would 💀 himself bc of me. 

He’s insulted me. Called me stupid, an idiot, bitch, cunt, etc. and he always says it’s my fault for him insulting me. I will admit I’ve called him names but that was after months of him just insulting me over and over again that I just snapped. 

Into last nights fight. I don’t remember much. I have bad short term memory. I remember when I told him (crying) that I was tired of being insulted by him and he fucking laughed. I told him he needed to change but he said he liked himself like this. And he even told me I was the toxic one for bringing things up all the time and attacking him. And that he’s never been the toxic one. And told me to add him back when I realise I’m toxic and will stop attacking him. 

Am I the toxic one? Honestly. If I am I want to change.

I (f20) have a friend group in uni that hang out whenever we’re free on campus (we’re mostly commuters so don’t go home.) One of my friends A, is a Muslim and wears a hijab. I’m a lesbian. 

Yesterday A mentioned she had gotten a proposal and she was going to have dinner with the guy. I know that’s how relationships work in her culture but I guess my surprise showed cause she asked if anything was wrong. I said I didn’t understand how people just propose out of the blue in her culture and she said it wasn’t as if people propose knowing nothing, they usually run in the same circles, find someone attractive etc. I asked if they ran in the same circles then and she asked if I was calling her unattractive. 

I said no but our friend L jumped in and said I was being pretty rude. I explained that it wasn’t about finding her ugly I just couldn’t see her in a romantic or sexual way, she wasn’t really a prospect to me even though I like girls. A got pretty upset and said I didn’t need to see her that way but to assume that no one else could was insulting. She then brought up how she had previously confided in me and L about how she felt masculinised because she dressed the way she does and I was just reinforcing that.

This resulted in one of them berating me after I asked why they didn’t buy me a drink. He was soon chewed out by the rest of the group and the matter was dropped. I spoke to him saying I was only being sarcastic shook his hand and that was the end of it. He then left the group with another colleague for awhile. We all reunited on the train home and I was sat with them. The other colleague he was with was also visibly drunk (I was too at this point) we were talking about our home areas and she began poking fun at me for where I’m from. Having enough of being walked over and disrespected I bit back stating that it could be worse and I could be where she was from “where all the barbarians of society who don’t make it to childhood are from”. She immediately took offence to this comment and chewed me out taking it as if I was targeting her children? I really don’t understand how she took it like that but never the less I apologised stating I meant no ill intent and was just trying to be funny and not to take me too seriously as I was drunk. I don’t think she accepted my apology. The guy who had berated me earlier validated her by siding with her and I felt very awkward. I’m now in a horrible position where I’m scared there will be repercussions for this and I’ll loose my job or something. Am I over thinking this or have I been an asshole?

I was commissioning a $50 piece of an OTP I ship from a cartoon I watch. It was just an SFW picture of the ships fully clothed in bed. It is a little steamy, as one girl is on top of the other girl and they're pretty clearly in a major lip lock and blushing as they're doing it. So I ask an artist to make this piece and she says its possible for her to make the piece. She says that she typically takes 50% of the payment before and 50% after. So I agree and send her $25. A few days go by and she sends me a FULLY COMPLETED picture of the two girls I asked for lying next to each other in bed. Pretty obviously what I DIDN'T ask for. I tell her this and she says that she's not comfortable drawing what I asked for in terms of them being in the positions they are. I ask her why she didn't just tell me that at the beginning of the commission and she says she needed money, so she was willing to take what she could get. So I asked her to change it to what I asked so I would be satisfied with her drawing. She said no and then told me to send the remainder of the payment. I told her I would NOT be doing that unless she did as I asked and send me an altered picture of what I originally asked for.

I'm not gonna ask her to send me back the $25 I initially sent as she still did do half of what I wanted, but I'm not gonna send her the other half of the $50 if I'm not satisfied with the final piece. She told me that I was scamming money from her and that I had to send her the last of the money. But I'm adamant about not sending her money unless I feel satisfied with the service she provided. And as she only did half of what I asked, I feel only half satisfied. I understand not everybody is comfortable drawing what I asked with one person being on top of the other, but I feel it's not unreasonable to not send her full payment if I'm not satisfied with her work.

They were at a client visit at Mesa Verde Bank, and were given a tour to the bank expansion building models. Kim seemed overwhelmed. I commented that she should learn to expand her practice to handle her work load, and that at least she hired an assistant - referring to the paralegal. My boyfriend heard this and corrected me, and said 'no she's a paralegal'. I said okay, that's providing assistance to Kim. 

He then asked me if I even know the difference between an assistant to a paralegal, and said because he knows more about the legal field, he assumed that I didn't know the difference. I said of course I know the difference between an administrative assistant and a paralegal, and I said it's very condescending that he assumes that I didn't know the difference. I also explained to him that I was using the term assistant in the broader sense. I told him that please don't be condescending towards me. He asked to explain to him what the difference is between a paralegal and an admin assistant. I did. And he said that it's just sometimes I pretend to know more than what I actually know. I was that like - what's that supposed to mean? 

He then said okay, so what do you want me to do here then. How could I have asked this question and not sound condescending? I was like, just don't assume what I know or don't know. I said that I don't know the exact way he should have said/asked the question and said and I think he is responsible to figuring that out. Then he said ""I'm not responsible for anything, if you want me to do something, then you tell me what to do"". I said, I already told you that what you said was condescending and hurt my feelings, and also not to assume that I don't know certain things. He said he is not responsible for my feelings. I said if he cared about my feelings he would figure out a way to not be condescending. He said that is not true, he said even if he doesn't figure it out it doesn't mean he doesn't care. 

I said he is invalidating how I feel which is gas lighting, he said that I think everything is gaslight. He asked me if I know what gaslighting means. I was like, I wouldn't be using that word if I didn't know what it means. And his statement here is again condescending. 

I'm very confused by this entire conversation. Am I responsible for telling him how to not be condescending? I already told him to not assume that I don't know certain things. He is saying I need to tell him what I want him to say, or how to ask a question.

I need to know AITA. We recently spent a decent amount of time and effort to update our kids play area. It was not something I was onboard for - but my wife seemed to think that it will help them to keep thing organized and it would be future proofed a bit for as they grow later. I was annoyed because we has spent money on shelving and stuff before and it never solved the problem - all I felt was bullied into the deciosn and if I didn't make it a yes with here then I am at fault. 

One of the items in the room that was to be added was a TV for a little gaming console. I'm like sure okay. My wife asks me to look at some of the units we have lying around the house to see if any would be good quality, compatible etc. So I did, and what I found was that we could use something new - or at least replace one of the older ones with something better since Black Friday was coming and give them an older tv. At first she agreed this would be a good idea - so I started looking around for decent features and price. 

A week later we have the discussion again about this, now she wants to save the money, take something down from one of the rooms and because she is considering cost - which I get (but we could have done not going forward with any of this). I continue to think about this a bit more and I agree cost is one thing - I don't want to take away from our finances. So I think about some solutions that would still allow us to do this. So what I came up with was to sell something that I was not suing anymore for work - just didn't need it. I made $1050 selling it. I then went to the store where I was looking around before and bought an open box floor model, cash - no tax. (this was like a super nice tv almost 70% off. I bought it for less than I made selling the item - so I still had cash to spare too. 

So now the tv's are all on the wall in their place. Now that I have done this, she is furious - in fact she took the kids for a sleep over at the grandparents - because she needs some space. 

I have to say I put up with a lot - from everyone. When she wants to do something she thinks she consults me, and she does to some extent, but often she buys tons of stuff for the kids that I don't think they need - no discussion - just happens. Sometimes these purchases are from my account, sometimes they are from hers. Note what was done to the kids room came to of mostly hers.

Lastly I should mention I deal with a lot here  - I'm not saying that as an excuse but there are issues that do contribute to my thinking that sometimes - don't I deserve a break? Don't I deserve to be upset? I bottle it up instead or go with whatever everyone else says because I don't want the fight. 

And when stuff happens she has family to talk to friends etc. I don't - hence why I am writing this here.

It's a regional competition that has hundreds of students competing who come from states nearby, so it's very safe and not a random, unauthorized trip to go do drugs at Burning Man, or whatever. 

Normally, the invited students and my music teacher will carpool together to the competition and stay in the same hotel room, and of course, guys and girls stay in different hotel rooms. This year, there would be six people going, including me and my music teacher. We would be gone from Friday to Sunday.

When I told my parents about the trip, they immediately assumed they would be going too, which makes sense, because I've never been allowed to go on these overnight, away-from-my-parents type of trips before. But that was when I was underage, and I figured now at 20, it would be different. They started talking about getting new, better-looking clothes for my brother (14M, he would be going too) for the trip, and I told them no need, I'm going to carpool with everyone else and go by myself.

To say the least, they did *not* like that, and after they cooled off, they called me upstairs to their room to say they talked about it, and the family would go with me this year, and maybe down the line I can go by myself next year.

I said, word from word, ""I appreciate that, guys, but I'm comfortable going alone and I can handle it."" They said they weren't asking, but telling me, and if I went by myself anyway, that would be disrespectful. Again, I said, ""I still think I'm going to go by myself, but I hear you and appreciate your concern."" In return, they said if I'm so comfortable ""disrespecting them and shirking them off"", then maybe I need to find a new home to live in and find a way to pay my tuition when I come back. 

I figured they were bluffing, so when it came to the day, I packed my bags and got inside my friend's car who came by to pick me up. Went to the trip with them mad at me, came back, and it was a long fight just for me to get into the house and stay the night, but they're still very pissed at me.

I think that what she wears is inappropriate.  She usually wear silky nightwear (nightgowns mostly). She says that's  just ""her style"" and is what she's been wearing for years.

Last night, I  saw her in the kitchen grabbing something from the fridge and was  dressed in a purple, strapped, knee length nightgown. I tried to speak  to her about it but it didn't go well. We started arguing and I ended up  telling her to stop leaving her room when she's wearing stuff like that  and she argued that there was nothing wrong with what she was wearing,  that it wasn't like she was walking around naked or anything of the  sort. I told her it's my home and she's a guest and should just respect  my request but she responded saying that just because she lives in my  house does not mean that I have the right to control what she wears then  stormed off to her room.

I (31m) went to my parents house for thanksgiving. It was a normal thanksgiving, watching football, and eating food. We had a couple of heated discussions and then everything would go back to normal. Now I don’t remember how the argument got started. But my mom had mentioned something about our Italian heritage. I jokingly mentioned that we are not as Italian she thinks we are. A couple of years ago I had done a 23 and Me and it showed I was only 1.2% Sicilian Italian. The rest is all Irish. 


Then started the heated argument. My mom (51f) was stating that she has all the birth certificates of our great great grandparents being born over there. Then my dad (49m)chimed in stating the same thing. I then stated that just because they were born there doesn’t mean they are actually Italian. I then followed up stating that ‘Just because I was born in America doesn’t mean I was Native American’. (I know I know. May have been an asshole thing to say. But it was the only example I could come up with). 


Then my dad started speaking very aggressively. I then got threatened by dad when I told him there was no reason for him to be speaking so aggressively about a subject mom and I were talking about. I respectfully asked him to just lower the tone because it was aggressive. Then he started really yelling. Told him I am going home because I don’t deserve to be talked to like he was talking to me. He then said ‘I’m right here and I back my shit up’, as he was standing within a couple inches to a foot in front of me. While pounding his chest at least once.  I then proceeded to tell him that I know longer am allowing anyone to talk to me the way he did. And that I am 31 years old and deserved to get treated with respect. Then he went on a rampage stating I was selfish and have always been a baby about things and can never admit when I am wrong. Then said something about how I forgot to say happy fathers, and that for all the years he raised me like his own son when I wasn’t. I then told my brother (18m) and mom I loved them both and left without raising my voice. Got in the car and drove home.

On Thursday Thanksgiving My ex-wife Vanessa showed up at the door with my brother who she left me for and her for children by him and my first daughter from our failed marriage. I adore my daughter and so does my wife honestly I wish we had the money to get custody away from her but the child is not being abused and has a much better life My brother makes more money than me it's a long story.

My wife Amanda (21) welcome to them with a smile and ask them what they wanted to eat. I greeted my daughter with pleasant with my brother and then the problem started. My daughter referred to me as Uncle. I corrected her gently because I understand that as much as I try to be there her mother often keeps her from me. And I do my best to be the present father but my brother has that honor unfortunately he's the father in the house I'm the father that made her and I always will be.

That's when the problem started Vanessa began to yell tear Amanda down. Insulting her cooking, her accent (she's a Puerto Rican /Cuban) her parenting threatening to call CPS because our kids are wearing Walmart clothes and not designer like hers. Calling her a homewrecker (She isn't) we met the day my divorce was final which was Vanessa's idea not mine I wanted to work on things.

It got so bad that my poor wife started to cry. She's not a fragile woman but she had been up for 96 hours against my advice making food for 60 people for which I am very grateful. I Lost my mind I told Vanessa to shut the f*** up that she a better respect my wife in her house, that you should be grateful that my wife spent hours trying to cook a duck alorange that is as her request and that she's not a bad mother or bad woman or anything else.

My ex got pissed and said that if she didn't like the conversation then she would leave. This is where I might be the a****** I told her to do so at once and with no hesitation. She threatened that I would have my rights to my daughter terminated. I laughed and told her that she only allows me to see my daughter twice a year we've gone to court but nothing has come with it yet and that as far as I'm concerned she's my niece. She even call me Uncle. If she could not respect the mother of my children then she was no longer welcome in my house for the holidays.

I don't know if it's because of our 2 year age gap or because of me not being wealthy. 
His grandma would nag him on and on about our relationship till he left me for about a week because of it. She would tell him things like ""she's just using you"" ,""she's going to ruin your life"",and ""you grandpa would have been disappointed""
My bf praises his grandma and grandpa because they were their for him his whole life. 
Since me and my boyfriend meet each other online (we know each other for 3 years and been dating for a year) I haven't been able to physically be their for him. 
Me and him made an agreement to meet on my birthday (17th birthday) but somehow his grandma ends up getting deadly sick out of nowhere on my birthday. I was annoyed because me and him had that meet planned out for 7 months. I let it slide and our plans was held off for two months. 
Now that I'm turning 18 in a few days we had made a plan I would come and move in with him and his grandma for a few months till I get my own car and place. 
We had this planned for more than ten months. Yet again something happened with his grandma. My bf uncle had a stroke so his grandma needs a ride up there and my bf said if his Uncle didn't get out by Monday he wouldn't be able to make the trip to come get me. On my birthday!
I was annoyed and told him how I felt about it. Saying I don't understand why she couldn't take herself to the hospital to see him. She has a car. She has a phone. So he went on and tried to defend her saying ""she doesn't know how to use a GBS"" so I said ""your friend lives with you why can't he take her. We been planning this out for awhile and it just sucks we might have to cancel because she wants you to give her a ride. She realise on you too much when there are people there to help her""
He gets pissed at me saying it's not anyone responsibility to take care of his grandma. And I said ""your friend is living with you rent free so I don't understand why he can't help"" then he goes on to say I was being inconsiderate towards his grandma that she NEEDS him there because ""no one else will help her"".
I told him how I felt that I'm tried of feeling like #2 in this life and he gets pissed and starts to scream saying ""YOU WILL ALWAYS BE NUMBER 2. YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE THROUGH ALL MY PAINS. MY GRANDMA HAS ALWYAS BEEN HERE SHE IS ALWAYS #1"". I put my family above him and he would always rant saying he should be number one in my life. But I can't get the same respect? 
Afterwards, me and him didn't talk for 2 hrs. So I was talking to one of our mutual friends who I felt close to. She basically told me I was being the asshole in the situation that I can't force him to choose his grandma or me.

My (23f) bf (25 m) (let’s call him ron)are together for a month now and live together. He moved to nyc for me because I have a job here and he did not have a job where he was. I work in service and try to help my bf by getting him to work in the company I work for. That means I take my bf with me to see how I do jobs and I try to also teach him. Yesterday I was at a job with my bf and it didn’t go so well, I was stuck at the job and didn’t know how to continue it so I called my boss(who’s supposed to also maybe be Ron’s future boss) to ask for direction In finishing the job. My boss and I speak a different language and my boss asked me if ron was with me so I said In my language “yes ron is with me”
So ron heard his name in a sentence he doesn’t understand and thought I was talking shit about him to my boss because the job wasn’t going well he thought I was telling my boss that he fucked the job and thought I blaming him. He didn’t say a word looked pissed and went to sit in the car and I followed him to ask him what’s wrong and he gave me silent treatment. I started crying not understanding why he’s reacting this way and I had to leave the job and leave the customer there very unprofessional thing to do and my boss was pissed.
I blew up at my bf for leaving me in a job were supposed to do together and he got mad that I mentioned him in a situation that he had nothing to do with.

He married his ex when he was very young, and they divorced after about 5 years.

My husband has nieces/nephews ranging from about 10-13 years old. The first time I met them was at a family event when we were just dating. One of his nephews asked him where his ex was, what was the deal with me, would the ex be coming back? etc all in front of the family. It was uncomfortable for everyone, but my husband tried his best to explain divorce to a kid who clearly was confused (these people are very religious and shelter their kids.)

Almost every time I am around these kids, one of them will make a comparison of me and the ex. It’s always very uncomfortable, and my husband and I have discussed what to do many times, and have decided that it will stop soon. We understand that they are confused kids, and we do not want to stop them from expressing their thoughts. 

A few weeks before we got married, one of the kids said “Let’s hope what happened with (ex’s name) doesn’t happen this time.” My husband and I tried to laugh it off. My SIL was there and didn’t correct him. 

We have been married about 8 months. At thanksgiving, one of the kids said “(my name) is nice but I still miss (ex’s name.)” No one corrected her, they just changed the subject. I obviously know that she is not malicious, just a confused and potentially upset kid, but it does hurt my feelings. It’s hard enough entering a new family, especially as a second wife in a very religious family, let alone hearing these unfiltered opinions about me vs the ex wife. 

My husband and I decided it’s gone on long enough, so he brought it up to his mom. She basically said that they are kids, and unless we want to talk to them ourselves, I need to get over it. This is the type of family that would rather sweep things under the rug. From my perspective, this is an opportunity for the parents to teach their kids (who are plenty old enough) to understand what’s appropriate to say, and what can be considered rude/hurtful. I don’t think it’s our place as the aunt and uncle to do this, because we barely see them! It’s not like we are very close and have that sort of relationship with them. My husband is at a loss on what to do. He validates my feelings and wants to fix it, but it doesn’t seem like anyone else in the family feels that it’s necessary. He has considered talking to his brother, but they’re not super close and doesn’t want to step on his toes “trying to tell him how to parent.”

Also, I am really good with the kids. I play games with them, talk to them, make them their favorite desserts, etc. Apparently, the ex pretty much ignored them. 

I understand these kids clearly have not had the opportunity to grasp this change because their parents don’t talk to them about it.

So hopefully this gets okay traction 😅

Context: I am 18 F living in an apartment with my (age 57) mom. We both have ADHD (hers is more 'severe' if that's what you want to call it)
Bc she was diagnosed at 40 so it's affected her way of life a lot more than mine has. I was recently diagnosed at age 17. Anyways, she's been switching her ADHD meds trying to find the right one for her to be able to function properly, bc a few months ago she realized that the ones she had previously been on weren't helping her like they used to. (Hormones and shit y'know) And I also have meds, (a type of methylphenidate, and antidepressant as well). 
My mom hasn't had her ADHD meds in over a month and it's been effecting her pretty heavily, bc she sort of needs them to aid in her day to day life. I do too lol, it kinda sucks that our brains hate us. 

Okay so to the actual issue: 
Like a week ago I had got my ADHD meds refilled for 30 days like usual, took them like normal y'know. And my mom's been having a rough week bc she can't get her refill until next week which admittedly sucks ass. It genuinely affects how she functions. Y'know, motivation, eating, mood, concentration, insomnia ect.
But yesterday, she came to me and told me that she's been taking my ADHD meds the past week. And she felt bad, I knew she genuinely felt very guilty about it. And I don't know what I'm even supposed to do or how to feel. Bc it wasn't right of her to do, I'm pretty sure it's not legal; or at least if her provider found out she wouldn't be able to take medication bc of it. And she went behind my back and lied to me (withheld information to me is lieing idc) 
But on the other hand she's my mom. When she confessed to me I could see how much it weighed on her. When I asked her why she even did it she was like ""Because I was being selfish and I wanted to feel better."" And idk I sort of understood, bc I know what brain fog feels like. I know what it's like when the simplest tasks seem impossible. That's why I fucking take meds. 
And honestly ig I was more upset that she kept it from me, not that she took my prescribed meds. And idk I kind of didn't get that angry and now I'm wondering if I should have? Like what do I even do in that situation? Bc I didn't want to fucking go off on her bc she was mentally punishing herself as it was. But I also felt like I was being too easy? Bc what if she takes that as me enabling her. I'm not going to like legally do anything about it bc that could ruin her being able to take any type of medication that she needs.

I can say with certainty we're the most popular couple in the school, I'm well known and so is he and everybody, including teachers and such, know about our relationship. 
As fun as it is being known as the golden couple it's annoying when everytime we act slightly different around eachother that people ask if we've broken up 24/7.
So in public we decided to act as if nothing was wrong. 

Now, my bestfriend (M) used to date him but she loses feelings fast and never looks back; I was with my now ex-boyfriend at the time they were dating. Before M and E dated he was into me but I'd rejected him because I was still with [ex-boyfriend] though it was obvious E still had a thing for me, which made M immediately lose feelings. 

When I broke up with [ex-boyfriend] and that my E was single we hit it off and I fell deeply in love with him, fastforward now, 3 months have passed and the argument has taken place. E and M are still talking because she's a friend of mine and therefore involved a lot. 

I had faith in her and E even though I was kind of jealous of how much they talked but suppressed it because I loved them both and did not want to ruin their joy.
I had problems with my phone and couldn't access it so me and boyfriend could only see eachother at school and couldn't talk anywhere else (I have no device other than my phone cuz I broke em all 😅). 

I meet up with M and she told me that because me and boyfriend were on a break and he was horny he decided to send her a dick pic and when she proceeded to apparently remind him of his girlfriend he said ""it be like that sometimes"". 

The next day after finding this out I ignored him for the whole day thinking about breaking up but decided to take this in a mature way and instead of ignoring him, to ask him if he had anything to tell me and see if he'd admit, spoiler alert he did not admit to anything.
I still cooperated and told him what was bothering me and all he had to say was ""sorry"". 

I left it at that and said I'd think about forgiving him but the next day he ignores me to my face and avoids me the whole day, I think he wants to get back at me for ignoring me except I was doing it because of his previous act of unloyalness but I feel like he is doing it out of spite.

the thing is there’s a rule where only those of ages 5 and lower don’t need a ticket, so for anyone older needs a ticket. (dumb in my opinion, but i get it with seats and all) 

unfortunately my nephews/nieces are older than 5 but i don’t see why they would need to attend since they’re so young. 

this ceremony is very important to me and i’ve already planned for my bestfriends to come, they’ve helped me so much in terms of uplifting me and being there when i needed them most. seeing their face in the crowd would truly make it all worth it. i’m not one to celebrate my own achievements and i don’t ever really go all out for birthdays. my friends know this so of course they’d jump at any opportunity i’m open to lol. they’ve also already taken off work and everything else aside to attend. 

my family is furious. they keep telling me to “just drop the other two from the ticket registration” which is just making me even more angry. i love my nephews/nieces but i don’t think their attendance is necessary. my family is also known for belittling my friendships, saying that they won’t last forever etc etc. i’m learning to stand my ground when it comes to boundaries. but i can see why they’re angry.

also, going back on the whole “not big on celebrating achievements” i already told everyone i am not having a lunch or dinner. i don’t want to do all that and if i were to, it would only be for their enjoyment. which i’m trying to stop doing lol.

so, am i the asshole for not preserving those seats for their kids?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4827934,public,top,self,AITA for not preserving grad tickets for my siblings kids?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5jj74/aita_for_not_preserving_grad_tickets_for_my/,all_ads,6,,,

Everytime I eat my dinner they say pls join I don't like bord games except a couple and I'm not into card games and I like to be in my room and I don't like go interact as often as they with me. They mock me for not liking these kind of gamesevery day this makes it so I don't want to play even more and makes me so sad that I cry in my room more often then I like to admit. My sisters are talking about it behind my back as well (we have thinner walls then they think so I can hear them discussing it) and this really hurts. I don't really have a close relationship to my younger sister because she doesn't like what I like and I don't like what she likes so we don't really get along. My other sister does have a ok relationship with me but she likes a bit of everything so she never really commits to enything I like or my little sister likes. And Everytime I go to my room I can hear them say that they are mad that I am not coming to play with them even after they cuss me out and are saying mean things. This makes me more mad because my parents chose their side. This also happens with other things my sisters side with each other and I don't mind but when they cuss at me they won't get told to stop but when I do it I get in trouble. My sisters also don't support me whatsoever a couple examples are: ever since I started to stream they are mad at me. ( my PC is in the living room so they have to be a bit quiet and I can't move my PC to my room bcs I don't have an wifi adapter and my parents won't let me buy one because they don't want my PC in my room) they always make noise to annoy me and when I tell them to stop they scream. My parents do support me but hold me a bit back because they don't always like when I stream. They told my sisters that they should be quiet a couple of times and then they are but then the next time they make a lot of noise again. I did mention this to my parents but they said they can't control this. They also don't support me when I have to study for tests and other school related stuff. They do the exact same as when I'm trying to stream and they never supported me with sports (I did support them in sports even when I wasn't interested) my parents also control my phone with something called family link and I got an other phone wich is completely mine I bought it with my own money I was saving for half a year (I have a little job) but they take that phone away when they can (I don't have a sim card in it so I can only use it in my parents house) (I am making this on this phone in secret) so I hate my life at home because it's always an 2v1 and my parents chose my sisters side at school I'm getting bullied so I have nowhere to go except my room and even there I can't do shit so aita?,True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4827935,public,top,self,AITA for refusing to play bord/card games with my family?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5jixt/aita_for_refusing_to_play_bordcard_games_with_my/,all_ads,6,,,
