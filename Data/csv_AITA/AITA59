Everything is fine between us, I love him him a lot but it seems like there is this small problem that bothers me. See, right now the appartement is quite empty so everything resonates in the entire appartement for very little sounds. We chose 3 rooms because we wanted 2 rooms for our respective activities and privacy when needed. My boyfriend is a gamer and we chose to put his room far away from our mutual room so when I sleep I don't hear him play for speak to his discord friends.

Yesterday my BF finished his work shift at 1:30AM and we spent a little bit of time together as usual before I get sleepy so he can go on his computer afterwards. He finished work very often at this hour which means he goes to bed very late, around 5AM I would say. The problem is that I struggle naturally getting asleep so I need some time before I actually fall asleep, and every night I hear my BF hitting his damn keyboard as if he was trying crushing it into the ground. I asked him several times if he could do something about it like being cautious or trying to soundproof his room (I wanted to give him a carpet to put under his desk, Idk if it does anything but he refused) and when I ask him, he watches videos. But if I don't ask him, he plays right away. Yesterday, I heard him cooking very late in the kitchen, doing dishes and singing.

This is very annoying for me because everything wakes me up. A smell coming from under the door can literally wake me up. I feel bad knowing I interrupt him and sometimes I let him playing without saying anything so he can play in peace but it bothers me.

This morning I said I heard him cooking very loudly and that he could maybe be a little bit more cautious about it. He said ""if you can hear me from the kitchen then I can't do nothing for you at this point"" and I replied ""well you know damn well what wakes me up and you do it anyway"". He went to work kinda upset and I feel bad.

My brother(35) and his wife(27) have been married for a little over a year now and have a kid together.

Recently the two of them called and refused to show up for a family event that was very important to my mother. They were on speaker phone and it was very obvious that they were already drunk af even though it was only 11am. My mother was very upset after hanging up and cried about them missing the event. I couldn't help myself, I just blurted out that my brother would start showing up again after the divorce. Everyone was quiet for a bit(except one of my other relatives who agrees with me) before telling me that I was being horrible and that my brother's wife is bringing grandbabies into the family and that was more important than any small problems she might cause. My mom wanted me to apologize for saying it but I won't.

I for one don't think her problems are small. 

On multiple occasions she has complimented my(28f) body in ways we'll call inappropriate since I don't know how vulgar I'm allowed to be on this sub. Once after pulling me aside, she said she wanted to have sex with me before asking me to look at her breasts. She held onto my arm during this to prevent me leaving. My mother(who is the only one I told about this) said she was probably just joking and brushed it off... I personally find it to be unacceptable.

She also has a huge problem with alcohol. My brother never had a drinking problem until he met her. Now they are drunk almost constantly, with her frequently being near blackout drunk. On one occassion she started getting in the car to drive while very clearly drunk. I was THE ONLY ONE of the family who tried to stop her from driving drunk with their baby in the car. She refused to give up the keys unless I took her to a restaurant where she then ordered a huge amount of food and alcohol and tried to dash with it. I wouldn't allow her to dash, the cops got involved etc, and it was incredibly embarrassing for me. My family excused this saying ""well, she's young, honey"". This is only one example of the kind of stuff that she does while drunk. They drive drunk so frequently and I worry they're going to die or worse.

I've literally never seen her sober.

My family loves her and every time I try to bring up how violated and embarrassed she makes me, or how I feel like she needs an intervention for her alcoholism, everyone says I'm overreacting and need to give her a chance. That she's not my wife and it's not up to me. I literally feel like I'm going crazy and need a second opinion on all this.

I’ve been in a 2.5 year relationship with my BF, I’m now 39 F and my partner is 41 M. To paint a picture We met during lockdown, the relationship is somewhat weird considering how long we’ve been together, I’ve met his family 3 times  who live in the same city and my parents have met him many more, 14 days in total and they live 6 hours away, we see each other 2-3 times a week, he wants to spend almost every Saturday with his brother and the lads because he said his brother has always been there for him, when I’ve ask him to spend time with me and to try spread it out maybe even alternate weekends, he tried it for a bit however He often smokes weed and again bails on me regularly because he’s too fk up, I’m not a big fan of when he smoked he lacks motivation and isn’t great company. Anyway, BF never seems to be there when it matters and makes me feel like I’m hard work, for example the death anniversary of my dad he decided to get fk up and bail or he’s meant to meet me but makes plans to  out with the ladies from work so doesn’t want to come over, even booking a lads holiday on our anniversary, all this is a priority over me. This is a regular occurrence and any conversation we had would turn into massive argument and he would ignore me for days, he would often promise to change and put me first however the same thing happened time and time again. Now to the last couple weeks, I live on my own and had to make a really tough decision and put my dog to sleep, my heart was breaking, the BF did step up for the first time ever, well the first 6 days, I had been honest with him my grieving had heightened my anxiety and with grief I lost motivation that week and didn’t feel like doing anything or really wanting to leave the house much. I also got overwhelmed as I was also offered a new job and I’m going through some test for my health , I also had his ex best mate message me saying he cheated on me with his ex wife and some girls he met last Christmas with no evidence at all a and this guy is known to be a liar. At this point I’ve kinda just crashed. I said to my BF I would like him to step up and be there for me, he said what am I now not allowed to leave your side because you have this all going on I do need to get out myself for my mental health, this was causing him stress. i then asked him leave and he didn't really speak to me and chose to be with his brother and smoke.

My father has always hurt me. While he was not physically abusive, he would often compare me with my sister, would often make me feel bad or hate myself, would say he supports me but add that he would prefer me not to follow a certain carrier. I was never enough for him. If I would have a 7, I didn't study enough and I could better. If my sister would have a 5, well she didn't like studying and did her best. He would always choose her over me: she was the one who was unfortunate and should be taken care of, she was the one who deserved everything first, she was the one I should dedicate my life to. 

I quickly enough found the courage to stand up to him, but it was too late. At that point I didn't care about my justice, just to make him hurt. When I couldn't hurt him, I would hurt my family. I always get into arguments with my sister and have used everything I know she is insecure about against her, I made her feel worthless, I called her names and laught at her every single dream. 

Now my sister is finally calling me out and I still try to play the victim. I tell her that she and my family have no idea about so many things — they have no idea in what place I was a few months ago, they don't know how depression almost took me, they have no idea how hard it was for me to pretend to be ok, they have no idea how much I regret being selfish and hurting my sister, how much I regret turning my anger on the rest of my family who loves me and hurting them. My sister acts as if I am the villain, and I know I hurted her, I know I was wrong, I know I shouldn't have and I know the bully she turned into was just her response to the bully I was. I know I wasn't a saint, I know I was horrible, but she doesn't understand how I ruin everything I touch. There's nothing save from me. Everyone who loves me gets hurt and I am the one to hurt them. 

And this is the excuse I would always use. While everything I said here it's very true, it is also true that those things do not excuse what I've done. 

I get angry when people tell me I'm just like my father, but that's the truth. I hurt people, I use them, I say hurtful things and than act as the victim. 

So this is my story. All these things that make me horrible, all these things that I've done hunt me but I am not brave enough to ask for a real forgiveness. I apologize and than do it all again. I would want so much to just say that I am the victim, to delete everything here and rewrite the narrative, but I just want someone to tell me that I am in fact the bully because maybe if I hear it from more people, I will finally be able to accept that I am a horrible person and that the world would be a better place if I would have never survived when I was born or if I would have never been in this family.

He's had a few insecurities about that. It's gotten better over the years because he's seen different types of families and most people are satisfied when he's tells people that I'm his dad. He just doesn't want to be labeled as the ""adopted"" kid because he's literally the only adopted kid at school. He just wants to be a normal kid. Bring different is considered to be a liability adoption can carry a stigma.

This week Mason was not his normal self. Usually when he's very upset he lashes out at me or won't cuddle with me. Eventually he cried and said that his teacher gave him a note saying ""Happy Adoption Day."" Like I didn't even know there was an Adoption Day. He viewed it as a dig and that everyone knows he's adopted. 

I sent his teacher an email to get more information and she did say that she likes giving personalized notes to her students for things that they share in their classroom community. She's never gotten a complaint about this. 

I asked her if Mason told the class that he was adopted because that would shock me . She said no but she knew and she was adopted too so she knows an adopted kid when she sees one. She then asked to speak in person.

I met with her during lunch and she turned it into a pity fest with crying included. I cut her off and told her that her tears and life story didn't move me at all. Just admit that you fucked up, apologize, don't do it again and move on.

My son came in from lunch recess and she did apologize. She told him to tear up the letter, it was a mistake. It was over.

Later in the day, this nut emailed me to basically go over what we discussed and her last paragraph was how she felt I was rude and dismissive and snapped at her. She was fishing for an apology which I wasn't going to give because she was trying to take some of the heat off herself in case I brought it up to the principal. That's not my style.

We eventually agreed on getting everything for her birthday celebration on the 24th and that she will have to do nothing. Meaning food preparation, decoration of the house, cleaning it if needed, and bringing both sets of grandparents so she will not have to take care of it.  I usually work on the 24th, but I already made arrangements to have a replacement and pass the day with her, and my boyfriend would come for help. I was planning on making some entrees and baking her a nice cake, and we would have the rest of the food split up between me, my brothers, and their girlfriends.

A small clarification is that as her birthday is the 24 it is usually never really only her birthday but also Christmas that we celebrate that day. She always works so hard to have everything ready for the celebration... on her birthday. We agree to not talk about Christmas at all during this day and make sure the 24 is her day, and we will all stay to sleep anyway, so the day after, we will be ''allowed'' to mention Christmas.

That was mostly set until my older brother's girlfriend proposed that we set up a surprise party for her a couple of weeks before her actual birthday. Both brothers agree that it could be fun to have a day just for her and not Christmas. I know my mom doesn't like surprises and loves to have us all at her house on her birthday, but the idea was not all bad. We decided to do both, her birthday only in early December, and to help her set everything on the 24. The set date was a Saturday in early December.  I asked if this could be on a Sunday. Again I work on Saturdays, and December is a big season for us, I already took the 24 off and can't make more arrangements or skip more days. Everyone else said that they prefer it to be Saturday. I advised them in advance that I will not be able to help in the preparation of it and that I won't be able to take more days off. They said nothing really and just continued talking about food and gifts. 

Now the date is coming quickly, and I'm getting bombarded about what I am gonna bring or what will i do for help. I repeated to them that as I told them before, I couldn't do much, I won't have time to cook anything and my gift will be ready for her on her actual birthday the 24. I told them that as we agreed I will be happy to pay for my part of the food they will buy and get prep during the day, by I will be working and will be arriving, I hope, right before my mom. My sister-in-law is not happy about this ... at all and says that I should do more for my mother.

I will still be the main one to get everything ready on the 24, passing the day with her getting the grandparents at her house and cooking some extras, as she decided to hire a caterer after all. 

So now that I think of it I will have absolutely nothing for her early birthday, no gifts, I won't help or bring anything, and it makes me feel bad a little.

He has two children from his first marriage. Kai who is 28, and Mia is 27. My husband's first marriage ended during the pregnancy with Mia when his ex moved another man into their home. She told my husband to leave and she was planning to marry the other guy. A DNA test was done when Mia was born, and another was done on Kai later, custody was decided and the divorce was finalized when Mia was still a baby. I met him 6 months later and we married after a year together. 

My husband's ex made our lives hell. She alienated the kids from me, we were in and out of court, therapy, they were always placed in mediation and co-parenting classes to try and get them to a better place. Nothing helped. Her second husband left and that only made her worse. Then she married again but that also ended.

My relationship with my stepkids breaks my heart. I love them, I have always tried to be a respectful and loving stepparent who doesn't talk bad about their mom, overstep my place or assume they would love me the same as their parents. But I hoped we would be close. They have been rude or distant and cold. But I loved them regardless and my husband took the lead with them. When my husband and I had our own two children together they did not bond with them but we still hoped time and therapy would help some kind of relationship form.

Now my stepson is due to get married. He told my husband our kids were not invited since it was a child free wedding. But then he told me what I could not wear (because the two mothers were going to match the theme and I am not counted in that), that I would not be given a corsage to wear so people would know I was not one of the parents, he said I would not be mentioned in any of the toasts, I was not welcome to give a toast, that the photos with the parents and immediate family would not include me and after my husband asked him why he was making such a big deal out of this he said I needed to know my place and then admitted he didn't even want me there. So I made the decision not to attend and instead stay home with my children. I have reached a breaking point where I just no longer see a future where we might get along better and clearly I am not wanted at all. But my husband's family are furious and say I was invited so I should go.

My grandpa, uncle, aunt and cousin however just straight up suck. Grandpa is a fascist, uncle is the spoiled male child, my cousin is also spoiled and an obstetrician that got fired for refusing to vaccinate and now mooches off of her husband while he cheats on her. (Personally, I find this very amusing) (Also Hubby doesn’t know I know. I saw him cheat but he didn’t see me) They also have 3 kids under 5 that I’ve been stuck babysitting the last couple times I went to a family gathering. My aunt is just the worst. She’s a spoiled old money b*tch that tried to run over my dog, coincidentally after I came out as bisexual.

Grandpa backed them up cause his little prodigy of a son can do no wrong even if he’s effectively evicting him.

I've noticed that he rarely washes his hands. I once confronted him on it after coming out of the bathroom and he said ""I only peed though"". I said that's not the point, it's not about what you touch but washing every time you use the bathroom is just a regular time to wash your hands.

The pipes make a weird sound whenever someone uses the bathroom sink and I've noticed multiple times that it doesn't sound off after he poops. I've started confronting him every time and he acts offended and says he washes them while he flushes so I probably don't hear it, I've noticed I never smell my handsoap on him either.

Since he's gone back to work in the office I've been getting sick, a lot. It's extremely upsetting to me because I was diagnosed with M.E. after getting German measles as a kid. My chronic illness went into remission earlier this year and it was great, but he's started going to the office again I've been absolutely flawed by a string of illnesses, post-viral fatigue and malaise. It's making me become severely depressed as I don't have the energy to do things I enjoy like embroidery, I only have it in me to do every day responsibilities lately.

He has diarrhea on a fortnightly basis, and I mysteriously do a few days after him. It's gotten to a point where I don't even want him to touch him anymore, like I'm developing some sort of OCD. When he touches me it's like I can feel the germs that will make me sick on me and just want to wash instantly.

Today I woke up feeling floored by a rattly cough and body aches. The same cough he had last weekend which he said was from vaping. I told him ""I'm sick again and i havent seen anyone but you. You seriously need to up your hygiene because I can't deal with this constant chain of viruses anymore""

Obviously he's offended and furious, telling me that it's my ""shitty immune system"" and that I can't blame him for ""every little sniffle"" which I don't. Like I got sick after a party a couple months ago and didn't blame him, but i feel obvious he's the only source of illness the last few times

a few months ago my friend decided to move to a new city for a few months as an exchange program. the city is like six hours by bus from where i live now, so i thought i would be able to go. it has gradually gotten more and more inconvenient from the first time i committed to going. 

i wanted to help her because she is a close friend of mine from home. she is moving to europe and will be here for the first time. i also did this, two years back, so i wanted to be able to help her. Buttt she is moving to a super expensive city and she decided to arrive three days before her housing starts, so we have to get accomodation for those days. (at first it was five days before but when i said that was impossible for my budget she changed the flight, to three days before... why couldn't you arrive the day of! \_-\_) its even more expensive to travel and stay there because it will be over new years, which isn't really anyone's fault but it is now more inconvenient. i chose an airbnb in the city, but she didn't like it so she chose a place super outside the city (like two hours on transport with bus/metro exchanges). prices can now be added for metro, bus, uber fares. 

although i agreed to go at first and i do want to go, the price keeps rising. i haven't booked my ticket yet because i was still making plans to visit family over the holidays. i must admit this is bad planning on my part, but also things have been up in the air so it was hard to plan. now tickets are over 100 euro and i will have to do transfers in different cities. then when i finally get to her new city, i will have to take more metros and buses to even get to the accommodation. moreover, i'm a bit upset because although we were supposed to be doing the trip together, she is the one who chose the accommodation, which is super far away from Everything. this decision was made without my say :/

Since I was three, my mother has lived 1000+ miles away. My paternal family tells me she left me when in reality she lost her job and wouldn’t be able to pay her bills, so she had no choice but to move back to where her mom was since her mother could help her get a job. My father offered to help her move if she signed over full custody. 

Due to this, I haven’t seen my mom much growing up, and being raised by a young man with no knowledge of how to raise a girl without a mother is difficult. My mom moved again when i was 14 (same amount of miles, just a different direction). She now lives around 3 hours from my paternal great-grandmother, so it’s been easier for me to see her more often because my family is more willing to see their family and just drop me off with my mom. 


My uncle recently died at 35 because of a work accident, and ever since my family has decided they want to be more close knit. They planned this cabin trip for Christmas and was really hoping I’d go. 

I so badly wanted to go to this cabin trip, but I already got summer with my mom cut short and wasn’t able to see her for my birthday. This left me with two options; Thanksgiving or Christmas (can’t have both because even one is too much to ask for). 

Considering my mother was planning to go back to her hometown for Christmas, i decided that I should go with her then. This made the most sense because for Thanksgiving i’d get to see my great-grandmother maybe one last time, and for Christmas I’d get to see my other great-grandparents since they’re also getting very old. Reminder, this was NOT an easy decision. That cabin sounds like an amazing time. My paternal family, however, did not like that. 

The first time my grandmother saw me after the decision she immediately started guilt tripping me. She said I haven’t spent christmas with my paternal family in ages (I’ve only spent the last two christmases with my mother. Every other christmas has been spent with my paternal family, and i spent a decade without seeing my mother on any of them.) My grandmother claimed that my cousins friend (my replacement) loved her more and was her new grandchild.  I then got to watch the rest of my family have fun trying on matching pajamas, guilt tripping me, and talking about how much fun they’re going to have without me. No doubt it’s going to be worse after christmas when they’re all talking and go “it’s a shame you didn’t come”.

So I was asked by my gf a few days ago if I wanted to meet some of her friends. I told if she wants me to then I will (she knows i don’t love going places and meeting new people). She then brings up her guy bsf (we’ll call him Tim). Tim doesn’t like me, he thinks I’m a bad boyfriend, he’s made many comments about our relationship that are out of pocket such as accusing me of cheating and asking her why she hasn’t left me yet.

I said “I hope you can understand but I’m not meeting Tim if I don’t absolutely have to.” 

She then got upset, and sent lots of messages saying how Tim is a really good friend, is one of the only people who actually care about her. Then she tried turning it onto me saying she doesn’t like one of my friends because he called her insecure (whole other story), so I brought up the fact that that’s completely different because neither me or my friend are gay or into me so it’s nothing to worry for, he was dealing with something personal at the time which lead him to say what he said, and I already dealt with him and he understood why I told him to not do that again. She always tells me about him and she always says I have nothing to worry about, she says she’d choose me over anyone but gets mad when I say that I don’t like him or trust his intentions with the friendship, but I’ve seen this happen before with me and others, the guy best friend is always waiting for you to mess up.

The city where it's located is several miles away from home but my sister (29F) lives pretty close by.

I went over to her place last sunday as my mom was visiting and parents aren't allowed into the dorm. When I got there, I asked my mom whether I can buy an extra blanket (there's no heating in the dorm room because it doesn't get exceedingly cold that you'd need it.) My sis felt sorry for me as she knew how much I'm afraid of the cold so she wanted to buy me a heater instead. I knew how much money was tight for her at the moment so I tried to refuse but sis told me we'll look for one that doesn't exceed her budget. Mom, who was originally lying down, immediately jumped up and said I'm going with you.

When we got to the supermarket, mom picked the most expensive heater available and kept trying to convince me to choose it. I knew my sister didn't have that kind of money so I lied and said it'd be too big to fit into my room and we should buy a smaller one. 

After this episode, my mom then kept asking me whether I needed anything and I kept saying no I didn't. I was really embarrassed by her calling me out on how I did need a bunch of things and I finally said those are not urgent but milk is something I consume pretty often.

So I went and only took one bottle of milk and my mom kept urging me to take more. I told her it'll only go bad if I take more since I didn't have a fridge and I can always buy it myself.

When we got to the house, my mom then insisted I take several cartons of liquid powdered milk that didn't need a fridge. My sis said that that milk is for her house and children. Mom wouldn't relent and went and took several of them and shoved them into my hands. I put them back on the table in a hurry and told her mom you're embarrassing me I really don't need it! 

She then yelled at me who am I doing this for if not for you, now you and your precious sister are on good terms and in harmony while I'm the bad guy now. I tried to appease her but she said ""whatever that's your business don't come crying for me later that you need something, figure it out yourself""

He a freelancer and works from home, while I work in a school full time and part time in a restaurant, so most of the afternoon and evenings I’m out of the house. Two weeks ago he got a gig which requires him to work 7-8 hours a day (even on the weekends). The problem is, he usually does it in the evening/night occupying our living room, which means that when I get back home after work (around 21 pm) I don’t even have access to my own TV, and can’t really do much around the house without bothering him, which I don’t want to do to not interrupt his work (the TV is in the middle of the apartment, which is mostly open space, so to get from one side to the other I need to pass in front of it). And I can’t really do much in the morning, when I wake up, because that’s usually when he sleeps after working all night (he goes to bed at 7am and usually wakes up at 4/5 p.m. when I’m already at work) and I don’t want to wake him up, because if I do, he gets grumpy, which I can understand because I would be mad too if somebody woke me up after two or three hours of sleep. 

However it started to make it harder and harder for me to function (not being able to be very noisy with stuff before work and not really being able to do much after work) so few days ago I suggested that maybe he should try to change his day routine, start getting up early, so the stuff he has to do during the day when I’m at work and he would have free evenings and could go to bed early and not sleep all day (because of his day pattern he hasn’t  seen Sun in two weeks, which is not good for his mental health). 

He snapped at me, saying that I don’t understand him, and it’s not like he’s some teenager sleeping all day and doing nothing and that I shouldn’t be telling him how to live his life and taking away his freedom.

We broke up in August due to my mom's restrictions because we were only allowed to see eachother for 3 or 4 hours and with other friends I can be there for as long as I wanted. This felt unfair to the both of us and created alot of fights.

When she found out we broke up she kept saying I was a side piece and how he found someone better and made me feel horrible for the breakup. During the breakup I did get pregnant and miscarried a few hours after I even found out I dealt with it alone. I hid the fact I had sex because she kept saying how I was being a whore for going out with my boyfriend for long periods of time. Meanwhile she only dated men for a few weeks and would sleep at their houses. He got an apartment and I wanted to sleep over and she said how I was desperate to have sex and how I am a nympho and other hurtful things. I just thought it was normal to want to overall spend time with the person you love. She literally moved a man in I didn't know randomly one day and made me move out of state with them a year later and she blamed me for that relationship not working out because I made everything difficult for her. She neglected me for 3 years.

After she discovered the break up between him and I she lectured me and yelled at me for being depressed which sent me into a deeper depression. Him and I got back together September and she doesn't know. I have resulted lying to just see him because she does not want me with him. I was at his apartment one time and she demanded to know where I was because she did not want me out that day after saying she did not care where I went and how long so I did as she said. I said I was with a friend and she said in the car she was gonna use her taser on my friend if they walked with me to the car. She says I am selfish, I would make anyone I am with miserable and how she is the only person who can love a person as broken as me. It has gotten to the point I only smile at work and when I am with him.

We also talked about the n word before, I have never said it, but my friend admitted to saying it once before, just because one of his friends forced him to say it. 

The conversation that we had that day was about my friend telling me that his first period had a lot of racist people, and a black person was in that class and said some “racist” things too. 

The teacher was in the middle of doing a worksheet with us, and we were talking. I admit I shouldn’t have been talking there, but we were pretty quiet for the most part.

This guy goes, “can you guys stop talking in the middle of class and making racist remarks? You’re obsessed with us.”

I didn’t know what to think about it because I didn’t think I was being racist, nor have I ever really been racist imo.

Let's sum it up so that it doesn't bore anybody. And BTW, TL:DR is in the title already 😁

I (39M) have an ex wife (36F) and two kids, 15F and 9M.
She's all about influencers stuff, trying to be one since I remember, with little to no results. She posts way too much pics of our kids on IG/FB etc. 
We went through the profile with my lawyer, and eventually she kept it private rather than public. 
I'm not preoccupied, she's a good mom, my kids are fine with both me and her. I guess she can dream of being an influencer as much as anybody else 😂. 
We see them half month each (Monday with her, Tuesday with me, alternate weekends and so on) so they're equally with the both of us. 
I thought we got (it's been almost 5 years) to a point where there was some kind of balance: I'm very accommodating, I pay what I owe every month, she's in my house with the kids, I never ask for receipts at all, I just trust her enough not to. 

BUT, some time ago, my son (again, 9 today), kept asking for an earring, cause some of his friends have it, cause it's today's fashion apparently and so on... 
Now, I have nothing personally against piercings and such, I did have one on my tongue and one on my ear when I was 25 to 30, and I would let my daughter get one now that she's 15. 
And I personally told him he could get one once he grows a little bit older if he wants it so much, just not now.

Yesterday my son videocalled me, showing that ""mom got me this (a little fake diamond on the left earlobe) for my birthday and cause I'm good at school"". I hung up the phone immediately. 
I was (and still am) fucking pissed. 
Plus, today it's his birthday, I was supposed to go there for a cake and the gift, but I don't feel like it now, I'm gonna go and drop the gift at the gym after practice.

He obviously knew I was against, so I'm a little pissed at him too, but he's 9, he can't fully understand what's going on.
His mom, on the other hand... to me, she has no excuse. 

Now, if I demand for the piercing to come off, I look like an asshole cause he wanted it so much (and of course ""mom let me""). 
If I don't, his mom has yet another confirmation that she can do whatever the hell she wants. 
I could threaten with legal actions (you know, he's a minor and every decision should be taken together), but I don't know if it do (for me and my kid) more damage than anything. 😔

And now the birthday is freaking ruined for this stupid earring.

I changed some details for privacy reasons :D. I (23F) am an American currently studying abroad in Japan. I have a Sri Lankan classmate B (28M) who I see 5 times a week in class. 

Around 2 weeks into class starting, I had brought some mochis to share with the class and teachers. It is a very small class of only 6 students, and the day before we were practicing how to say what food we like in Japanese when it was brought up that no one but me and the sensei had the blessing of having eaten ”yomogi mochi”. I thought I would be nice, and bring some the next day for the class to try. 

That same night, B texted me on Line (messenger app) saying that he wanted to give me a bracelet. This was really the first time we had talked outside of class at all. He also said he wanted to take me out for a lunch as a thank you for the mochi, and that he would pay. It seemed a bit too much, so I politely rejected the gift, citing thank you, but I have no need for it, and I was much too busy to go out for lunch (not a lie). 

From then on, he would give small edible gifts about 3 times a week in class. Each time I would say some variation of “thank you, but please stop giving me these sweets”. He claimed that he understood and would stop. I asked the sensei for advice, and he recommended I pass any gifts off to the teachers. I’ve had to do this twice so far.

It came to a head when he said that he had spent $85 USD on fruits that he wanted to give to me and my grandmother as a thank you for an old coat she had given him. The short background is I told him about a sale for a bike, offered to show him where it was, but when he showed up he was not wearing a coat. My grandmother felt bad, and knew we had some of my grandfather’s old coats lying around and offered it to him. When he told me he wanted to buy a gift as a thank you, I told him that if he wanted to say thank you to my grandmother then I would be happy to pass along a thank you card. He said he understood, but then the next day said he ordered the fruits! 

I put my foot down with this one, and told him in class in front of the sensei (no other students around) that I had already told him we did not need or want the fruits or any other gift. That I understood he wanted to say thank you, which is why I offered to pass along a card only. I also told him very clearly that I wanted him to only contact me if it was about school. This time again he said he got it, and I have not heard anything about the fruits or any other gifts since, although it has only been about a week.

He is now texting me asking me “are we not friends” and “I feel said when you reject my gifts but I will comply” And “what do you and your boyfriend talk about? I have no relationship experience”.

My fiancé (28M) and I (24F) are in the process of buying our first home and investment property. 

I went to go see the house for the first time the other day and it’s a nice home, it’s over 100 years old but it’s in pretty good shape. At the end of the walk through with the inspector he was mentioning a few things about the house being to code and some of the repairs which were a little concerning to me. 

Last night, we were looking at the numbers for cash flow (which are great btw) and we were talking about the rent for the tenants. I brought up the house being in code again. My fiancé kept saying he didn’t care if the house is in code because the problems aren’t that serious. My fiancé is a senior engineer inspector — so I know he knows what he’s talking about. and i was confused bc he comes home all the time talking about contractors and ppl want to be sly and not putting the building in code whatever and he hates that because they aren’t following the rules snd putting peoples life on the line. 

So I asked him, why is it you care about coding at work, but with a home we will be living in and other tenants too you don’t care about the house being up to code? PLEASE BE MINDFUL: I was respectful, I was nice, I kept my fucking tone neutral. Bc we were just having a conversation and I was genuinely just curious as to why it seemed like he was letting it slide. 

He said that my question was extremely offensive and hurt his feelings bc I was calling him a hypocrite and attacking his character. He said he wants me to communicate better and understand how my words can hurt him. 

I just don’t know how to be more careful bc I don’t think what I said was rude. (I’ve been in therapy learning how to communicate better too and I use all the skills (saying I instead of you, saying and instead of but, giving positive affirmation before bringing up a topic I’m upset about etc etc etc).

The gifts I bought weren’t super expensive but they were personal &amp; I went to about 4 different places to buy these gifts. Everyone at home was super appreciative. While I was home my mom showed me the gifts that my cousin gave her when she was home - her MIL’s hand-me-down blouses 🙃
At the time I struck me as odd but I didn’t say anything. 

Fast forward to months later &amp; my cousin asks me for suggestions for what to get my mom as a gift. I suggested a nice bag or a perfume, it didn’t have to be super expensive &amp; my mom would love it because it came from her. 

My cousin is now home for xmas &amp; NY &amp; my mom sent me pictures of the gifts she received…my cousin’s MIL’s hand-me-down blouses!! 
I immediately asked my mom why my cousin keeps giving hand-me-downs as gifts when I gave her suggestions. To me it’s giving zero effort. I feel bad because I could feel my mom’s excitement evaporate even via text. I pointed out that the gifts didn’t need to be super expensive but it would’ve been nice if she put some real effort into it. Or maybe her &amp; I just have different ideas on gift buying.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4843401,public,top,self,AITA for pointing out the fact that my cousin gives hand-me-downs as gifts,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9n4c1/aita_for_pointing_out_the_fact_that_my_cousin/,all_ads,6,,,,

I (22F) flipped out on my mother (51F) for not respecting my wishes. For starts let me start before my daughter was born. My mom showed up to every appointment (except the last one where I got sent to L&amp;D). The asked me to fill out a birth plan, and I went over what I wanted with my mom. I didn't want an epidural and she kept pushing me to get one. After many times of explaining I dont want one she finally stopped. Another appointment they had me sign a thing saying if i wanted students in the room or not. I did not want students in the room and my mother tried pushing me to let them because ""she did and they are just there to learn"".When I got sent to labor and delivery I had to be induced for medical reasons. They said I wouldn't have have her till the next night so I sent my mom home so I could relax. She threw a fit and stormed out of the hospital. She came back the next morning. The doctors popped my water without saying anything to me. When I went in to labor the doctor that was supposed to be there was off shift so I got residents instead. There was a male doctor and a female doctor. The male doctor got in my face and started screaming at me. The female wasn't saying anything and was looking around to room scared. They wanted to do internal monitoring and I said no many times. If you dont know what that is they screw something in to your baby's head. My mother decided to try to take in in to her own hands and try to have them to do it. Apparently how the conversation went was my mom: ""Since I'm her mother and she's a minor can I decide?"" The doctor:""yeah"" my mom: ""well let go ahead an do it"" my bf: ""she said no"" the doctor: ""well I guess we won't do it then"". Now today my bf and I were talking about the birth again and went over the story again. I texted my mom flipping out on her for trying to screw it in my babys head. And she knew there were students in the room and still allowed it knowing tha1t's what I  didn't want and that's what she wanted.

I showed it to my friend Zoe because she also loves horses and she liked it. She showed her dad a photo of my work and one day, when I was at their house, his dad came to me with a proposition. I knew that Zoe's mother died when she was a little girl and her father never had any other woman in his life. He wanted me to do a portrait like the one I did of that horse but of his dead wife. They are really rich so he would pay me a lot of money.

He wanted me to recreate a specific memory he had of when she was 21 and they had sex in a green grass field in France. He had a clear image in his head of her naked with her legs open, laying of the grass, looking at him, but he  didn't had a picture of it. I was in love with this whole idea. He gave me access to a lot of old photos and videos so I could study her body in detail. He had some nudes of her but I needed a more clear vision of her vaginal area. Zoe looks really similar to her mother at that age range so I thought if she could let me study her pussy, It could serve as a model for my artistic vision. I have already seen her naked before but when I explained the situation to her she refused to help me.

She said that she is not comfortable with this whole idea and that she was just keeping it quiet for his dad but I asking her this crossed her limit, so now she is angry at me. I feel like she is just feeling a lot of emotion because this forced her to think more about her mom and the pain lf her being gone. I don't think it is fair that she gets angry at me when I am not doing anything bad, quite the opposite.

Because of the process to get a work permit, in a span of 2 years, I didn't work for 12 months (6 months at a time).

Again because of immigration/work permit paper work, my husband didn't work for 10 out of the last 18 months. He used that time to pursue a change of careers while I paid for everything. Now, my job is letting me go by the end of Dec and my husband is working, so he said he'll take care of everything while I get a job, except for rent.

After the first time that the payment was due and my mother failed to pay them back, they still gave her money. Throughout this time, my aunt and I were in intermittent contact (Facebook greetings and messages) but she did not say anything about these emergencies.

So this was really a big unpleasant surprise for me. I  sent my aunt a very salty letter for letting this problem snowball, for not notifying me when this started or when my mother was having these ""emergencies"". My mother was culprit yes 100%, but I was also very angry over their decision to keep this from me, for giving her money several times, and for letting this problem grow.

My (51m) wife (56f) have been married for five years and we each have two children from our previous marriages. My children are in their upper twenties  and hers are well into their thirties. None of them have ever lived with us and they are all living on their own.

After getting married my wife and I purchased a farm that we currently live on. The problem is that my stepson has laid claim to everything we own by calling it ""Ours"". We were sitting at the table and we was looking at a magazine and saw something he liked in it. He looked at me and said ""We need this on our farm"". He has referred to everything this way. Our farm, our cows, our tractor, our truck, our pond, our work shop. You get the idea. One day he told me he needed the truck to haul something. He was referring to my pick up. In my mind I was thinking couldn't you ask me to borrow my truck like most people would instead of telling me your taking it. 

The final straw was when he went into my workshop and rearranged stuff and made adjustments to some equipment I have without me knowing about it. I sent him a text and blew up at him telling him that he was entitled and had no respect for the stuff that his mom work hard to have. I told him that because his mom and I own something it doesn't mean that he also owns it. I also told him to never make changes to my equipment without talking to me about it first. He told me to fuck off and that he never really liked me anyway. He was just nice to me because of his mom. 

I could understand if he was ten years old and lived with us. However he's in his mid thirties and has never lived with us or on our farm. Is this normal behavior?

I (very early 20s) live with my parents for a lot of complicated reasons. All house expenses are divided between my mom (55) and me sometimes 50-50 and sometimes 40(me)-60. My dad doesn't pay for anything because he has been unemployed for around a decade, by choice. His contract ended at his previous place of work and he chose to not work again. My mom allowed this and when I complained about having to support him 50-50, she told me to stay out of her marriage decisions, so I do. 

He also doesn't do a lot of housework because he says he doesn't like to. He sweeps the floor of the living room and his bedroom, nothing else. He also goes out of his way to not do anything around the house that would make my life easier: he sepparates my loundry from the common basket so that it doesn't get washed with my mom and his for no reason, whenever he sets the table, he doesn't set whatever utensils I would be needing, even if it's the exact same that my mom and him will be using, etc. 

So, like he does every year, he is working for 15-30 days per request of our city council (this is a program that gives long term unemployed people the chance to work for up to a month a year). He always accepts to work when they call because I think that if he says no without a valid reason, he won't be called next year. So today it was his first day of work: he works from 9 to 14, which are pretty normal hours where I live, and he has a 30 minute break somewhere in the morning to have a bite. I should add I work two jobs: one corporate WFH and one teaching in the next town over, totalling from 9am to 10pm everyday but the weekend. My mom is a civil servant so works more comfortable hours: 9 to 15 with a 1 hour break for food, WFH.

Because he was going to start working, a few days ago I went to the supermarket and I picked up a packet of mini muffins because I know he likes to have one or two in the morning with milk before going to work. Today, during his 30 minute break, he came home and saw that I had one half eaten mini muffin on my work desk. He went crazy saying how they were HIS mini muffins and they shall not be touched. I tried to deescalate the situation and told him that I'd make another trip to the shop before they ran out so he didn't have to go without.

He kept screaming and berating me and calling me an AH and a brat etc. so I got angry and said that if he wants to have food of his own that noone is allowed to touch, he should find a all-year-around job and pay for whatever he doesn't want to share with the rest of us.

He got even angrier and called me nasty stuff, which is typical from him, and then left, taking the mini muffins with him. I'll make another trip to the shop and get some more, but AITA for eating a single mini muffin that I paid for?! My mom also thinks I'm an AH because I bought them 'for him' and then took 1.

Most of it was actually my fault. 

One time I casually mentioned needing help with a certain event in a game we both play (in which, if you got enough ""help,"" you could buy a hero's skin for a low amount) in a public chat, and a random guy messaged me that, in return for a helping hand, he would want my Instagram account, and I did give it to him.  When he asked for the skin, I was so excited that I told my boyfriend about it. My boyfriend became jealous and said it made him feel like he was poor or something. And when he asked what hero skin I wanted, I replied with what I was aiming for (I'll just mention that I clearly stated that I am in a relationship), and I added that I was a little concerned I wouldn't get it because I receive so little assistance. 

There was also one time I was just playing games in my free time from school, but as a support-main player, it is really difficult to play solo, so I just accepted random invites to the game. I had like 3–4 games with a girl (after we got paired up in a game, she then started inviting me), then one game with a random guy, and finally with another guy. It was all random. But the last player was disappointed that we had lost, so he invited me to play with his team, and we won. We tried playing ""duo"" again after his friends left the game because they had something to do (the girl we were with said she has class). I was shocked when my boyfriend found out and began cursing at me. I tried to explain, but he cut me off for a week before I could really explain it all. Almost every fight we had, we were on the verge of breaking up, but we both tried to make things work. I was doing my best to understand him, keeping in mind his current circumstances (his mom just died a few months ago). He is stressed out and in pain, and I know it.

Now, next week I have this case going to court (complicated) so I had booked Sunday off, as I was going away for the duration of the trial, but when I originally booked Sunday (this was before I asked for Sunday's off), I forgot I had plans on Saturday as well, and I was unable to change the booked holiday (the system is crap) so I messaged my boss explaining the issue in SEPTEMBER and I constantly reminded him in person and via text. The problem occurs, when I checked the schedule last week and saw I was working Saturday, so I reminded him again via message, surprise, surprise no response. So last Friday I went to talk to him about it during my shift, now luckily for me, he was with a trainee manager, who I really like and who knows me. When I mentioned the issue my boss didn't seem happy but I mentioned I had evidence I've been asking this for 2 months and now there was a witness, so he reluctantly booked it for me. 
There's another issue aswell, in which I called him out for a couple weeks ago. The majority of new people are on make line and recently we've had a lot mistakes and spare food, which is not mine or the fellow CSR's or the divers fault, it's makelines fault.

I was neither out or in the closet when I was in high school, I just didn't care to tell people. However, Mike decided that I was acting gay and bully me for that. He was kinda popular and that makes me a target for quite some people. Long story short, my high school year was hell.

I am now in university in another city, everything is great, people are so much more accepting. I somehow bumped into Mike in one of the party (I didn't even know he is in the same city), and color me surprised, he was kissing another guy. He saw me and nod at me, but like he wasn't that big asshole to me a few years ago. Obviously I wasn't comfortable staying and left very soon after seeing him, so we didn't get to talk or anything.

Now, I vent it to one of my friend about him and my friend is also very surprise. Then, rumor started back home about him, he freaked out and reach out to me. Apparently he is not out yet back home and he wanted me to lie and say that I was starting rumor to get back at him. I was like, first, he should have apologized to me for all the things he did before even asking me for a favour and second, I don't feel comfortable lying for him. He double down that me of all people should know how difficult being gay back home. This is where I might be the asshole. I said ""That's not an apology, so if people ask me, It will be a pleasure for me to confirm the rumor."". I blocked him after that. My friend said I should have just ignored him.

However, we kept hearing discrepancies regarding how the donations (not only from us but from other relatives) were used. But without concrete evidence, all those discrepancies would just be hearsay. But my mother wanted to have some sort of clarity 'cause if there were some cash left behind, we thought it'd be better to give it to my grandmother. So I advised her to ask our relatives, mainly our in-law who was in charge of the majority of the arrangement, for a breakdown of the budget. And I think you could guess that any conversation that involves money + family wouldn't end up so well. And it really went downhill real quick.

The argument ended up with my uncle ""disowning"" my mother as their sibling for not being able to attend and ""not giving enough money"". Afaik, donations aren't a competition, it's about the sentiment, right? Now he's telling her she should've just shut up.

Since I was the one who insisted that she should ask for transparency, I felt somewhat responsible for what happened and I especially felt bad for my mom. She's getting sympathy from our other relatives but they also told her that she should've just ""kept it for herself and didn't ask any further"", which left a bitter taste in my mouth tbh, though I appreciate their efforts consoling my mom.

Maybe it's about time? We asked about it like two days after the burial, so maybe they thought it was too soon to ask. But how long should we have waited? And if we waited it out for a bit, then we might not find the appropriate time to bring it up again because everyone would've already ""moved on"" and forgotten about it, they might even say ""we've forgotten about the specific expenses because it's been so long ago.""

I think the ""disowning"" part went too far. All that my mother asked for was an audit, but then she was blamed that she was ""painting my in-law as corrupt"". Well, if you didn't want to be painted as corrupt in the first place then show the damn receipt. This would've been resolved sooner if no one got butthurt that we asked for transparency. The reason why I thought that it'd be better to get the breakdown was that this is a type of information that no one should be left in the dark in, at least in my opinion.

Sure, the amount we donated wasn't much but I don't think staying ignorant about where all that money went, no matter how small our contribution was, is okay. They need to wake up and finally realize that not everyone's ""okay"" with not knowing how the budget was managed, this specifically is a family matter.

I'm a working musician, live on the bottom floor of a 4 story apartment, have always been courteous and cooperative with neighbours, only one other neighbour has had a problem.

Previous neighbour that had a problem asked me directly to turn it down, immediately gave them my number saying ""call or text if it's ever too loud and I'll turn it down immediately.""
since then I practice at low volume and I haven't heard from them since. 
A civil and community based approach worked.

Important details out the way, let's go.

Amp died the day before a gig, I had to source a new one and get a half decent sound out of it within 24 hours.

Friend lent me her's that evening so between 8-9pm, less than an hour I experimented (a little louder than usual) being a practice amp, it just wasn't suitable for a gig.

Next day I dipped into my savings, bought an amp, spent not even an hour, between 2 and 3pm dialing in a tone before heading to the gig.

Tone was bad at the gig, so next day I spent some time with the amp to finally get it sounding right.
Also went on for no longer than an hour at a reasonable time.

Skip forward a week, I let my friend in, he tells me an older woman was standing outside my door explaining to him that she's made two noise complaints and thinks i'm very selfish. 

This particular neighbour is a recluse, gets up at 4pm, goes to bed early hours of the morning, never leaves apartment, reluctant to interact with others and refuses to deal with anything in a civil or community based manner. 

Few years ago her toilet leaked into my bathroom ceiling.
Whole time she was dismissive and offended that I asked her to do something about it, forcing me to contact her landlord.
I paid for damages to my bathroom ceiling and lighting.

This year she neglected her balcony 
(Lease agreement says that residents/owners of apartments with balconies must keep them clear and the drainage unblocked to prevent water damage in apartments below.)

Paint was peeling from my newly decorated front room so I politely asked if her balcony had been cleared before recent rainfall. 
said she had trouble opening the window, I offered to come up and clear the balcony myself, which I did and also removed a plant that she had let grow through the stone.

Said I was happy come clear the balcony myself whenever it needed doing as long as she kept an eye on it and let me know.
She continued to neglect the balcony and never contacted me, so I had to contact property management.

Tried to develop a neighbourly relationship but she wants to sit in her apartment, never leave or talk to anyone and thinks everyone should just leave her alone even if her toilet is leaking into their light fittings.

All she had to do was knock, drop a note, anything and I would've immediately given her my number so she can inform me if I was disturbing her.

I posted a note to her with my number, explaining that if she had contacted me first, I would have cooperated and given her my number immediately.

My mother created a really bad environment for me where I wasn't allowed to criticize my siblings, any time I mentioned a mean or horrible thing they did or said to me I was dismissed or yelled at for being mean talking about my sister or brother like that.

I last year finally told my parents about a lot of the horrible things he's said to me and about them. My parents main response was ""He's our son we still love him."" which is understandable but is not the most reassuring phrase to hear when you're expressing your hurt. 

Anyways, I don't want to see him anytime soon so I can have distance from him and space to heal, so in the summer I told my parents to not invite him to Christmas because I knew I wasn't going to have the option to spend it anywhere else but home and I knew I was not going to be ready by then to spend ""family"" time with him.

I remained polite, I said after your initial lies, I want to do my due diligence and check each anc Very ticket to make sure they are legit. spent another hour checking, and I found multiple tickets weren't even for driving, but expired registration, expired tags, etc etc.
I told her this information, and I also told her husband, she then proceeded to lie some more saying her husband has never gotten a ticket, but I showed her screen shots that in fact he's gotten over 20 tickets the past year. She then proceeded to attack me some more.
Her husband was equally rude and doing exactly what she was doing.

Anyways, I still had every intention to pay the tickets, they they are after all my responsibility. I told them I'm working a lot with overtime. I'm in a different time zone right now. I need a week or so to check everything. And I will pay the tickets online.
They said, NO, you have 3 days to pay us, or we will go to the police. You have to send us the money, not pay online! This gave me more red flags.

Probably because the police can't help them.

I (32f) have a on-off cold since 3 weeks. I didn't take time off of work since I am a teacher, we have a serioius shortage etc. but for weeks I have on off cold symptoms like headache, sore throat, cough, stuffed nose.

On tuesday my body finally decided it's enough. I finished my work day but then called in sick for the rest of the week. Yesterday I needed to go to the doctor for a note, did grocery shopping, cooked a big pot of soup for the next days and nedded to design assignments for my classes since we have the rule that no classes get just canceled but if a teacher gets sick the kids get their class work as online assignments. 

So in other words, I had a pretty full day and couldn't rest as I wanted. I went to bed at 8pm since I felt like I was hit by a truck and I slept like dead.

This morning our dog woke me up at 7.30am. I looked on my phone to find a text from my spouse (35m) from 6.30am that said something along the lines of ""I woke up early and went to work. Since you stay home I figuered you could walk the dog in the morning (which is usually his turn) and in the afternoon. Could you also wash this one item of clothing for me since I'll need it tomorrow. I will be home at 5pm in case you want to get dinner ready.""

I kinda blew up, called my spouse and told him I was dragging myself to work with this cold for 3 weeks now and I finally want to get some rest. That means I don't want to do shit, I just want to stay in bed 24/7 an not be bothered. On sunday I need to get up and prepare my classes for the following week anyway so I just have today, tomorrow and Saturday to heal. 

He was kinda taken aback, said I don't even have a real fever and shouldn't be so dramatic. He thought I would do the neccessary house work since I was home and had nothing to do and I was not THAT sick. And he added as an adult you can't just take a break on life when you have a cold.  

I walked the dog in the morning but made him take the afternoon walk. I did not do his urgent laundry and do not plan to cook his dinner. I have my soup anyway and he is free to cook for himself or order out. Now we are both pissed but I am not sure if he might be right. He still works full time and I would probably not die if I got out of bed and do some stuff. On the other hand I really feel like I deserve to rest.

One more important info: He works 5 min on foot from our home and has flexible hours so it's absolutely no problem to take a 1 hour break in the afternoon and walk the dog or start his laundry. He can also start working whenever he feels like it, e.g. when he played games late he often starts his work day around 10. So there was no reason to skip the morning walk to go to work early.

Me (21/m) and GF (19/f) 

I just recently became a homeowner and got my house about a couple months ago and have been spending every hour of the day when I’m done with work and before I goto work to make this house ready for my girlfriend to live in with me and of course my older brother. Prior to looking at houses I brought up the subject of having my brother move in with us and she was onboard (brother just moved back to home state from California and just needed some help getting on his feet again) 

Over the span of a month I’ve completely demo’d the bathroom upstairs and downstairs to the studs and had the house rewired and replumbed and made a decent size room in the basement next to the bathroom. Pretty much I’ve been working mad crazy on this house and just been stressed and getting burnt out and ready for this house to be done. 

I had some ups and downs with my brother throughout the span of the month and when it came to the room I was building for him I told him I expected him to help build it to the make process go faster and obviously help pay for some of the material. He helped out a tiny amount when it came to building aspect and framing wise for the room and obviously I vented quite a bit to my GF about this but in the end it is my house. Granted my brother worked 12 hour shifts and so did I for my job and in my time outside time of work I worked on the house and he just chilled at my parents house playing video game. 

Fast forward a week and we’re at the painting stage - he’s done all of it thankfully and been doing all the finishing touches and everything got squared away. 

Girlfriend came upto me and doesn’t want my brother moving in no more because she wants to have privacy and be able to walk around the house naked if she wanted to - She also doesn’t like how my brother has been throughout out month - I told her I think everyone is just stressed out and want the house to be done and we’re almost there. I told her to just give a shot living with him for a month or two and seeing how things are and she refuses. She said it’s either me or him and she’s refusing to even compromise or meet me halfway. She then mentioned she wont fully move in and keep majority of her clothes at her moms place. I told her why are you forcing to make a decision when you can just compromise and give it a shot atleast. I told her why? I’ve been busting my balls this last month to get the house prepared and it feels like all the work I did was for nothing. If I knew this ahead of time I wouldn’t have built his room or finish the bathroom in the basement. I told her to talk to my brother and talk things through but she refuses that too so I told you have two options (move in and deal with my brother) or (partially move in and deal with my brother) my brother living here isn’t permanent it’s temporary to get him on his feet again and save up then he’ll leave. My girlfriend said I don’t love her and I’m choosing him over her.

I have a lot of trauma to my name, and the main one is there was never room for me in my family due to a family member being sick my whole life. Now I work in social care, where there sometimes is behavior problems hence I got beat)

My friendgroup of 4 all has some mental health problems, and I think we try to be there for each other at least to have someone who will listen. I also think that's how we all bonded (might not be healthy). 

We have had some problems in our friendship, as two of them flirted a lot with a guy I liked (a party that ended in lingerie, them dancing up and down him and telling him they changed only for him, and trying to see his dick and so) We came through this, but I think it still sits with me. 

We had a time where I was fucked up (sickness in family, I got beat up, load response reaktion, depression and stress). During this, I felt very lonely, but my friend broke up with her boyfriend and I felt that was the only thing important for all of them. 
I told them afterwards how I felt during this, and I got told I was angry and so on.

A year after I got beat again, and I am just really afraid of getting sick and feeling lonely. My family is now battling cancer, and I have some other traumas going on. I tell my friends this, and haven't really heard from anyone since. My friend is not doing good at her new school, and I do anything I can to help. Call her, give flowers, pick her up etc. 

I ask if we are still friends, and I tell her I'm feeling very lonely in my struggles right now. I got told she is having her own struggles and therefor is focusing on only positive things for her (fair, you go girl!) 

I am just again feeling like I don't have any one, and that I am only to use if I can help others which lead me to cutting contact. I don't know if I'm fucked up due to my depression, or if I'm just really allergic to hearing people can't be there for me (my family trauma) or if it's okay that I cut contact with my ""friends"".

I [f30s] was very close with her and her death hit me hard emotionally. Me and my brother inherited equal shares of her life savings.

Because I was her only female child, my mother left all of her jewellery to me. She had a fairly large collection of jewellery that is made from various precious metals and gems, it is all very valuable. 

Before her passing, my mother and I talked a lot about what her wishes would be, and she told me she wants the jewellery passed from generation to generation for the women in the family.

My brother [m40s] has three daughters, [f20], [f15] and [f11]. I discussed it with my brother and I mentioned that I intend to gift my eldest niece some of her grandmother's jewellery.

My brother asked about me giving some of the jewellery to the other two daughters. 

I said I will when they're both 18 and done with high school. I think kids their age usually aren't mature enough to understand the importance of the jewellery or to take good care of it. When I was a teenager lots of girls at my school would bring jewellery to school and it would be stolen.

My brother said I'm being unfair to my nieces and that if I'm going to give jewellery to the eldest, all of them should receive jewellery straight away or they'll feel left out. He said that I'm not the one who will have to deal with the younger two being sad. 

He suggested I just gift all of them the jewellery now. I don't think this is reasonable, kids of different ages get treated differently in certain situations because that's what's appropriate. He thinks I'm being harsh on the younger two and being selfish.

So, would it make me the jerk to just gift my eldest niece some of the jewellery, leaving out the younger two, against my brother's wishes?

I told her this information, and I also told her husband, she then proceeded to lie some more saying her husband has never gotten a ticket, but I showed her screen shots that in fact he’s gotten over 20 tickets the past year. She then proceeded to attack me some more.

Her husband was equally rude and doing exactly what she was doing. 

Anyways, I still had every intention to pay the tickets , they they are after all my responsibility. I told them I’m working a lot with overtime. I’m in a different time zone right now. I need a week or so to check everything. And I will pay the tickets online. They said, NO, you have 3 days to pay us, or we will go to the police. You have to send us the money, not pay online! 
This gave me more red flags. 

So after 5 days, the wife decided to call my wife, and start making threats, attacking my wife and she decided to make this entire situation public. Probably because the police can’t help them.

I'm glad for him because most of his past boyfriends have been horrible. However I also find it very annoying being around him and his boyfriend when they're together because they're so overly affectionate to each other, especially the boyfriend. 

They aren't being overly sexual so that's not the problem. They're just very lovey-dovey. For example the boyfriend has hundreds of pet names for my friend: baby, angel, gorgeous, beautiful, and so on. I find it a bit nauseating. He's also constantly wanting to hold hands or give him hugs and kisses, not full-on making out to be fair but it's still a lot. My friend doesn't seem to have a problem with it at all but he does seem slightly shy or embarrassed sometimes. 

I find it very annoying and uncomfortable. It seems unnecessary and a bit forced to me. None of my other couple friends are like that.  I've mentioned a few times that I find it off-putting but no one seemed to pick up on it. I've also made some pointed jokes, like reminding the boyfriend that my friend has a name when he's calling him by pet names. The last time I saw them I lost my patience slightly and told the boyfriend to stop putting on a show because no one wants to see it. 

No one really took my side at all and multiple people have assumed it's because they're gay which isn't the case, I wouldn't want to see a straight couple acting like that either. Most of our mutual friends say they think it's sweet and I should be happy for them which I am. I have suspicions it would be different if they weren't gay, I think people are scared of looking like they don't accept their relationship.

I (20F) feel like the asshole. This started in February / march 2022, and the issue has gotten worse since. My family runs a martial arts business but since Covid we have backed off on classes and are in the process of shutting down. A few of the students have become very close family friends. On in particular is a single mum (call her Kate) or 2 kids (19F call her G and 17M call him D). In feb/march of this year, the daughter was taking by ambulance to the hospital for mental health issues were she was told that her mother doesn’t have to be let in as she was 18 at this point. After that, she moved out without really conversing with her mother. 

Fast forward to June, the day on my birthday too, I get a call from Kate saying the son has run from school and is most likely coming to me, not telling me any reasons or anything. Turns out, he had been speaking to his sister and she didn’t like that (Kate is mentally unwell and said ‘daughter is dead to me’). And this is where I feel like I start being an asshole - it’s my birthday, in my family, we always have dinner together (normally something home cooked by my nan) but this time, D wanted pizza instead so that happens. Kate then calls my parents with a mental health crisis so they leave me at home with D and go to her, meeting police and ambos. After this nothing much happens until September. 

September comes around and D called my dad saying ‘mums gone crazy please help’. When him and my mum arrive, there are police there escorting him around the house to protect him. He has lived with us since. 

I have been called many things by this woman but I can see why she isn’t trying anymore. She feels like her children have been taken and I truly don’t think D and Kate will ever be able to communicate again if he stays with us any longer. D also has a dog that he barely cares for - I do more than he does(he feeds his and my dog at night - I do everything else)

My husband (M39) inherited the house from his mother a couple years ago when she died. It was her house alone because my FIL (M76) had alot of dept and they would have lost it when his name would have been on the house. So the house went to my husband when she died and they made an agreement that he could live there rent free till he dies. 
Also the house was a present from an old women my MIL, FIL and my husband cared about when she was old. So no dept on the house. 
Now we have two children and moved to another state. There we found a house we wanna buy. 
And my FIL found a women that lives near where we live now. They wanna move in together in her house. That is fine with us. We like that women. We also will celebrate Christmas together. 
We want to bring in the house he lives in now (our house) so the monthly fees will be less. He is fine with that too - even though the house is not his and he basically has nothing to tell my husband and me what to do with it. 

Anyway: My FIL wants all the money for himself if we sell or give it up for rent. 
We said this is rediculous because he will live rentfree at the new womens house and gives up is agreement to live for free in our house. 
He said it is his house and it is just in our name because he would have lost in otherwise. 

I told him he would loose all the money as well if we give it to him because of his dept and it is our house anyway. We would maybe give him some money to pay for gas and power monthly. But thats it. He said because of the agreement it is his money till he dies. 
Now he doesn’t want to move to that women and blames us that we are ungrateful and don’t support his relealationship with that women.

My children are in their upper twenties  and hers are well into their thirties. None of them have ever lived with us and they are all living on their own.

After getting married my wife and I purchased a farm that we currently live on. The problem is that my stepson has laid claim to everything we own by calling it ""Ours"". We were sitting at the table and we was looking at a magazine and saw something he liked in it. He looked at me and said ""We need this on our farm"". He has referred to everything this way. Our farm, our cows, our tractor, our truck, our pond, our work shop. You get the idea. One day he told me he needed the truck to haul something. He was referring to my pick up. In my mind I was thinking couldn't you ask me to borrow my truck like most people would instead of telling me your taking it. 

The final straw was when he went into my workshop and rearranged stuff and made adjustments to some equipment I have without me knowing about it. I sent him a text and blew up at him telling him that he was entitled and had no respect for the stuff that his mom work hard to have. I told him that because his mom and I own something it doesn't mean that he also owns it. I also told him to never make changes to my equipment without talking to me about it first. He told me to fuck off and that he never really liked me anyway. He was just nice to me because of his mom.

The setting: I’m (21F) visiting family today because it’s my sisters birthday. I met up with my mom (53F) at her house first and we’ll drive to my sisters house in an hour.

I woke up at 10, got up, and immediately my mom told me I had to give a massage (she is a trained masseuse and taught me when I was younger so I could give her massages as well). I hadn’t eaten anything yet and was still sleepy but I was fine with it. Then I got up and made myself lunch and as soon as I sat down she come over and demanded I fix her phone. I asked her what exactly she needed me to do. She wanted a new protective glass on her screen. I told her to let me finish my meal because I’m hungry and I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday (I‘m a chef and we were super busy last night and when I got home I had some stuff to do so i forgot to eat). She immediately got loud with me, saying things like „You never do anything for me“ and how I‘m such a bad daughter. I told her to fuck off and let me eat. Then she left for the living room and sat there sulking.

Myself and many other people have asked the manager to not park in the disabled bay but he always gets defensive and on some occasions gets aggressive, when we ask other managers about it they say that he parks his car there because he doesn't want it to get scratched and he's got permission from the owner to park there.

Whilst writing this I understand that he has permission to park there but the reason is not a valid reason because if he parks in any parking spot normally he won't have to worry about his car getting scratched and it being his fault.

I've dealt with this for three years but what made me the most annoyed was today when a delivery came and the delivery truck always parks in front of the store and doesn't cover the disabled bay but due to his poor parking the truck had trouble trying to get out of the parking spaces. When my colleague asked if he could move his car the manger got defensive saying that he's never had to do it before and when another manager came in to ask him to move he went to move it whilst muttering words in the process and when the other manger said ""I don't understand the big fuss over this"" The first manager whipped round and starts getting aggressive on the other manager. He then went back inside and left the truck to get itself out.

When my colleague told me this I was seething with anger because it's bad enough we get spoken to like that from customers but managers acting as immature and unprofessional as he did is an absolute joke because it seems like he's abusing his power as a manager to get his way.

I'm now thinking he needs to be taught a lesson and the best way I think he'll learn to not be rude to everyone but also park in the correct spots is by calling a tow truck company on his car and have his car taken away but there a thought in my mind that I could end up losing my job over this so I thought I should ask reddit to get your opinions.
