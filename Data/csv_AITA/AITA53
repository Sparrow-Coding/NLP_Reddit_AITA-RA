Holidays with DH usually involve him spending until we're in serious debt and he's yelling, screaming, breaking things, making threats to me &amp; the kids &amp; the ""fun"" doesn't stop 'til I'm crying so hard I puke. I hate all of that but for once I did not bring that part up in our discussion.

I hate that I'm expected to buy a bunch of presents with money I don't have for people who won't even appreciate them, &amp; then I'm expected to graciously receive presents from people whom I've repeatedly told I don't want them &amp; to leave me the fuck alone about it! I told my husband I feel this way last night, not for the first time. He said I should receive graciously because he enjoys giving &amp; otherwise I will rob him of the pleasure he gets from giving.

I said all I get out of it is that you can't respect my wishes &amp; you want to keep forcing me into it. I said the last thing I need is more shit to find a place for &amp; clean.  I was probably an AH there &amp; I think I hurt his feelings.

I hate the dinner too &amp; I said that too! I told him I hate that it's just a huge expense that's going to fuck up my diet once I'm pressured into eating the foods I never even wanted in the first place. What's the point? The kids hate every part of the dinner &amp; I try to avoid this shit all year &amp; don't want to make an exception now &amp; no one is coming so who but him is it for? I told him to go to his grow daughter's house if he wants Xmas &amp; leave us alone. 

I told him I hate the wrapping paper because it's expensive &amp; messy. I hate the lights because they're an unnecessary effort &amp; expense &amp; we have bills &amp; responsibilities that are more important. I told him I AM a ""Scrooge"" but unlike Scrooge I am never changing my mind &amp; those movies where someone is eventually forced to love Christmas make me sick!

I told him I am drowning &amp; overwhelmed by other responsibilities &amp; health issues &amp; I just can't handle all this extra shit! I said we're taught tolerance of Kwanzaa and Hanukkah etc. &amp; that's fine but why can he not tolerate the person who doesn't want to be part of it and leave them alone?

Her mom, Sue (F47) didn't take it well at first. Last month, Lucy has been making trips at her parents' house every Saturday to make up with her mom. Since she's close with my sister, Judy (F19 and bisexual) and we live like 10 minutes away from her parents she would visit our house as well and bring her new dog.

I guess a few days ago, Sue must have asked Judy if she knew any places that sell LGBT merchandise. This morning Judy has been getting texts from Sue showing suggestions of aroace stuff that Sue wants to buy for Lucy as a Christmas gift. Judy has been smiling from each text and I'll admit, it got me annoyed.

I don't get along with majority of the family. My dad and I are like the black sheeps. Lucy especially I just really dislike. I'll admit, I am an AH for wishing that Sue never accepted Lucy. I have friends who are LGBT and not being accepted is really hurtful. Hating my cousin isn't an excuse to wish that on anyone who is LGBT.

Now the reason why I think she's lying, is because she's lied about her sexual identity before. In high school she made everyone believe she was a lesbian which caused her to lose friends which probably gave her abandonment issues because she's been seeing the school counselor practically throughout her whole high school years. In fact when she went to college, she went to see the counselor there. And she now has her own therapist. She didn't tell us she wasn't a lesbian until she was in her first year of college. She didn't tell us about her identity, just said she wasn't a lesbian.

This is what my conversation with Judy went.

Me: How do you go from only liking girls to liking nobody?

Judy: You don't know what the f you're talking about

Me: How does that make sense?

Judy: She never said she was a lesbian. We all thought she was

Me: She said she knew she was asexual when she was 17

Judy: She wasn't ready ok? Back the f up

Me: How do we know she's not lying again?

Judy at this point just repeatedly said ""shut the f up"" while she goes upstairs. Later she came back down with her bag and I said again ""how do we know she's not lying again"" and she again repeatedly said ""shut the f up"" while she grabs her keys and drove off. She had like two hours before her classes started so I know she left early to get away from me.

I briefly mentioned this to my partner (M32) and then booked the flights to be away for a week in Spring of next year. I told my partner what dates I'd booked which isn't near either of our birthdays or any other significant dates and said he'd be home to look after the two hamsters. It's worth noting that I've hardly seen my partner in the last month duee to different circumstances and life things so we haven't had many proper conversations outwith messaging recently. 

My partner seemed okay with everything, was asking me about visas and seemed excited to look after the pets. I didn't ask him to come with me as the flights are expensive and I'll be staying with my friend in her 1 bedroom apartment and she'd invited only me although she has met and likes my partner. 

A few hours later we were arguing and he told me that he wasn't happy I'd booked flights to see my friend without discussing with him. I apologised but said I thought he'd be okay with it since it was only a week. We're planning to get pregnant but even if I do get pregnant between now and the trip I'll be way under the 24 weeks before I'm reccomended not to fly. 

I apologised for not properly discussing it with him and he told me that he wasn't comfortable with me going. I asked him why he wasn't comfortable and his response was ""its just something I'm not comfortable with"" and couldn't expand on it. He also said he wouldn't be comfortable with me going on a just girls holiday and again couldn't expand on why he'd be uncomfortable. The last girls holiday I went on was before we got together and wasn't anything crazy, me and a couple of girls went to a beach resort and just ate food, hung out at the beach and would be back in bed by 11pm,no clubbing, hardly any drinking and no talking to other men or anything of the sort! 

He asked me to cancel the flights which I couldn't do, then said he'd prefer I didn't go and that he would pay me back for the money I lose by not getting on the flight.

My boyfriend (34m) has a job he really enjoys where he gets to work outdoors. He gets to take people fishing, hiking, snowmobiling, etc. 

I don’t make a ton of money, but I do pretty good for myself. My boyfriend makes quite a bit less than I do, but obviously has a job he enjoys. 

Housing where we live right now is absolutely insane. I don’t see us ever being able to afford a house here. At the moment, I’m renting a very nice, but pretty small apartment for way more than I should be paying. He lives in a crappy house with a roommate at a pretty reasonable price. My lease will be up in about 6 months so this conversation is being brought up a little bit more frequently lately.

This isn’t a new topic between us at all, but it seems like it finally clicked during our latest chat - he realizes he would be leaving his job. I explained that would be his choice, and I would never want him to resent me or “blame” me for having to move. It would be OUR decision.

He mentioned there could be potential for him to start making a little more money at work, but explained that probably wouldn’t be for another four years. Honestly, four years seems too long for me to wait for something like this, but I don’t want to throw away our relationship either.

There are a lot of places we could move and pay a fifth of the price of homes here. I don’t want to throw away a lifelong dream, but I don’t want to make him throw away his either. And I really don’t want to spend my life throwing all my money into crappy houses or rentals just to live in this area.

I should add neither of us have any family in the area, either. I am not pushing to move closer or farther from any family and don’t really have a particular place picked out (since I wouldn’t need to find a job, location will be a lot more important to him)

I said okay and after I finished working ran to the store, got her a sandwich I Thought she liked, and brought it to the restaurant she works at (it’s a kind of expensive place so she rarely buys food from there).

But when I got their, she told me that she never gets that exact sandwich because of the Garlic Aioli that was on it. That she always subs that out with honey mustard. I felt really bad and offered to get her something else. But she repeatedly said no. Told me to take the sandwich away, and that she would just get something at the restaurant she works at.

She was visibly upset, but because she kept turning down me running out and getting her something new, I relented and left after checking one last time. After I left she texted me “I’m hungry af idc if it gives me a stomach ache I guess I’ll eat it cause I’m gonna throw up if I don’t”. But when I apologized again and went to turn the car around, she texted me “Nevermind” and then went on about how I fuck up a good day, how I don’t pay attention to the little things, how she could’ve ordered me a whole meal I would have loved, and that she was over this shit.

To that I said “I’m sorry, what do you want me to do” to which she said “I want to break up I can’t do this anymore”

I repeatedly offered to get her something new while she just told me she wants to break up again. And told me to shove the food up my ass when I asked about what food she wanted.

After that it was essentially total radio silence, no response to text messages, until she got home from work hours later at about 1am. Which at that point she put headphones on and ignored me/gave me the silent treatment for about 45 minutes.

After that when she finally spoke she told me that the fuck ups that I needed to fix were: getting her something she’d told me once before she didn’t like, then not going to get her something new, and finally not having something ready for her when she got home.

From my perspective, okay, I’m sorry, I got a bad sandwich that is my bad. But she repeatedly turned down my offers to get her something else (which she later said she did because she wanted me to fix it without being told what to do), so I listened to what she was telling me to do. And then after she told me she wanted to break up along with other hurtful worlds I shut down and didn’t make her any food for when she got home hours later, which I feel is a reasonable reaction.

He began an affair with an ex girlfriend while dealing with his PTSD. The affair is very out of character for him, and before it began, there were no (outward) signs of problems with his marriage. He and his wife have 3 small children. I mention this to say that I acknowledge there was a question of his judgment in getting into the affair at all (if affairs are ever ok). His wife and my whole family found out when he announced he would be getting divorced and that his gf, who lives out of state, would be moving in with him.

About 4 months into the affair, he called me and said the gf is in town and he needs me to get her from the airport. I’d been the only one in the family supporting him, his happiness, and mental health. Yes i knew he was depressed and judgment was iffy, but he was very clear about wanting to leave his wife and be with the gf. I was the only one he’ll talk to about what he’s going through. So I go get her, and since I was going out of town for a week, I let them both stay at my house.

My sister in law and the rest of the family found out and are pissed for “enabling the affair.” The gf also got pregnant that week. I don’t see why that matters as they would have an affair wherever. My sister in law says it was “disgusting” that I let it happen under my roof. Before this happened, she and I were close but not best friends or anything. Either way, though, I was supporting my brother and what he said he wanted. 

My brother has since reversed course and is trying to make it work with his wife while working through his MH problems. He ended it with the gf notwithstanding the pregnancy.

Some background: I’ve had a history of struggling with eating disorders. I’ve been open with my family about it. I’m content with where I am right now.

I have history with the guy I’m talking to right now. I’m not going to say that there were no issues from my part, but he was a complete asshole, got caught lying, and was immature about it. He reached out to apologize and I thought, “okay.” We got together the other day to discuss what happened. I spoke a bit about my struggles and said how I just had to watch my portions until my next few shows were over, so that was annoying. But I otherwise want nothing to do with it. He offhandedly said skinny girls are his preference. I ignored it. (I should add he’s also drastically changed his own dietary habits and is working out religiously. He’s free to do as he pleases, just to try and limit the “talk” of stressing over calorie counting with me.)

We had to cancel dinner last night, so we reschedule for the weekend. He starts talking about cooking for me: “if you want to stay skinny, I can make you some cut food.” I don’t think much of it until he starts talking about his low cal food. Calories and gs of protein in every other sentence. “Being skinny AND enjoying yourself?” I’m try to switch the topic. But he keeps going. I leave it there but I don’t let him know how uncomfortable it made me. Pretty much, “oh, he probably just got caught up in it and forgot.”

I make a smoothie for breakfast. He says “careful with what you blend.” Suddenly starts talking about how the fruits I’m blending are full of free sugars, and I need to be careful with that and try to avoid an excess. So I just say, “I’m going to hurt you, dude.” A joke, but a warning. He keeps going. So I’m clear about it this time, tell him it doesn’t help, that I’m not trying to stress every little detail again.

He says he’s not a mind reader. I tell him that I understand, but I don’t want to feel guilty over what I eat. “But you look great, so don’t even worry!” And then, when I said nothing, word for word: “bro, don’t be mad. I was just trying to help. Didn’t think it was that deep, sorry if I hit a nerve.” I tell him how I felt last night about the low cal food, and that this today was just hurtful. Then he insists he’s just trying to help me stay skinny for next week, talking about calories and sugars because he’s spreading good information. 

I literally felt sick. He’s trying to excuse himself, so I don’t respond. He then says I blew up on him like he’s some kind of monster, he didn’t know it affected me so much.

He says he doesn’t want anything for Christmas anyway and we are not big holiday people.

For additional context, we have had a really rocky relationship that has been predominantly one sided - with extremely low effort on his end. I was the “gifter” and overachiever for a very long time (still am, but he’s making little improvements to do more and I am establishing boundaries). I’ve paid for most vacations, some much needed cosmetic dental work for him, the majority of dates, etc. He is not very romantic and most romantic gestures come from me (writing notes, making romantic playlist, etc).  I have gifted him unique dates and dinner for every anniversary. He did not do anything for our anniversary in the two years that we’ve been married, not even so much as a “happy anniversary”. I had called him out on it this year and he ordered a necklace to pacify me. 

We are now in the process of home buying and i have worked for years to get up to the point of having a sizeable down payment and good credit score. He cannot contribute anything to the down payment/closing costs/ and does not have a strong credit score. He’s been complacent with career progression and does not make consistent attempts to get additional certifications to advance his career. He makes a little over minimum wage and I make $50/hr. I have spoken to him numerous times about feeling like a straight up sugar mama and how I hate the financial dynamic of our relationship. He makes promises to do better but of course, it’s short lived.

He also did not put any effort for years into international traveling (been trying to convince him to travel with me for six years outside the country) and now he is planning on finally getting his passport for a family member’s destination wedding. I kinda find that to be very telling of how dismissive he is to my own wants.

All this to say, i love him dearly but he’s a obvious man child who I have overcompensated for. The resentment regarding his lack of effort/reciprocation has left me feeling unmotivated to continue spending any type of money on him besides basic necessities. We have done couples counseling in the past and our therapist definitely was helpful but he was not 100% receptive. I can’t change him so I’m just focusing on establishing healthy boundaries. Yes, I am enrolled in therapy myself.

Eli told Ally she felt like she was spending too much time with me and was worried that I was a big part of why Ally kept flaking. When trying to make a plan to connect Ally told Eli that we try to be consistent about having dinner together in the evenings. Eli was saying things like “im only asking for one night” and “I don’t mean any harm but one night shouldn’t be too much to ask for” instead of trying to find times that work for them both. Then Eli said she was “good on hanging out” (didn’t want to make the plan with Ally anymore). Ally is the type of person to try to pry and figure out where she went wrong in the situation so she asked to talk otp. Ally told Eli we’re good and I am not the reason she has been flaking. She also told her I have been wanting to meet her. Ally learned that Eli was going through things with other friends and bc of that was feeling extra lonely every time Ally flaked. Ally missed dinner with me to pacify the situation and talk to Eli that night and although Eli said via text that she didn’t want to hang out, after the phone call, they had decided to meet and do dinner on Friday night of that same week to get a chance to fully catch up. They had their dinner and Eli asked if Ally was SURE I have no problems with them being friends. Ally assured Eli that I am supportive of their friendship and that I want to meet her. Ally left feeling confident they were on the same page. Fast forward to a couple days ago. Eli let Ally know that she is not open to meeting me anymore right now bc she is convinced that since we haven’t met yet, it is bc I have not wanted to meet her and “now” that I do want to meet her, I probably have ulterior motive bc she has done the same things in the past. Eli told Ally that she has behavior tendencies and I have them too (we still haven’t met) and ended by asking confirmation AGAIN that I am Ally’s person.

Eli keeps assuming the worst in me without knowing me. Ally says she can see how I feel disrespected but she doesn’t feel disrespected/offended on my behalf. Ally says because Eli is seeing a therapist and trying to work through some things, she knows that it’s not her fault Eli is coming to these conclusions so she isn’t taking it personal.

I am upset with Ally for not once ever telling Eli that she shouldn’t talk about me that way.

I female (29) is currently married to my now husband (31) for 2 months now.
I love to cook to spend my time at home, I try to cook new dishes whenever I can.

 The problem all started when my MIL came to meet us she flew all the way from Canada to the uk unannounced, well to me at least my husband apparently knew 2 months in advance but I didn’t really care about it since we have a guest room (we don’t have children yet). My MIL has been here for now 2 weeks and she criticises me behind my husbands back and when I tell my husband about it he just makes excuses after excuses just trying to avoid the situation.

Ok so we prepared a family gathering bringing our close family to meet mil and because my house is big on the inside you can hear conversations really easily even with the doors closed. So as my husbands family gathers at our house a interesting conversation kicks up about cooking but my mil excludes me from it telling me to look after the food. I continue making the final preparations as I overhear my MIL criticising my cooking and how the kitchen is polluted by my cooking and other hurtful things , I felt sad upon hearing what she said so I brought in enough plates for my family excluding my mil.

At first she was happy seeing the food but once I gave everyone plates and seeing that she didn’t get a plate she suddenly turned quiet she asked me where’s her plate but I ignored her and walked back into the kitchen.

Now this is where I might be ta. Mil walked into the kitchen and demanded for a plate but I loudly replied back to her saying “I thought my food made the kitchen polluted yet your stood here ” the house turned quiet and MIL grabbed a plate went to the living room asking her niece to stay at their place. Once my Mil and everyone had left my husband got furious at me for what I had said and told me I was way out of line for saying what I had said. Husband &amp; mil are giving me the silence treatment and husband isn’t eating my food anymore.

We went to school together. We were in the army together. He is like a brother to me. Our wives also became close friends and they were both pregnant at the same time. Our daughters (19F) have never been really close but they were generally friendly with each other, specially when they were both little girls.

When his wife died 10 years ago, he had a really hard time. He started drinking a lot, driving recklessly to the point that he run over his daughter's dog and kill him. I tried to help him the best I could during those years but I have always felt I didn't do enough. Once his daughter turned 18, she left him and they no longer have any contact. My wife and I still talk to her sometimes to be sure she is ok. Since last year, he had been more stable. He does not drink anymore and he started dating a college girl he met on tinder. He is not interested in reconnecting with his daughter because he says she reminds him too much to his dead wife, so talking to her might make him relapse.

My daughter is not spending christmas with us this year because she will be doing humanitarian work in Ghana. So my wife and I decided to go to our beach house in Florida during the holidays. My friend was also planning to go to that region with his girlfriend at that time. He has spent holidays with us many times before, so the idea of him staying with us for a few days wasn't crazy but I knew my wife wasn't going to like it if he came with his girlfriend.

I talk to my wife and she said it is fine if they spend a few days with us in the house during the holidays but they can't sleep in the same room. My friend will be at his usual guest room but his girlfriend will have to stay at our daughter's room. He says that he will accept those terms but still feels it is unfair. I am worried about how all this will affect his mental state. This relationship with his girlfriend has been so important for his recovery so I am afraid that what my wife is doing might be too cruel. Maybe I should have argued more in his behalf.

I have a feeling that he is only accepting because he really want to spend the holidays with us as he has had paranoia about being ""left out"" from our friendship since his wife dad. I also suspect he already had promised his girlfriend that they will stay in a fancy beach house and didn't want to be forced to put her in a cheap hotel. Ultimately, I felt that we are putting him in a somewhat emasculating situation and that he is only playing along because of his fragile situation.

I was friends with a girl (S) for 16 years and have known her since 11 years old. I've always been close to her mother (R) and her brothers (D and L) and sister (J). In June 2022, S didn't congratulate me on getting engaged to my partner of 8 years, and in July 2022, S didn't wish me happy birthday knowingly and distanced herself from me as she got back with her ex who left her and her newborn nearly 9 years ago. I hashed it all out with S (as our kids go to the same school and we have to see eachother every day) but told her I don't want to be friends anymore. There's loads of stuff but that's the general gist.

So December 1st is R's farewell party as she is going to Thailand with her ex (S's dad who she recently got back with) and I was invited along with my kids. It was a school day so 9am-3pm and then my eldest had a birthday party for a kid in his class (was organised in August and I have conversational proof with dates and times messages were sent between me and the kids mum) at 5pm-6.30pm. The farewell party started at 4pm and was going until 9pm. It was a school day the next day (today) and we didn't get back from the party until 7.20pm. Not only was I not really wanting to go for the simple fact that I didn't want to see S, me and R have had some issues recently too. 

Also, we live an hours walk from S's home. I dont drive and taxis cost a bomb. Anyway, I wasn't going to walk there to then have to walk back after 20 minutes so I said I wasn't going to go. S kicked off saying that my eldest deserves to say goodbye to R and that her kids wanted me and my kids there. I told her that I wasn't blowing off the birthday party that had been arranged for months and I wasn't walking down to leave within 10-20 mins. 

I organised with R to take my kids to hers on the 6ty before she leaves on the 7th. S just doesn't think this is right and that I'm being an a*****e for not going.

Fast forward about three months and they break up (they were together for 5 months). At this point, I am super close with the gf and also good friends with the bf. 

Once they broke up, something in my brain clicked and I realized that I never actually stopped liking him, I just tried to repress it for her sake. At this point, they've been broken up for three and half weeks, he's totally over it (he broke up with her) but she's still in love with him, and I'm over here secretly longing for this guy that my friend is heartbroken over. He and I and I have gotten closer and I think he might potentially like me back but I don't know. I would like to pursue a relationship with him eventually but I feel like a terrible person because of my friend. Everyone I've talked to about it says that it's a bad idea but I feel like we'd be good together. 

I've been in a situation like this before where I liked someone but listened to everyone else and wound up not going out with him and he got another girlfriend. I've regretted it ever since and I don't regret anything with this guy.

Around five hours later my best friend came to play a couple of round of madden 16 and he came down to interact a little bit and went mad when he saw usplaying since he said it was my responsibility that the console was on and got so much stress and heat unnecessarily and it was due to rest for a couple of days.

I took all his stuff and put them into his room and told him that if he wanted to continue living here he would have to pay rent and services and his living space would be limited to one room for himself, kitchen, diningroom and bathroom as common areas and that he could not use any of my stuff.

Initially he was working only evenings (from 4PM to 12 PM) and he is a bit of night-bird anyway, so he was going to bed at 2-3 AM. Later he got other jobs which required night work (to 6-7AM) so he was mostly asleep for the day. I accepted that situation. In some cases he would spend my birthday and significant holidays as well as whatever vacation time we had together either sleeping or doing his hobby, although he would promise every time that he would wake up / stay awake and we would spend them together. I spend 4 of my last birthday and Chrismas alone waiting for him to wake up. I entertain myself quite well so even though I am not thrilled about the situation I can understand.  
For the past 1.5 years he has been working days (normal 9 to 5). Still his sleep pattern is off (he actually sleeps during the day more than he does at night). He is also complaining a lot about not being able to fall asleep and stay asleep. He adamantly refuses to seek any professional help and states that he just needs to reset his sleeping pattern (which he does nothing about).  It's not a question of money, we live in a country where healthcare is state insured. I am quite worried about this as I feel that it's a more complicated such as chronic insomnia or depression.   
During my last birthday I decided not to stick around like an idiot and went and had a nice day by myself doing my hobby. Altough originally planned for 1-2hrs, this extended the entire day. When I came back around 6PM he was awake (but not for long) said ""I chose to spend my birthday doing something else"".   
Today we had another vacation time where he promissed to take me out to lunch so I waited for him to wake up and go out instead of doing my hobby (which is outdoors). This has not happened. I feel at this stage that his sleep pattern is starting to have a serious impact on our relationship and I am wondering if he is just using his sleep issue to avoid spending time with me.

My reasons for not wanting to go;
1; I have a final exam due next week (I’m in uni) and more time to study would be grand (as the celebration is happening a few hours away and requires an overnight stay)
2; I have social anxiety and crowds make me severely uncomfortable 
3; the restaurant has nothing I can eat due to my dietary restrictions 
4; I don’t drink 

I knew I’d not enjoy the event to begin with as the three last points were still true when the plans were made. I’d probably feel like the ultimate party pooper. However, it’s his 40th and I feel like I should probably tolerate being uncomfortable for a day to make him happy. 

We’re going out with close family for a nice dinner on his actual birthday, so it’s not like I’d be skipping out on his whole big day, just the “dinner and drinking with old friends”-part.

I made a joke trying to ease the tnesion and I said something along the lines of “I’m never kissing someone random again, thats Melissas thing not mine.” I had assumed that it was okay to joke about considering we all had in the past, but the friend I said it to passed the message on and Melissa sent me a long text explaining why she was hurt.

I am the youngest of 5 girls. When I was born, my sisters were 14, 13, 10, &amp; 7. Before me, my parents were very poor. Mom worked at night and dad dug ditches for the water company, they lived in a small trailer &amp; were barely scraping by. When I was born they had better paying jobs, &amp; when I was in HS they were solidly middle class. By then my sisters were married &amp; out of the house with families of their own. My parents were able to provide me with things that my sisters never had. My sisters I’m spoiled &amp; when I was in my 20's one sister told me that I was a spoiled brat. I was married, had a child, &amp; working as an RN supporting myself.

During my parents 50th anniversary I couldn’t go because I had a 13 &amp; 8 yo, nephew living with us, finishing my PhD, &amp; it was during the semester (teaching at a university). 2 sisters were angry I didn't go. They didn't outright say it but I was accidentally added to a family chat I wasn't in. #1 is broke, but constantly wants to buy our parents gifts, once my parents needed a new washer/dryer because theirs died, mine died the same week. #1 insisted we split the cost among us. #1 constantly says how important family is to her, but her idea of showing it is spending money she doesn't have. Except in the incident that I finally said I’m done. My oldest son graduated HS in ‘21. I mailed announcements to my entire family. 2 of my sisters sent him something. #1 &amp; #4 didn’t send a card. I’ve given all their kids graduation gifts, even when FIVE nieces graduate the same yr. I’ve sent baby shower gifts to my nieces for each pregnancy. Less than a year ago my niece (daughter of #1) was pregnant with #2 &amp; having a virtual baby shower. I got her a gift because she's my niece &amp; I love her. Sister #4 sent her an elaborate gift, when I saw my heart broke for my son, who neither #1 nor #4 could be bothered to send him a card because they resent me. I immediately unfriended them from FB &amp; have spoken to them only when necessary.

Original WIBTA. Parents’ 60th wedding anni is in ‘25 &amp; mom wants a family cruise with her daughters &amp; grandchildren. Alaskan cruise is booked &amp; all have paid but me. Problem is it’s also our 25th anni &amp; we’ve been planning a family Germany trip for &gt; 5 yrs. Cruise is in June, only time I can travel is in summer &amp; right after my kids graduate from college AND HS.  Tried to tell mom, but she said sisters will be angry I'm not there. She also said, ""It will be the last time everyone will be together before your dad, or I die."" I can afford to go, but we would have to sacrifice our anni/family trip. Plus, I would inevitably have a few drinks &amp; tell my sisters off in front of our extended family &amp; my parents' friends. WIBTA for not going on the cruise?

I have been with my husband for 11 years, and have 2 kids. My husband has a dad and step-mom, and a much younger brother, who has a wife and baby. We have always invited the dad to everything, and he comes to birthdays and Christmas, a few big things, but that’s it. Bare minimum. He was always too busy.

 A couple of years ago my husbands brother got married and they now have a 1 year old.  From the beginning the new wife excluded my husband and children from their wedding, we weren’t even told to come early for the family photos. We found out by accident from the Dad the day of that they were doing them.  Her sister was included in the photos, but not him, the grooms only brother. My FIL didn’t see why that would upset my husband. 

A year ago we all are at a family trip and we have to share a condo with BIL. (We did not do the arrangements, mother in law planned this trip) He gets drunk, tells us how his wife hates us, doesn’t like our kids, she hates coming to anything we are at and he hates having to listen to it. he apologized for her behavior- but let’s be honest, he’s ok with it so it is what it is. Once again FIL doesn’t see at all why we would be offended by this. 

Now that their baby is here,my MIL watches the baby everyday. they even go on trips with them and her parents and sisters family and seem like a perfect family. And that’s great for them, I truly wish I had that. I have always tried to include my in-laws, but they were always too busy. I think the most painful thing for me is that 2 years ago my stepdad of 20 years passed away. My in-laws had met him many times, but couldn’t spare an hour in the same city they work in to come to the funeral. But now they can take trips with the new DIL family.  In March they took a trip all together on the same weekend as my oldest child’s birthday, and then called her on the wrong day to say happy bday. She’s old enough to notice and was pretty upset. It was also because they were all together on speaker talking to her while shopping at Dollywood. So it was like a slap in the face, like “happy birthday, look at the fun we’re having without you!”They have never tried to include my parents in anything, and don’t even ask how they are. and now, they have started inviting DILs family to Christmas and thanksgiving. We feel forgotten, and while they’ve all been on multiple trips just this fall, we haven’t even heard from any of them or seen them since August. So for the fist time in over a decade, I said something. I let MIL know how we feel and that if we continue to be treated as afterthoughts then we will not be coming to Christmas or anything else. Now I am the families outcast. AITA for stirring this all up right before Christmas?

During the time together, we have been extremely happy. Although we have been long distance for about a year (she is off at college while I am currently working to afford to go back to college), we have made our relationship flourish and continue to grow as individuals but as a couple as well.

However, yesterday she came to me to discuss her emotions and how she has been feeling for a little while, which is very normal for us because we have always believe in good communication to reduce conflicts and make problem solving between us so much easier. She came to me saying that she has felt like couldn't grow as individual because there are so many things that she wants to do an aspire to get to, but because she's been in relationships in general consistently since she was 14 (exes were abusive or negligent towards her and her time) she felt like she wanted to be single to explore her life and figure out what she wants to do.

Through all of the conversation, she also kept telling me that there is a huge part of her that doesn't want to leave, that I have been there for her and help her change her life for the better and that she has never been happier in her life. She cried to me about how she hates feeling like this is the last time we are going to talk or that we are going to go in separate directions and not have each other in our lives anymore.

Her proposal was that she wanted to take a 2-3 week long break so she could take the time to figure out what she wants to do and how she wants to move forward, but she doesn't want me to feel like I'm being strung along behind her. I have told her that I just want to see her happy, and that she has a lot on her plate to sort out, and that no matter what I would support her decision.

Obviously, I am personally heartbroken currently, because I am trying to cope with the fact that even though she told me that our relationship as partners was perfect and she was so happy being with me, she still didn't want to be with me. I feel like an asshole being heartbroken about it because I don't want to be selfish and make her feel like she can't peruse her own dreams and discover herself more, but I have tried to salvage our relationship by showing her my own options and perspectives on all of matters that she has brought up to me.

I have been with my husband for 11 years, and have 2 kids. My husband has a dad and step-mom, and a much younger brother, who has a wife and baby. We have always invited the dad to everything, and he comes to birthdays and Christmas, a few big things, but that’s it. Bare minimum. He was always too busy.

 A couple of years ago my husbands brother got married and they now have a 1 year old.  From the beginning the new wife excluded my husband and children from their wedding, we didn’t even get told to come early for the family photos. We found out by accident from the Dad the day of that they were doing them.  Her sister was included in the photos, but not him, the grooms only brother. My FIL didn’t see why that would upset my husband. 

A year ago we all are at a family trip and we have to share a condo with BIL. (We did not do the living arrangements, mother in law planned this trip) He gets drunk, tells us how his wife hates us, doesn’t like our kids, she hates coming to anything we are at and he hates having to listen to it. he apologized for her behavior- but let’s be honest, he’s ok with it so it is what it is. Once again FIL doesn’t see at all that we would be offended by this. 

Now that their baby is here,my MIL watches this child everyday. they even go on trips with them and her parents and sisters family and seem like a perfect family. And that’s great for them, I truly wish I had that. I have always tried to include my in-laws, but they were always too busy. I think the most painful thing for me is that 2 years ago my stepdad of 20 years passed away. My in-laws had met him many times, but couldn’t spare an hour in the same city they work in to come to the funeral. But now they can take trips with the new DIL family.  In March they took a trip all together over the same weekend as our oldest child’s birthday, and then called her on the wrong day to say happy bday. She’s old enough to notice and was pretty upset. It was also because they were all together on speaker talking to her while shopping at Dollywood. So it was like a slap in the face, like “happy birthday kid, look at the fun we’re having without you!”They have never tried to include my parents in anything, and doesn’t even ask how they are. and now, they have started inviting DILs family to Christmas and thanksgiving. We feel forgotten, and while they’ve all been on multiple trips just this fall, we haven’t even heard from any of them or seen them since August. So for the fist time in over a decade, I said something. I let MIL know how we feel and that if we continue to be treated as afterthoughts then we will not be coming to Christmas or anything else. Now I am the families outcast. AITA for stirring this all up right before Christmas?

It all felt very underhanded especially as we'd had a few issues previously. 
So, last night, I was telling my partner about it, he wasn't really saying anything, so I changed the subject by saying ""lets not talk about it, it won't help"". 
We chat for a bit but I wasn't in the best frame of mind so after a while he tells me that I'm bringing the mood down and I'm making him feel like he's done something wrong. I had to say  x3 times that I'm just upset and it's not him, that the reason I wanted to change the subject is because talking wouldn't help.
He then proceeds to tell me that's not how it comes across and I have the same issues all the time including the last few jobs I've been at and there's always someone I seem to have an issue with.
I then told him that's not true, the only issues I had in my last role is that my career wouldn't be progress beyond where I was at and the one before the company went under (I loved that place).

All names are completely fake for the sake of the story. This is also confusing so apologies. Back during prom season, my friend, who we’ll call A posted on her instagram story joking that someone needed to ask her guy friend to prom so he stopped complaining. I knew the guy as we were friends in middle school, so I decided I was going to ask him to go as a friend. Lets call this dude Sam. So, Sam and this other kid, Jason were best friends. I never knew it, but Jason liked me and wanted to ask me to prom. Sam said yes, and we went together. Jason was upset when he found out. Sam and I went on a movie date later, and he didn’t tell Jason until we came back. Jason and Sam got into a huge fight and their friendship broke up. I hung out with Sam a bit more but eventually decided I didn’t want to pursue a relationship for multiple reasons but we stayed friends. Now, months later it’s finally coming out that my whole friendgroup is blaming me for their friendship ending (they have since reconnected).

When we sold our previous house, we came away with a significant profit (about $65-70k) that we decided to keep instead of putting into the new house - this was pretty much all profit, not equity that he paid into the house. All of this went into my husbands account, which already had a healthy savings. He gave me maybe $4k. At the time, I didn’t ask for more because I (wrongly) assumed that I would have some access in emergencies and would also get a say in how this money was spent. 
In the first 6 months, he paid off his truck ($18k), then upgraded his truck, TWICE ($25k total). Since then, he hasn’t made any big purchases and instead has just saved as much as possible, building his account to over $30k. 
He admits he is a cheapskate, and I acknowledge his ability to save is helpful, like when we moved to this area from out-of-state, he used his savings at the time. He grew up poor and has admitted that it terrifies him to go back to living like that. We have 3 kids (16M - mine, and 7M and 5mM - ours), and I just came off maternity leave in September. From that time, I had 2 months that my pay was cut in half, but I still paid all “my” bills. I had a break down at one point and admitted that I was in trouble financially from years of taking out high interest loans in emergencies because he is not easy to ask for money - he gets angry and accuses me of using him for an atm, or I have to promise to pay him back at my next pay check - so I avoid asking him for money at all costs. His solution was to co-sign a loan through his bank that I will pay. We make approximately the same monthly, and try to keep things even as much as possible, but typically by the end of the month, my account is negative. Lately, he has had to pay a bit more of the groceries, but I still cover as much as I possibly can. 

Now you have the background (from my perspective), so this is where I’m wondering if I’m the AH. 

Whenever  we talk about making a bigger purchase (vacation deposit, upgrading appliances, Christmas presents, etc), he makes comments about how he can’t afford it and will have to wait or we just do without. I get upset when he says things like this because I live paycheck to paycheck, but I don’t think he does because he has a huge savings to fall back on, so he CAN afford things. I haven’t been able to get my car serviced or visit the eye doctor due to not being able to afford it.

We share a room and a kitchenette/sink area, the bathrooms and full kitchens are in the hallways. She works from home and most of her classes are online as well. I on the other hand only have on-campus classes, so I leave everyday around 8.50.
Now, about a month ago she asked me if we could set 11.30PM as the time when we switch all the lights off and are quiet (note- by 'lights' I mean a single night lamp, since she's sensitive to bright light). I agreed, it seemed like a reasonable compromise, since I would normally go to sleep around midnight anyway.
Since I have classes on campus, I normally get up at 7-7.30, cause I need a little time to mentally prepare for the day, eat breakfast, etc.
But like two weeks ago, she told me that she really can't sleep because of how loud I apparently am in the mornings and asked me to try and keep it down till ~at least~ 8. Now, I can try. And I did. I saved all the actually loud things for later( turning on the kettle for coffee, running water), but I do need to get ready and can't just wait until it's an acceptable hour for her.
Yesterday she fully snapped at me, like how she can't understand why I am being so inconsiderate, that I don't respect her sleep and that it's really not healthy to sleep less than 8hrs anyway. I tried to tell her that I sleep just fine thank you, I need to get ready and I have been accommodating her needs but I don't think she really got what I wanted to say.

To me, this is more than old enough to keep track of his own things. But since the start of the school year in August, he has forgotten his homework twice and his WHOLE BACKPACK once.

I did take that back up there when he called because he kind of would’ve been screwed without it, but I told him not to do it again, and I didn’t take his homework up there either time which has really upset him.

This is rudimentary cause and effect to me. He’s a perfectionist who doesn’t like to get bad grades, so it should be important to him to make sure he has his homework. To be blunt, it’s really not my responsibility to take time out of MY day to run it up there. It’s on him. 

Well, since I’m a stay-at-home mom my husband does think it’s my responsibility. I told him I’m staying at home for our youngest (1.5), not to run errands for our son.

It's just…common sense for anyone over the age of 5 or so, I would think.

T and I used to be absolute best friends. We would hang out all the time, FaceTime, talk to each other as much as we could, jokingly flirt etc. just like normal friends do.

On Tuesday a couple weeks ago she wouldn’t talk. T didn’t say a word to anyone in our friend group. At the end of the day she slowly started to talk to one of our friend again. I thought a lot about it and hoped she was okay. The next day (Wednesday) she was okay and talked and chatted with everyone except me. She wouldn’t talk to me, answer me, not even look at me. But I was the only one who noticed that (that sounded dramatic, sorry). I tried to talk to her like usual but T didn’t respond and it hurt a lot. 

I thought it would end soon because this has happened before and she started to talk to me again after some days. But it didn’t, and she would continue to ignore me and not look at me. So it was like that until Friday. 

I was going to tell my teacher I felt sick and wanted to go home because I couldn’t stand being at school anymore. It hurt so bad. 

she asked me if I was okay, and I was going to answer “yes” but I broke down crying and told her everything. I asked if I could call my mom and ask her to come and take me home, and I was allowed. 

I called my mom and she said I should talk to T and the head teacher to sort this out. So I did, while crying like a baby because I was so upset. 

I got to talk to her and my teacher and asked her why she has been ignoring me. She said it was because I make unnecessary comments sometimes (FYI: I never say rude comments to my friends or anyone and some of our mutual friends says a lot more rude comments than me. But she didn’t ignore them).

So I asked her what kind of comments so I can stop saying them, but she didn’t answer me. 

We apologized to each other, but things are not the same anymore.

I was scared of going to school. I started to cry all the time, because I felt so left out and ignored. I only had one friend and she’s 1 year older than me and we aren’t in the same year. 

But she helped me so much and I love her. Things are better now and I hang out with someone else, but I’m still scared and anxious. 

My mom wants me to try to talk to T, but I refuse. 
T ignoring me has happened multiple times before and I’m tired. I don’t want to forgive her and become her “bestie” anymore. I’m still going to give her a Christmas gift though (:

He was having a baby with his girlfriend/now wife (50). 

My mom was a stay at home mom and didn't finish college.  She had gotten pregnant with my older brother (42). My father was an ass and made the divorce as shitty as possible for my mom.  

We ended up moving in with my paternal grandparents.  He was their only child and they were disappointed in him. They helped my mom go back to school. Once she finished school she wanted to pay them back but they wouldn't let her.  They also basically disowned my father. He was invited over for Thanksgiving and Christmas but that was about it.  They did love their other grandchildren though. They always provided gifts and contributed to their education.  

My grandmother passed away a few years ago from breast cancer. And my grandfather passed away last year from complications related to COVID. And he left everything to my brother and I.  It wasn't a huge estate. And it's not life-changing money.  Both my brother and I are well established in our careers.  They left my father $500.  The lawyer explained that it was a way of avoiding him being able to challenge the will.  They also left each of my half siblings $10,000.  My brother and I each got over $100,000.  My grandfather said that since my brother and I had grown up without a father, by his choice, but his other children had then he felt this was fair.  

He also left my mom his house and some money. She had been taking care of them for a long time and they never stopped thinking of her as a daughter. 

My father approached my brother and I recently saying that his other kids are struggling with finance and that we should split everything with them since we really don't need the money. He also tried to get my mom to renounce her inheritance. She laughed in his face and asked for all the child support he owed. 

I get that it's not my half siblings' fault but they had a dad to take care of them growing up and we didn't. So neither my brother or I agreed to share. 

Now my father, his wife, and all my half siblings are calling us assholes for being so greedy and not helping them through the hard time they are going through.

I 28M, and my wife 25F have had an overall good marriage. We have been married for 5 years and together for 7. 

Last weekend, my brother 30M and his girlfriend 29F were having their baby shower/gender reveal. They’ve been together for 6 years. My wife was surprisingly hesitant to go. I waved this off as she had recently suffered a miscarriage (although we have 2 healthy kids) and I thought she was just upset about all the baby related stuff.

Eventually, after speaking to her she agreed to go.

We drove half an hour to attend and everything seemed to be going well.

At some point, I noticed my wife was on her phone a lot and so was my brother and stealing glances at each other. I thought they were maybe planning a surprise for my brothers girlfriend so I asked my wife what she was doing. She was surprisingly dismissive (she has never been secretive about her phone or her passwords) so I just left it.

About 10 minutes later, my wife tells me she’s going inside to go to the bathroom and my brother tells his wife he’s going to get more drinks for the guests. I start speaking to my cousin and note my wife’s strange behaviour.

After a while. I started to get worried so I went to check on her. I look in the bathroom first and find it’s empty. I then look in the kitchen but they’re both nowhere to be seen. I searched the whole house and when I got to my brother’s bedroom the door was locked but I heard my wife’s voice so out of anger, I broke down the door (for reference I am 6’2 and go to the gym 5 times a week) there, I find my overweight brother on top of my beautiful wife. I thought he was trying to suffocate her (he’s 5’3 and 20 stone) and I pulled him off of her. I then realised that they were both naked and about to have s*x. I let my anger get the best of me and it got physical. After, I stormed out the room.

I walked out to the baby shower and announced to everyone what they were doing. His girlfriend started sobbing and I heard my wife and brother coming outside and I started shouting at them both while everyone was watching. Here is where I might be the ah, while I was shouting at them, I pointed out how my brother can’t even afford a baby because he’s too obese to work a proper job and his girlfriend deserves better. My wife was also sobbing and apologising and out of anger I called her a b*tch and a wh*re. I went into my car and started thinking about my next steps. My wife came back in an uber and we aren’t on speaking terms as I’m upset with her for cheating and she’s upset with me for calling her a b*tch. She’s currently sleeping in the guest bedroom.

So ermm something crazy just happened to me. This woman 
(24F) and I (29M ) have been having a carnal relationship recently. I witerawwy got into a situation that you could NOT believe, honestly sometimes my life is stranger than fiction.

 Sometimes I feel like John Wick, except instead of crushing bad guys, I am crushing poonani. Soooo… earlier this year, I was dumped by my GF and nowadays? Well I guess you could say I have been a proverbial ‘chick magnet’ ever since. So where to begin… I was invited to a party and well… to cut a long story short, this sweet babe invited me to hang out with her. The one catch… she had a boyfriend… are you friggin kidding me. I have an understanding that THEY have an understanding. So errrm one thing led to another, I invited this babe over. Or should I say, she invited herself over LOL. She immediately laid out some ground rules: we could never reconnoitre at her home, because that’s where her boyfriend lives (cringe). I ALSO have to use protection so that her boyfriend doesn’t catch anything, (LOL animals don’t need protection) and also..? I’m not allowed to let anybody we know find out (no PDA I guess). 

Don’t freak out reddit, but I broke a few of those already. When I broke those rules I felt this primal rage (like super Saiyan if you will). I feel it is my duty to eff this man’s GF. This weekend, we’re going to a christmas party where her boyfriend is gonna be there. (Btw my ex and her new bf is gonna be there lol)  In a way, I feel like Jim from the office. The boyfriend of the girl I’ve been courting/f**ing is going to be there. Btw he also works as a support worker for disabled people. 

TLDR: I am effing a support worker’s GF. AITA

He tried to talk to me about his own confusion about his beliefs and I basically said that we aren't married anymore (his choice) so I don't care. Talk to your wife.

That went nowhere. So finally I called her and told her to watch her mouth around my kid (I said it nicely in the beginning, but she didn't understand). She said she had a religious obligation to share her beliefs with others, and asking her not to was like asking me to eat pork. I was very offended by the comparison. I told her to back off from my kid, or she would be the reason her husband loses a relationship with his child.

She started crying, so I had to hang up. My ex called furious. I guess she called his mom asking for comfort. He told her about how his mom and I never got along and apparently thought his mom would side with her. His mom freaked out and called him to yell about him exposing our son to paganism (I know Christians aren't really pagans, but that's what she said).

I live with my cousin and a few months ago he and his fiance broke up.

A couple of months ago he decided to get a dog but I don't think he understood the massive responsibility he is taking on by doing this. I never wanted a dog because right now I don't have time for one and to be honest neither does my cousin. 

Don't get me wrong. I love dogs and want one for my self someday but with my apprenticeship, college and everything else I have going on I know I won't have the time to look after one. However I feel that my cousin is expecting of me to look after the dog. I love her, but I'm starting to feel like it is seriously getting in the way of my life. I always feel like I have to factor looking after the dog in my weekly schedule including when I spend time with my boyfriend. Its too much. I've made it clear to my cousin that I will look after the dog when I can, not when he wants but I feel like what I'm saying just gets brushed over and I'm always the first person he asks when the dog needs looking after.

I love the dog sm, but I don't have the time to always factor her in my schedule and it's causing me to stress out so much, it affects when I can go away with my bf, when I can spend time with him etc, I never wanted a dog as I knew with our work schedule it wouldn't be fair on her. 

My cousin has booked holidays to go away and kind of assumes I can just look after her as he asks me straight away and I can't deal with it anymore. I have explained how I feel about it and I don't feel that he is taking me seriously. 

Imo I think my cousin got her so he wouldn't be lonely after his break up and because he is dealing with the aftermath of it, I don't think he was thinking straight when he got her and I don't think he thought about the responsibilities you have to accommodate to when getting a dog.

What if I decide I want to move out? Then what will he do?

I also have a few health conditions, so what if I get sick when my cousin is away?

Then what will he do?

I don't think it's fair on the dog and it makes me feel so much guilt.

Its a smaller place so as GM, I do everything except basically signing paychecks. Been this way for a while, I enjoy what I do so mostly no complaints. 

Im now working under my 3rd owner. The kicker is, its now owned by a set of siblings, whos dad bought them the place. Couple of early 20y/o who are still actively in college. Weve been short staffed for awhile now, so with me being the GM, Ive been trying to pick up the slack. Extra hours, solo shifts, and moving my personal life around to keep the place open.

I told my ""bosses"" almost 3 weeks in advance that I needed one(1) day off, a day I usually work a 12hr shift solo. I need one of them to work that day, or to find someone to help in their family. I got no response until I reached out again week of asking what the plan was. I had needed the whole day off, but offered to help with the lunch rush if their was someone to relieve me. 

There was no one to help me, he said work lunch and close at 2pm. A lot of work to do solo for only ~3 hours of business. Which I was sorta willing to do.

Proceed with that same morning of us talking, the owner doesnt show up to open. A ""mistake"" on the schedule, so I open late, and work by myself. 

2 days later, another staff member - a friend of the owners - had been out of town for 2 weeks, and I was expecting him back. Didnt show up, wasnt going to be back until the following day. Either gave me wrong dates, or didnt tell me of a change of plans. So I worked another lunch solo, while trying to train a brand new employee. 

The next day was the day I had requested off. The day I offered to help with lunch, even though I needed the whole day. Following these 2 fiascos within the last two days - 1 due to the owner, 1 due to his friend - I made the choice to not open the next day. I was exhausted, and certainly wasnt feeling like going out of my way yet again, on a day I needed off. I told the owners the night before. 

Fast forward to 6pm the next day, my forced day off, I get a huge text from one of the owners. Saying that what I did was unprofessional, and there will be some sort of repercussion for not opening. I respond with quite an angry yet professional response. Telling him A. I requested this day off 3 weeks ago. B. Im already doing my best to keep the restaurant afloat. And C. Both him and his friend left me hanging that same week. I said his message to me was unwarranted, and unprofessional. 

He responds with about 3 paragraphs defending his stance. I didnt respond. I was with my mom and wanted to enjoy that time. However, with my level of burnout and bending over backwards to keep this place in business, Im not even open to the owners trying to reprimand me for 1 day, especially after me being f-ed over that same week. I tried to find backup through the owners and their family.

I (23M) live with my parents and my 2 siblings (19M and 26F). Growing up me and my brother were extremely close, we had similar interests, friends and would do pretty much everything together. Things started to change slowly once I entered High School as I ended up doing pretty well with grades and my parents started expecting me to do good. My brother wasn’t that good academically and my parents would usually nag him and I felt like he needed his own space. Therefore I would take most of my revision stuff to my parents room or my living room so that he could have his own space.

A part of me however started feeling stressed and I rly wanted my own space to calm down. In context we live in a 3 bedroom, my sisters share and me and my brother share. The difference here is that my sisters kinda have a system where when my younger sister is in school, my older sister has the room to herself, and when she comes back from school my older sister would come downstairs or is usually out. With me and my brother I am mostly always downstairs, for my exams, after work and during afternoons whilst my brother is mostly in ‘our’ room on his PC playing games.

Now initially I brushed most of this off however there have been instances throughout this year which led to some major outbursts. For example couple years ago I had to go work at like 8am so I’d tell him to turn his pc off and it would be like 3-4 am and he’d still be playing. It took screaming matches and me reminding him constantly that the TV downstairs was free for him to listen and let me sleep in peace. Another instance was last year when I came back from work sweaty and wanted the fan and lie down in my parents room and he said no so we had a tug of war and screaming match. There have been other minor ones for example us fighting over the window as it’s on his side and he likes to sleep with the window open even though we live on a busy road so you can hear cars all night.

Now a couple of months ago whilst I was sleeping he barged in and opened the light which made me get up immediately and led to a mini argument. Around 2 days ago I finished work and went upstairs to change my bedsheets and it was like 6pm, he was still sleeping so I tried to do them quietly. Anyways he ended up waking up and when he went to the toilet, I turned the lights on and grabbed my clothes. He came in turned the lights off and went back to bed. I turned them on again because I couldn’t find my vest but also as a mini payback for when he turned it on and he threw his water bottle at me. This led to another argument which led to him throwing his shoe at me. Idk at this point I lost it and pushed his monitor because it was the closest thing to me. I feel like it was pent up anger over time. I have this extreme guilt feeling when I was in the toilet though and instantly regretted it.

My brother who lives at home, has a 3k salary and it was all hush hush until a few days ago. He’s never had a job a day in his life and only applies to the top companies because he thinks everything else is beneath him. 

My family is pretty obvious in their treatment between males and females. My brother was always allowed to go wherever he wanted, have his overseas trips paid for, have a high allowance every month, have his own room despite all his sisters living cramped in another room, be a complete prince to be served for by his sisters, and just be propped up on false compliments. He went to an Ivy League extension school for his graduate studies simply because my dad was willing to shovel out an insane amount of money just so my brother can say he has an Ivy League education (he never tells anyone it’s an extension school degree and the whole family has to go along with it. He specifically instructed us not to). My dad has tried to get him to work in the family business but he cries and complains about how boring it is and how he wants to have a more flashy career. Most days he works a maximum of 5 hours. 

The kicker was a few days ago when I found out that my dads been giving him 3k/month salary (after taxes) for doing nothing. My sister who also works in the family business makes half that amount and actually works like an employee. Yet she doesn’t get a business card, business trips, or a high salary for doing nothing. My other sister who is looking for a job doesn’t get an allowance. If she asks for some money she’s told to go get a job or that she doesn’t deserve any money. She gets 20 bucks here.

My brother isn’t an awful person except the times that he is. Lol. There’s this entitlement to him that I never understood; but as I grow older, I can kind of piece together where it originated from. 

My dad complains to me about his business suffering in this economy, my mom complains to wanting a job so she doesn’t have to rely on my dads money, yet they’re both in agreement that my brother deserves this 3k/month allowance.

My wife (29f) and I (29m) bought a house that we are absolutely in love with. We moved in late October. For security I installed a Ring Floodlight camera in the front and in the rear watching our backyard as we live in a city and I want to make sure our home is protected and secure but also for the lighting. 

The camera automatically records when motion is detected in the backyard. About 50 times a night it notifies me that there is motion and it is almost always rats coming from my neighbors backyard through a hole they made in our shared fence to the other fence in my yard which leads to an alley. 

The neighboring property is a rental townhome that has about 5 tenants in a family home style setting. We ran into a tenant yesterday and mentioned that we have been seeing some rats come from their yard into ours and if they know anything about it. 

Apparently the tenants have been complaining about it for a year or so now as there is a rat nest in the backyard that the owner hasn’t taken care of despite numerous quotes from the tenants for exterminators and such. 

After speaking with the tenant and sharing contact information. She informs me that the owner plans to demolish their back porch but doesn’t make any mention about the nest/how to remove it/etc. 

All of the tenants and both my wife/I want the nest gone for safety and health reasons. 

WIBTA if I called the city for a surprise, anonymous inspection for the rat nest (which I’m allowed to do)? 

I don’t want to start a rocky situation with the neighbor but if I am getting this many motion notifications (I can also see them running through my yard on the footage), I don’t believe it to be safe/healthy and can only get worse.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4846522,public,top,self,WIBTA Rat Nest in Neighbors backyard,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaloal/wibta_rat_nest_in_neighbors_backyard/,all_ads,6,,,

He has a sister in a different city that he's not really close with. Before this year we invited her over to our city and gave her a little tour. She left without saying thank you, which rubbed me the wrong way but oh well. 

In the past 6 months I needed to travel to a different city for a program I was enrolled in. My bfs sister lives with her partner really close to the university so I asked her if I could stay at theirs as they have a spare bedroom. I would stay there once every month for a couple of days. They asked me if I could give them money daily for expenses while I stayed there. I also bought food and cooked for them. Every time I arrived they also refused to pick me up from the airport as it was too expensive for them to drive, so I had to pay for an uber to get to theirs. I found this a little unfair and it got quite expensive for me. 

Recently both my boyfriend and I flew there together to stay for 2 days, so that he could see his sister and the rest of his family. This is because he will be spending Christmas with my family overseas. 

On our first day there, his sister and her bf decided to spend the evening with other friends. So we basically got expensive plane tickets and we are paying them to stay at their place but we aren't even spending the first evening together. This upset me. 

The thing is, they don't struggle with money. My boyfriend sends his sister money every month. Her bf is a property manager but he's quite stingy to the point where he doesn't even help out his girlfriend if she needs money for groceries. He's the one that wanted me to pay to stay there and he also refused to spend money on petrol to pick me up. 

Recently they asked if they could stay at my place during their road trip in the holidays while I'm gone, in return for 'looking after our cat'. We already had a friend to look after the place and he would have to leave and return for the week that they are staying there. They also wanted to bring friends along. I agreed because she is basically family and I won't be there anyway, but after a while I felt a little resentful. 

I feel like I want to ask them to pay me when they use my flat.
