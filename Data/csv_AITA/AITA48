I am an Indian (19) college student and earlier today, I had to leave class in a hurry due to an emergency. I didn't pay much attention to where I was going as I was panicked and only realized minutes later that I'd run by a small group of students in the corridor singing the national anthem. I am aware it is custom to stand for the anthem, and I usually do. It was an accident and no disrespect was intended. 

I was immediately called back and verbally harassed by the teachers in charge of the class, i.e. , this is not your country, you don't belong here, etc, in public. 

I was exhausted at this point, and politely apologized and walked away. It lead to me feeling unsafe and guilty for the rest of the day.

For privacy reasons, I won’t go in depth about it, but it involves public speaking. 

I have a stutter. I don’t really care as much about it as I did two years ago, and it’s not a major insecurity for me. It’s pretty noticeable, but who cares? It’s how I talk and how I’ve always talked. 

The unofficial “head” of the club, “Megan”(17F) is not a nice person. She’s bullied me on and off for ten years, and her parents work for our school district, so she’s largely been allowed to get away with what she does. My stutter has played a huge role  in Megan’s bullying. 

This Christmas, Megan decided it would be a good idea to do a white elephant book exchange. I loved the idea, but Megan’s made the joy in it impossible. She only told certain people about it(I only found out because I’m close with “Emily”, a girl who Megan told right away), and has banned a specific author’s books. Megan has also required everyone to bring food, when she herself is bringing nothing. What began as a cute idea has caused a lot of hurt and stress for a lot of people. 

I had the idea of buying “Black Swan Green” for the exchange. The book is about a boy who stutters with the dream of being a writer. It’s one of my favorites, and it fits all of the “Megan criteria”. It would be a great learning opportunity. 

It is also the pettiest pick possible for this group. Emily and my other friend “Amanda”(17F) love the idea and think it’s hilarious. My mom said I would be kind of an AH if I brought it, because if Megan or her friends opened it, it would make for a really uncomfortable situation and ruin the fun.

When the kids made their anger about that known they ended up in 4 years of family therapy where my sister and her husband had the goal of changing their feelings and outlook on the situation.

I spoke to my sister and so did a number of family members who felt it was badly handled. But she dismissed us all. So her kids started confiding in me and I did not tell her about it. I know they feel let down by her and they dislike her husband and his kids. I also know they fight with his kids more than my sister and her husband realize.

Let me just preface this by saying that my friend is wonderful, and I've met her partner before - he seems like a genuinely nice guy, so this isn't about him at all and also why I feel like an AH

I've had a quite difficult time of it lately. In addition to a very close relative being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I also recently got closure on a very complicated situationship which lasted a very very long time. My birthday is next week and I am dreading entering my mind thirties and very much feel overwhelmed at the thought of getting older, being surrounded by friends who are mostly coupled up, worry about ever finding someone, feeling alone, unwell family, etc etc

I also have chronic depression and anxiety and one of the key way it shows for me is insomnia. So perhaps unsurprisingly, I have been falling asleep at 5/6 am (today at 9 am actually) for a couple of hours (I wfh) for the past 3 weeks. I am a wreck.

So when BFF wanted to take me out for my birthday, I was very much looking forward to a very relaxed girl night in where I could relax and perhaps, hopefully do so enough to sleep. Her partner is lovely, but I would need to focus and be more 'hyped up' if he was there as I don't know him very well - and I just honestly need a bit of girl time with no romance.

So just for context, this guy who I haven't talked to since we graduated college in 2019 recently texted me and asked me if I could refer him to a position in the company I work for. I didn't say anything, I just told him to maybe apply directly to a HR first. He then insisted I refer him. I honestly don't want to, I think he was a bully I am not sure, him and two other guys used to always berate me. He was my dorm mate too during the first few semesters in college. I wasn't that good at studies and tests hence bad grades and they used to make fun of me for that, they used to fun of my clothes and how I didn't exactly used to go out and date and everything. Initially I didn't really care but eventually it did affect me and my grades suffered more. It got even worse afterwards till I moved out. I am not blaming them or anything, my friends back then told me they are just teasing me and I am just acting like a victim.

We went to a pretty fancy restaurant and started ordering.

We were all at the table and decided to order a couple of appetisers to share and order our own main. We had 1 girl (who im gonna call tiff) who drove to the restaurant so she didn't drink. All she ordered was a soft drink and a steak

The rest of us went pretty crazy, We ordered shots which everyone offered to drink except for tiff since she was driving. However, another girl (who I'm gonna call steph) came with her boyfriend and was quite conservative on ordering, but ate the food we ordered to share as well as the drinks that we ordered and the shots that we ordered.

My background is asian so I'm always happy to shout a couple items or even pay a little extra and so forth, my house mates are all Australian.

Come to pay the bill we kinda all agree to just split evenly except let tiff only transfer the stuff she ordered.

The bill was $945 for 6 people. We in live in Australia so we're not obligated to tip, but I also gave a $50 tip which idm.

So $945 bill, it should be $157.5 each.
But I told tiff to transfer me $50 since she barely had anything (which was exactly the amount she ordered). Now there's $895 left on the bill. Which mean everyone transfers me $179. But I just tell everyone to transfer me $175 so it's easier and makes me look less stingyer to transfer me to the exact dollar. At this point I'm already paying $20 extra plus the $50 tip I just gave which i still do not mind. I pay for the bill And in the group chat I say everyone just transfer me $175 and tiff to just transfer me $50

Everyone transfers me the right amount, but a day later steph and her bf transfer me a total of $240. With everyone transferring me $175 and tiff paying $50 and steph and her bf giving me $240. She only transfered me what her and her bf ordered plus their drinks, but didn't not include half the food we all shared. That makes me pay $130 extra (not including tip)

This weekend, he forgot to pack pyjamas (we bring clothes from mums house whenever we're here, and somehow he didn't remember pyjamas) so last night, he slept in a shirt and his underwear which I was unaware of. Tonight I found out he was doing that and I yelled at him and told him he can't do that and he has to wear pants. After about 15 minutes of us yelling at each other, and my dad trying to explain it was fine, I pointed out how it made me uncomfortable because he's 10 and shouldn't sleep half naked in a room with me. My dad agreed it was a fair point, and he should wear pants but my brother continued to refuse for a while. He then reluctantly agreed and went to bed and I told Dad he had to go check my brother was in pants. He wasn't. I told my brother if he didn't want to wear pants he could sleep on the couch or outside.

By the way, he said it was too hot for pants. It's meant to be like 14⁰ Celsius tonight and by pants, I mean loose shorts that are made from thin material from target, not like long pants.

So please be gentle on my grammar. 

I (25F) just got married two weeks ago to the love of my life, Felix (25M). And it was the happiest day of my life, aside from this little thing:

So I don’t drink alcohol at all. I don’t like it and more importantly I don’t like how most (not all but most) people act after consuming a little to much, it makes me uncomfortable. 
My husband drinks occasionally a beer or a wine, but like on drink in half a year at best.

We have people in the family who like to drink to much and they get really weird and that makes me as uncomfortable as stated above. Also they get impolite and disrespectful when drunk. And they are not good at managing their alcohol intake. 
This and the fact we don’t really drink alcohol and that alcohol is hella expensive we decided together to have a dry wedding. 

We served a lot of different beverages (cocktails, fruitpunsches, juices, alcohol free sect and alcohol free wine), so everybody could have something they liked. 

We had delicious food and an amazing time until my one grandfather realised that it was alcohol free. He trough a hissy fit. 

After he shut up, we still had an amazing time. But after we came back from our honeymoon, which was yesterday, we read some messages that we got during honeymoon. Most of them from my grandfather, but a few from three friends complaining about the lack of alcohol and that they would not have come if they knew there wouldn’t be alcohol. 

For clarification:
1. There was no cash bar. 
2. Everybody else wrote us that they loved the wedding. And at the wedding everyone (except my grandfather) seemed to have a good time. I went from 15o‘clock to 1o‘clock, where it ended after a midnight snack. And then 10 of our closest friends and family drove us to the airport so we could fly to our honeymoon. And everybody seemed happy.

Well, I wanted there to be a couples' dance at our wedding because my aunt &amp; uncle had one at theirs &amp; I really liked the idea of everyone getting to dance with their DH/DW/bf/gf because a wedding is meant to be a celebration of love.

Unfortunately, my MIL did not like that &amp; made a scene at our wedding, calling out to her dead husband &amp; accusing me of purposely singling her out of the wedding dance(even though she had just had a dance with my DH, you know... the son/mother dance).

He got fired by not going into work, we live in New York City and shit is expensive, and he has no problem with it.

I feel that it’s not my problem because he’s the one who is choosing not to work. His best friend is moving in after me and is taking the rest of my part of the lease.

G is the only person in my country to have this disease as the last 2 people (brothers) who had it died at 18 and 20. 
Now on to Emily (17f) who I’ve confided in her about my sisters condition as I’ve had to explain why I used to stay at the hospital a lot and why my sister is small for her age. I told her, along with other friends about G and how she can be fragile, Emily’s first question wasn’t “Is she okay?” or any other caring question, but she asked “when is she going to die?”  Now this is heartbreaking especially since I try not to think about my sister dying. I brushed it off and avoided her question. 
Now two years later COVID happened. G is more at risk at getting COVID but we were even scared that she might die if she got it. I told my friends this as I had to stay home more than once if an outbreak was even hinted.

When I ask her why she did make those jokes she replies with “jokes are jokes and not meant t be taken seriously” and “life is to short to live seriously”.

We’ve only got one more year of high school left so I could put up with Emily for another year so there is no drama.

So let me tell you some background story, I (18 female) have a friend (18 female) me and her has been friends on and off for over a decade, she has undiagnosed adhd, and is just very hard.

So my friend has just gotten a puppy (1,5 months ago) and I’ve already been “babysitting” her dog 2 times, but my friend has also got her babysit more times by family ect
she asked me if I could stay over at her place and sleep there so I could babysit the dog 2 times in 3 days, I said sure bc I’m not doing anything atm (I was hospitalized so I can’t work atm) and have a lot of time. I stay over for like 3 days? Where we had an agreement over that I babysit her dog for half a day and she would pay dinner (she was going to Sweden whit her fiancé and another couple and the bill was less than 100$) she also bought groceries so we could eat (I payed for the things only I wanted to eat). But now she is asking for money bc she doesn’t thinks it’s fair that I’m living and eating/drinking at her house for free, while I babysit her dog. I have been sleeping on a couch and bearly eating anything (a piece of bred and dinner for 3 days) 
I said to her that I could pay half for the eating out, but I don’t think it’s okay to want money from people who is gonna do something for you. I have payed for my food the first night but not the second and third.
She is now complaining that I should pay, and you cannot expect that if you invite people over that they are gonna not be paying for food/drink. I told her that I was paying for my ex when he was here except his high soda and candy expenses for 6 months. But she doesn’t rlly listen to me.

I said to her that if you invite people over to stay is a thing you do, i have done that and I asked her when she was staying if she wanted something to eat, but she didn’t like what I got so she ordered some, I said you pay for that yourself bc if you don’t like what I have that’s not my fault.

Now she is mad that I don’t want to pay and I have said to her I want to but I can’t in this month bc I don’t have a lot of money.
I also said to her that I don’t want to discuss whit her bc she is not getting her money back like that, but she won’t listen to me. 

Her sister/ my sister in law asked If she could take the dog so I have stayed over at her place just for her sister to take it. And I got a little pissed of bc I was tired mentally and had a breakdown. But I still think that it’s fair that I don’t pay. I have also walked her dog so many times alone just so she could do her makeup.

He always gets upset with me when I don’t tell him my phone password, or don’t let him hold my phone when he’s interacting with it while I’m there. 4 years we’ve been together, and this is an argument that comes up constantly, despite me telling him at least a hundred times at this point that I’m not hiding anything, it’s just a very personal thing to me, and is one thing that I can control where only I can see the information on it. Today, the argument came up again, and he lost it at me, telling me that it’s wrong of me for wanting to hide whatever’s on my phone, and even off handedly accused me of sexting being the reason I don’t want him looking Through my phone.

He worked upwards of 50-70 hour weeks. They often shared drinks after long days, but increased to day drinking. And drinking in the morning, even when my mother had to drive my sister and I to school.
In middle and high school, it only escalated. My sister and I found ourselves eating in our rooms most nights because of the horrible fights our parents would start with us over various things. We also both got hurt on a few occasions while they were drunk, and then they didn't remember any of it the next day. In the end, they brushed off any form of conversation we tried to hold to stop them.
My sophomore year of high school, my mother went to rehab for the excessive drinking, but also the opiods she had taken for years to ease her neck pain. I still vividly remember having to hold my mom's hair back as she threw up while detoxing prior to the rehab admission.
After that, they had both quit for about a year, and we all had grown closer as a family. Until they started to hide the drinks (though my sister and I always knew) and the screaming arguments resumed, we holed up in our rooms or were constantly out of the house until they went to bed for the night.
In 2021, I moved out of the house into my first apartment and the distance separating my parents and I actually brought our relationship closer. When I found myself in solid ground, I visited them and tried to talk to them about how their alcohol use worried me, especially with my mom's experience in rehab only a few years ago. The conversation wasn't really a conversation, but moreso my dad yelling about how hard he worked to keep a roof over our head and how I was ungrateful. My mother backed hin up, mentioning that without the opioids, alcohol kept her pain in check. 
I told them that they had to stop drinking while I'm visiting or I wouldn't come visit anymore. My dad yelled at me until I was out of the house and crying in my car.
Now, our relationship is rocky. They still drink when I visit, but I'm afraid of bringing up the conversation again. I know I can't stop them altogether from their drinking habits, and I don't want to, but I can limit my interaction and focus on healing myself while I work towards a future. I just want them to be sober around me and I want a solid relationship with them.

I see a psychologist once a month just practice healthy habits. 

My boyfriend (M37) and I (F31) have been together for nearly a year and a half. Its obvious that he's never practiced emotional well being. Generally things are very good, we argue very little but it can get tiring having to explain 'I'm not attacking you' or 'My feelings are not right or wrong, they just are' when issues come up. 

This weekend we were invited to his family's place for a lunch. The day before I said I'd make dessert. When I woke that morning the kitchen was a mess. I text him to say I was gonna bake today and wish it was left clean. 

This started an argument. He was saying I leave dishes too and have no right to complain. (Generally we're very clean so it's a rare occurrence) I was explaining that it's not that big a deal but this time it was very messy and I wouldn't mind cleaning his stuff usually, but I have 5 hours of baking ahead of me. 

He started to say that it wasn't that messy and literally a quick wipe would sort the stove and cleaning out the food left in the sink would take two mins. Then I got really annoyed. I told him it's not fair to tell me if I have a right to be annoyed by something or not. He said I was making drama from nothing and I said I felt disrespected and not listened to. Eventually he said we should talk at home. I agreed and said I'd love for him to google active listening/arguing as a couple. He responded 'go fuck yourself'. 

He didn't talk to me all evening. This morning he said he was grabbing some things and when he gets back we can go. I was confused and told him I assumed he didn't want me to go. He got annoyed again and said we could discuss it in the journey. I said I didn't feel comfortable being around his family feeling like this. He left to run errands and I'm still not sure if I should go.

my 27th (f) birthday was days ago. my parents threw me a birthday dinner at an upscale restaurant.

My husband came with me but he kept excusing himself to the restroom several times. first time I had no issue, second time no issue either. but after the third time I noticed something. I started watching the time and found out that he'd excuse himself to the restroom literally every 10 minutes. While he was talking to my parents, he'd cut the conversation and go to the restroom. while were eating, even while cutting the cake. he'd just up and go. My parents noticed and seemed upset. they asked if he didn't want to sit with them but I couldn't give an answer because I didn't know.


Once we got in the car I blew up at him and told him that he embarrassed me in the restaurant and infront of my parents by going to the restroom every ten minutes. he defended himself saying I can't police his restroom usage or needs but I pointed out how he was perfectly healthy and had no issues at all. he got upset with me and shamed me for saying he embarrassed me after he attended my birthday dinner party.

On the day of my graduation/formal my VET teacher deadnamed me Infront of about 150people who I didn't know the name of.

For the sake of this story let's say my name is Michael and my deadname is Grace.

Since the start of this year I've been known as Michael, all my classmates use it and so do all my friends and teachers (luckily most of which don't know my deadname). 

I even recently (to helps of my therapist) got my siblings and parents to start calling me Michael as well.


So since the start of the year my VET teacher has known me as Michael, she knows my deadname is Grace because it is on my legal documents. She still misgenders me (she/her and referes to me as a girl instead of he/him and a boy). I don't think she ever ment to do it on purpose even after all my times correcting her but now I'm starting to doubt myself.


On graduation my school teachers all used Michael as my name, even with my awards with Grace on them as the name, but for some reason when it came for my VET certificate my teacher without thinking called me Grace in front of everyone.


Now that would've sucked by itself, but she continued to be like 'oh whoops my bad grace- I mean Michael, sorry your name just slipped my mind's.

SLIPPED YOUR MIND? ITS THE NAME YOU'VE CALLED ME THE WHOLE YEAR HOW DID IT SLIP YOUR MIND??

.. anyways

After her little slip up, she had to call out the name of my friend we will call Em, Em has also has there name changed since the start of the year and I was expecting her to misgender them as well.

But no she somehow did something worse. She got up to Em's name, and started at it for A WHOLE MINUTE while everyone sat in silence, before having to whisper to another student and ask for there name. The name they had been using for the whole year.

She also misgenderd me when talking to me after the ceremony.

Now when she called me my deadname in front of everyone during the graduation, as I walked up to grab my certificate I muttered to her 'what the fuck that was such a bitch move' and she looked upset. I do feel a bit mad coz she was a really good teacher but honestly that was humiliation on my end.

Not to mention all of the people laughed when she deadnamed me and I got a lot of snarky looks from some old people. Transphobia, at it's finest.

(Ik they were laughing at my name because I had been made fun of for being trans this year and ppl thought I should still go by Grace).

All my friends thought I was right for defending myself because I rarely do, but my parents think I am in the wrong (tbf they also misgender me and deadname me a lot still coz they think it's a phase but still)

He would even visit and stay overnight at the wake and sometimes would crash in our house and sleep there too. (We would sleep at the same bed).

Now don't get me wrong I am not a person who is that conservative I also make green jokes once in a while but never including us in the narrative. Now I didn't think much about it. Until after the wake he confessed AGAIN to me that he actually likes me. He already did once but I turned him down. 

This made me feel like I was kind of taken advantage of and none of his care was actually genuine. I felt as if there was motive behind it so I talked to him a few days after that, explaining my side but It seemed like he didn't get it then I got tired of it so I finally ended it. 

My other friend would send screen shots to me that A would say ""Does she want me to give her everything?"" or ""Why won't she forgive me. Doesn't she have mercy?

So I have tried to be there for her in my best abilities and parent her, tell her right and wrong, help her in school and empower her. Id like to think that we’re pretty close.

She started uni in September, my bf(29M) and I are fully paying for her school. we gave her new laptop for school as well and keep on buying her whatever she wants and if it’s in our capability. She started seeing someone in the past few months and then we even sat her down and talked to her and told her as this guy wasn’t upto no good(we could tell). She told us she’ll be careful but ended up getting her heart broken after two months when she found out that he is seeing two other girls as well. We have been there for her since she took it harshly. Giving her advice, providing support, letting her stay in my room with us as she doesn’t wanna be alone.

My bf is about to get a big amount from his work soon, so we thought we will send my sister to weekly therapy,as she has expressed that she’d like to go but doesn’t have funds and set her a bank account and give her a good amount of money to kick start her savings. As we were never able to save money because of our financial problems.  

But my sister is very mean towards me, example; I always ask if she wants to go shopping or food with us but whenever she has to go somewhere, she never invites me but our cousin instead. My bf is from another country so we travel half the year to see his family, she says things like “well you roam around the world and live nice” anytime tell her no from anything. Never wants to spend time with me. 

Tbh I feel used, I do everything in capacity for her. I’m trying to provided her with the support I never had growing up. Hence why, i have decided that i’ll stop with the extra help such as gifts, helping with saving, helping with therapy and inviting her.

This is literally the only thing I have ever been upset about in her self expression. I don't care what kind of tattoo she gets and where, I always like them.

When I left the hospital I was in a better place . I asked him to tell his friends and family were together and were doing fine. 

He said okay that’s fine . Then he asked me for 20 Bucks . I said jokingly “ok I’ll give you 20 bucks if you post a story with me on social media” so he did . Then I gave him $100 more dollars cus I had money and kinda owed him for stuff he did for me in the past 

Then several hours later I check social media and he has deleted the story that I gave him 20 bucks for . I said I want my money back lol 

I was texting him I basically started a fight over this 

He put the story back up because on instagram you can put a story back up 

He said his friends and family reacted negatively to the story so that’s why he took it down in the first place and he was insecure 

He apologized and even posted another story of him at my apartment . I had also posted a story of him too 

NOW we’re supposed to hangout and have a pool day tomorrow and I’m kind of hyperventilating and staying up late worrying because I don’t wanna fight during our hangout tomorrow

The whole reason my boyfriend even talked to him was because is username was a reference to an IT term, and he needed some references for future work in the IT field. But this guy has been unemployed for years, and refused to take a job that payed less than 6 figs when he never made that much to begin with. So he finally got a job at a $15/hr market and said it was ""soul crushing"" (cry me a river, how awful!

I'm not going to lie, I hate this person. His misery is elating. I delight in his pain. If the Purge was real, he'd be first on my kill list. My boyfriend has known I hate him.

I don't think I'm asking for too much just to give each other a little attention for more than 30 minutes every 12 hours. But I'm kinda wondering if I went too far by saying I'd kill him if I had the chance.   


I assured him he's allowed to be friends with whomever he wants, and talk to anyone he wants to talk to. I'm not policing his relationships, I'm just saying I feel a little disrespected and I think his ""friend"" is a shitty person. And I'm frustrated. There's a deeper backstory of lies about me to try and break our relationship on his friend's part, but I don't want to get into it at this time.

My daughter, unfortunately, hates whenever I do that. And most things included in her diet just so happen to have at least one of those ingredients. I’ve tried so so hard to make food she‘d like, but she’s just too much of a picky eater.

I made rice with broccoli and beef, sided with vegan mashed potatoes &amp; a chocolate cake. All allergen free.

I know he isn’t saying this to surprise me because he never misses work, and I have his schedule and he is indeed working tomorrow. He’s been hyping up my birthday so much, that I turned down every other invitation from friends and family to celebrate together and now I will have to spend my 25th birthday, which is a huge milestone for me, and which I’ve been waiting so long to celebrate, all alone in my apartment. I never celebrate my birthdays, but I was really looking forward to this.

We moved into a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom with his brother and rent was split 3 ways, we lived like this for about a year and 4 months when his mother got abandoned by her husband and ultimately was evicted from her home, she brought 4 extra kids with her, (2 of my husband's brothers, his sister, and sisters child) I gladly accepted with the exception that the troublesome family members only be there extremely temporary, (troublesome meaning, likes to cause problems, and will go as long as possible without getting a job and also not good people.) 3 of them moved out within a month leaving his youngest brother and mom.

My husband took a job to where he will be gone for months at a time, he also decided to bring the brother who we got the apartment with along too, my husband decided to approach me and asked me how I feel about him not paying rent or his mother taking over his side of rent while he's gone, knowing she has no job.

He has an online friend from the same game who is a genuinely toxic, garbage human. The most incel-ish, toxic piece of shit I've ever had the displeasure of speaking to on a one-time basis. The whole reason my boyfriend even talked to him was because is username was a reference to an IT term, and he needed some references for future work in the IT field. But this guy has been unemployed for years, and refused to take a job that payed less than 6 figs when he never made that much to begin with. So he finally got a job at a $15/hr market and said it was ""soul crushing"" (cry me a river, how awful! You have to actually contribute to your marriage financially omg) and I said he was a drama king. I asked how his new job was going but apparently he doesn't talk about it. At all. I jokingly suggested my boyfriend ask about it cause ""maybe it'll get him upset."" I'm not going to lie, I hate this person. His misery is elating. I delight in his pain. If the Purge was real, he'd be first on my kill list. My boyfriend has known I hate him. He knows I sometimes have some jealousy when he spends all day talking to this asshole rather than spending time with me or even just speaking with me every couple hours.

I don't think I'm asking for too much just to give each other a little attention for more than 30 minutes every 12 hours. But I'm kinda wondering if I went too far by saying I'd kill him if I had the chance. I assured him he's allowed to be friends with whomever he wants, and talk to anyone he wants to talk to. I'm not policing his relationships, I'm just saying I feel a little disrespected and I think his ""friend"" is a shitty person. And I'm frustrated. There's a deeper backstory of lies about me to try and break our relationship on his friend's part, but I don't want to get into it at this time.

Next month is both of their birthdays, and so I asked my sister if there were any plans in place yet that I need to be mindful of. She tells me has decided to do a ""combo party"" since their birthdays are so close to each other. I was a little surprised and said I didn't think that was a good idea. She asked why and I said I didn't think it was fair to either of them to have to split their birthday. She said that my nephew is too little to need a full on party just for him,  and my niece ""loves her brother and will probably be happy to share the day with him.""

I told her it wasn't about loving her brother or not, it was about making sure she had her own special day. A lot has changed for her since (nephew) was born, so I didn't think it was right to essentially take away the one thing that is still just hers. My sister got upset, and started yelling at me that I didn't know how expensive it was to raise children, and so unless I was willing to open my wallet, I needed to keep my opinions to myself. I told her I would be happy to pay for the parties, if she wanted to plan something and then just let me know so I could book things and pay. I think she wasn't expecting me to actually offer to pay, because then she screamed that I didn't understand and hung up the phone.

And for as long as I’ve been there we’ve also got them something. We always exchange gifts at our party, which is typically in mid-late December. 

The person who typically organizes it is no longer with the office and last year it was a scramble. I literally put together some gifts a few weeks before but it was a struggle collecting $20 from everyone in a short period of time and I fronted the money. Everyone DID pay but had to approach some people directly. 

So this year I wanted to avoid the scramble. I sent out a group text to all my coworkers on September 12th (3 months before the party) in hopes of having everyone pitch in the $20 and wouldn’t need to worry about it. We have 15 people I’m collecting from, and more than half paid. I sent out another reminder 1 month prior to the party. 

I waited a few more weeks and after Thanksgiving I approached those people directly and they sent a Venmo on the spot. 

All but one person has paid. When I approached her directly about paying she said, “Oh, I’m not sure if I’m going to. I’ll let you know.” My first thought is WTF. So I waited a little bit over a week and sent out a text message to her directly. She texted back saying, “I wasn’t going to because of my finances. Don’t want to overwhelm you with the details, but life without any help is very hard. I don’t even know how I pay my mortgage monthly. No raise for almost two years and no Xmas bonus to count on…
I’ll get you the $20, but from now on either count me out or ask me prior please.”

She is a divorced mom with 2 kids but does have 50/50 split with the dad. I know she doesn’t make as much money as I do just given what our roles are at work. I am totally understanding and sympathetic if someone could not pay. I understand cost of living has increased and home heating has gone up. I think my hang up is the lack of communication. If she was struggling it would have been nice to let me know this back in September when I sent out the original message to the entire office rather than have me chase her down. She also had the opportunity with group message #2 in November and when I approached her directly a few weeks later. 

I sent out this response, “If you can’t afford the $20, that’s fine. The party is less than 2 weeks away and needed to know what our funds are to finalize gifts. 
Next year I plan on sending out the same text message in September. If things are the same next year just let me know if you can’t make it work.
I know things can be tight around the holidays 💕”

Finally, we end up arranging to go on bike rides in the evening, after work. It's too good, the girl is refreshing, a brilliant mind, athletic...

it happens regularly over several months, then comes the winter so impossible to bicycle in the evening.

The day before the Christmas holidays, I send her a message asking her to say goodbye before leaving work, to which she replies ""yes I will, sorry"". I know it's not really the tradition and that she's not the only one to leave quickly without saying goodbye, but this time she had gone all the way down the hall wishing happy holydays, except in office where I am.

After the holidays, we don't talk about this message but she continues to leave without saying goodbye. After I send this message: ""As you left again without saying goodbye, I couldn't ask you when we were going to go cycling again?"". She does’nt respond. I don't insist, we don't talk about it face to face after. One day I ask her face to face if she really wants us to ride again together and she tells me no, that I was too aggressive in my way of asking, without giving any further explanation. She also tells me that she won't come by to say goodbye because my office is at the back and she doesn't pass by to leave.

Later, I apologize for that and try to understand. She tells me ""we're not on the same wavelength"". We end up writing very long message to each other that come to nothing, always without talking about it face to face.

I let a little time pass, we always meet at work and I ask her if we can from time to time arrange to make the trip by bike together. She accepts, it happens once or twice but she will admit to me later that she was calculating so that we don't leave at the same time and that doesn't happen.

We still see each other in the canteen, at the café... once I leave just before her and I ask her if we can make the trip together. She tells me that it's a little weird that I'm waiting for her to ask her that but accepts for the day after tomorrow and even tells me that we can arrange to do it once a week and that it's good to de-escalate the situation and not ignoring each other.

Again, she does'nt do what she says so I ask her by message when we can redo this trip together. She replies that in fact, she no longer wants to.

The following week, I arrive in his office to ask her if we can talk about it again and there I am insulted like never before and threatens me ""to go and talk to people about it"". 

I feel betrayed because she lied to me and at the same time I blame myself for wasting a potentially good friendship.

For context, my (F25) fiancé (M27) and I are planning on getting married in 2023. In our culture it’s common for children to live with their parents after marriage and considered good luck to live with your in laws for the first year. We were planning on buying our own house but with the current interest rates we aren’t sure if that’s the best decision. He has an older brother that is married and lives at their family home. Him and his wife live in the master room in the home and my fiancé has a significantly smaller room, with a closet that barely fits his own things, and the family dog also sleeps with him. Their grandma &amp; sister also live in the same house and have their own rooms. My future mother-in-law had pitched the idea of us living in her basement if we wanted to live with her until we got our own house since the main floor bedroom space would be too tight for two people and a dog. She is a single mother and very kind, she works a high labour job to pay for the house expenses and rents out her basement. The basement’s rent covers her mortgage. Now the issue arises where the wife of my fiancés brothers essentially tells us there is no room for us to move into the house and if we move into the basement we should pay the basement rent or the mortgage ourselves. I told her this isn’t fair and we should all split the costs of running the household. I told her the basement was offered to us and we aren’t stealing “income” from my future mother in law. I was a bit surprised that her and her husband don’t pay any rent or any of the ongoing costs of the house. They’ve only been married 6 months, so she hasn’t been there very long. She said that since we were the ones that would be changing the dynamic of the house we should cover the whole cost. She also said that if anyone tried to make her pay rent she’d move out. I even offered for us to either pay a larger chunk of the mortgage than them,or to switch rooms with them if they wanted the bigger space instead. She refused to pay anything. I don’t even want to live there anymore but my fiancé and future mother in law think this is ridiculous and everyone that lives in the house should split the cost, if renting the basement wouldn’t be an option. I feel we have the exact same right to be there in that house as them. So why would we pay for it all? So aita for not agreeing to pay the entire mortgage of a house where 5 other people will be living?

They sell strawberry punnets from a shed and there is a gravel parking lot in front of it. 

I bought a punnet and we were walking back to our car when my parents spotted a random lemon tree on the edge of the parking lot. 

My mum goes a bit crazy for fruit so I took a photo of my parents next to it. 

We then noticed the floor was littered with lemons, fresh and rotting, from which we made the incorrect assumption that it was a decorative piece and the lemons could be freely picked. It was not netted (behind it was an orchard completely netted off) and there was no sign indicating otherwise. 

We picked 2 lemons from the tree and proceeded to return to our car. At this point, the owner came out of the strawberry shed and shouted at its periphery, “You can’t do that!” 

I apologised, letting her know we did not realise to which she responded, “Of course you knew, how could you not know. If you had just asked, I probably would have let you take some.”

When she said that, I realised we really should have asked. Honestly, we just hadn’t thought of it, thinking it was free for the taking. 

I apologised multiple times and offered to return the 2 lemons back to her to which she kept getting angrier, implying I was trying to steal them and told me I could drop them on the floor. 

In an attempt to assure that we meant no harm and it was a genuine mistake, I said we were not being malicious. 

The owner then shouted irately “No, but who said you can just walk around taking stuff like you own the place!” and stormed back into the shed. I was quite appalled. 

I feel like her reaction was totally unwarranted and excessive given it was a genuine mistake and had already profusely apologised and tried to tell her so. 

I am also peed off because my parents can not speak English and got frightened by her screaming until I had explained what we had done wrong.

He did this in public while I was chewing on a chicken thigh. 

I was shocked because he hadn't told me he was even dating anyone. I stopped eating and told him we needed to go home to talk about this. 

When we got home he told me his fiancee (37 f) and him were getting married in January (less than thirty days from now). He said that they decided to get married quickly because her work visa is about to expire. She also has a daughter (14f) stuck in Colombia (her home country) so my dad's green card would be able to secure both of them US citizenship.

My dad told me he wants me to attend his wedding in less than a month and meet his fiancee soon.

My dad also told me that he picked his fiancee because she was very excited to become my stepmom. 

I felt awful after learning all this. Through the years my dad has pulled all kinds of surprises on me irregardless of my feelings. For example when I was 8 he invited a girlfriend to come live with us for a few years and lied to me about who she was. I told him I felt unsafe but he didn't care and didn't do anything about it. 

Now, my dad is saying that he wants me to meet and become family with a woman I don't know? 

I told my dad I was happy for him and I wished him the best. He then said to me that he wanted the four of us (my dad, me, fiancee, and fiancee's daughter) to be a family together. 

This made me mad. If I have to be a member in his new family, why do I not have a say in who my dad decides to make family?

I hit my breaking point when I was talking to my dad's neighbors and they knew he had been seriously dating someone before me.

I felt so stupid and humiliated. My dad clearly didn't value me or the way I feel.  I confronted my dad about this and told him since he didn't care about my thoughts on who he was marrying (even though he expected me to have a relationship w/ them), or even consider how shocked I might be about this news I should probably stop contacting him.

I explained to him that I love him a lot but clearly he doesn't value me in the same way. I told him that I genuinely don't understand why I should even be in his life if he doesn't give a fuck about my opinion regarding something this important.

My dad is surprised by this and is telling me I should still meet his fiancee. He is also telling me I should be supportive.

Background, I (26F) and my partner (34M) have been together 7 years. We had a baby 7 months ago and have lived together for 3.5 years. I do every night feed with this baby and am at home with them all day, baby will not nap unless on me, so I am exhausted.

My partner has always played sports twice a week, which is fine. After I had the baby I was in hospital for a week so he missed that week of sport, he went back to playing twice a week the week after I got home so he missed 4 games in total. 

Recently (last month or so), he’s started going out more, doing an extra day of sports or going out with friends, some weeks he can be out 4 nights after work and one day at a weekend, all of which I’m left alone with baby.

Last night he was going on about how he ‘hates’ our pet. This was the final straw for me as he’s been treating me awfully lately, I went upstairs and cried. He came upstairs and when he saw I was upset he smiled. We got into an argument about how he dislikes coming home because all he has to do is clean, I asked him why he didn’t take the baby from me so I can clean, his response was because I’m tired. He then said “why do you think I spend so much time away from home” I said it’s not about that, he has a child to spend time with now. His reaction was that he doesn’t get to spend time with her because all he does is clean. I asked what he wanted me to do because I and he couldn’t give me an answer.

He quite often cooks, and does the laundry which I am grateful for, but he will leave dishes after cooking, example he left a pan all week (I refused to wash it for a while because he didn’t so it after use). 

I’m lost, I don’t know how to do more than I am doing, I spend at least an hour each day trying to clean and tidy, but nothing is enough for him.

My friend says he’s emotionally abusive as when he is in a bad mood, which is often, he will give me the silent treatment and just make snide comments every so often.

She literally just sipped her drink and looked at me and said are you getting that?

Mind you, we had a first date where the total was 55 and I paid for the whole thing. This time, the tab was 95 and she just expected me to pay it all again. So I just looked her dead in the eye and said No and stared at her blanky.

The girl started crying and panicking and I threatened to get up and leave. I also told her that I would not be manipulated and that I had plenty of other women after me.

Since she called me cheap, I told her she was cheap and needed to put down her card. Out of spite, I also locked my card on my phone and when the waitress came back and told this girl that her whole card was charged for both meals, the look on her face was priceless! LOL! I also purposely didn't leave the tip because I saw cash in her purse and told her I knew she had enough for a tip too.

She then when on about how she likes chivalry and being wined and dined, and I told her ""Oh well that's how you get bigger."" Lol.

To be mature and still be a gentleman, I offered to walk her up and even carried her dinner home. i then said i had to use the bathroom and she let me in angrily. Then i took my shoes off and then she flipped out crazily and said ""Did I say you were staying"" and her roommate was there so I got scared and told her let's go outside and talk about it. But she ignored me.

I still got a free meal though, so player got played. But I'm just wondering why this girl ghosted me after this? I told her that sometimes couples fight and she's not responding to my messages, and I was hoping I could meet her again or at least kiss a bit. What can I do?

**TLDR:** Girl refused to pay on date after I paid for the whole first date, I locked my card to teach her a lesson, and instead of talking to me or discussing it with me, she won't even hear my views and is probably just moving on to other guys.

To put some context, there is no hierarchical relationship between us and even very few work subjects, simply his office is close to mine. We both come to work by bike and practice in a sporty manner.

Finally,  we end up arranging to go on bike rides in the evening, after work. It's too good, the girl is refreshing, a brilliant mind, athletic...

it happens regularly over several months, then comes the winter so impossible to bicycle in the evening.

The day before the Christmas holidays, I send her a message asking her to say goodbye before leaving work, to which she replies ""yes I will, sorry"". I know it's not really the tradition and that she's not the only one to leave quickly without saying goodbye, but this time she had gone all the way down the hall wishing happy holydays, except in office where I am.

After the holidays, we don't talk about this message but she continues to leave without saying goodbye. After I send this message: ""As you left again without saying goodbye, I couldn't ask you when we were going to go cycling again?"". She does’nt respond. I don't insist, we don't talk about it face to face when we see each other every day. One day I ask her face to face if she really wants us to ride again together and she tells me no, that I was too aggressive in my way of asking, without giving any further explanation. She also tells me that she won't come by to say goodbye because my office is at the back and she doesn't pass by to leave.

Later, I apologize for that and try to understand. She tells me ""we're not on the same wavelength"". We end up writing very long message to each other that come to nothing, always without talking about it face to face.

I let a little time pass, we always meet at work and I ask her if we can from time to time arrange to make the trip by bike together. She accepts, it happens once or twice but she will admit to me later that she was calculating so that we don't leave at the same time and that doesn't happen.

We still see each other in the canteen, at the café... once I leave just before her and I ask her if we can make the trip together. She tells me that it's a little weird that I'm waiting for her to ask her that but accepts for the day after tomorrow and even tells me that we can arrange to do it once a week and that it's good to de-escalate the situation and not ignoring each other.

Again, she does not do what she says so I ask her by message when we can redo this trip together. She replies that in fact, she no longer wants to.

The following week, I arrive in his office to ask her if we can talk about it again and there I am insulted like never before and threatens me ""to go and talk to people about it"". 

I feel betrayed because she lied to me and at the same time I blame myself for wasting a potentially good friendship
