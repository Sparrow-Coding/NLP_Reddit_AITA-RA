I started losing weight because it wasn’t easy to eat with braces on so I cut out a lot of food and the number on the scale started dropping. In hindsight, the method I used to lose weight wasn’t healthy and I went as far as to just have one meal a day as I was afraid of gaining weight. When I was overweight I got bullied quite a bit, not just by the people from school but also by some of my family members, especially my from my mum’s side (this normally happens during Chinese New Year when we are all gathered together). My mum didn’t disagree and sometimes even made “joking” comments about it from time to time. 

Fast forward a few years later, I’ve lost weight and have also researched more on healthy eating and eating in moderation, I have also started exercising to build muscle, whereas in the past I only relied on controlling my food intake. Even so, I’m still getting comments from my mum about how I would gain it back whenever she sees me eating more than a meal a day or eating “fat” foods like pasta or rice. 

I tried communicating my boundaries to her by letting her know that I do not appreciate these fat jokes of hers and would like her to stop making them as I was still on a journey on trying to fix my skewed body image. Every time, she would just brush it off by saying that I’m too sensitive or that I’m very narrowminded and I can’t take a joke. Basically, gaslighting me into thinking that I’m too emotional. 

I tend to plan what I want to eat in a day and no longer restrict myself fully from enjoying the occasional desserts or snacks as a reward for surviving the week or keeping up with my exercise routine. So I will bring them home and then keep them in the fridge so that I can enjoy them for the next few days. However, they normally disappear and when I ask her about it, she tells me that she has eaten them. And when I confront her about it, she would say that I should be more generous and share whatever I buy with my family. 

Of course I wouldn’t mind sharing if she had asked, but she normally just take my food without telling me and I’ll only find out when I want to eat it. Also I am working part time so I purchase it with my own money. 

So I say that they are mine and she claims that I’m being selfish and that I don’t think of the family.

1) She always complains when I buy sweets home because she prefer savoury foods and 

2) My dad can’t have anything too sweet as he has high blood pressure

We got into a shouting match. This had happened a few times already. If it’s just once or twice I wouldn’t be posting about it. 

I’m not sure if this is just an asian mum thing or if I’m just too protective over my food. I do love her but I’m just so tired always fighting about this.

Its just me and my dog (9 months old). My dog isn't the type of dog to bark non stop but he can be loud since he's a big boy and he will bark once or twice at people on the property to give a warning then stop. The house Im in has the back of a service station right at the back fence. Because of this trucks are coming past at a certain time being really loud picking up garbage or dropping off things they order. Its something my dog will bark at for 2 minutes then stop or stop when I tell him to. We have been in the house for 2 weeks but he's getting use to them and is starting to not bark at them but still does a little.   


The other day I got a knock on the door and it was my neighbour. He seemed friendly at first explaining he works nights and sleeps during the day so could i please keep my dog from barking. I understand it can be very annoying so I tell him sorry and explain the situation that he's still getting use to the trucks but sorry again. (It confused me a little tho since theres another 2 dogs right next to his place that bark non stop while mine will bark maybe 1 or 2 times a day for a few seconds or a minute each time). 

Then he said something that really rubbed me the wrong way, ""I use to have a dog like that i had to get rid of because the thing didn't do what i got it for"". I ignored it and just apologised again but then he said that if he keeps barking he will have to call rspca/aspca. After that I just saw red and told him to fuck off and shut the door. My dog is well fed, groomed everyday, gets better food than some humans, has lots of toys and activities, gets walked everyday and is pampered better than some people treat their own children. To me saying you will call them is basically saying I'm neglecting my dog and a threat to take them away. Especially when my dog is more well behaved and quieter than the other dogs around this area.

We lost all contact with each other until my mother was released from jail and she gained custody of me, my brother and my sister. I was in the 8th grade, my brother was a freshman and my sister a sophomore. All was going well for the first year of living together but when I got to high school everything changed

As my high school experience started to grow I notice that my sister was moving from boyfriend to boyfriend every other week. I didn’t notice this until one of my friends told me that people started calling her the “school hoe.” This spread like wildfire leading to me being extremely bullied and depressed. I would have people from all grades saying they would f*ck my sister and laugh at me. This made me grow a strong resentment towards my sister so I would do everything in my power to avoid her at home but especially at school. 

 When I was in my sophomore year my sister came out to my family saying that she was pregnant and didn’t know who the father was. When people at my school found out about this bullying was 10 times worse then the first time. I would have people laughing at me and some would come up to me saying they were the father. This extreme bullying lead to me one day taking a bit to many pills and swallowing them. I woke up in the hospital the next day trying to express my situation to my mom that my sisters actions were the cause of this but she would not hear it and just tried saying she has had a hard life and this was a way to cope. 

My sister went on to have the child and would soon graduate. I thought this would be the end of this horrible bullying but when I went into my junior year through the year many rumors were spread that my sister was sleeping with people in my school. This don’t stop and neither did the bullying. I finally escaped when I moved for college and started to study business. 

I cut all ties with my sister for years and started to focus on a business I was interested in pursuing. My business popped off after a few years and I can say that I make around 400k yearly. 

My sister called my family together saying she had news. She came into the room with a man that a I had seen before if was one of the worst people to bully me and was a he was a main factor in why I took those pills that day. My sister explained that she was pregnant with his child and she needed money since her baby dad spent it all gambling. She came to me saying since I was so well off she wanted me to give her 10k.

I (26F) and my now husband (29M) got pregnant on August 2020 and got married December 2020 after dating of 1 1/2 years. I usually attend celebrations on their house for every occassion they might have because my husband wanted me to be there, and eventually his family invites me everytime. My MIL and I gotten close and usually talk about family stuff and opened up about my FIL's drug use issues, which she said I might notice since I was often at their home. 

Before we got married, my MIL and FIL told us they renovated the 2nd floor room above the garage and we can stay there to be our home. In other word, we are living so nearby to their house, even my 2 BIL which have their own spaces on the same lot. 

FIL drug use caused him to be addicted and cannot be controlled sometimes, always shouting and saying things which I think is his hallucinations due to the effect of drugs. At one point he is making stories on how my SIL is cheating to his son and we all know it is not true. Because of this, my husband and his brothers together with my MIL talked about how they wanted to put my FIL in a private rehabilitation center (they chose private because they have fear the government institution is not really good on our country) and split the bill 4 ways, my MIL, My husband and my 2 BIL.  

But our financial situation is not good as I'm the only one working and my husband is still studying (kinda the blackship of the family). We have a 7 month old child and my salary is just enough for the bills, grocery, daily allowance and our son needs. The amount if the rehabilitation push through requires us to pay our share which is 25% of my salary. This would mean that our budget will be limited for a year so on depending on the progress of my FIL.

This conflict mainly involves, my eldest’s twins, our granddaughter, Paisley, and our grandson, Tanner. We love them both dearly, however, there has been some tension this year between them, with Paisley usually being the aggressor. 

Tanner is mostly a good boy, he is a straight A student and is very sweet. He has definitely had some moments with his parents this year, but mostly typical teenage fights, like over what he can wear, bedtime, ect. Tanner also has a great group of friends. Tanner is an athlete and the one adult him and his friends respect the most are his coach, his coach has a prize box to incentivize handing stuff in on time early, going to extra help, ect.

Paisley has been a sweet girl in the past and is very artistically talented, but something has gotten into her in the past year, she’s failing multiple classes and has become mean, she still loves all of her hobbies like painting and cosmetics, but now she’s pretentious about it, like making fun of other girl’s makeup. Her friend have become the “school mean girls” in Tanner’s words, she’s gotten in trouble at school recently for her behavior. She has been in therapy for the past few months, and her grades have improved slightly. 

The twins have always been competitive against each other, but this year Paisley has turned from being competitive to being a bully. Examples include when we were praising Tanner for his grades at a family dinner, she suggested he “only takes easy classes for him like History of American Sports”, and mocking him for his outfits.

A few days ago, there was an incident that made me reconsider if we should get Paisley gifts for Christmas. Christmas is a big deal in our family, all the kids and grandkids come to our house after opening gifts at theirs (all live within 20 minutes). We have always been the family to go all out on decorations, and our kids adopted that to. We were helping the grandkids decorate while their parents were out on a date. Each child has a tree in their room with their own ornaments, Tanner’s is full of vintage sports and sports teams ones, sports are the love of his life. When Paisley came in his room, she started mocking the tree and made her brother upset.

At that point, I told her if she was mean one more time in the next few weeks, she wouldn’t get gifts from us. When we got home, husband told me I went to far and to be easy because being in 8th grade is rough, I also got a call from my daughter asking if I threatened to cancel Christmas, I explained myself and she got upset. We’ve already started buying gifts but I don’t want to reward a bully. She only needs to be nice for 6 weeks.

I didn't have school and hung out with my mom most of the day. I bought a gift for my grandma, who's birthday is the day before mine, and I got a gift for me too, since I had money. Money is tight for my mom, so I just bought them instead of her. I enjoyed my day with her. 

Until we got home. 

My stepdad(m48) was home and completely ignored me. My mom made us all dinner. My brother and I started talking, my brother brought up a question to me and it just continued. My stepdad just gave me a death stare all of dinner. It got me uncomfortable, it always does. 

Afterward, I opened the gifts I bought earlier. My stepdad was on his phone the entire time, ignoring me further. We did cake and my mom tried to get my stepdad to be involved and sing happy birthday and celebrate with us. He ignored her and was on his phone playing his games. My mom just asked again for him to be involved and ignored again. She served cake, and asked again before putting cake away. Keep in mind, my mom broke her foot, and as Dr orders, no pressure or much walking on it. Stepdad got upset he didn't have any, and she got him a slice. After we all finished, I put my plate, and my mom's plate away so she didn't have to make an extra trip to clean it. My stepdad got upset I didn't do the same to him. My mom argued he didn't participate in anything so I didn't have to, and she was broken, and he is perfectly capable of doing it on his own. 

We went to her office because she had a bag for me, so I could put the gift for my grandma in. Stepdad walked over and started to call me an asshole, telling me i was abusive, neglectful, and an absolute terrible person.. It hurt and I started to cry. My mom and him got into a fight. I left the room because I can't deal with a lot at this point, I was already crying and overwhelmed by the situation. 

A while later I was asked to come downstairs and talk. 

My stepdad started to say that I was ths problem, and I couldn't handle talking to him, and I made no effort at all. And that I was an asshole to my brother. I'm sarcastic, and if you tell me I made a mistake, ill apologize and not bring it up. My brother has never told me I was being too much or that it bothered him, and clarified that again during the family conversation. 

A couple days later my stepdad had made no more effort than during my birthday. And the death stares don't stop. 

He called me an asshole that I abuse him.

I (25F) am an extremely active person. I
farm for a career, I have been playing rugby for 7 years, and I go to the gym almost every day. most of my life and coping mechanisms, are spent being active. 
I had three ER visits and surgery. I have never experienced pain like this before and I would not wish it upon anyone.
The first 2weeks I stayed at my apartment, which I share with a roommate. My roommate (26NB) and I have been friends for several years. However, have not asked my roommate for any help unless I absolutely need it because I don't want to be a burden, and I know waiting on someone hand and foot is not fun for either party.
roommate has not respected my boundaries like
insisting on undressing me, helping me shower, coming into my room very early in the morning with a flash light to leave me things they think I need. They come from a family of nurses, but I have tried to set boundaries that if I need help, I will ask for it. I will go as far to wait until
4-6pm everyday before I ask them to bring me food because our kitchen is downstairs, and stairs are obviously an obstacle for me.
roommate also never cleaned before I broke my leg/ankle. I did all the essential house cleaning. But now I can't, and they have complained about having “chores.” 

After surgery, I stayed at my parents bc the pain was excruciating. Indescribable, absolutely
unbearable. I am on several pain medications to
compensate, but even after a week post surgery, I still cannot sleep. (Maybe that's normal, I don't know bc this is the first time I've ever had surgery so I am going into this very blindly.) On top of the pain, I feel incredibly defeated, a new kind of depressed and anxious, I can't do anything for myself except wipe my
own ass and lay in the shower to bathe. I'm out of work, running out of money, and continue to rack up medical bills. I can't do anything I enjoyed doing before, and am struggling to find new coping mechanisms since I can no longer just go for a run, escape in the woods, or go to the gym.
Our landlords asked my roommate and I if we
could move our cars because they are having a birthday party. I told my roommate I wasn't going to be able to move my car and that they shouldnt have to do that for me (since they were helping me out with many other things.) they said they would do it and I said that was unfair and made a light joke ""just let me be bitter haha.""
They told me to ""be bitter somewhere else"" and that my ""attitude is too hard to handle right now."" And made it clear they don't want me to come home. This all went down during the week I have been away at my parents, and this was the only real interaction I've had with them since my surgery.

Here’s the thing: I have nothing else to do aside from electronics, and it’s not like my grades are low or anything. If anything, my grades are fine. Also, I’m autistic, if that’s important. 

While there is a reward system in place in which I’ll have my phone when I do study for a significant amount of time (allegedly), it feels like there is no reward system at all, mostly because when she and my sister (F16) forces me to study, all it does is to kill any and all motivation to actually study, and even if I did, they wouldn’t give me the electronics back as if they wanted me to study 24/7. 

It sounds like an exaggeration. Maybe even biased. Perhaps it is, but it feels like that. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry. 

I’ve tried my best to convince my mom about this, telling her that I don’t care for high grades but rather, I see them as a bonus, but the only thing that changed is that while I can use them while studying, it still doesn’t change the fact that they are still forcing me to study and won’t let me use my phone, which makes the entire thing moot since it still kills my motivation. 

(Then again, I’m not the kind of guy who speaks up their mind, so maybe I could do more.)

As a result, I have to find ways to get the electronics back without them knowing, but my sister is pretty good at enforcing the rules my mom has set up. It doesn’t change the fact that stuff like that does not make me want to study. 

I believe the reason for the confiscation of electronics are because my mom and my sister expects high grades (since it’ll net me a good job according to mom) when I don’t care about that at all—I care about whether or not I pass, and so far, I’m doing good, barring that one time I didn’t pass, but that was mostly because it was designed to make you drop points from last time. I don’t think it was designed for students to dip, so it’s all on me. 

Yes, she places the exact same rules onto my sister, but I never saw her use her own electronics, which only makes me reinforce the idea that the reward system is a lie (although she could be studying over using her phone). She doesn’t seem to be worse for wear, though, but I believe that’s mostly because she isn’t autistic. 

If you think there isn’t enough info, I’ll try to provide more information if I could, but I’m used up all of my limited time that I got by essentially throwing a tantrum to write this post. (Even with that, it’s only for an hour.)

Over the last few weeks, he has been consistently texting me long paragraphs of condescending texts about my ""behaviour"" in the apartment that he hasn't been fond of. Now, I am not a messy roommate. I generally clean up after myself and share the space equally with him. I am pretty easy to get along with and tend to give him the benefit of the doubt when he brings up this stuff, like when he texted me saying he was ""disappointed"" in me because a shared friend of ours crashed on our couch. I didn't tell him about it because it was really late and she did not leave a single mark or stain on our couch. Recently, the texts have become too much. I have even asked him to wait to have these conversations with me in person rather than over text, but, here we are.

My girlfriend (21f) and I share our time together pretty equally between our places and we mostly spend time in each others rooms or in the kitchen to cook, but always when no one is using it. She has had a cold for the last 1.5 weeks that sounds pretty gross, but she has yet to make myself or any of her roommates sick so, she is pretty low risk (It's not covid, she has tested many times). Like I said we spend nearly all of our time when we're at my place by ourselves and in my room. 

My roommate texts me again saying he overheard my girlfriend on the phone talking about how she was sick and heard her coughing and that he didn't feel comfortable with her being in the apartment, with his reasoning being that he wouldn't want to ""jeopardize his health during such an important time in our university journey"". Mind you, I've been with her basically the whole time she's been sick and they probably share about 10 second total of face to face contact while she is over at my place. 

I'm not sure how to respond. I'm not a huge fan of confrontation but this is becoming ridiculous and I want to be able to have my girlfriend over at my own place if she's not posing a genuine risk to his ""university journey"".

I want to preface this by saying I know for a fact my sister was not ready to have a child. She only had one because she wanted one.


AITA for not wanting to watch my sister's child anymore. So I (F22) watch my sister's (F23) child every week from the time she goes to work till the time she gets picked up by our mom. Our original agreement for when I watch him is that it was to only be the days she worked and he would go home right after she got out, but ever since I've started watching him he's been at my house even on days she and my BIL (M25) don't have work and spends multiple nights a month. They were also supposed to give me compensation for watching him since I'd need to be available and wouldn't be able to get a job. Her most recent payment to me was $25 for the whole week. They don't spend time with him and let him sleep in their bed which makes it difficult for him to nap when I watch him since he wants to be held the whole time. He's very high maintenance and wants to be watched 24/7 because of how my sister takes care of him. I can't even leave the room to go to the bathroom for 2 minutes without him crying. Then they just told me today that I'd have to watch him tomorrow, as my BIL offered to do overtime at his work without checking in with me or my sister about it. Even though I was supposed to go help my mom at a craft show tomorrow. I'm honestly fed up with them changing plans and not telling me and handing their kid off to me when they just don't want to deal with him. My sister is not a parent but pretends that she is. I've cried multiple times due to the amount of stress she puts me under. I also had a mental breakdown today because I realized that I'm going to lose out on the next 5 years of my life due to her child. I won't get to find a significant other, get a job, get my own place, or move forward with my own ambitions. It's to the point I'd rather not be alive than to keep living like this. I'm seriously considering telling her she's going to have to find an actual daycare or other accommodations cause I keep doing it.

Growing up, my parents forced my older brother Henry (42M) to essentially be a third parent and caretaker for Daniella. Then they expected that of me after Henry moved out when I was 10. I was forced to quit all my extracurriculars. I was never allowed to go anywhere or do anything outside of school hours because they would need someone to complete chores while they were at the hospital with Daniella or look after Daniella while they went out to “have fun.” It was very common for them to say things like “You get to see your friends every day at school. We only get to see ours two nights a week!” They would be out until midnight most times and I would be on my own taking care of Daniella. I moved out the day I graduated high school. I only talk to my parents for family emergencies, because any other conversation becomes about me again becoming a full-time, unpaid caregiver for Daniella.

Recently my father experienced a health scare. He is fine, but it made my parents realize that they are getting older and will not be able to take care of Daniella someday. They finally got Daniella on a waiting list for a care home, but it’s obviously a very long wait and it’s very likely that my parents will either pass away or become unable to care for Daniella before it will be her turn to enter the care home. My parents explained this to me and said how since I have the ability to work from home with my job, I can start “taking over” certain days with Daniella’s care to “get back into the hang of” it and be ready in case I need to become her full-time caregiver.

I explained that I would not work from home, because it makes less money and I want to focus on advancing my career. I also wanted free time for my own hobbies and outside social life. My parents called me selfish and said that I need to realize caring for Daniella will not leave enough time for “those other things.” I told my parents I would not be caring for Daniella. I’ve spent my entire childhood taking care of her and I’m done. Now other family members and some acquaintances are telling me what a horrible person I am because I am prioritizing career advancements and hobbies over my own sister. Some are calling my ableist because Daniella’s disability isn’t fair to her or my parents and I am essentially saying disabled people shouldn’t be accommodated by refusing to help care for Daniella. I believe that disabled people all deserve to have their needs met. At the same time, I’m not obligated to keep putting my life on hold for Daniella and my parents. I know on the outside it sounds horrible to prioritize my career and hobbies over my disabled sister, but I won’t return to revolving my life around caring for Daniella because it’s never going to stop if I do.

At this time I requested for the second time a return to work plan and if this could not be accommodated I’d request to extend my leave until it could be. I was reassured that it was no issue and they would come back to me with some options.

The reason why we both share an ebay account is because on ebay, you need to be over the age of 18 to sell stuff and you need to send in ID to verify that, so the ebay account is under our mums name with her ID, so technically its her account.

Now, I had an item listed on that ebay account, with the starting bid being around 90 AUD, however I did allow offers on this item. So, a buyer sent in an offer for 75 dollars, and I decided to make a counteroffer for 82 dollars. Now this is where the issues began, my brother knew about that I had received an offer on my item, and he wanted me to just accept the offer, but when he found out that I had sent in a counteroffer to the buyer instead of just accepting their offer, he got mad at me.

He said that I should've just accepted their offer of 75 dollars rather then make a ""fuss"" about an extra 7 dollars. He said he didn't want anybody leaving a bad review on the account, and that it was stupid that I made a counteroffer for a 82 dollars, when its only an extra 7 dollars. He even went as far as changing the password to the account so I couldn't access it, and delisting the item I had listed on it. After that, he called our mum, and she seemed to side with him, saying that I should have just accepted the offer for 75 dollars.  


Yes, I know 7 dollars isn't exactly a lot of extra money, but I figured I'd send the counteroffer and then negotiate with the buyer from there. 

After a while, he said that he would let me list items on the account, but HE would have to list them since it is ""his"" account, even though it uses our mums name.

I honestly don't even get why he thinks someone will leave a bad review over receiving a counteroffer, and its not like I was being rude to any of our customers at all, I was always polite when communicating with them, and if they don't like the counteroffer, they can just deny it..

I'm honestly not sure what to do, I didn't see anything wrong with me sending in a counteroffer, especially when it is MY item, so I figured I would be fine to make a counteroffer on my item.

Sergio was previously friends with my husband's sister and her then bf. He was a medium friend with my husband, then with me.

They all moved in together, my husband and her sister, her then bf, and Sergio. Things were rocky for me and the sister and the exbf for a while, and Sergio helped me through that, as well as issues with mania from my bipolar disorder. 

Recently, one month before the wedding, Sergio started treating me really poorly. He wouldn't acknowledge my presence even when I would say hello, and he would leave if I added to a conversation between himself and my husband. Idk why honestly. I know about just one thing bc he literally won't tell me what his issues are; he wanted to invite this random dude to my wedding (a very small affair, 25 people), with whom I hadn't had a great experience. I told him to invite someone who I actually knew. He didnt explain further or object at all. Later, I found out through a third party that they were kind of dating (less than one month at that point). 

Anyway, recently I had a manic episode and in the middle of it I completely cut ties with Sergio. He, after months of ignoring me, expressed worry about my condition and I told him to f off, were not friends clearly do don't pretend to care. 

Later I found out my husband was expressing his issues with his sister and Sergio, including issues regarding my problems. I told him with your sister tell her whatever you want, but Sergio has no business knowing my business. Talk about yourself, your feelings but I don't trust him and I don't want him up in my shit.

I have a coworker who we’ll call “Sam” . Sam and I both work at a day care for dogs and Sam does a fantastic job and I enjoy working with them. 

 We have crates to put the dogs in for naps, breaks , etc, the crates have removable trays in them just in case a dog goes potty while in a crate or what have you. We also clean these trays at least twice a day just to maintain cleanliness in the room. The cleaning spray we use comes in a squirt bottle that can be refilled. 

When using the cleaning spray a little goes a long way as we are mostly wiping off lose fur, and even when cleaning off residue from any potential potty accidents, putting in a little elbow grease with a small amount of cleaner usually gets the job done.  

Here is my issue….

When we pull the trays out to clean them as part of the daily cleanings,I feel like Sam puts way too much cleaning spray on the cleaning cloth. They practically saturate the cloth in cleaner even though that much isn’t required. This means the bottle empties a lot faster than it needs to.

My wife works in the special education so she would be best to diagnose. But we believe it's too early to be sure. One example is that my daughter is very particular about the routine she undergoes before school. It needs to be almost exactly the same for her to have enough comfort in the emotional bank for her to be ready for school.

Every morning I help get my daughter's snack ready for school, pack it in the backpack, make sure she has a full water bottle and leave it all by the door. My wife helps to get her dressed, brushed, loads the car with her two jackets (while on the ride to school she drapes both over herself like a blanket and then wears one to school), backpack and shoes. Meanwhile I get dressed to log in to work. Once she's ready to go, I stop, I pick her up and load her into the car and drape the two jackets over her. I don't typically offer to help load the car because in the past when I've forgotten things, my wife tells me that it's better if just one person is responsible for loading.

This morning we couldn't find the second jacket. My wife asked, me, ""Do you think it's at school?"" I didn't know, I asked her if it was on the hallway hook or in the car. She said no. So I said, ""Yeah, I guess it's at school.""

At school my daughter starts to cry. She refuses to wear another jacket (the missing one is her favorite one). And she can't find it in the classroom. She insists that mom go home and find it. Again, imagine that our daughter has a finite emotional bank, my wife very generously knows that not filling that bank can mean a meltdown and temper tantrum or that my daughter will tire out before the end of the school day. My wife goes home, pissed off and stressed out that she might not make it back home in time for her virtual training and that she'd have to sit through the entire training without breakfast because she has to find and drive the jacket back to school.

She told me she found the jacket on top of a pile of toys and that neither of us saw it until she went looking. She tells me that I should be sorry and that she was furious with me. She says that I should instead have replied, ""I don't know"" when she asked if I thought the jacket was at the school.

So I said I'm sorry for misleading you. I'm sorry that was a stressful situation and that you had to deal with that. I'm also sorry that you didn't get breakfast. She purposefully corrected me and said, ""I'd rather you say, 'I'm sorry for the jacket' because it is downplaying your role in the problem \[by only saying you misled me\]."" She tells me that it's also my responsibility to know whether or not the jacket came home the prior day. In this particular instance maybe I recall that she still had her jacket on yesterday... but I'm not even truly sure. These are details that I can't place (having a 1yro son at home who likes to play at 1am doesn't help).

I'm just going to start by telling a quick story, recently I lost my car in a car crash (attempted robbery gone wrong), insurance paid out, no problem, I'm ok with all my parts. Didn't leave my house in a week and puked every time I had breakfast from the anxiety. I'm ok now. Anyways that means, well, I don't have a car. Not a problem since I live in a big ass city with a lot of public transport, and I can take Uber whenever I please since my parents subsidise some stuff. So thankfully it's been ok.

Enter my dream car, after almost 5y of saving and working(250 a month+/-) I can finally buy a MX 5 ND, I just need a 5k loan for it, and I can pay it. My parents told me Im paying for everything since they're not happy Im getting that car.

Now that loan means cutting costs, and I told my gf that. I will not be able to afford a ton of stuff, like going to restaurants, movie tickets, Ubereats and the like. Basically leisure stuff, I can still afford school stuff and the basics since my parents pay as long as I get good grades. Obv they don't pay for me and my gf.

Now here's the problem, I told my girlfriend (of 2yrs) I was going to have to cut costs way way down and that until I pay it all, we may need to go low budget for a while. Maybe if we want to eat a dessert we can cook it together in my house. If we want to go to the movies. Perhaps we watch it in her house and I bring snacks over. Gifts? Maybe let's go with something handmade since I can't buy a ton of stuff. Sushi for dinner? Well maybe let's go eat tacos with lime water. Basically lets try to budget these things. I hoped for her to be understanding and tell me its ok since its only temporary and well its my literal dream and I still tried the hardest to be a good boyfriend.

Her response?

""No, I want you to have money to treat me like a gentleman, I want you to have the money to spend on something like a dessert or a nice day out. Maybe fix your situation before dating a woman.""

Its to note that my family is very well off, and I've always been thankful. My gf is from one of the poorest places in the country, her family isn't poor per se, but they aren't definitely well off or anywhere near that. And she has told me in the past she can't afford to buy me a videogame (60$) because it's to expensive and she has expenses. And I've never expected anything of the sorts from her. And I was more than happy to pay since I can.

AITA?

basically my partner and i are winding down when they suggested watching a movie. so, we start watching a movie. everything is chill but not even halfway through they take off their glasses as if to go to bed. i was confused because they suggested this, so i asked what was up and mentioned that they took off their glasses. i asked if they wanted to watch it later. they said for me to keep watching. i was excited to watch it with them so i said we could pick it up another time since they were clearly tired. i was bummed but whatever. it must have shown in my tone because then they put their glasses back on and insisted we keep watching. and this is when i become confused and annoyed because why would you force yourself to do something you don't wanna do when it's not that deep? i mentioned that it wasn't a big deal and to not force themselves. ""go to sleep, just go to sleep,"" is almost verbatim what i told them but they kept insisting.

i admit at this point i was annoyed. i was bummed about the movie but my partner has a habit of always doing whatever i want and it annoys me to hell and back. i have told them this so many times that if i am confused in response to whatever you're doing and i ask a question, it doesn't mean stop. even when i make a comment, ""oh that's just not how i do things,"" they'll borderline throw themselves on a sword to do it my way. and i've told them ""dude. it is not, nor will it ever be, that serious! please stop doing this. it makes me feel bad because i'm not trying to tell you what to do, i'm just talking to you. it makes me feel like im stage managing you and i hate it."" we had a whole 20 minute conversation about this and they said they understood but, as you can see, they keep doing it.

the kicker here is when i reminded them that i really don't like when they do this, they ignored me completely. im chalking this up to the faxt that they smoked before this but they were cognizant enough like 2 seconds ago. why when i ask them why they keep doing this am i suddenly ignored? mind you, im not yelling and my tone isn't even pointed. it's not sharp for that matter, but i am a little hurt that this keeps happening. i feel like shit and i kinda wanna cry right now. i feel like they have a low opinion of me, like i'm a toddler that can't handle the word no so they just kowtow to whatever i want. belittling isn't the word but i don't know what else to call it.

She's comfortable in revealing clothes which I'm not all that comfortable with but it's not my business so I try not to say anything. 

So I (29M) invited my girlfriend to come with me to my brother's wedding in my home town. I don't live there anymore and live in a place where it doesn't get really cold which is great because it can get to be really freezing this time of year in my hometown. 

My girlfriend agreed and while we were packing I told her multiple times she should buy something to cover herself up because it will be really cold and she wouldn't be able to wear her usual clothes. She said ok and said she's add the clothes. I had to fly out early since I was in the wedding party so I asked her if it was fine and she said it was and she'd fly out by herself.

Well I fly home and have a good time with my family. My girlfriend texts me she's coming the next day and I get ready to pick her up. I go to the airport and I see her wearing a crop top with shorts freezing her ass off. I asked her why she wasn't wearing something warmer and she told me she thought I was 'joking'. I wasn't

So we go to the hotel I'm staying at and while she's warming up I decide to do something nice and unpack her suitcase. And what I find is that there isn't a single thing in her suitcase that is appropriate in the weather. Everything was really short, and wouldn't keep her warm at all. 

The next day I go to my mother's house to introduce her and everything is well and good until she asks to use my jacket. Remember that I only have one. I don't want her to be cold so I give it to her and while she's warm I'm freezing but don't say anything. This happens over and over. I ask her if she would just buy a jacket or ask someone else but she said its a waste seeing as she won't use the jacket and she doesn't know any one. I'm angry and we get into an argument where finally she agreed to buy a jacket. 

Onto the conflict: It's the day before the wedding and it's really freezing. I'm having a good time while she's chatting with my sisters and then she comes up to me and asks to use my jacket. I'm fed up of being cold all the time so I tell her no and it isn't my fault she's cold when I told her to get warm clothes. She's angry and tries to convince me otherwise but when it doesn't work she flies home. I stay and celebrate my brother and his wife before returning home.

All good, she was polite and friendly and I didnt have a reason to be suspicious. 

But when the food arrived, she removed the neck thing, and started to eat normally. I was surprised, more so when I stood next to her and she refused to look at me.

After I asked a few more questions, her husband asked me if there was an issue and if I could not stand so close to her because she was having trouble looking at me.

I told her that she was just frankly being rude, and that it was embarrassing that a woman her age was pretending to be ill for god knows what reason.

The AQI is frequently over 300 and deemed hazardous by all scientific sources. It has been said that the air is so bad that breathing in it is like smoking 20-40 cigarettes a day.

My father however, is insistent that the air is not so bad and it is only fog. He says I need to make myself healthy and live here so he can see me. But the fact is I have no life if I live in Delhi as I can't go anywhere because the air is so bad. I'm so afraid my health (mental and bronchial) will regress. So I left for a city with cleaner air near the hills in the Himalayas. The city is well developed and not too remote.

However, as I am here, my dad demands I speak to him on a regular basis out of ""concern"" for me safety. But I have not once felt unsafe in this city. Moreover, whenever we talk, he says that the air in Delhi is fine and it is me who has issues. He keeps saying that the air quality is good. This is in stark contrast with the facts. When I get annoyed by this, he tells me I need to not get annoyed by ""little things"". But to me, this isn't a little thing. My parents' denial about the pollution levels affected my lungs and health all throughout my childhood. 

This morning, I woke up generally happy and again he put forth these arguments, urging me to come back. I was so annoyed, I yelled at him and told him he is not an expert on the pollution, all legitimate sources differ from his opinion and then out of anger, ridiculed his authority on the matter as he is no expert (finance person). I am so sick of him ruining my days like this, I even said I can't wait for him to die.

She recently moved out of state and also got engaged. I was obviously super exited for her (despite the fact I hate her fiancé) and was one of the first to know, this was a month or two ago. When I found out they did not have any plans on dates, and were even considering eloping and having the “real” wedding next year(2024). I told her to let me know and I would fly any time to see her even just for some bff time. 
Recently I was able to get Taylor swift tickets for me, two of my siblings and my mother. It will be in a different state and we will fly there so we could also visit my grandparents at the same time for about a week. 
I was so excited and texted Jay jokingly to not have her wedding then because I could not attend. She told me that they were actually looking at that date so I better be joking or cancel my plans. I thought SHE was joking and said no can do I love Taylor more then her. She sent me a long text saying how it’s her fiancés parents anniversary, how I promised, and what a bad friend I am for choosing some music over her.
I thought it was weird how she didn’t mention this as a perspective date sooner, not even offhandedly. So I did some digging, not much just checked on future in-laws fb. Yah turns out the anniversary was last month. 
I’m obviously mad and text her a screen shot and said dude just have it any other days that month and I can come. She told me everything is planed and booked (even sent me payment screen shots), that she has never let me down or bailed before and I can’t do this to her, the date was “to perfect”. 
I was pretty mad and send her a list times she was a bad friend (most recently on my birthday) but the one I regret the most was saying I didn’t even really want to go in the first place becuse I hate her fiancé and how I wish she was marrying anyone but his homophobic, racist, pos ass. 
To be clear don’t regret calling him those things, those are true and she knows I hate him, but I do regret telling her I never wanted to go, because I do love her and want to support her even though I do think it’s not a good idea. 
She blocked me on everything and announced her exs sister (who bullied me in hs) as maid of honor instead of me. I know she did this to get back at me because she hates her and has no other reason. 
So now I feel like I was an asshole to her because I lost my best friend who was the first person I ever came out to, that I’ve known as long as I can remember, and left her in a bad situation with no one to support her.
I will not go to the wedding(I’m defiantly not invited anyway) and I’m not going to apologize for what I said about him.
 One mutual friend told me I had every right after she lied to me and tried to make me the bad guy, but another is telling me I should not have aired out my grievances like that, or chose a vacation over her.

We were and are very close with each other.

My oldest brother was always an extrovert and the life of the party. It wasn’t uncommon for my brother to give grand toasts, chat up every person in the bar and loudly sing karaoke. Just a very vibrant personality. He was dating and married to his high school sweetheart for almost 13 years, when suddenly his wife out of the blue asked for a divorce. I’ve never gotten the whole story out of my brother, but he’s said there was no cheating or anyone being wrong, but even though this divorce was amicable, I don’t think my brother wanted to split up with his ex. He really loved her.

In the three years since, my brother has been to put it lightly, a shell of himself. Gone is the man who would tell jokes and interact with every stranger at a new place, he now generally just sits quietly and will make light conversation if asked. It’s not uncommon to hear him only utter a handful of words in an evening. He will frequently turn down invites to go out. It’s kind of a family and extended family topic about his behavioral shifts.

Recently my parents found out he was seeing someone, and asked if he wanted to invite her to Thanksgiving. He then proclaimed he didn’t want her there because we would embarrass ourselves and him with how loud we are.

This just did not feel like the brother I know and love. I know his divorce was a life altering event, and I am was so concerned. My middle brother had tried to talk to him and figure out what help we can provide, but my oldest brother refused help and said there is nothing wrong. So I thought that maybe both of us talking about it to him would maybe help. I told him that I wanted to make sure he was ok, and that i would always be there for him. 

He basically just stared at me blankly and then said thanks and nothing other than that.

Well two days later, my brother and I got a simple text from my oldest brother that he didn’t want to talk about his behavior with either of us again, and that he was fine. If we tried to talk about it again with him, he would go no contact with us, and it was rude both of us to ask the same thing on the same day.

I understand that my brother was upset, but this is literally the only time my brother or I have asked in 3 years. And while I understand he may have felt ambushed, it’s coming from a place of concern.

This is not about me (27F) being an entitled brat. Okay, maybe it is, but you're the ones here to judge me so I will explain my reasons behind my feelings here.

So my aunt is flying in from Australia tonight. If I had favourites in my family, I would say she's my favourite aunt. If anyone's read my earlier post here, she's the one that wanted to give me tickets to a show I didn't want to see but that anyone who knew me would assume I did want to - very thoughtful but ultimately misguided.

Anyway, I'm only staying at my parents' house for another night before I go back home to my flat, which I do need to go back to. My parents are going to meet my aunt at the airport and bring her home, but they won't let me come.

I'm fine with my mother going on her own. This is her sister, who she hasn't seen for three years, and so they want to catch up. According to her, my dad's only going to make sure she doesn't fall asleep at the wheel as it's late at night (for them, not for me) and isn't going to speak a word while there. This does NOT explain why I can't come and just do the same thing. Maybe I could help seeing as I'm used to being up late at night?

I won't get to see my aunt for as long as they do because I get 12 hours tops if I don't come to the airport. They get a full 48 hours. But at least I will get to see her, and that's not the main issue. The main issue is, if I can't do the same job as Steve, does that mean they think I don't care enough to keep Amanda awake and alert? Does that mean they think I don't love them?

So of course I brought this up, saying ""If Steve can come, why can't I come?"" and ""If that's the reason, why didn't you just say that the first time I asked to come?"" I got absolutely no answer and my parents practically rushed out of the house just to stop me from complaining again.

Worse, this isn't the first time they've done this. The exact same thing happened with picking up and dropping off my sister's family at the airport. I begged to come along both times and they said no to picking them up because ""they'll have all their luggage"" and second because ""There's no room in the car"". Yet they could fit all of them in the car on the way back but only one person on the way there, so I'm the only one who gets left out both times. What is up with this?

Around bedtime (6:54 PM) I saw that my wife sent me a Snapchat and I opened it expecting the usual photo or video of the girls.  Instead it was a picture of my youngest crying and a caption that said “she fell and hit her head on the tub”.  Thinking that while she was crying, she ultimately was fine since I don’t get a call or text, I sent a Snapchat text (7:05 PM) saying “Awe baby girl”, and then sent a photo of me saying goodnight.  She snapped me back right after saying “Ya not good”.  I then am sent a video (7:10 PM) of the girls saying goodnight and I went back to enjoying talking with friends.

At 8:24 PM I see my wife had sent a text at 7:15 PM asking if she should be worried about a concussion, and then at 8:14 PM she said “You’re on (1 year old daughters name) duty the whole night when you get home”.

I replied asking “Why?” followed by “What is she doing that I need to be on duty for?”  I didn’t get a reply so asked “Hello?” At 8:50 PM.

When I got home around 9:45 PM my wife was sleeping and I woke up to tell her I was home and she was pissed.  I asked what she was upset about and she is furious I didn’t ask to see how our daughter was doing.  I replied saying I wasn’t here, have no way to judge from a blurry pic how hurt she is, and didn’t get a call or anything alerting me to any concern.  We snapped our good nights and I put the phone away.  When I finally saw then text an hour after, I asked what was up and nothing.

She always made me kinda uncomfortable but I didn't think to much of it since I just don't tend to like most people.
Flash forward to 2 days ago when she came knocking on my door to talk. I told her I was tired and didn't have the energy but she kept pushing and saying she had something she had to ask me about, whicj she aparantly couldn't do in the hallway so I had to let her in, then she proceeded to tell me that she had herd from her boss(B) that aparantly my mom had called them and said I hated living there so much that when I was moving out around the end of the year I was going to give away all my furniture since I didn't want to have any memories from here and she had apparently talked to another resident about it. She also start to ask about my childhood, like when CPS took me away from home, what my foster parents name was, where and how many people could live in the institution I lived at etc. She later claimed it was because she wanted to ""get to know me better) 

This was not the first uncomfortable situation I've had with her as some days prior I was sitting with my friends who are also residents here (M and R) waiting for an ambulance after R had tried to poison herself, K was also in the room and jokingly said ""are we so ugly you want to die?"" we later told her that that wasn't okay and she then proceeded to say she never said that and that we where gaslighting her.

She has also called M manipulative to both me and R and then denied ever saying that when confronted. 

She also dead names me constantly even tho they don't write my old name in my journal ever since I changed it 2 years ago. So she had no excuse to make that ""mistake"".

Anyway, yesterday I managed to take a hold of B and told her all the things that have happened, including K violating HIPAA about other residents to me and was informed by B that she has never talked to my mom(already asked my mom so I knew that already) and she was horrified by K's behavior and that she was gonna have a talk to her today.

I have not talked to K since after confronting her about her lying with M and another caregiver and I'm frankly worried she is going to do something to my cat as revenge for it since the caregivers have keys to all the apartments and she obviously looks down on us residents

It’s been about a year since I ended things and she texts me a few times a month trying to get together for coffee or because the kids are asking where I’ve been. I’m in school so I haven’t had time but I also have a new relationship and she is aware of this. I’ve been trying to slowly distance myself and at the suggestion of my therapist I stopped responding to her texts. Now this is because when I ended things she continued to talk and act like we were still together and then several months later she “broke up” with me. I just let her do it and didn’t fight it because I thought that would finally end it. BTW she’s married (he was aware and involved) so she has plenty of support. 

My initial thought when I saw the obituary was that I should text her. But I’ve tried so hard to distance myself and set boundaries. I don’t want to go back to her thinking I’m still interested. 

When I was with them I was the dirty little secret that no one could know about. At first I was around all the time and felt like part of the family, but then I was invited to less and less. Then I couldn’t be around when family was there. The final straw was when I told my family I was spending Christmas with Jen and would see them the next day after work. She told me that day that I had to wait until the extended family went home which would be around 4pm. (For context I live an hour from them and had to be awake at 530 the next morning for work so I couldn’t spent the night). I asked at 6pm if I could head up. Nope not yet. At 9pm I got the all clear. I said no I was in bed since I spent Christmas alone waiting for my presence to be convenient.

He lived several hours away so I had to change schools and only saw my parents and other siblings every other weekend. This continued until I was 14 when my grandfather retired and we moved in with my family. I know that my parents feel really guilty about this. 

I have two half-siblings from my parents’ first marriages, ‘Lily’ \[37f\] and ‘Tim’ \[27m\]. It recently came up in conversation that throughout this period both were asked on a few occasions if Ryan and I could stay with them.

It seems unfair that we had to uproot our lives and our half-siblings did nothing to help us.

They both had their excuses, but it made me feel really abandoned and as if we didn’t matter to them, so I told them such. I told them that they robbed us of the chance of a childhood with our family because it wouldn’t have been easy for them and they were selfish for not trying to compromise.

I hang out with this group of 7th graders during lunch. Eventually, this one girl (let's call her Ashlie) started to have a crush on me. I didn't really like her and considered her more of a friend so I left it at that. But when her friends found out, they wouldn't leave me alone asking me if I liked her or not. When I didn't give them a response, they just automatically assumed I said yes, and that's what they told Ashlie. She ignored it and we continued to be friends. She was depressed so I helped her here and there. But, one day I put on my Snap story that anyone in my DM's could ask me one question and I would respond truthfully. So, Ashlie asks me if I really like her back. I sent her a small paragraph explaining how I think of her as a really great friend, and how we're in middle school and we're just experimenting with things. In the paragraph I go onto explain how she deserves a really good person, and that she's going to fall in love with someone some day that deserves her. So, after this message, she leaves me on read. She continues to unadd me and add me back, and then take 4 screenshots of my friendship profile. When I ask her why she did that, she said she never took the screenshots and doesn't know why snapchat said that. I ignored it.

Fast forward a few days, and I'm still mad at one of the girls (lets call her Ria) in our group of friend because she kept adding gasoline to the fire with the whole crush situation (spread rumours with us, annoying us with questions whether we like each other, etc.). One of her friends comes up to me and tells me to meet her in the quad after school and talk it out. While saying this, she accidentally blurts out something about the paragraph text I sent Ashlie. I asked her how she knew about that, and she went quiet and tried to walk away. I ran after her, and asked her how she knew about the text. I bugged her enough to tell me that Ashlie told her. So, I go to the quad after school (being pissed that she shared the text), and I ask Ria who knew about the text. She said everyone in the group knew because she showed them (around 7 people). And Ashlie could see I was mad, so she stood at a distance (I assume she read the text I sent her asking why she shared that text). When I asked her to come over to where we were discussing, she said no, so I brought the conversation over there. I asked her why she would show other people a private text I shared to her. She told me that she can show what she want's to her best friend. Keep in mind not everyone in that group is her ""best friend,"" only Ria. So, I tell her that she told more people than just her best friend. So, I turn my back for a second, and she runs off. I removed her contact.

Some background: since I've (16f) always struggled with interpersonal communication and school-related things, I thought it would be best to seek an official diagnosis of sorts. I say official because in the past, I've had a social worker—not a professional— diagnosis me with anxiety and depression, as well as a counselor I'd met with for a few months. Well, this was years ago, and nothing has come of it.

Since then, multiple people I've crossed—school nurses, veterans with diagnosis, others who have children with the disorders—and they all said I display similar behaviors and whatnot.

Because I'm an outcast and loner, I thought seeking professional help could benefit me. I only considered those, but as my friend  (call her P) got diagnosed with ADHD, she noticed atypical behaviors in me as well, only mine seemed to extend beyond hers. (I.e., an inability to socialize and what P perceived as a great distaste for it, nerves, over sensitivity, separation from our peers, obsessive tendencies, an ability to excell in subjects of interest yet lacking when uninterested.) 

From there, P had created a list. Long story short, we wound up with a symptoms list similar to those of ASD. Something clicked, so I discussed it with a school counselor after additional research to see if anything could be done. The counselor tried, but my parents were furious when they found out. They said I was perfectly fine and that I'd be wasting resources. They didn't see me as someone who struggled, but I've always been ostracized and picked on, and too good at hiding my oddities.

And I do see their side; prior to attending school, I'd already taught myself to read and entered kindergarten reading Harry Potter and the like, and was a pleasure to have in class . Only, I'd regularly throw fits at home, was an incredibly picky eater, and often got in trouble for my questions. People called my distressed noises and actions r4tard4d, so as I grew older, the more disturbing behaviors dwindled.
I still have moments where I can't control myself, and it's debilitating at times. My parents refused any sort of action and cursed at me. That was months ago, but they still snap at me, and after a harsh scolding today, I felt guilty about it and decided to post here.

I hang out with this group of 7th graders during lunch. Eventually, this one girl (let's call her Ashlie) started to have a crush on me. I didn't really like her and considered her more of a friend so I left it at that. But when her friends found out, they wouldn't leave me alone asking me if I liked her or not. When I didn't give them a response, they just automatically assumed I said yes, and that's what they told Ashlie. She ignored it and we continued to be friends. She was depressed so I helped her here and there. But, one day I put on my Snap story that anyone in my DM's could ask me one question and I would respond truthfully. So, Ashlie asks me if I really like her back. I sent her a small paragraph explaining how I think of her as a really great friend, and how we're in middle school and we're just experimenting with things. In the paragraph I go onto explain how she deserves a really good person, and that she's going to fall in love with someone some day that deserves her. So, after this message, she leaves me on read. She continues to unadd me and add me back, and then take 4 screenshots of my friendship profile. When I ask her why she did that, she said she never took the screenshots and doesn't know why snapchat said that. I ignored it.

Fast forward a few days, and I'm still mad at one of the girls (lets call her Ria) in our group of friend because she kept adding gasoline to the fire with the whole crush situation (spread rumours with us, annoying us with questions whether we like each other, etc.). One of her friends comes up to me and tells me to meet her in the quad after school and talk it out. While saying this, she accidentally blurts out something about the paragraph text I sent Ashlie. I asked her how she knew about that, and she went quiet and tried to walk away. I ran after her, and asked her how she knew about the text. I bugged her enough to tell me that Ashlie told her. So, I go to the quad after school (being pissed that she shared the text), and I ask Ria who knew about the text. She said everyone in the group knew because she showed them (around 7 people). And Ashlie could see I was mad, so she stood at a distance (I assume she read the text I sent her asking why she shared that text). When I asked her to come over to where we were discussing, she said no, so I brought the conversation over there. I asked her why she would show other people a private text I shared to her. She told me that she can show what she want's to her best friend. Keep in mind not everyone in that group is her ""best friend,"" only Ria. So, I tell her that she told more people than just her best friend. So, I turn my back for a second, and she runs off. I removed her contact. I feel that I opened up to her in that text and felt really uncomfortable that she shared it with other people.

We have been dating for almost 2 months. I just moved to a new city 3 months ago, new friend group, new school, everything. Most people in my class have know each other since childhood. I have joined a friend group that in which everyone’s known each other for long. In this group there’s a girl who we’ll call G who is also 15. She is my boyfriends best friend. No he doesn’t call her his girl best friend, because we agreed that’d be wrong, but he says she’s his closets friend. Today after school I was going to go to my boyfriend’s house, who happens to live really close to G. They showed me that they have a tradition in which every Friday they go in front of her house, talk for a while, and do a little handshake. My problem here is that the handshake involves the lyrics “will you be my boy my boy my boy”, a version from we fell in love in October. That is a love song. I know that they’ve had this tradition for years and that they’re friends. I also trust my bf, and I love him. The fact that it is a love song just makes me really uncomfortable though, but I don’t know if it is my place to tell him that.
