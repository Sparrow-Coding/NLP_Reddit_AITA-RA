The highlight of the day was when I drove to the shops in my city and bought myself some candy. Then I had to go to an expensive restaurant that I dont even like. The food isn't awful, but its not that good either. And every time we go there my grandmother throws a tantrum about something. This time it was even worse, she complained to the workers there about being sat at the ""wrong table"" and how they have a secret plot against specifically us AND after that she kept going on and on about how my interests are childish. After dinner we all went to our house to eat cake. The bakery we usually get our birthday cakes from didnt have any cake apparently so my grandmother got some from the grocery store. It was fine. My grandmother picked up my porcelain dog to look at it and dropped it and it broke. It was an antique that I spent a lot of tme searching for and a lot of money on.

It's not a school that I work for directly, but the school I work for rents their sports hall sometimes, so they let me get a staff membership. Aside from other staff members, the only other people that use the gym are students of the school, all between the ages of 11 and 17. The last few times I've been in the gym, a group of 3 lads has been in there, they look around 15 ish. They stay for at least 2 hours at a time, but tend to do very little.

My concern is what they're consuming before their workouts. Today I watched them take a 250mg caffiene pill each, which they were claiming to take every 4 hours until 7pm. They did some 10kg bicep curls for a singular set each, then decided their wrists were hurting so took a few painkiller tablets. Later, one of the boys was trying to take some 2-CB as well to ""aid with the workout"", and was getting angry because he'd forgotten to pack it.

For reference, I am a powerlifter and my preworkout consists of honey and a monster energy if I'm feeling extra saucy. Most of my friends are lifters and bodybuilders, two of my old housemates competed on a national level, but even the most intense ones won't take more than a scoop of preworkout and an energy drink.

The lads were claiming to have also worked out that morning for two hours. I know teenagers exaggerate, and they were doing very minimal hard exercise, but I do see them in the gym a LOT so I'd believe it. It seems that they're taking this cocktail of uppers and painkillers then spending multiple hours every day exercising (albeit not very hard). They were all very skinny and leaving 5 minutes at a time between light sets, so there is no way in HELL they need to be consuming that shit, I'm seriously worried about the harm they're doing to themselves at such a young age.

WIBTA if I reported them to a staff member? They do attend the school, but aside from talking about 2-CB and MDMA, I only saw them swallowing various pills that I wouldn't be able to identify. I don't want to be a Karen, but they're going to end up hurting themselves.

First of all, my mom died of cancer when I was 4 years old, my dad raised me on his own. 
When I was 7  he met a woman who I will call Laura. Laura also has a daughter a year older than me from a previous marriage. They got into a relationship, we eventually moved in with them and I had no problem in the beginning, I will even go as far as saying I liked her and I enjoyed having her daughter as a play buddy. They started arguing very often, most of the time it was either cheating allegations or fights about me and her daughter. Laura’s daughter was a very socially awkward child, she switched 3 schools because she kept getting bullied, parents would always complain that her behavior was “weird”, she didn’t understand basic social cues, did not know how to take care of herself (take showers, use deodorant, etc) her grades were always low and she was just struggling.

Laura wasn’t a very good parent, she never wanted to go to parent-teacher meetings cause she didn’t wanna put up with the other parents complains about her child, so she just sent my dad in her place; she would curse at her daughter, throw chairs at her, while I just cried in a corner horrified, she would not pay attention to her daughters hygiene nor her social issues. 

In their fights Laura would call me “manipulating”, saying I’m “the devils child”, she even got physical but my dad did not reciprocate. He eventually started telling me to not eat her food cause she might have poisoned it. 

When I was 10 she got pregnant after assuring him that she is not able to, kept the baby and they eventually broke up and I didn’t hear a word about her until last year when she called telling him she got cancer. My dad being sensitive to the subject, got back with her.  

Since then, he met his now 12 year old daughter who told him she would poison him, and her path until now is just as Laura’s first daughter, really low grades and social issues; he was diagnosed with HPV after having unprotected sex with her because she swore that now she REALLY can’t get pregnant (she blames it on him, saying he had it first and gave it to her), her ex husband frequently sleeps at her place and she somehow gaslighted my dad into thinking that’s ok, called him a psychopath and a failure in life (even though he has great accomplishments while she has none), it got so bad that he kept coming to me asking if I really think that she’s right and asking me for advice. 

Told him numerous times to keep me out of it, that I’m not interested since he refuses to listen to me anyway and I got to the point where only thinking about Laura would trigger a panic attack. 

He keeps calling me “evil” because she has cancer and I’m “insensitive” for refusing to even listen to him and for not supporting their relationship.

Being the big sis that I am, offered to give her a line on my plan. Told her plans start at 40. Knowing that she didnt have money for a new phone, I mailed her my old iPhone. One less thing for her to pay for. She was literally only paying for the line itself, not the taxes, not the upgrade fees, not the insurance, NOTHING! I didn’t mind because I was in the military, made decent pay. Year and a half later, we switch to a different company because i was getting out the military and trying to save money wherever I could. I didn’t want to keep paying a 220 bill that she was only giving 40 on. We talked about it and she agreed that we should switch because her service sucked and hopefully it will be better with the new company. After switching, we had 3 months without a bill because of the gift cards we received for switching. Sep 1, she doesn’t send me any money. I reminded her, she sends me 60. I potentially reminded her that her bill is 105 not 60. 2 weeks later she sends the rest. 
Oct 1, she doesn’t pay for her bill again. She’s not answering the phone nor responding to ANY of my messages or the requests I sent her for her bill. I went to look at the usage on her line. She’s still making/receiving calls/text. Oct 25 I disconnect her line after reaching out with no response.
Nov 1 , get charged for her line again (line active in Oct). I request the money for her line, no response. I went to the company to see what it would cost and what I needed to do to get the line removed. They said I would have to pay $675 (remaining balance on her iphone) + $200 (gift card she received to switch) + $101.75 (my new bill) on my next bill Jan 1st. I reached out on Snapchat and told her that since she’s not going to pay her bill to at least send me the phone back because I have to pay for it and don’t want to feel like I just threw 875 away (not including her 2 months of bill I paid). After being ignored for over a month she finally replied and said that I was the one ignoring her, I FORCED her to switch knowing she couldn’t afford it, I turned off her phone without saying anything to her first, the phone is paid off and she doesn’t owe me 675 (nor the other fees I have to pay) and that if I want the phone, I need to pay for the shipping and she’ll send it. 
I screenshot our message thread and the bill for her line and messaged them to her on Snapchat. She opened the message, screenshot it and didn’t respond. Now I have a 976.75 phone bill that I have to pay in Jan. I only have 1 source of income which is my VA disability. That bill is going to eat up 30% of my income for that month.

This is a park I've been coming to since I was a kid and although I know its vandalism and some people might think it just makes places uglier, I think it can also bring a level of intrigue to a place. For instance there is an artist in my town that ive started to notice his art all over the place, and I get a little joy when I see his character unexpectedly. 

After I painted my own little character, someone rode by on their bike and stopped. I instantly felt guilty. They had stopped and I knew I was ""caught""... all I could think to do was get out of there asap. I think how I may be the asshole is that I wasn't willing to really talk to this guy, I was just trying to leave. 

He clearly was against the graffiti. He asked if I had just done that. I said yes. He said my art sucks. I said ""thanks"" sarcastically and kept walking.

I kept walking... he said ""do you really have nothing better to do"" I said ""im just going home man""... i didn't know what to say.

I drove home and realized that if I responded differently maybe it could've gone better. If I was able to just talk to him. My first impression was he seemed like an interesting guy who id like to talk to or be friends with, but I just felt guilty from the jump. I decided to go back and paint over all the graffiti with a clear color and just cover it up. Maybe he'll see it.

I said if that was the case and they wanted to go i was unsure why they asked me if their mind was already made up. They then said they were sorry if they had upset me, but said i was being sharp and they thought it could be a compromise. I said i thought it was unfair to ask me to make the decision as it puts me in the position of choosing between being a partner who keeps them from their friends , or wasting my mums money and having to pretend i’m okay with them dipping early on a trip that is important to me and my family, so they can hang out with people they see every day. If they wanted to go, i couldn’t stop them but i also wouldn’t act as if i wasn’t hurt by the situation. They said if that was how i felt they would stay for the whole trip. 

Now i feel as if i’m holding them hostage and this will cause a rift between us, but i don’t see another way to handle this other than suck it up and pretend i changed my mind and am okay with them not being there for the whole trip, but maybe i should as the date mix up was no one’s fault. on the other hand, even if they had known the dates months ago, neither my birthday nor the work party could be changed, and i would still want my partner to chose me who they haven’t seen in a month over friends that are local.

He is a great human &amp; he definitely could have left when I decided to keep our first daughter. I am grateful that he didn’t but I also did not want him to live a life he didn’t want.

They are nice enough, but I always feel like a bit of an outsider. 

My husband left his ex because of her drug issues and things went downhill from there for her. His daughter lived with us. 

I think her family prefers to remember her in the days they were together, so they still treat him like he is their daughter's husband, though until her death we rarely saw then, as he and his ex pretty much hated eachother.  

Since her death, his daughter(who lives on her own now) has put pictures of her all over our house, as well as some of her ashes, that sit on our fireplace mantle. 

Her family has highly discouraged my husband and I from having kids of our own because it will upset his daughter to ""replace"" the family they had. 

It feels like every major thing in our lives have a ""but ex died"" clause. 

Couldn't take a better paying job out if state because ""ex died and daughter needs us"", though we only see her occasionally, as she is doing the friends/college thing. Can't have our own kids because ""ex died"". Have to go to holidays with her family because ""ex died, gotta support the kid"".

I was working as a tour guide for a retired millionaire’s private antique collection that he opened to the public during the day. The house was built in the mid 1800’s and had a storied past. For anonymity’s sake I won’t say the name, but it bore the surname of an infamous US Vice President associated with horrible mistreatment of minorities.

The thing is, the VP never lived there, having died several years before its construction. One of his descendants married into family that owned the house, hence the name. However, many tourists travelled from across the country to see the house thinking it belonged to said VP; some people admire him in spite of his evil deeds.

So here’s what happened:

One day a woman came by to take a tour. She didn’t seem very educated, but I was happy to teach her about some history. I gave her the full 50 minute tour of the house and its wonders from every corner of the globe spanning several millennia. I always began each tour with the history of the house, which included dispelling the rumors that the VP had ever lived there.

At the end of the tour, the woman followed me down to the cashier desk and angrily asked for a full refund. I kindly asked if she could enlighten me with a reason for the refund. She said I had tricked her into seeing the house because I never spoke about the VP. I told her that I had, in fact spoken about him in the beginning of the tour. In addition, the owner had a room “dedicated” to the VP in a hilariously disrespectful manner, with the VP’s bust in the window surrounded on all sides by art depicting and created by the minorities he had so horrendously treated; like a mausoleum of shame. I reminded her about the room.

She exclaimed that I hadn’t done any of the above and that we had defaced a great American hero’s home with foreign garbage. We had a rather untoward back and forth, with her making a number of ignorant and borderline racist comments and me making a few passive aggressive jabs at her intelligence, until she furiously stormed to the door. Before she left, she wheeled around and asked if I had any suggestions of a place in this city that would give her a better experience.

I said, “You’re welcome to visit the local library.” She left.

At the end of the day, the owner came storming in and said he’d gotten a complaint about what happened. I explained the situation, but he ended up firing me.

Now I’m not mad at the owner. I respect him a ton and we occasionally keep in contact. Technically, the owner’s policy was to offer a refund to everyone regardless of the situation. It was his house, his rules; I knew that and chose to die on that hill given the circumstances. Maybe it was my pride; I just didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of her unabashed ignorance.

Tonight, we were making dinner, and doing ""fend for yourself night"" (think leftovers but you can also eat sandwiches and such). I decide that I want to do a sandwich, so I get the ingredients out, but the cheese I want (a nice soft garlic cheese) has only enough for one sandwich, so I confirm

Me: ""Hey Mom, you cool if I eat this?""
Mom: ""Yeah go ahead""

So I put my bread in the toaster oven as the rest of my family makes their food. I cut the cheese while I wait for it to toast, and I give my 12M brother, Toby, a small piece of cheese so he could try it. (He had some of the cheese before, I just like giving him food. IDK why.)

Now, Toby is pescatarian, so my mom jokes with him saying ""That dish you just ate had chicken broth haha."" Toby knows better, but he still checks the package out of curiosity. I had thrown the packaging away, so I went and took the package out of the trash to look.

I turn around to see that Toby had eaten a piece of cheese off my plate. I look at him and go ""Hey, what the hell?"" and he says that our mom told him to. He begins to apologize, when I say ""No, it's not your fault, Mom told you to do that and it was a dick move."" She got pissed at me for 'disrespecting' her and we go back and forth.

She comes over to my plate with the cheese on it and takes it off, putting it on the other side of the counter, saying ""If its that big of a deal, now you don't get any."" She turned her back to get something out of the fridge, and my brain decided that it wanted to be petty. When she came back, I had eaten the cheese. She looks at Toby, and says ""Did you eat it?"", kinda chuckling while she said it. But when I say that I had eaten it instead, she starts yelling at me saying that this is her house and she won't be disrespected in it, and that my tone of voice is being rude, blah blah blah. Toby defends me, saying that she was the one who raised her voice first, and that I was simply matching. I also said that ""Hey, you're forcing me to pay rent, so it's also my house too and I should get a say.""

We begin eating and my mom is still in the kitchen, making her food. She throws the final piece of cheese at us, saying ""Here, one of you eat this."", but it falls on the floor. Toby and I both refuse, but my mom says ""You've eaten things off the floor before!"" (True, but not CHEESE.) My 8 year old brother then asks if he can have it, and I say he can, but my mom comes and says ""You don't need to eat that"" and throws it away. While doing so, she made some snarky comment about what I did, and I said ""I'm over it and done talking about it, you're the one still going.""

We ate our dinner in close to silence, and I went downstairs to the basement room to write this. I don't know, I feel like I'm TA for disrespecting her? I feel weird about it but she does things like this often.

It was a nice gesture and I did need it. A few months after though, a family friend got into an accident. She only got $1000 insurance check and my mom called and asked if I would want to let her buy the car. (It’s not worth much) I would’ve kept the money and since I have another vehicle it would be fine. I decided not to do it cause I felt the car would break down to soon. Since my boyfriend works at a car shop it’s easier and cheaper for us to fix it. It would’ve been different for her, and more expensive. Anyways, when I told my boyfriend about the conversation. He said “your moms the worst. Don’t take anything from her, she’s a India giver.” So obviously I stood up for her and said “no she’s not taking anything, she was asking if this was something I would want to do. &amp; I said no so.” He then said “whatever, that’s just shitty,  not something a GOOD mom would do.” I let my anger speak for me and said “let’s not talk about who has a good mom and who doesn’t!” I immediately regretted it, and apologized.

My brother, José, 32 years old, came out the closet about 5 years ago, my parents did not like. they did not throw him out of the house, but they did not accept his orientation and they considered it something temporary, something that could be chosen, in defense of my parents, they were raised under a strong Christian belief that they tried to instill in us with no success.

I always had a good relationship with my brother, I couldn't care less about his orientation because he was always my beloved brother and I thought he thought the same until one day my father discovered my brother with another man at home when they returned early from a meeting of work. There was a strong argument in which my brother voluntarily left home (admitted by him) since he could not stand my parents' homophobia.

I would like to clarify that in my country it is normal to live at the parent's house until getting married, since my brother had never been married, he had never left home until that day, when he was 27 years old; he he contributed with the household bills and with the housework.

I tried to keep in touch, but since I didn't cut off contact with my parents, he told me that I was also the problem for not stopping them. I tried to remind him that when he revealed his homosexuality, I continued to treat him the same and that he talked to my parents so that they could understand my brother. However, he told me that if I didn't break up with my parents I wouldn't have a relationship with him again and by not giving him an answer he excluded me.

Almost 3 years passed and he contacted me to tell me that he had forgiven me and that he wanted to meet me, after an afternoon conversation with José he told me that he needed a guarantee to request a loan for a house, I refused, I told him that He did not have to forgive me and he had killed our relationship by coercing me and leaving my life, that I felt used, I left while he cursed me and he has not stopped calling me and leaving me voice notes about how I am garbage for not wanting to help him and get back into his life once he was ready to forgive me.

So I buy a lot of vintage designer clothes on ebay, thrift a lot for good quality clothes, and sometimes will buy fake designer bags. But even the fakes I get are still great quality bags, like made-to-order, hundreds of dollars, real leather, nice metal hardware that holds up. The differences are honestly so nitpicky, you'd need two bags side by side and a magnifying glass.

It's crazy talented workmanship regardless, and tbh I'm paying more towards the people actually doing the labor than I would if I bought from a designer. I shop direct from the manufacturer, and have chatted with the people making my bag when I've placed custom orders, both to ask about their processes and quality control, and to kinda check up on the working conditions / ethics. And quite a few of the workers come from working in the brand's factories but make better money making dupes, apparently. 

But that context aside... I was traveling for work to NYC, and I brought a fake Birkin bag. I work as an engineer, and this older guy at the new york office started making rude comments at an after work happy hour, like saying ""That's a really expensive bag for a young lady.. especially to be putting on the floor like that?"" 

Now normally I just tell people all my fashion is secondhand or dupes, like I literally don't buy into that financially irresponsible shit, and I couldn't imagine spending twice what my damn car cost on a bag but I'm still trying to look cute and professional. 

But this guy was getting on my nerves so I was like ""Oh, Is it expensive?"" 

He said it was, and asked if I'd spent like half my salary on it... Which, rude! Like I don't even know this guy and he's asking me about my money? And also assuming I'm super underpaid..

So I just went ""Oh, it was a gift from my ex"" 

He incredulously went like ""And he's your EX?"" 

I was like""Yeah, he was kinda a dick honestly, we only dated for a few months, he was as entitled as you'd expect from a 'daddy's money' kid."" 

The dude was just acting incredulous and was like ""You dated for a few MONTHS and he spent 20 grand on it?"" 

I was like ""Twenty grand? Damn I should have put it on Ebay before I let it get this worn out"" 

I was kinda having a laugh at how much this guy was getting pissed off for seemingly no reason? Like I really don't know what he was mad at, it all seemed like none of his business. 

So when he started talking again, I literally got the giggles. And that made him more pissed off, until I literally just walked away. 

I feel kinda bad for lying and laughing at the guy, but it's also like.. he was in my business for no reason?

I play a mobile game, one of those where you train troops, gather resources and strengthen your empire. You join other people in guilds and work together with people in the same world/server to complete against other in different servers. 

Over the past few months, one of the biggest issues on the server I play has been people gathering 90% of the resources from a tile. And then leaving the rest. These tiles won’t go away until someone cleans them up. This is a major pet peeve of mine, and about a week or two ago an argument broke out on discord between son from my guild, and a bunch of people from another guild. 

The leader of that guild contacted me, and I handled the situation with the person from my guild. But while talking with the leader, I made a comment about how i preferred the way their predecessor used to handle people who left resource tiles, a conversation I thought was just between me an that leader. 

Well last night, something happened with the game, and 4 tiles I was gathering on came back early without finishing the tile. When this was brought to my attention, I immediately apologized and send my marches out to clean up. 

Then I start getting accused of doing it on purpose, and the whole other guild was saying I was trying to make a point because of the conversation I had with the leader. I thought that was just friends talking/venting and wasn’t expecting it to be shared, so what kinda point would I be making when only one person knew my opinion? 

Now I’m pissed at my friends for sharing a convo I thought was was just between us. I’m pissed that the other alliance public accused me of doing it on purpose (about 20% of them where originally from my guild and moved over the last 4 or 5 months cause the other guild is stronger and manages the way the state is run, so those people should know me better) and because it was done in a public manner instead of coming to me in my DMs about it.

Years ago, we met through work, both of us are in our 60s now. Despite living having lived in different cities for the past decade or so- we've managed to stay in touch. To be frank, the majority of our recent interactions have been me acting as a shoulder to cry as she worked through the grief of losing her husband

Let's call her Ann for anonymity's sake.

In the past couple years' Ann has taken up marathoning, has a new bike, wetsuit, etc. While she has always been relatively body conscious, I've noticed in our more recent interactions is her increasing fixation- bordering on obsession- when it comes to all that involves weight, appearance, and one's figure. She constantly comments on other people's bodies, speculates on their weight, and offers unsolicited opinions on her thoughts about other people's looks, as well as a non-stop appraisal of her own figure. 

On our most recent visit, she commented 3 separate times that her 11-year-old step-granddaughter ""has a cute little figure.""  After the 3rd time, I couldn't bite my tongue any longer. I told her that ""while I'm sure that she meant it as a compliment, comments like hers that actually sexualized the child...""

I went on to share that most girls have body-positivity struggles and that it's really never ok to comment on others' bodies- especially *children*.  I wondered aloud if she had ""ever talked about me that way to others..."" and if she ""ever commented on her grandsons' bodies?""

  She didn't respond to a thing I said. Rather, she lost her temper, stating that she had been bulimic in her past, and couldn't say ""*anything right*"" in front of me.  While I am used to accommodating Ann's extra-thin skin, her rude (and honestly dramatic) reaction was truly hurtful. I remained calm, and informed Ann that I ""felt hurt that I couldn't share where I was coming from."" To that, she replied that she ""didn't want to talk about it.""

Fast Forward 3 weeks:  Ann has now just invited me to a week at her timeshare in the Virgin Islands.  She has not addressed anything since our last (extremely negative) interaction. I really don't want to go and real talk- feel extremely uncomfortable and judged by Ann when it's inevitably time for us to change into our swimsuits.

Im small in frame and over the last week or so my bump has really popped out so maternity clothes that fit me at 34 weeks are now super tight around my bump. Anyone whose been pregnant can tell you that wearing clothes that dont fit around your bump comfortably can be really uncomfortable. While my maternity clothes still just fit me and cover my bump properly,  my pyjamas do not fit properly which has resulted in me having the pants just below my bump and the top sitting above my bump so im comfortable and not feeling squished in my pyjamas. Also i accidentally repierced my belly button after a 2 day hospital visit (it was out for less than 48 hours and the pregnancy bar went back in first try with no issues so i didnt think it has healed up yet) my belly button has been super sore for the last few days so having tight clothes rub against it hurts even more.

Now my house is on a slight hill so the only people who can see in my house are the two neighbours directly across and thats only if they are looking in from there top floor bedroom windows. Otherwise i have a hedge that gives privacy from their bottom floor windows and you cant see in from the street. I have also not long moved here (about 4 weeks) so while i have net curtains up i do not have proper curtains up yet, they are not on my priority list right now as im literally about to pop so can wait as my house has privacy apart from those 2 windows across the street

Today i had a knock on my door from my neighbour, shes mentioned how in the night she has seem me walk around my living roon with my bump out and that it makes her uncomfortable to look at, i explained 1. How i walk around my house is my business, especiallly since all i want to be right now is comfortable, 2. My pyjamas dont fit me at this moment in time so its the only way to wear my pyjamas. She said i should buy new maternity pyjamas if mine dont fit me and i should be mindful of what others can see. I thanked her for letting me know that she looks into my house but im not spending money on new pyjamas for the sake of a few weeks, i also let her know that im going to be breastfeeding my child so if she doesnt like my belly being out then she really isnt going to like whats to come.

*She's looking for sincere responses. Much thanks in advance &lt;3*

&amp;#x200B;

A recently widowed, long-time friend of mine recently stayed with me for several days. Years ago, we met through work, both of us are in our 60s now. Despite living having lived in different cities for the past decade or so- we've managed to stay in touch. To be frank, the majority of our recent interactions have been me acting as a shoulder to cry as she worked through the grief of losing her husband

&amp;#x200B;

Let's call her Ann for anonymity's sake.

In the past couple years' Ann has taken up marathoning, has a new bike, wetsuit, etc. Her whole life seems to revolve around ""fitness"" now. While she has always been relatively body conscious, I've noticed in our more recent interactions is her increasing fixation- bordering on obsession- when it comes to all that involves weight, appearance, and one's figure. She constantly comments on other people's bodies, speculates on their weight, and offers unsolicited opinions on her thoughts about other people's looks, as well as a non-stop appraisal of her own figure.

On our most recent visit, she commented 3 separate times that her 11-year-old step-granddaughter ""has a cute little figure.""  After the 3rd time, I couldn't bite my tongue any longer. I told her that ""while I'm sure that she meant it as a compliment, comments like hers that actually sexualized the child...""

I went on to share that most girls have body-positivity struggles and that it's really never ok to comment on others' bodies- especially *children*.  I wondered aloud if she had ""ever talked about me that way to others..."" and if she ""ever commented on her grandsons' bodies?""

  She didn't respond to a thing I said. Rather, she lost her temper, stating that she had been bulimic in her past, and couldn't say ""*anything right*"" in front of me.  While I am used to accommodating Ann's extra-thin skin, her rude (and honestly dramatic) reaction was truly hurtful. I remained calm, and informed Ann that I ""felt hurt that I couldn't share where I was coming from."" To that, she replied that she ""didn't want to talk about it.""

Fast Forward 3 weeks:  Ann has now just invited me to a week at her timeshare in the Virgin Islands.  She has not addressed anything since our last (extremely negative) interaction. I really don't want to go and real talk- feel extremely uncomfortable and judged by Ann when it's inevitably time for us to change into our swimsuits.

We do not split credit card payments because he doesn't want to share that information with me.

Curiosity took the best of me, and I ended up pulling dozen of articles about how this is a fair way to split bills. I told him, and he got pissed at me, saying he could not afford to pay more than me; because he “budget” his leftover money to have at least 80 dollars for his daily spending.

The courts said she can stay at the apartment Airbnb but the husband keeps renting it and my sister keeps allowing it to be rented.  When rented she stays at the vacation community Airbnb which is in a few hours away.

I (20f) have been in a serious relationship with my bf (23m) for 2 years. We go to university together in a different country than I grew up in.

The problem is when we go to my country on breaks, my parents don’t let us sleep together in the same bedroom. He sleeps in the guest bedroom. They are religious and it goes against their morals. I also have a younger sibling and they’re concerned about the example I will set. They’ve expressed that they love my bf (they’ve met him many times before) but they just don’t want us sleeping together under their roof.

I think I am a responsible adult (good student, don't do drugs, etc) and they should trust that they’ve raised me well enough to make my own decisions. I do not want to sleep in the same bedroom to have sex, but because I enjoy the intimacy of cuddling while we sleep. Also, we’re not in a financial position to get married in the foreseeable future so I don’t want to keep sleeping separately for the next 5+ years whenever I visit home.

B and I shared a room (said room is A's sister's room, who lives in another state currently). Both B and I have boyfriends, and they would both come over. If my boyfriend was over, she would typically go into another room, and I'd offer the same courtesy. However, my boyfriend would clean any mess he made, mostly fast-food wrappers or otherwise, while B's boyfriend wouldn't. B also had a habit of leaving trash around and not picking up after herself, which once resulted in a moldy cup of peaches being found and promptly thrown out by me. B also had two cats.

It wasn't our room, technically, and I was tired of being surrounded by messes. Before A and I left to hang out with some friends, I wrote down some ""room rules"" with the help of A that I wanted both B and I to follow. The rules were as follow: 1. Clean up any mess we/our boyfriends make, or else they will not be allowed over. 2: The cats cannot sleep in the room at night, because one of them keeps knocking my TV off of the shelf every night. 3: Get rid of any food, finished or not, that is in the room once you are done with it.

I would argue that those are simple rules, and common courtesy to expect of a roommate. A received a text from B while we were hanging out, where B said that we wouldn't have to worry about it anymore because she was moving out. The only place B had to go was back to living with her abusive family, which I felt horrible about because while she frustrated me at times, she didn't deserve to go back to that.

She got under my skin, which I regret.

My mom moved back to her hometown, had me, and never saw a penny in child support. He officially divorced my mom when I was 8 and introduced me to my sister. Me and my sister have never been close. We had very different backgrounds. She had privilege,I was the scapegoat, the dumbass and the motive of their jokes. 

I was expected to suck it up if she hit me, or made me cry, or ruined a special occasion, like when she tore up my dress trying to put it on and couldn't wear it for my birthday. Or when she brushed her hair with my toothbrush and I got grounded for yelling at her. 

I was often invited for Christmas and had my presents taken away if my sister wanted them. 

I never told my mom because I didn't want any problems, but she found out and she was supportive of me cutting ties, which I did at 22.

I'm happy with my career, I'm successful and I can say I'm close to being considered wealthy.
My sister went to an Ivy League University. For years, I was told that she worked for the UN. They lived about this, for no reason.  

I was stupid enough to extend the olive branch and try and help her and try to make amends after over a decade. That was a mistake.I found out that she graduated but hasn't had a real job in 20 years.
 
I took a step back when my father sent me a long email.
In a nutshell, he wanted me to replicate my achievements (media, contacts) to put everything in her service AND pay for it. 

I recently got married. Unfortunately, someone found out and sent my father some information.  

At some point, she expressed an idea of my wedding which is erroneous, like ""I hoarded all the good opportunities"". My wedding was a family event, not a b2b, nor a social platform. She said our entire family hated me, and that the only reason I didn't invite them is because of social convenience. I didn't expect my entire family to judge me for not inviting them.

I kept ignoring my sister's calls until she got on my nerve. She accused me of causing intense feelings of loneliness. She put me on speaker ""so her fiance could hear what kind of a witch I am"". I told her fiancee that he was being a fool for making a lifetime commitment to someone so miserable, so hateful and so petty, and to be ready to have to financially support her because she hasn't had a real occupation in ages.

He sent me and my entire family an email and broke the news that the engagement was off. He cited he cannot marry into a family of conflict where siblings can't stand each other.

I don't like my sister, but I wasn't trying to destroy her relationship. 
I feel like I got carried away and this is the end result. I know she's not a good person, but maybe I should have kept my mouth shut and this wouldn't have happened. I did hear she required medical attention after her breakup. The person who told me wouldn't lie.

ann currently has 4 children (3, 7, 10, 14), all of them are girls, ann and her husband only wanted 2 children originally but they wanted a boy and a girl, so now they’re 4 children down the line and none of them are the gender that they want. i don’t exactly know what their financial situation is (ann is a nurse and her husband got honourably discharged from the military.) but i do know that their house is not big enough for their kids (kids usually share rooms, toys are commonly thrown out due to clutter, the whole family can’t fit in 1 room, etc.)

i usually buy all the kids in my 2-3 christmas presents because the holiday is mostly for them, they are my little cousins and i only have 5 (ann’s kids and my uncles stepson, none of my dad’s other siblings had children.) + i buy the pets gifts too, but that’s more for the kids as well. my aunt had her wedding party this weekend where she announced to us that she was going to try and have a baby again, everyone was a bit shocked but happy but that all changed when i asked her if she was going to get a part of her house converted or if she was going to move (the bedrooms can’t fit anymore kids.) she just brushed off all my questions and said that “god always finds a way.”

today i was doing my christmas shopping for the kids and because of the cost of living crisis, it very easily went over £200 and nearly crippled me financially, i then started doing more math and i figured out that with this new baby and the cost of living rising, that i could not afford christmas for 5 kids, a dog, 2 guinea pigs and a hamster (if she didn’t get any more pets after the baby as well) so i called up my aunt and told her that if she has this new baby, then i will only have to give her kids one present this christmas and ann and her husband we’re definitely not happy about this.

my family and ann’s family have been calling me non stop and saying that i’m an asshole, that i should’ve minded my own business and let ann do whatever she wanted, my uncle is also grilling me and asking me if i’m only gonna get his son one present and i really don’t know the answer to that. all of this pressure is building up on me so i want to know, aita for telling my aunt that i won’t buy her kids + pets more than 1 christmas gift if she has another child?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4838435,public,top,self,AITA for saying to my aunt that i’m only gonna get her kids one present this christmas if she has another baby?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z888sj/aita_for_saying_to_my_aunt_that_im_only_gonna_get/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I saw him looking at me a few times and his face was always mad. He has the right to be mad because I wasn't the best girlfriend and I should have told him about my suspicions sooner.

His parents (63F and 71M) and sister (42F) were being evicted at the time, and MIL asked to move in with us for 2 weeks and then, since it's easier renting a place in the countryside, they'd move right away. Less than 10 minutes living together his sister informed us they'd need 3-4 months to leave and started laying down rules (do not go to the kitchen or bathroom after 10pm, she didn't want to upset downstairs neighbors, she wanted a fresh start, she was a light sleeper, our daughter couldn't cry, so on).

We argued, of course. MIL took her side, and then we started living in hell. Before I proceed, I must admit my husband had told me several times his sister was ""deranged"", she must have some kind of mental issue, and I always thought he was exagerating, but boy was I wrong.  
His sister developed the habit of staring at me angrily whenever I left my bedroom (she was sleeping in our living room, MIL and FIL were sleeping in our daughter's bedroom). She'd loudly spew sh\*t about me so I'd hear her anywhere inside the apartment. She'd have a melt-down whenever my daughter cried wanting to go back to the old apartment. I'm not kidding, she'd start screaming and crying if our daughter shed a single tear, asking her mom to make us discipline her, and MIL joined the band wagon saying we were bad parents and our daughter was crying because we were not firm enough with her (WTH woman?). They both started calling our daughter names (like sissy, crybaby, spoiled baby, etc) and I drew the line the day I caught SIL trying to restrain my daughter from running to me when I got back home from the supermarket and telling her ""baby, you're not supposed to go to her, go only to daddy!""

We're living sepparately now. I set rules about visiting - they can't step foot into our home, our daughter can visit them on weekends only, Saturday OR Sunday, and no sleepovers. My husband needs to be with her at all times, never leave her alone with MIL or SIL, but I'm still scared SIL would find a way to ""teach"" my daughter bad things. Recently my daughter developed some speaking habits that are just like SIL, and when I pointed it out to my husband he looked like a cartoon character who'd just seen a ghost - and changed topics.

I (16F) am dropped off and picked up from my Dad (39M )for school. Honestly, my school is tiring. It’s not even the schoolwork most of the time, its the obnoxious, loud, disgusting students. But I manage. Point is, im drained after school. 

I used to take naps once I got home. But my Dad was mad at that because it would end up in me going to bed around 11pm. So he wants me to stay up. “Just do, something!” I have nothing to do. Apparently scrolling on TikTok isn’t an option. I can’t watch TV or stay in the living either. My Dad is always playing a game or smoking 🌿, asking me to leave when he does so. He doesn’t want me to just stay on my phone or play with my cat. He wants me to do chores or homework. 

Heres the kicker though. He doesnt work. He only works on the weekends and even then it’s from 5pm-11pm. Btw, not a stable job. Delivery driver. He drives me to school, comes back home, sleeps and plays games and smokes till it’s time to pick me up. Does he do chores? No. 

Today, I get home after another lecture telling me basically to not go to sleep once we get home. We get home and I drop off my stuff in my room. I go to the kitchen and pull up a show on my phone. I’m standing next to the sink snacking on a cookie. He sees me and yells my name. I look at him and he asks “what are you doing?” I assumed I was in his way so I moved without saying nothing. He said “If you’re not going to be doing anything, do the dishes, they’re piling up” I looked at him. “Are you serious? I just got back from school” He raises his voice, “But you’re clearly not doing nothing. So do them.” I kinda snapped. I said “You’ve been here all day! Why do I have to do them? You literally just stood here for like 8 hours, and you added to the pile, you couldn’t do them?” He said he was busy. I said getting high and playing GTA is not “doing something” He yelled at me and sent me to my room.

She called me up to ask for some advice, because she didn't know if what \*she\* did was right or wrong. My nephew was recently heartbroken over a girl he met on a dating app, and my sister wanted to make him feel better by finding him a better girlfriend or someone to take his mind off of the pain. She created an account under his name, made a whole profile and started swiping to see if anyone was a good fit. Keep in mind that she did this according to her own preferences, not her son (though that doesn't help her case much). She told me about how she paid like, at least $50 on extra fees to keep swiping on the dating app he had been using.

Because I'm not always updated on her family, I asked if it was okay for her to tell me what happened with my nephew and this girl (35F) he met online. Apparently, he had been talking to her for almost a year now. They met on a dating app and had been talking ever since. He was absolutely enamored by her, and the feelings were seemingly mutual for the most part. It wasn't until a couple months ago that she found out she was pregnant and almost due. Knowing this, she withheld that information from my nephew until after her new child was born. My older sister found out and was absolutely furious, and took matters into her own hands when her son wouldn't break up with her after she had a child with another man. She had her Facebook and started telling her about how badly she broke her son's heart, how she's a terrible person for even having a dating app downloaded on her phone when there was someone else, etc. In the end, she got blocked and asked if I could find her Instagram so that she could further give her a piece of her mind.

At this point I was pretty mad as well, but at the same time I felt as if she had meddled with his life enough. She likes to be active in her kid's lives, but my nephew is 20 now. Sure, he's taking his first steps into the world as an adult but that doesn't change the fact that he's still an adult and can make his own decisions and should be able to do so without his mom around.

In the end, I investigated her online presence and found that she had actually been with the other guy for way more than a year. She has an entire career, a man, and now a child. They even had matching dates in their bios, with links to each other's Instagrams. And at what point did my nephew believe would be a good place to stop? Even after he was informed of all that I found he still insisted that he wanted to be with her. It felt like I was doing too much, because I was planning on sending screenshots of my nephew and said girl's conversations to her baby's dad. But I didn't, and instead left it up to my sister to do what she would with the information.

My mother (43) was unsure if she wanted children, but still made the choice to have me. She and my father were never married and separated when she was pregnant with me. I never permanently lived with her - I was living with my great aunt and grandmother until I was 19, when I moved into an apartment by myself.

My mother started dating someone who was a severe alcoholic and became an alcoholic herself. She would occasionally drop by to visit me and my grandmother or great aunt, sometimes while shit-faced drunk. One night when I was 15 and she was drunk, she called me and told me I was an accident she shouldn't have had. I cut contact with her and my great aunt (who I was living with at the time) didn't allow my mother to visit.

I didn't talk to her until a week ago, when she contacted me and told me to call her. She said she wanted to make amends for things she had done in her past, so I called her. She told me she was sorry for being such a shitty mother and she should have been there for me instead of drinking. She broke down crying after I reminded her she told me I was an accident when I was still technically a child. She told me to have some mercy on her since she was young and stupid and that she wouldn't be able to forgive herself if I didn't accept her apology.

I didn't know what to say and without thinking, I told her she was an immature and selfish person. I told her if she was truly sorry, she should have asked to talk in person instead of calling. She proceeded to tell me that she wouldn't have been able to properly apologize in person as she would have cried the whole time, but I told her to quit making excuses for her behavior. I told her I wouldn't accept any apologies of hers unless she apologized in person. She told me that if I was going to be so immature about an apology, then maybe I didn't deserve one. She then hung up.

I felt guilty and tried calling her the next day, but she denied the call and sent a text telling me I was the immature and selfish one, not her. I want a chance to actually speak with her, but I feel I might have completely fucked up.

So there is 4 of us including me where I have to ask the guy in front of me and he has to answer then the guy infront of me askes the other person Infront of him and so on.
Now there was this girl that I asked her questions that are slightly advance but still easy to answer if you studied a little  (mind you that I studied very hard for this test and using complicated sentences increases your score a lot) 
She couldn't answer and proceeded to blame me for making her lose some points on her test 
I didn't make a fuss about it because I didn't see it as a big deal I just told her that I studied really hard for this and I'm giving it my all 
She started shouting Infront of all the students in the hall after the test ended and saying that I'm an asshole because I got her to fail her test further more she started lecturing me and telling me how I should be considerate of other people.
I looked at her with the most cold look ever and told her how about you start putting in some actual effort instead of blaming others for your shortcomings and instead of lecturing me on how to be lazy and useless you could've asked me for some tips that might help but here you are just a failed nobody putting the blame on anyone but your self.

Honestly, my school is tiring. It’s not even the schoolwork most of the time, its the obnoxious, loud, disgusting students. But I manage. Point is, im drained after school. 
I used to take naps once I got home. But my Dad was mad at that because it would end up in me going to bed around 11pm. So he wants me to stay up. “Just do, something!” I have nothing to do. Apparently scrolling on TikTok isn’t an option. I can’t watch TV or stay in the living either. My Dad is always playing a game or smoking 🌿, asking me to leave when he does so. He doesn’t want me to just stay on my phone or play with my cat. He wants me to do chores or homework. 
Heres the kicker though. He doesnt work. He only works on the weekends and even then it’s from 5pm-11pm. Btw, not a stable job. Delivery driver. He drives me to school, comes back home, sleeps and plays games and smokes till it’s time to pick me up. Does he do chores? No. 
Today, I get home after another lecture telling me basically to not go to sleep once we get home. We get home and I drop off my stuff in my room. I go to the kitchen and pull up a show on my phone. I’m standing next to the sink snacking on a cookie. He sees me and yells my name. I look at him and he asks “what are you doing?” I assumed I was in his way so I moved without saying nothing. He said “If you’re not going to be doing anything, do the dishes, they’re piling up” I looked at him. “Are you serious? I just got back from school” He raises his voice, “But you’re clearly not doing nothing. So do them.” I kinda snapped. I said “You’ve been here all day! Why do I have to do them? You literally just stood here for like 8 hours, and you added to the pile, you couldn’t do them?” He said he was busy. I said getting high and playing GTA is not “doing something” He yelled at me and sent me to my room.

We're both in medical school and are about to apply for residency. In the past, whenever we discussed residency, we always talked about couples matching (basically a process where you both apply as a package deal, either to the same program or programs in the same region of the country). This means that there's always the possibility that one partner will have to compromise on their top choice program if the other doesn't match in their paired program. Basically, it means both people have to be willing to compromise.

Last weekend, my boyfriend and I were looking at programs together, when he told me: ""you know, I don't think it makes sense to couples match; I want to apply in more midwest areas and you want west coast.""

At the time I responded by telling him that I wanted to support him in whatever he thought was best for his career long-term, and I didn't want any resentment between us. But the more I've ruminated over it the past few days, the more I feel absolutely gutted by the entire thing. For him to so casually state that he wasn't willing to even entertain a compromise for the sake of our relationship is making me feel like he's just using residency as a way to make a clean break.

So, WIBTA if I asked him for some time apart?

She literally just sipped her drink and looked at me and said are you getting that?

Mind you, we had a first dinner where the total was 55 and I paid for the whole thing. So I just looked her dead in the eye and said No. It was 95 and she just expected me to pay the whole thing again without telling me.

The girl started crying and panicking and I threatened to get up and leave. I also told her that I would not be manipulated and that I had plenty of other women after me.

Since she called me cheap, I told her she was cheap and needed to put down her card. Out of spite, I also locked my card on my phone and when the waitress came back and told this girl that her whole card was charged for both meals, the look on her face was priceless! LOL! I also purposely didn't leave the tip because I saw cash in her purse and told her I knew she had cash for a tip too.

To be mature and still be a gentleman, I offered to walk her up and even carried her dinner home. i then said i had to use the bathroom and she let me in angrily. Then i took my shoes off and then she flipped out crazily and said ""Did I say you were staying"" and her roommate was there so I got scared and told her let's go outside and talk about it. But she ignored me.

I still got a free meal though, so player got played. But I'm just wondering why this girl ghosted me after this? I told her that sometimes couples fight and she's not responding to my messages.

**TLDR:** Girl refused to pay on dinner after I paid for the whole first dinner, I locked my card to teach her a lesson, and instead of talking to me or discussing it with me, she won't even hear my views and is probably just moving on to other guys.

There are some nights (most of the time 1/2 a week) that my brother can’t sleep, so he comes lay in my bed with me. I have a Queen size bed, so he fits right in, but I just can’t stand him. He snores and makes all other kinds of sounds, which I find really annoying, so then I can’t sleep. I already told my parents about this, but they said: ‘When you were younger you also slept in his room, because you didn’t want to sleep in your own room. He hasn’t laid in your room for even half the nights.’ I don’t think this argument counts, because I was laying in my own bed at the other side of the room, while my brother is laying 80cm next to my head.

We were in the kitchen, and my dad walked in to have a cup of tea. My mom asked me a question about the symbolism of a painting, and my answer was incorrect. My dad then laughed about It, and as I am very insecure, (expecially with him around: since my coming out he said some very hurtful things and never tried to apologize or understand my side, and I developer a Deep state of anxiety where I was hyper sensitive to the slightest politically incorrect joke and I Always fear getting screamed at. I'm saying this bc I think It explain at least my reaction) I told him to stop laughing at me. He was annoyed and my mom and him told me that they werent making fun of me. I said that I still didnt like that and asked him to stop, wich he didnt as he continued laughing while looking at me. I then screamed that I was gonna study to my room and stormed out crying. They forced me to get back there and we had a talk about my behavior(wich Is Fair I should not Scream I guess), I don't Remember much but they said they thougth I was overreacting and dad laughed at me again when seeing how his actions were making me cry and then I felt bad for the whole rest of my studying session with mom ( that I usually enjoy).
Idk I feel like you should not make people uncomfortable like he did but maybe I overreacted? Idk maybe he was Just joking around and it's my problem?

Sorry for errors english aint my First language. Also yeah maybe the title Is a Little clickbait.
