So to get into it I'm a 20 year old female,and my dad 50 something. Starting of my life wasn't that good as a kid (I just learned that). Let just say CPS was called several times and Nothing came out of it because we were forced to clean up, while are dad was not there i believe cheating on my mom. Also we always moved into a house for the animals never the kid. Like holes in the roof, holes in the floor, windows broken, and a shower that never worked. We also barely ate especially if your a girl, and this happened all the way till adulthood.

So now that we're all caught up let's get down to it. So this started before my Moms Birthday I'm over at my siblings for reason. My mom and dad used to come and visited, One day my sister was trying to sleep when my dad kept talking to her. My sister told him politely she was fixing to go to sleep, he didn't like that and left all mad. My moms phone wasn't working so they were communication with each other by using my phone. I was hanging with my siblings when he called I let him know my phone was on charge because it was about to die. He didn't like to hear that (i assumed) and called me a bitch and hung up. He called again and i just gave it to my mom, she defended me some before he threatened to put my dog in the street so he can get ran over. (He didn't she talked him out of it)

So now none of he's kids want to talk to him. It my moms birthday we celebrate with her and invited her to come eat with us. She did not want to because her husband was coming.( We wanted to leave because he was coming) We go out to eat and come back and he is still here. Already mad and drunk, we try to avoid him but its a small place and he was supposed to be gone already. Him and my mom comes out of the restroom talking. He gets mad because nobody says hello, so i tell him ""Hello"" as friendly as possible but he's not happy with that. He starts to get mad and talking shit, of course there's only so much I can take so i says something, he's still mad and cussing so I start ignoring him. Him being upset he rushes over to me with his hands in fighting position. I send up because I'm not finna let him scare me. He swings so i moved in put him and a head lock my mom started screaming and so let him go ,his pride was hurt. So he swings hitting me in the chin but I was not back down (neither was my siblings). The fight finish he lives looking like he was hit by a truck, I've never cried over a fight and wasn't gonna until I saw my mom doing so as she hugged me. I called up my other siblings told them what happened and they asked me what did i do and that they were gonna call and check on him. Not gonna lie i felt a little bad because i always respected him and always listen to him. My other siblings that were there is saying I'm in the right and i feel like I had the right as well, am i in the wrong?

One roommate, who I'll call Max, and I remember having real trees for Christmas trees as kids and loved them. My family stopped getting real trees when I was around 8, as my dad had heart issues and getting the trees from farms was strenuous on him, but I miss it, and my mom would always hit me with the classic ""When you have your own house, you can have a real tree.""

Well here I am now in my own (rented) apartment, but our other roommate (let's call him Bobby) doesn't like real trees. His family always had an artificial tree when he was growing up, and doesn't get the charm of having a real one. He doesn't like messes (compulsive cleaner) and describes the fresh pine scent of a real tree as ""sticky."" In fairness to him, our first Christmas in the apartment (before Max started living with us), I got a small real tree, and it wasn't a great experience. I was lax on cleaning up the fallen needles, and they were very long, stiff, and sharp, so we would get jabbed whenever we got near it.

Last Christmas, I wanted to get a real tree, one with shorter and softer bristles and being resolved to be more diligent with cleaning the mess. Max was all for it, but Bobby was very much not. I believe he said something along the lines of, ""I swear to God, if you bring home a real tree, I'm throwing it out."" We'd been given a small artificial tree by one of our parents, but the way he so insistently refused a real tree honestly rubbed Max and me the wrong way.

We all work and we all contribute equally to rent, bills, etc. I think it would be nice to alternate between real and artificial Christmas trees every year. In my mind, if the vote is two against one in favor of a real tree, we should be able to get a real tree. I've been thinking about asking Max if he wants a real tree this year, and if so, having a sit-down with Bobby and telling him that, since it's two against one, we're getting a real tree. He won't have to pay for, decorate, clean up after, maintain, or otherwise do anything with the tree aside from look at it, but we're getting it. WIBTA if I went through with this plan? Is this a majority rules situation or all-or-nothing? None of us has any allergies to coniferous trees or sap, and the only issue I can really see with getting a real tree is that strong smells sometimes do give Bobby headaches. I don't think a tree would smell that strongly, but we can't even really light incense or candles in the apartment.

I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. I told him to fuck off twice, and he eventually stopped, but did it one more time right when class ended and kicked my chair. I told him ""Listen dude, fuck. off."".

During next class he ""shot"" one tiny paper ball towards me. I gave him a slow applause. Then we had PE, which was the last class of the day. I waited in the changing room until he left, and once he left, I took my water bottle and poured a shit ton of it into his brand new shoes, and the remaining water onto his schoolbooks. 

After PE, while I was leaving I said ""Hey (his name)"". Enjoy."" while looking at his backpack and shoes. Left quickly. He sent me multiple insults on Facebook, which he deleted after a few hours and asked me WHY. He claimed his books are ruined and his shoes can't be dried. Haven't replied anything.

I (M) had been seeing this girl, lets call her Maddie. Maddie and I had been together for a while and everything seemed great. She always had a smile around me, her family loved me and saw me as a well rounded and respectful young man. Me and her family frequently hung out at restaurants or went to bars to play pool. But after a while Maddie started to get distant with me. Texting me less and less and at times leaving me on read for a day or so. And one day i was worried i had done or said something to lose her, and so i asked her “Did i do something that made you not want to see or talk to me anymore?” And thats when she said “i dont think im ready for a relationship.” And i tried to be understanding and when talking to her, i appeared calm and understood. And i did understand but i was beyond hurt. What really rubbed the salt in the wound was her telling me “You have been nothing but perfect. Youve treated me exactly how id wanted to be treated. You’re a great man.” But in my head im thinking “If im perfect, why dont you want me?” It was a horrible situation and it tore me apart for months. She had posted a couple things on social media, one mentioning something along the lines of “im tired of these year-long relationships, if im an oil change, just say that.” And one talking about people who are hooking up only want a third. And that hurt because that told me she only wanted to have meaningless sex with people instead of being with someone who cared and even went as far as to help people in her family and friends when they needed it. But I digress. A few weeks ago me and a few friends decided to do a drunk stream on Overwatch 2, where everytime we died, you took a shot. And if we lost, everyone took a shot.

The next morning i checked my phone and read the message. It was a long apology with cliche excuses and what i can assume happened was that she didnt get the attention she wanted from trying hookups on Tinder, and came crawling back to me; i know this is my fault; bc in the moment of us breaking up I told her “Well, if you feel like you may be ready for a relationship later down the line, we could try again” well she took that offer months and months too late. And i told her how much i was hurt, that i had seen her social messages. That her family was actively worried about me when i wasnt around anymore. And that i had felt used for my time, money, and energy. I told her exactly how i felt and she just said: “Ok. Couldve just said no, asshole.” And complained to mutual friends who dont know the details of the situation outside of what she told them. And now hate me and wont speak to me anymore.

Long story short, one of my best friends Tara has a habit of inserting herself into set plans that I have with 2 other women that live in my building - she doesn't feel she needs to ask if it's ok, she simply says ""I'd like to join you"" and expects that the answer should always be yes.

Just a little backstory - I met these 2 women 4 years ago when we all moved into the same building around the same time. We started a little group, just the 3 of us, where we go out every Wed night, locally, and catch up with each other. We rarely have anyone join us, but once in a while Tara requests to join. My usual response is ""sure, just let me check with the girls"". The answer is always yes. One of the girls recently pointed out that they could never really say no because it would hurt Tara, and  responding the way I do to her I've put it on them to always say yes. I can see her point, although my intention was to respect them rather than throw them under the bus, lol. Honestly, I thought I could go back to Tara and just say ""I think tonite isn't a great nite to join us,"" but maybe I didn't really consider how sensitive she is (I'm not at all sensitive to that - I totally see it as not personal, just that the core group wants to keep the vibe as is).

I also need to point out that Tara doesn't particularly like one of the girls and has let her feelings be known to myself and the other girl. So when she joins the 3 of us, it feels kinda weird having that knowledge and hearing her complain about her. Also, the other girls have never brought a friend into our little group. We all like the dynamic and enjoy our nights out.

About 2 months ago, one of the girls moved out of the building and out of the state, actually, so when we finally got the chance to get together we were all 3 very excited. On that Wednesday, fully knowing the situation, Tara said to me, ""I'd like to join you all tonight"" and I responded, ""ok, let me just check with the girls"" to which she blew up. I hadn't even said ""no"". She was furious with the fact that I wasn't prioritizing her feelings and that her desire to join us should be enough. I was shocked that she felt ""entitled"" and I felt strongly that this was disrespectful to the people I have plans with.  It was also a special night for our core group bc we hadn't seen each other in a while, and I tried to explain that I don't feel it's my place to just confront the other 2 women that she is joining us. I didn't say this to her, but it's not even personal toward Tara - we wouldn't want ANYONE to join us that night. But that is her point. She isn't anyone. She's one of my best friends. And she feels strongly that I should care more about hurting her than respecting the other 2. I fundamentally disagree with this line of thinking. She wasn't suffering from a bad day or anything, she simply felt like going out. She actually UNinvited me to her Thanksgiving dinner that she invited me to. That was an obvious gut response to me.

We will call my friend Susan.
Susan has had a whole 2 serious boyfriends. The first one, she started cheating on him about a year in. At first it was little stuff, but still cheating. It would start out as other men messaging her, and them taking her out to dinner, blah blah blah. Not my circus, not my monkeys so I stayed quiet at first. I didn't think it was my place to be the snitch. As things progressed, the first guy, we will call Cody, got suspicious. Supposedly he had already cheated on her(she knew and stayed but he swears he didn't do it) so this whole thing was toxic to begin with. It was annoying to be around them and they were constantly together. They always were arguing about something.
She would come to my house while he was at work &amp; invite these men over. Finally she progressed to pretty much dating her now boyfriend who we will call mason, while still with Cody. At that point I'd had enough, so I told Cody what was going on and swore him to secrecy because I didn't want in the middle but neither of them needed to continue this shit. She was always sending me screen shots of her talking to Mason, so I told Cody to lie and say that he got into her iCloud &amp; was able to read her messages. He was able to tell her what he ""Saw"" since I had screenshots. She finally admitted it to him &amp; they broke up. He was thankful and glad I told him, but she still has no idea. She immediately started dating Mason. She was good about not cheating for about 6 months, and then started her crap again. Recently she cheated on him by bringing another dude to my house that Mason WORKS WITH. I knew she was messaging other men as well but he never looks at her phone because they live together, he trusts her, and they have security cameras.
So.... I texted Mason from a fake number. He checked her phone, found some shit she shouldn't have been doing, but stayed with her anyways. He doesn't know she physically cheated though.

Last week I was at the eye doctor for my yearly check. I'd been wanting a new pair of glasses because I've had mine since I was like 13 and I've outgrown them. I discussed this with my parents, who of course thought it was ok. 

After my appointment I went to the optician's and tried on a bunch of new glasses. There was one I kinda liked and my mom told me it looked really good on me. I decided to get it but had a few doubts because my prescription makes my eyes look a lot bigger once I have my glasses on, but I decided to get this pair. 

The problem here is that the guy at the opticians's insisted that the already expensive glasses wouldn't look good with the usual spectacle glass I was used to and kept trying to sell us this thinner and way more expensive glass type. The total price would come to around 400 USD. (I don't live in America so that means a lot more to us.) Don't get me wrong, we have money but I just thought this was too expensive for something that I wasn't actually sure of. I tried to back down but my mother kept saying that it was ok and I could get them. The optician guy also said that it was ok if i brought it back but I wouldn't because it suited my face well. 

So I got it. This morning my mom told me they've been shipped and gave them to me. (I always have to have my glasses specially made for myself because my prescription is very weird.) I tried them on, and they were not at all like what I wanted. They don't fit my face and make me look really ugly. I''ve been dealing with insecurity and the social anxiety that my insecurities caused for a while, and my parents know this. Every time I look at my face with these glasses I want to scream.

So I (f26) have this guy friend who we'll call ""Andrew"" (m27). He has met my female cousin few times and I noticed that she gets shy around him, and he gets a little awkward/shy as well. Not just me but other mutual friend noticed this as well so we thought they had a thing going on but are too shy to show. So me and a few friends attempted to get them together a couple of times.


Yesterday, Andrew had his birthday party at his place. I btought my cousin with me and we had a great time there. That is until 8 pm when me and a few other friends heard commotion coming from a distance. We went to see what was up and found Andrew ""scolding"" my cousin for walking into his bedroom whrn he wasn't even there. I told him to relax since she said she was looking for a charger and I told her it might be in his room. also since it wasn't like he didn't know my cousin, especially when they have a thing hoing on, imo he cpuld've used this opportunity to get closer to her as my friends said. He shifted the blame onto me saying there was ""nothing"" going between them and that shevwas just an acquentance so she had zero right to enter his bedroom and without permission.

We kept asking him but he kept saying no. Fast forward to today he demanded I get up and help him rent a uhaul using my license. A little backstory: I tried to tell him during covid to apply to get his DL because all he had to do was take a written test. He didn't want to do that and continued to drive around without one. And like I stated before we tried to offer help but he declined. The main reason why I don't want to help is because I'm burnt out. I'm moving to Houston to get away from family because no matter what they will always guilt me into helping and I can't do it anymore. Time and time again not only has my brother not done what he needed to do to take care of himself but also has demanded I do it for him or help him. Even when we were younger he would get by on slacking off and my parents refused to force him to do it and instead said I needed to do it because he wouldn't do it right. They allowed him to be lazy like they allowed my other siblings to do what they want but expected me to carry the weight of everyone else's burden.

They can hardly manage to be in the same room, but we get along great with the rest of the family as does my mom, and neither is willing to sit out of family stuff.

My wife does get overwhelmed by my mom and everyone tends to gather around my mom, so our therapist suggested that she bring something she can do when she needs a break, so she has been bringing crochet. 

My mom got annoyed by this and said it was rude and something a five year old would do, and said if she ever brought something to our house and tried to go into the other room and ignore us, we would raise hell. to be fair that is kind of true.

My uncle later went in to get a beer and came out laughing and said I need to see what my mom is doing. My wife and I ran inside and my mom was working on an art project at our coffee table. She had resin, glitter, beads, shells, and my wife lost it and began screaming.

My mom said we were being hypocrites and she was doing exactly what my wife did, her hobby is just messier. I told her to get out, cussed at her, and said she was banned. She said ok and then told us the glitter on the floor isn't her fault, her husband did that. I told her to get the fuck out and never come back. She got glitter and tiny beads on the rug, and resin on the table.

My aunt and uncle defended her and said I was being unfair and my wife is super rude to bring crochet to family stuff.

My wife saw the cleaning lady as more of a nanny than a cleaning lady.

My brother (28M) lives far away with his unemployed fiancée and her brother. He supports them both. 

Up until last night, my parents (late 50s) would send my brother money when he asked for it, but lately that’s have gotten tighter. We have a very comfortable lifestyle, but my parents have 9 months to save up to help me pay for college, help my grandpa whose health just worsened and needs to go to rehab, plus they own real estate and have tenants, so duties as landlords. Our income is right around $150k so FAFSA will screw us over for aid too.

Last night, in the middle of a fight my parents were having after my brother once again asked for money, my mom put her foot down, saying they CAN’T send more money, and my dad was in denial. I walked in and laid down the following. I told my dad that while I don’t care what he sends my brother (I genuinely mean that, it’s none of my business), if it ever affected his ability to pay for my education I wouldn’t forgive him. I don’t feel like I need to validate this but while I’m no valedictorian, I am very academically ambitious. My brother was the complete opposite of me when he was my age. He’s a changed man now, but he was a “trouble kid” who went to alternative school, smoked pot, even spent a night in jail, and dropped out of college after one year. 

So Dad finally told my brother that he (my brother) is broke and he’s not sending him more money. Maybe $100-200, but no more. They fought about it last night and this morning over the phone, and I heard my brother telling him that he doesn’t spend enough time with our grandpa or some bullshit. It was literally the level that our parents’ toxic behavior can stoop to sometimes, so I felt very betrayed because I believed he was the only other one who understands that nasty side of them. He even told me he tries to work on that toxic side of himself last time we talked. 

As much as our parents have screwed up in raising us and are not the most supportive, sometimes bordering on emotional abuse and showing toxic behavior like I said, I am on their side for this one cause it affects me. I’ve been waiting for them to stop caving in to my brother.

I want to send my brother a text respectfully telling him how I feel about all of this and how it affects me, because while he won’t listen to my parents, he might to me.

My mom cried.

I couldnt bear this so  I asked my dad "" Do you trust me or not?"". He asked what. I asked him again,

He didnt answer it.

I told him, this is what you did with mom, Do you trust me or not. He failed to answer Yes or no, He wanted to say something else. But I asked him again,

He didnt answer me.

So, I told him, you trust your friends and give them money, but they failed to return to you and you still trust them'

His mom and step dad and I have had problems on and off throughout our relationship, especially during my pregnancy. My boyfriend’s parents never text or call to check on our son. 

They post about him on social media some but on the back side they don’t come see him or check in on him from time to time. (Note: they have other grandchildren that they make efforts to see **not jealous of that by no means** but they’ve made no efforts towards our son unless we beg them to). The only thing they ask is for pictures our son alone with his face showing. 

It’s important to my boyfriend that we attend certain major holidays with his family. Especially now that we have a son. Due to recent recent events with his mom and step-dad, I have expressed to him that our son and I wouldn’t be going to his family’s holiday events. He understands my reasons but deep down I feel bad because it means so much to him. 

His mom has made it known to other family members of our issues and some has deleted me off of social media. Due to this has made me feel uneasy and unwelcome to go around his family.  My boyfriend has stated that “if you and our son don’t go, I’m not going.” I have expressed to him that he could go cause I never would keep anyone from his family. When I made it clear to her that our son and I weren’t coming to holiday events she basically told my boyfriend that I needed to “suck it up” and be there so she and other family members could see her grandson. Why? You never check on him?! 

I stood my ground on my word but I’m made out to be the a-hole because I won’t take the lack of acknowledgment of our son and the drama that comes with it.

I have a Direct Supervisor and a Team Supervisor(TS) (\~40 M). On this team, I am responsible for making sure every team members stay on top of their admin responsibilities, like their timesheets.

My TS called a meeting which he can make awkward. For example, during our 1st meeting 2 team members informed him that they would be late because of a critical duty. The TS had no problem with it. When they walked in (&lt; 5 minutes late) the TS flipped. He stated that he would not tolerate tardiness and considered it disrespectful. The rest of us laughed because we thought he was joking. We immediately realized that he was not. Months later the team members told the rest of us about the very valid reason for their pretty insignificant tardiness.

This week, we had a team meeting and the TS starts out jovially. He calls out a team member and thanks him for always being the last to submit his timesheet. I have always sent out courteous reminders to those who forget to submit, including the TS. I don't have to but I do this for a number of their admin responsibilities. In response to this group joke that ""Michael"" is always the last person to submit, I say that Michael wasn't the last person to submit his timesheet. The TS asks who was. I say that the TS was. The TS says that he doesn't count. This isn't true. Supervisors need to submit their timesheets by the same date and time as non-supervisors. The TS says he doesn't count because he's the ""overseer."" I ask how that's possible. I ask because he's not the one that receives the Out-of-Compliance list, he doesn't email or call or search for team members who haven't submitted their timesheets. I do. I can be annoying with the reminders, but there's a due date and if team members and supervisors don't meet it, I get called out by an executive, not the employee or TS.

In response to my question of ""how"" the TS is the overseer (because he doesn't see that the task gets done) he tells me sternly, in front of the entire team to ""stay in \[my\] lane"" and that there's a reason that he did not submit his timesheet. I told him that I was \[staying in my lane\]. I found my official job description and in black-and-white it says that one of my primary duties is to ensure that timesheets get done every pay period. But, if the TS wants to be the ""overseer"" so badly, should I let him? Even though that will require that he send out multiple emails (which he won't do). Was I actually out of line? To be clear, I know that this is just his ego and he doesn't have the time (or necessarily know how) to do this part of my job, but I don't think I deserved to be spoken to (and humiliated) like that, considering the extra mile that I always go.

I (26F) have recently lost my grandma. My grandpa died around 15 years ago. However, they were basically my favorite people of all time (no offense mom, you're a close 3rd).

I had been wanting a tattoo for a while and decided that it would be a great opportunity to get something to remember them by. I picked a memory that was attached to each of them, condensed it to a machine for my grandfather and an animal for my grandmother. 

I then asked my tattoo artist to design a one line type tattoo that would encompass both (one line to signify that they were together, blablabla, it's adorable). I absolutely loved the end result and got it tattooed on my arm. Changed for privacy, but imagine a one line tattoo of a bulldozer and a walrus. It's goofy and fun and cute as shit, and goes well with my personnality (also goofy and fun and cute as shit).

I have a pretty decent following on social media (not an actual influencer by any means, but kinda getting there) and I posted multiple stories on insta of the actual tattooing, the healing process, the end result, etc. 

I am white (western european) but most of my friends and followers are from an Asian country and therefore have never seen a walrus and don't recognize it. They assume I tried to get a cow tattooed and it backfired horribly, that sort of things. I make fun of it myself, as I find it hilarious. For example, on my dating apps, I have something along the lines of ""if you can tell me what animal is tattooed on my arm, you'll get a free drink"". Most people tell me that they like the tattoo, even if they don't know what animal it is.

However, some of my friends have point blank told me ""it's so shit"", or asked, with dread, if it was a temporary tattoo. When I told them it in fact wasn't, I got answers such as ""why would you get a tattoo of such a fucked cow on your arm"". 

I found it particularily insulting, especially since it's kind of an hommage to my grandparents. My friends are also from a culture that basically reveres anyone over the age of 50 and I'm convinced that if I shat on the graves of their grandparents, they wouldn't take it super well. I kind of assume they would have never commented on it if they had known the meaning, but I don't think it matters, as they showed their true colors.

I don't mind people not liking the tattoo. It's on me anyways, so it doesn't matter. However, I think there is a line between ""meh, I wouldn't get a bulldozer and a walrus tattooed on me"" and ""lol it's shit"". I have personally never gone up to someone with a tattoo I didn't like to insult it, and I think most people haven't either.

I haven't answered anything in particular to the people who have insulted it, but I have carefully moved them (mentally at least) in an ""ignore until further notice"" folder. 

I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I'd like to get some other opinions.

My husband locked me out of the house yesterday but says it was an accident and is not sorry. I am hurt and frightened and don’t know if I am being ridiculous. 

My husband works mostly from home; he goes in to work perhaps once a month, and tells me the day before, as we share a car. So I generally know when he’s going in. 
Yesterday I took the dog to the park at 7am. I understand that my husband was working from home. He was still in bed. While I was at the park, he sent me a text message saying that he was going to work. I messaged back when I saw it (20 minutes later), and said that I hoped he had not locked the door, as I didn’t have my house key. He responded once he got to work, “shit, sorry, I assumed you had your key. Ask the neighbour; he should have a copy”. He did not message me again this day. I managed to break into our back yard (he locks the gate with a 3 dead bolts, but I have learned that I can open it by bringing over a chair from the front porch and then unlocking the 3 bolts by reaching over.) I then entered the back yard, got the spare key from the bbq, and let myself in to the house. This particular day was cold and snowy, so it took a bit of work. I was scared and broke into hives. I spent the rest of the day in bed crying. 

For context: I am on disability for mental health reasons. I struggle with depression and anxiety. I mostly prefer to be at home, and get anxious when I leave the house. At one point I was diagnosed as agoraphobic. Walking the dog is mandated by my therapist as a way of getting me out of the house. I struggle with my memory, and I often forget my keys. I get frightened when I am too far from home. My husband knows I forget me keys, as many times I have returned home and had to ring the doorbell to get in. 

He says this was my fault for not having my house key with me. I believe he did this in anger because he could not find the car key this day, and thus had to take the subway to work. (I had forgotten to put the car key back on its ring; it was in my purse. But he could have called me to ask where it was.) He didn’t call or text to see if I had gotten into the house. I cried all day. I feel frightened that I am in danger, but perhaps that is my anxiety speaking.

I had a patient come up to get her medicine, and there was a girl with a completed prescription linked to her account. I asked about this individual and it turns out that it was her daughter, who recently passed away. As the patient was explaining she started to cry. Normally I'd do whatever I could to help but a small crowd of people was forming in line (2-3 people) and I began to get anxious about getting my work done. My boss saw this patient crying, the line building up, and basically shouted at me to get the line cleared up so we could close for lunch. I turned to talk to the woman, but before I could my boyfriend had gone up to the consultation window (it's a small area where patients can talk with the pharmacist directly and have some privacy) and told her that the customer was crying and that she should ""show a bit of compassion"". My boss scoffed and closed the consultation window and we got the line cleared. Later my boyfriend apologized to me for my boss' behavior and expressed disgust about her, but I told him to mind his business. He's not some superhero that's supposed to come to the defense of other people, he should have just stayed quiet and waited for me to finish my work so we could eat lunch. I said all this to him and he's been kind of mad at me ever since.

My brother didn’t really see this as an issue until I told him and he told me to just “put them in the dryer wet” …I told him the washing machine is broken and my mom ended up giving us hers (which was really amazing). My moms working washing machine was sitting in the garage next to the broken one for 2-3 weeks and I had already asked my brother about when he was going to put it in 2 or 3 times, but every time I asked I didn’t get any kind of answer, and we got into an argument almost. The last time I had asked I said “can you give me some sort of time frame at least as to when you will be able to have it done” and he just kept saying “I have no idea” very snappy. I really didn’t know why it was such a touchy subject for me to bring up and why I can’t ask as a paying tenant. So a couple of weeks ago, it still hadn’t been done. I was really fed up but I didn’t want to fight with my brother about it, so I just tried to mention to him, “you know that putting soaking wet clothes in the dryer constantly isn’t good for life of the dryer, like it puts a lot of wear and tear on it.” I get an immediately annoyed response and him telling me if I don’t like how long it’s taking him to put in the washing machine then maybe i need to just move out. This just escalated by him raising his voice at me and screaming over me saying “fuck you” “shut the fuck up”. And we haven’t talked since then. I’m am moving out, I’ve lived with my brother for a few years now and I think it’s definitely time. But he’s still my brother and it sucks fighting. He told my mom that “he felt disrespected because I was talking to him like he was a slumlord.”

Also small TW for abuse and discussions of mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I (17F) have two best friends, Liam (15M) and Noah (also 15M) (not their real names obviously) who are dating. They're a sweet couple and I love both of them lots but there are a few issues.

For a bit of background: Liam has quite a lot of mental issues. Especially from his last relationship, where he was basically psychologically abused. So he's quite insecure and paranoid about people leaving him. 

Liam often messages me whenever he feels insecure about his relationship with Noah. He has done this since before they got together, and I don't mind helping him, but most of the time the problem can be solved by just having a conversation about it. Liam is always paranoid that Noah will judge him, but Noah is such a sweet boy to, he would never judge Liam for the things like mental health issues. 

Just now, Liam and Noah got into a ""fight"". I can't get into details about it for privacy reasons, but Noah worded something wrong and Liam got very upset about it. And when he messaged me, I obviously did my best to calm him down. But today was just a bad day for Liam and he would just not believe me whatever I did. So I messaged Noah about that Liam was upset and I wanted to know what really happened because ""He hates me"" wasn't telling me a lot. And it worked, Noah told me what happened and that he was partially to blame but wasn't sure what to do. To which I told him to just apologize for his actions. Which he did, and the conflict was resolved. 

Normally I don't reach out about these things to Noah, because I respect Liam's privacy and because it's their relationship. But it's hard for me to keep watching from the side lines knowing things can be going a lot smoother. Especially since both of them are quite a bit younger than me, I feel obliged to help them as a sort of older sister figure.

Yes, I'm a teen mom, please do not judge. My partner ""James"" (18M) and I have been together since we were 14. His parents are upper middle class and were upset at first, but they ended up being very supportive, and even take care of her when both me and James have to work. My mother was not supportive at all. She kicked me out of the house and I ended up living with my grandparents until around 5 months ago when me, my daughter, and James moved into an apartment together, which is being paid for by his parents until I turn 18.

Until now, I had not heard from my mother at all. I got a new phone after getting kicked out which came with a new number. I never gave her my number and both my grandparents say they did not give her my number either. But somehow, she got my number recently, claiming she wants to rekindle our relationship and invited me to a thanksgiving dinner with her side of the family.

I went NC with ALL of my family members from my mother's side. My grandparents are my dad's parents. Long story short, my parents divorced when I was 7 and my father passed away when I was 12. 

I was cleaning Sofia's room when she had texted me, so I had called her since my hands weren't free. She repeated her text again, saying she misses me and she had been in a bad mood, and all that stuff. I told her I could not attend because I was going to spend thanksgiving with James's family, and even if I wasn't, I wouldn't want to be around her anyways. She called me a bunch of names, including an A hole, saying she raised me and that it wasn't her fault that ""You fucked around and became a worthless whore with no education."" After hearing that, I told her not to contact me ever again.

I do have an education. I graduated high school early and have not decided whether or not I want to continue my education. I also do have a job, where I work around 30 hours a week. I know that is not a lot but I try to be there for my daughter at home.

My mother's new boyfriend (which, I wasn't even aware she had moved on after I left) found my Instagram, which again, I don't know how they're finding me, and said my mother missed me and I was being a rude teenager and soon one day I would regret it and would want to be a happy family again. My mother then sent me a message through his account, and said that I could still move back in with her, IF I left my wonderful boyfriend, his family, AND MY DAUGHTER. She wanted me to abandon my whole family in order to live with her, which I wouldn't even want to do as I already live on my own anyways. I didn't even bother responding and just blocked him.

Me (13NB) and my friend (14F) are in the same English class in high school, and we quite frankly hate it. Both of our teachers have left after we were 'too horrible to them and we haven't had a real teacher since. The first left after having a glue stick lobbed at them 70mph and the second one cried in the corner and then walked out after being ignored for most of the lesson.

Last year, we had a lovely English teacher (27M) that I will call Mr B. He's a lovely guy and knows about my mental health issues (mainly misophonia, the hatred of repetitive noises (I hate chewing, sniffing and loud breathing, but its different for everyone)).

The first reason i am wanting to move classes is because of my misophonia, which I have tried to talk to my friend (who I will call Olivia) before about, but she has always said no, because 'it would be too awkward with a teacher in the room'. This would be understandable, if we hadn't talked about her mental health issues the day before in the same room, with the same teacher still in the room. So my mental health is declining by the day, with no one to talk to because, to me, it takes a lot of confidence (which I don't have) to talk to your parents about these things. I used to talk to Mr B about my mental health, but can't do that anymore due to the teacher changes.

The second reason is that we haven't learnt anything in the entire year because of the constant supply teachers repeating lessons, kids not doing works and therefore disrupting the class, etc. And as I am in year 9, we are beginning to build up to choosing our GCSE's - which are over two years away, but still - so this year is the most important to me so far, as we didn't get to do our SATS because of Covid-19, so I want to be able to do well.

I have recently told her that I might be moving classes, as I have spoken to Mr B and he has agreed to try and move me into his class. She now keeps making comments like 'at least I'm not leaving my friend in English' and, this is where I have a problem with it, 'its not my fault you never want to talk about your mental health with me'. This really annoys me because, as I have mentioned before, I have tried.

She is now calling me a s\*\*g and a b\*\*\*h every time she talks to me and when I insult back, she brings up English again. I get that she's annoyed but I don't think she should take it out on me.

She was really pretty and we kissed at the end of the date. I asked her to meet again, but this time I just said meet, and SHE suggested the place. She has no car also so I had to drive 15 minutes to see her.

When the check came, she looked at me and asked me if I would get it. I said no, and explained how I believe in equality. She started crying. Her excuse for crying? She said me not paying ""made her feel like she wasn't worth it"", whatever that means.

She then asked if it was because I didn't have enough money and I told her that no, it was simply the principle of equality. She gave me a snobby look and then I explained that I have lots of other women that are into me.

So the waitress came and we both put our cards in I (rightfully) locked my card beforehand so that her card would get charged for the whole thing. When she found out that her card was charged for the whole meal, this girl was furious at me for no reason, again I just wanted equality and had paid for everything the first time.

I was even a gentleman and walked her home to her house down the street, but she just huffed and puffed and rejected me when I asked to put my arms around her. I told her I had to go to the bathroom so she said ""Fine, go"" angrily and then after I went, I took off my socks and she said ""Did I say you were staying? then she kicked me out. I asked her if she would at least come out in the driveway to talk about it, but she refused.

I even texted her a week later saying how cute and interesting I thought she was, and that I was hoping we could kiss a bit for the second date.

We live about a seven hour plane ride away from my mom and there hasn't been a single visit in five years. My wife and my mom never had a great relationship. It wasn't too terrible but just very different people and they get on each other's nerves, so my wife doesn't want her to stay in the house. 

It makes me sad but my wife feels the home needs to be a sanctuary and no one who upsets her should be allowed to stay in her sanctuary, and I chose to support that. Her ideal visit would be my mom staying at a hotel and having designated visiting times.

My mom says we can make our rules but we can't seriously expect her to put her time and effort into traveling to stay at a hotel. I also understand that train of thought. My wife however thinks my mom owes it to our kids to make the effort. My mom says my wife is selfish for expecting her to sacrifice her time, effort, and peace of mind just to be treated like a burden.

I have told my wife to leave it alone. I called my mom recently to talk and my wife came over and began making digs about how the kids don't recognize my mom and were asking if I actually have parents. My mom said my wife needed to leave the conversation or she was going to hang up. My wife said it is so sad that my mom won't just come and see her grandkids because she feels entitled to stay in our house.

I just snapped and told my wife that she needs to stop acting entitled to my moms time, energy, the money it would take to visit and she is the entitled one.

So  I (19M) recently developed a crush on one of my younger (18F)  classmates/coworkers. I am currently a sophomore in college, and she is  currently a freshman, and I was aware I must have been about a year  older than her. In order to find out how old she was, I checked our work  directory online and looked her up to see, because I didn't want to ask  her directly how old she was as I was trying to decide whether to take  things farther. I am 99% sure she isn't aware that her birthday is in  the directory, but at the time I figured it was okay because it wasn't  like I was taking her phone number or address without her consent, I was  just trying to check how old she was.

Now  that some time has passed I have started to feel like what I did was  really creepy, and I don't know if it was right to look up her birthday  in a directory she didn't know about without her consent.

They said that life ""isn't stable"" currently and that the whole family is in a ""crisis mode"" and asked that I reschedule my wedding date. My fiance agreed with them instantly and thought it was ""the right thing to do"" but I refused because for one, My family and I are gonna be the ones losing money after paying for almost everything. And two, I've already rescheduled once after they found out that my uncle inlaw had a child outside of his marriage. They're big, so big on image and reputation in this small town and they don't want my wedding to come BEFORE they fix the current situation and have people gossip about them in their own son's wedding. I refused and so no. My parents inlaw got into an argument with me then hung up. My fiance accused me of not ""giving crap"" about what he's family's experiencing and said that I need to show support and understanding since I'm ""family"" but this is literally costing me money.

When he asked me if I was ok with him going (we work opposite schedules because we have no help with child care, so I’d have to take the week off of work to be home with our kids ages 2 &amp; 4) I joked saying sure, but I wanted to tag along with the kids and bring them to Disney World. He’s not a big theme park fan himself and said sure, but remember he will be on a work trip, unavailable during the day and at business dinners, etc in the evening so I’d be completely on my own with the kids. I said that was fine and we booked the plane tickets that day. 

The next day I talked to my sister who said her and her BF were planning a trip down to go to Universal, and asked if I wanted them to book it for the same dates so we could travel together and they could offer me some help, come to Disney for a couple days with us, and even offer a date night one night to me and my husband. I said that would be amazing and they booked their flight along with a hotel right outside of Disney.

Well two days later we got the hotel info from my husbands work, and instead of staying near Epcot like they have done in years past, they’ve booked a very “business” hotel 35min away with no pool, no transportation to Disney and really no family friendly accommodations. This would mean having to rent a rental car, car seats, and being over half an hour away from the people coming down to help us. My sister offered to let me and the kids stay with them in the more family friendly hotel that offers all the accommodations, and that my husband could join us on the last day when he planned to come to the parks with us. I thought this was so generous and a great idea that would make things A LOT easier, and allow us the date night on the final night in FL.

I told the idea to my husband and he was PISSED and said I was the AH for even suggesting the kids and I would stay somewhere else. I said he stressed to me he’d be working the entire time and late into the evenings, and this would make the trip so much easier and enjoyable for me and the kids. He insisted I’m the AH and won’t even speak to me about the trip now.

This happened a few days ago at my work place ( a very well known super store that I will not say by name). I [22F] work in a online pick up and delivery department and we have been really busy with black Friday. Me and my coworker I'll called C were assigned to dispense or load the customers and drivers with their orders. We have a separate area in our store that we have been dispensing black Friday orders out of, we're supposed to have a person in there also but since we're so short staffed and have been super busy it's between the 2 regular dispensers to grab the orders.
    Well when you walk out the black Friday area you have to go out an emergency exit that needs to be locked from the inside. I happened to see my coworker C go the other area to grab and dispense a black Friday order but instead of going back in through the emergency exit she came in through are regular dispensing door. She did this twice. 
    I didn't think much of it and it was way to busy to worry about it, until I needed something outta of the black Friday area. I headed over there from inside the store and noticed that someone had accidentally locked that door to get into the area (they have been doing this alot I think its to protect it from curious customers but it's really annoying). So I have to go find a manager to let me because there's customers waiting for their orders outside. As me and said Manger are walking back a worker from stocking informs me and my Manger that the emergency exit is wide open. I gasp and say the coworkers name and manager looks at me and says what? I than realizing I have to tell him, explain what I think may have happened. Once we reach the black Friday area my HR is standing there pissed saying ""so we just letting people get free grabs in here"" my manager tells her that the person before mightve done it because someone had locked the other door. 
 I than go on with the rest of my day after that. I mentioned something to my fiancé who also works with me and he said she had actually asked him to close the door behind her a latch it the first time but not a second time.

  I'm upset because she totally left the door open and they can check the camera that's literally facing it. And this isn't the only thing she has lied about and tried to cover up.

I (17f) was in the car with my parents coming home from a friends place. I have just graduated highschool and my dad starts talking about how important it is to learn how to cook, clean etc. now. I of course agree as obviously these are very important skills to have for everyone and I would want to learn them for myself. I can already cook, clean and all of that at a basic level, but obviously just to work on those skills more is what I need. However, my dad keeps talking about their importance, and in a joking tone I’m like “so why can’t you cook or clean dad”. Dead silence. My mum does all the housework, despite both my parents being doctors. I am also planning to study med.

 Finally my dad says “well it’s an important skill for ladies”, and I disagree straight up. Ok, if I was planning to become a housewife and it’s the 1950s, he’d be right. However, times are different, and for me to be working my ass off studying for med school and me being as academically good and be able to do anything any man at my level could do, and for him to say that I need to learn how to cook and do all that as well, while my future husband can barely tie his own shoelaces, that is the most messed up sexist shit a dad of 2 girls can believe and say. 

When we get home, he comes to my room and yells at me about how I shouldn’t have said that to him. I explain my view and how I believe what he said was sexist.

My in laws go through cars like crazy. I think my mother in law alone has had over 6 SUVs in the past 8 years. My in laws have some money, so it really isn’t my business what they do. Until now…..The situation is this:

My husband has had a few cars his parents bought him when he first started driving. A few years ago, he previously purchased his first truck, and had it for a few years. We were so proud to do that together. My father in law decided to upgrade his truck, and convince my husband to take over payments of his current lifted Chevy Colorado so they could use his work truck to trade it in for a bigger diesel. At the time, I agreed that this was a good idea to do. We’ve had the newer truck for a while now and I’ve grown to love it. The title was never shifted to my husbands name, so basically he was just making the payments. 

Now, my father in law wants a bronco. He ordered one without saying much to us, and then proposes that he takes the Chevy Colorado and trade that truck in for the bronco since it has more equity. He is basically giving my husband his bigger diesel truck and telling him that he would make the payments for him since he knows we can’t afford it. My husband is used to his parents giving him nice things, but we had one conversation about it and he agreed that he didn’t want to trade in his current truck. This just makes me feel icky all over that no one included me in this conversation/decision afterwards - instead they hid it from me until the trade happened because they knew I wouldn’t agree with it. It’s a truck we can’t even afford to buy!! Very showy look-at-me truck. Like the other truck, I’m sure we will get compliments about it strangers/friends, and my husband will act like he bought it himself. Why drive something out of our means? It just doesn’t make sense to me.

Here I am over here just saving, and waiting for the day I can get myself a newer car eventually so I can drive to visit my family (5 hr away) whenever I want to. My husband travels for work so his vehicle is not always an option.

Both of our teachers have left because my class was 'too horrible' to them. I have many mental health issues, the main one being misophonia (**a condition characterized by a strongly negative and atypical emotional and physiological response to certain common, repetitive sounds).** As you can probably guess, a classroom of only supply teachers and 13-14 year old children is less than ideal for my condition, and as a 13-year-old, puberty has hit me like a truck right in the face, making my mental health even worse.

Last year, in my last English class - also with my friend - I had a lovely teacher that we'll call Mr B. He knows about my issues, always made sure we were all ok in the lesson and was just an overall really nice guy. This year when I looked at my timetable to see I didn't have him again, I was a bit sad, but I got over it within a day, because its just an English teacher, right? 

The first day of the class, my teacher straight up walks out on us because she had a Pritt Stick lobbed at her head 70mph from the back of the room. She's the first one down. The other real teacher I had, no one would listen to her and she ended up crying in the corner for twenty minutes. Since then, she has obviously left and we have had supply teachers for months now, the longest running one teaching us for three days before leaving. 

I recently have begun to have panic attacks in these lessons due to constant chewing, sniffing, coughing, and tapping from people around me, and I usually use my toilet pass to get out of the lesson. my friend used to suffer from mental illness, and when she would ask me to stay behind in the lesson at break, I would, just to make sure she was ok. As of late, I have asked her to do the same just 2 times. Each time she has said no because 'it would be awkward to do it with a teacher in the room'. This had never stopped us before, and I find it almost annoying that she's doing this to me now.

I have now told her that I have had conversations with our old English teacher, and he has said that he wants to move me into his class to avoid my condition getting any worse. She has now stopped talking to me for a solid two weeks because I am moving classes. 

I feel like this could've been avoided is she had just let me talk to her, but she thinks that I am in the wrong for leaving her, as she hates the class too.

First of all, sry for the bad english, am not a native speaker.
I am singing in a small coverband my bf and i founded. Since this year, we replaced the hole rhythm-group, bc the old rhythm group didnt have the time anymore for the band.
Since than we have this rhythm-guitarist. We had at the beginnings problems with his motivation, because he had none for playing (he said its from his seasonal depression). We had a big talk in the band and after that everything was fine... Till lately.
We had a gig at halloween. Our rhythmguitarist said, he has no time for practice bc he finally got into an university, so we had to play the gig without him. We got a substitute-rhythmguitarist for the gig. And the normal rhythmguitarist showed up to watch us play and told us afterwards, he is sad bc he couldnt play with us bc he had no time to practice with us. And at the next gig, he wants to play with us again.
So the next gig was in planning but got shortly after that cancelled.
We had a practice in planning even though we wouldnt play at a concert.
He said, he wouldn't come to the practice bc he would rather plan his moving-plans with his girlfriend (they try to move to the city his university is).
After i wrote in the group chat that some guys of the band still havent payed thair rent for our bandpractice-room (i am the person that collects the money to give it to our landlord), he told us, he doesnt want to pay for october bc he didnt practice with us for the gig in halloween over october. I mean, our landlord is chill bc hes the father of our drummer, but still.
The rhythmguitarist also took his time for making his drivers-licence. It was a moneything, so we all understood and drove to him  to pick him up for practice. Now, he has his drivers-licence. He could drive the car of his parents for getting to the practice, but he rather calls us to pick him up again. 
And he uses part of the equipment feom our lead-guitarist. He asked first nicely, but since then (also with the driving) h takes everything for granted. 
He also said he thinks, that he might end up not playing in the band anymore when he has moved with his gf, cause the driving is annoying (its half an hour). We gave him time till end of december to decide.
I am so annoyed of him.
Meanwhile the substitute-guitarist, who helped us with the halloweengig, wants to play in our band.

Alice’s last boyfriend cheated on her with her now former best friend, and she understandably now has trust issues because of it. She can be quick to question where I am and who I’m with at times, but I love her and until recently, I’ve been willing to brush it off.

This all started three months ago, when my best friend Olivia (22F) became homeless because the apartment building she was living in caught on fire. Now, I’ve known Olivia since we were in preschool, so when she asked if it was alright if I temporarily moved in with her while she gets back on her feet, I didn’t hesitate to say yes. She lived with my family during our last two years of high school (her parents kicked her out) so I already knew that she’d be a good roommate. I sorted everything out with my building, and Olivia moved in.

It quickly became clear that Alice does not like Olivia. Alice can be jealous of my female friends, but she knows Olivia is a lesbian, and she never seemed to have a problem with her before she moved in. Now she has this idea in her head that Olivia is faking being gay and wants to be with me. She’s been trying to convince me to ask Olivia to move out, but I always shut it down and tell her to butt out. To clarify, Alice and I do NOT live together, and she contributes nothing towards my rent or utilities. She said that it’s weird for me to live with a girl that I’m not dating, then got pissed when I reminded her that when I asked her to move in with me last year, she said no because she doesn’t want to move in until I put a ring on her finger.

Things reached a boiling point yesterday. Alice was over and we were watching the new season of The Crown when Olivia came home in tears. When I asked what’s wrong, she said that she found out from her older sister that her grandmother had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. I hugged her and told her I was sorry, that we could go and visit, but Alice got mad at me for rushing to comfort Olivia when I was supposed to be spending time with her. She said that it was inappropriate of me to hug another girl in front of her, and said something about how Olivia should keep her hands off other people’s boyfriends. I lost it and told her that she needs to get over her petty jealousy of Olivia. Alice said that I knew she got cheated on in the past and that stuff like this is why she has trust issues. I told her that her jealousy isn’t my problem or Olivia’s, and that she should go and see a fucking therapist about her ex cheating instead of taking it out on me and my friend. I said that until Olivia moved out, she was no longer welcome in my apartment.

Now she’s not talking to me. Her mom, best friend and brother have all texted me and said that I’m the ass for not caring about her opinion, but my parents think that I’m in the right. I need neutral opinions.

Like many my age, due to cost of living I still live with my parents. When he would come visit me he would also see my parents as a result. My relationship with my mom has always been great but my relationship with my dad has been tense over the years and my ex was made aware of these reasons- he even sided with me and sometimes would be critical when speaking about my dad. Flash forward to June of 2021 and I decided to break up with him. He told me during this conversation that he greatly respected my dad and that they could’ve been friends had they met on their own. After the breakup my dad starts getting on my case to reach out to my ex and tell him that he still wants to be friends, which I did not do. A few weeks later I find out one morning that my dad had invited my ex to come and stay at our house and that he was on his way over, so I packed a bag and left to go stay with my grandmother. I sent my ex a text saying that it was uncomfortable and inappropriate for him to try and actively stay friends with my dad and coming over to my house, and he basically told me to get over it and accept that they were friends. A few more weeks go by and while I was in the city for a wedding I found out that once again my ex was at my house.

Yesterday, I had to go to the dentist (I had toothache/possible infection for a whole week but since I had no time because of the kids and work and house chores I had to delay).

I kept pleading with him and started running out of time looking for a babysitter or someone in the family to watch the kids but couldn't. I ended up canceling the appointment and staying home.



Later at night, my husband revealed to me the reason why. He said that he, along with a bunch of his friends are participating in ""no simp november"". It's a stupid trend on tiktok where guys stop acting ""nice"" and say no for an entire month. I was stunned and went off on him for doing this and not caring that I had to deal with toothache and discomfort for days.

I kept lashing out at him which made him retreat and leave the house for 2 hours. He came back and refused to speak to me other than to say it was just a ""month"" and that he was in a competition with his friends and that I overreacted and verbally abused him.

I have been dating a guy for 10 months, it's getting pretty serious and we are even thinking about meeting each other's parents.

The problem is that.. I never told him I have a child. She lives in Bolivia with my sister, and I haven't seen her in 11 years. I don't feel like a mother at all. I talk to her maybe 2 to 3 times a year, birthday/christmas/important days. It felt right to not mention her, because she doesn't live with me.

But  we were planning to go to Bolivia to meet my family, so my daughter too. They do not speak English, so I'd pretry much be the translator . So, I decided to tell him that I had a child back in my home country but that it wouldn't change anything in our lives, that we could have our own family one day.

He got super p*ssed off, told me I deceived him, he's been ignoring for a week now.

He called me selfish for getting upset and that I’m “only making myself look worse.” He also said that if I didn’t want him to spend it, I should have deposited the money right away.

Hi all!

I(34F) have been with my wonderful husband for over 8 years now, married for 3. I am pregnant with our first child and am currently in the 5th month of my pregnancy. I have recently developed this very intense love towards pomegranate juice of one very specific brand and we have at least 2 bottles lying in our fridge currently. My husband has been very caring and has been doing all our household chores along with his job and I work from home mostly and go to work once a week. He has also does the grocery shopping and this time recently noticed he got me only one tetra pack of pomegranate juice.

He tells me that I have reduced my intake of healthy things like rice and vegetables because I drink up so much juice I have no appetite for ""actual"" food. I couldn't argue with him so I just kinda sulked the entire evening and just felt very let down.

I feel horrible now because he went back and got one more bottle of it when he'd been telling me how tiring his job had been this week particularly.

AITA? I feel so guilty because what he said was true.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4805960,public,top,self,AITA for not agreeing with my husband reducing my intake of pomegranate juice?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzcfkr/aita_for_not_agreeing_with_my_husband_reducing_my/,all_ads,6

I asked my brother if they could come stay with me last night. The boy has plans but my niece was very excited. I’d planned on watching movies and snacks and all that kind of stuff. 

At the last minute an old HS Classmate of mine texted and said a group was meeting a chili’s for dinner . I said I couldn’t since my niece was with me but they said that was even better since so many had kids now she would have a great time so we agreed to go. 

I’m not a parent and don’t have much experience with kids but I was a little grossed out by what these people let their kids get away with. First of all it was the phones. To me that’s a hard no. Kids don’t need to be on phones at dinner. But it was also the coloring books the restaurant gave each of the kids. Kids can sit and have polite conversations with each other and the adults. To shove entertainment in front of them constantly is insane. 

She really wanted to go color with the other girls her age, I said she could go talk with them but no to the coloring. ALL the other parents there (people I’ve known since I was at least 14, 25 now) thought I was a monster but while their kids screamed and argued and sent crayons flying across the room, my nice sat there politely and silently ate her food. 

My SIL came and picked her up a little early since I a last minute date with a guy I met on hinge and all seemed great with my niece. 

I woke up to this text from SIL : “so not only did you change your plans and ditch Kaelyn for a date and group dinner, you made her sit in silence like a robot—at Chili’s? They have coloring books for a reason. Don’t ask to watch het again. The answer will be no.” 

Obviously the implications of that text are that I’m a selfish asshole. I think I was helping her be mature.

There was a point in time when my chest was hurting and every time I stood up I had a massive headache. It was bad in the beginning, walking from the kitchen alone would have me out of breath so it was hard to make tea or something for myself to eat. Still, I had to go shopping for my medicine and whatnot. My partner (24M) is staying over his parents while I’m sick because he claims he doesn’t want to get sick and miss work. I honestly don’t know how to feel about this. I asked him if this is going to happen every time I’m sick and he said probably. The sucky thing is I’d take care of him in a heartbeat. I did. I got sick once taking care of him but I didn’t mind. And it makes me feel super alone. Like I’m so tired of having to be independent. Sometimes I just want to babied. Id like to be taken care of every once in a while. He even said he’s a big baby when sick. I don’t know I guess I’m just not understanding. I don’t know if I’m being selfish. Right now, I feel a little better but it usually gets worse through out the day. All I have now is a wheezing problem and dry cough so I’m relatively ok to take care of myself now. I just really want emotional support. I’m missing a whole week of work and I’m not happy about that. He says I’m making him feel bad for not wanting to get sick when I confront him. He claims if he gets sick, it’ll be worse for him.

We've made out since then and whilst it was all consensual I very much regret it happening after the two panic attacks, especially since he initiated it.
