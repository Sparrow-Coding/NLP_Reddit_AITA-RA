I tried calling them a million times and they wouldn’t answer so after like 25 minutes I called a locksmith and texted them that I’d need to be refunded.

The first was my aunt’s, I was adopted when I was younger and she is apart of my biological family who I met two years ago. I kept the invite on the table and would decide if I were to go as the weeks go on and depending on what invitations I may get. My boyfriend’s uncle invited us to his house about a month ago as his wife is cooking Thanksgiving dinner and needed a head count so we said yes a few weeks ago. 

Fast forward Friday, my mother (adoptive but she is my mother and I refer to her as such) had asked me if I have any Thanksgiving plans and I told her about the two I was invited to and planning on going to. She did not invite me over to her house for Thanksgiving dinner or tell me she was planning anything so I didn’t assume she was doing something. In my response, I told her that if she was planning something my boyfriend and I can make sure to come over as well. The year prior, we went to all three Thanksgiving dinners (my mother’s my boyfriend’s uncles and my biological aunt’s). 

My mother responded to my text saying “Ohhhh…we have nothing panned and that seems like enough traveling.  Just checking :)”

A few hours ago, she texted me asking why I didn’t ask her about her plans and basically saying that my siblings are unable to be there one due to bed bugs, the other doesn’t like family gatherings and is autistic and the other lives out of state. She can’t think of accepting any other invitations before she thought of her mom (my grandmother). 

With that response, I told her my thought process and how I was invited to other Thanksgiving dinners months ago and she didn’t invite me so I didn’t assume she was doing anything. I didn’t want to assume she was doing something and put pressure on her if she didn’t plan on cooking/hosting..

I can’t help but feel guilted and a part of me feels pressured due to my sibling’s absence. I don’t want my mother to have an unhealthy hold on me as I am an adult. 

I work two jobs, a salaried position &amp; part time position and my days are scheduled out to the T because of my schedule. I plan my weeks in advance. In my head I’m thinking that I’m not tracking my mom/someone down about their Thanksgiving plans if they don’t initiate or invite me..

This is something I've been debating for a while.My boyfriend and I bought a house 2 years ago, so we could accommodate my pitbull, I'll call him Hermes.  Well not long into us living in our house, a couple with their 2 kids and 2 dogs moved in next door. One day I was outside with Hermes and the neighbors came out. They have a German shepherd and a lab. The lab is a sweet baby, never had any issues. But from the first time I met the shepherd, he came out barking, hair raised, and charged the fence. (For visual purposes, our backyard does not have a fence. I kept Hermes on a long lead while I stood out there with him the entire time. Our backyards differ in which ours is level, but theirs drops at a slant. There is a concrete brick wall between our yards, but isn't tall enough to completely block the dogs from looking over while standing on their back legs. My dog could also reach the line with how long his lead is.) I caught Hermes quick enough to get him back into the house to avoid any conflicts as I didn't trust my neighbors dog right away after coming out immediately barking and charging us. We then went back out and talked to them, which went well. Introduced ourselves, and I let them know about Hermes and his anxiety and asked if we could come to an agreement on letting the dogs out. All I asked of anyone was to just check for us being outside before letting their dogs out. They agreed and said it was not a problem, and I did the same. If they were outside I would wait until they went back in. They however, did not. Multiple time I'd be out there with Hermes and they would open their back door, just let them out and shut the door again. I'd have to scramble and grab Hermes before the shepherd could reach the line. This happened more than 20 times in a couple of months to the point where I would get so anxious just going outside. Their fence wasn't even a real fence, just chicken wire. Shepherd started jumping the fence into our yard whenever he got the chance. He has even ran up on my father in law and me, and has even chased neighbors who were outside into our backyard as well. At this point I didn't even want to go outside with Hermes knowing there was a potential that the shepherd would jump the fence and start a fight. Sadly Hermes passed away back in July, and I thought after not having my dog to worry about anymore it would die down, but the shepherd continues to jump the fence and chase down random neighbors, cats, anything he sees. Other times he just strolls the neighborhood. At this point I am growing concerned that this dog is either gonna hurt someone, come up on the wrong person and get shot, or run over and killed. I feel bad for the dog, and really do not want to see him die. But at this point I think there needs to be some sort of intervention.

anyway, she’s engaged (now married as of today) to this guy i’ll call steve. steve is active military (which is important later). he and i have always been rocky- i’m very blunt and never been a fan of how quick he is to anger and cursing around my younger siblings. it’s something he and my mom argue about a lot, because her ex (my dad) is a narcissist and steve has a hard time realizing that his anger causes both my mom and i to react as if he’s my dad.

a while ago, they got into an argument (i wasn’t present) wherein steve had accidentally pushed my younger sister and caused my mom to go ballistic on him and kicked him out of the house. that was the only massive argument, but it’s caused me to lose trust. they argue often because my mom is also autistic (and so am i) and he doesn’t realize how things he says can hurt her.
 
i’ve told my mom on multiple occasions i don’t like steve, nor trust him. the amount of times i’ve had to console my mom because of him is ridiculous. he’s otherwise nice to my siblings and i, and my siblings like him, but i just cannot bring myself to accept him.

when he proposed they had only been dating a year, and didn’t ask my siblings or i if that was okay (which was part of his agreement after he and my mom made up after the big argument i mentioned above). and since them getting engaged, they got into another argument where steve interpreted my moms bluntness as abandonment and texted her saying “he’s gone” which my mom thought he was ending their relationship. i consoled her and admitted once again that i had never liked steve. that was two weeks ago- today i signed as a witness to their marriage (they did it just as paperwork- they were supposed to marry next year but he’s being deployed soon so they did the court thing).

i know my mom loves him, but i also know that they’re both catalysts for each others insecurities and past traumas. my mom knows i don’t approve of him (even though i treat him amicably) and my sister says i’m an asshole for not supporting our mom (even though i signed as a witness).

There are 5 kids in the family. There are the 3 older sisters, then myself(20M) and then my brother.

In September, he started dating this girl "" Cassidy"" we'll call her. From the time they started dating until now, she's what he talks about 97% of the time. Last month, he had her over to meet the family and we just weren't all that impressed.

I get that, because she's 18 she's going to say and do dumb stuff, but, I don't think it was smart to sit with your boyfriend's family and basically admit that you get blackout drunk on Fridays, spend Saturday in bed, and Sunday trying to get your bearings. Whereas we see a lost, wild child, he sees "" oh she's hot, she's so hot, and she's fun and it's awesome"", that's what he always comes back to when talking about her.

A couple of weeks ago, the 5 of us were hanging out at my sister's place and he out of the blue just starts saying that he and "" Cassidy"" have started to "" seriously consider"" what getting married might be like.

We thought he was kidding at first, but, when he started saying that he's looked at rings online and has compared those prices against his savings and mentioned how much she and him tell each other they're "" The One"" for one another, we realized he was pretty serious.

I told him he needs to wake up and be serious about what he's talking about. All I got back was, "" You guys just don't want to see me happy. It pisses you off that I'm happy. I'm going to do what I want.""

He took offense to what I said to him and called me an AH for implying that he hadn't put thought into this( I.E. his ring planning)

Our friendship grew to a point where we would text each other every day.

Being a guy, she would often come to me for dating advice and I would happily give her my two cents. Often, she would ask me to formulate messages for her to introduce herself on dating apps and so I did. 

Soon, she met a guy at a party that she fell head over heels for. I was really happy for her because I knew how badly she craved the companionship of a bf. However, this also marked a turning point in our friendship. 

Before she met him, we texted frequently but we rarely met up in person due to our schedules. After she met him, she no longer had any weekends that were available. I tried to book in a saturday where the two of us could meet for dinner. She said she had plans with her boyfriend everytime. I asked her for any weekend where she was free in the coming months and she said she usually keeps them all free for him. 
 
At first, this upset me because I thought she could find one weekend somewhere over the coming months to hang out. After some consideration, I figured I should let her enjoy her honeymoon phase and work around her weekday availability.

Over the next 6 months of her relationship our conversations took a turn and it became primarily about her boyfriend. While I didn't mind this, she often seemed unengaged by any conversation that wasn't to do with her boyfriend.

During these 6 months, I started to feel like I was losing my friend. She no longer answered my calls. It got to a point where she wouldn't even acknowledge that I had called. She would say she was busy but when we would message each other she would mention how she calls her boyfriend every day. 

After 6 months, her relationship came to an end. I thought this would change our friendship back to the way it used to be but she still never answered my calls. Still didn't engage in any conversation as much if it wasn't to do with the guys that she was interested in. 

She would often obsess over these guys she met online and go on and on about how attractive they are and ask me for advice on what to say to them. When I didn't know what to say she would tell me to be a better friend and demand that I help her. 

I called her out on it several times in the past but did it more blatantly in our last conversation. I asked that we talk about something else and said that I missed the days when we spoke of things like our plans for the future. I even suggested that she speak to a girl friend of hers that might understand this better than I would. 

She got the idea that this wasn't interested in talking about her crushes anymore and she said she won't bother me anymore. 

I sent follow-up messages apologising if i hurt her and explaining that I'm just tired of having the same conversation repeatedly about different guys she met online.

I’m shaking. 

I (40F) was married to my now ex (40M) and we had two children (M17, F14). He was very abusive, and I still suffer from PTSD. During the divorce, he claimed to be clean and getting help for his anger. His parents vouched for him, as well as the safety of our children, and I agreed to 50-50 custody. (He was not clean, but I didn’t find that out until after the divorce) 

I am remarried to E (40M). 

My ex recently (as in last week) lost 50-50 custody of our children. He had demanded a forensic psychological evaluation, repeatedly violated the court order to keep his house clean and not force the children to attend his church. Once the psych eval came back, he temporarily lost 50-50 custody, and it was made permanent last week. He was bumped to having them every other weekend and 2 hours during the week. He lost all legal authority over the kid’s medical, financial, educational, and religious decisions. He was also ordered to pay child support for the first time since our divorce. He was also to have the kids for thanksgiving this year.

The day after he lost custody, he told our daughter F, that he was marrying his girlfriend, and they would all be going to her house out of state for Thanksgiving. He met her online in September of this year. She lives in a neighboring state. I haven’t met her, and didn’t even know her last name or where she lived in the state, only the state in which she lived and her first name. Neither did our kids. 

I asked Ex, since I had never met his fiancée, and the kids really hadn’t either, if I could have her last name and at least an approximation of where she lived so I would know more about where the kids would be. Instead of telling me, he asked me why I felt I should be entitled to that information. He then demanded that I “ask nicely” and he would consider telling me. As an aside, he and his family literally stalked my husband and I. They knew we were seeing each other regularly before we had even decided to officially date, and Ex caused a lot of issues. 

E (husband) went onto Facebook and found her name since he did not have ex blocked. I told ex to nevermind, and I sent her a message introducing myself, congratulating her on her engagement, and asking if we could get to know each other a little bit better. When my ex found out I didn’t need him to tell me her name, he got pissed and kept demanding to know how I found out. I told him via Facebook. I told E that I had messaged her, and E told me I “massively overstepped” a boundary, and started acting like I had assaulted Ex’s privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

 So today I was at school, and I was basically on my phone, like a few of my other friends were. I was mainly scrolling through tiktok, when I realized I had to post my Snapstreak for the day. I was just about to get on snapchat, when the teacher rudely took my phone! I told him I needed it back, and she said unless it was for a medical reason, I wasn't having it back and my parents were coming to pick it up.  I almost had a panic attack due to this, as I have a 235 day Snapstreak. If my parents ground me, i'll lose it! I begged her to not take it, but she kept trying to rudely take it from me. I told her I was done, and I took my phone and ran out of the classroom and hid in the bathroom just before someone came to lock it.

 I rushed to get on as I have a pretty long password, and I had to keep from crying so security didn't catch me. I had to reset my password since I logged out of snapchat last night, so I had to wait for the email and then to reset my password. Apparently the teacher called security, and then the security person yelled at me to come out and that I was being sent to the office. I told her that if I didn't post my Snapstreak now, I would have a panic attack. She didn't care and told me to come out right now, and to shut her up, I did. 

When I came out of the stall security took my phone and I was sent to the office and then ISS for the rest of the day. When I got home from school, my parents told me I wasn't allowed to use my phone for a week. I begged and pleaded with them to let me have it as I needed to post my snapstreak for the day. They said they didn't care and that it didn't matter, and what I did was ""horrible"", although I didn't agree.  I went up to my room and just started crying. I couldn't lose my snapstreak now.

I moved into his apartment so we are still young and I’d like for us to have nice things while also saving money. He spends his money on collectibles if you know some of the Nintendo Switch game series like Pokémon Sword, Breath of the Wild, etc. 

My boyfriend complains when I ask him to have respect and table manners. And gets mad I don’t let him spend over $40 when I’m the one who’s pays every time we eat. I told him he’s fine to get whatever he wants if he pays, and he quickly got quiet.

He lashed out at todays lunch of my attempt to have a nice date with him. Because I said we probably shouldn’t order the expensive wagyu meat at this Japanese steak restaurant. 

I offered him to get another lower price or entree, and he snapped and said he feels like a dog having to be obedient because I told him to eat more carefully since he’s dropping food everywhere, eat quieter instead of shoving everything in his mouth. I told him to wait for the food that is raw (we went to a hotpot restaurant) and he snaps and says when he’s hungry he will eat.

He gave me the silent treatment the whole lunch, and got mad in the car and even yelled at me repeating the same thing. I’m not the extreme cheapskates, but I sometimes pick an appetizer or kids meal for my food just so he can get something nice but not insanely priced.

Some things to add is he has mental health and anger issues. Doesn’t like anybody (family or work) “telling him what to do”. I feel very disrespected a lot of the times because I cook and clean and he thinks me asking him to be more considerate of our budget is treating him like an animal.

We love our new apartment and try to take good care of it. On the regular, I definitely pick up more of the household chores than he does, but he does a decent amount to keep things clean. 

Jay’s parents are coming to visit for Thanksgiving, and I will not be here (I am going home to visit my parents this year.) His parents visit a lot. I’m talking like every 2-3 weeks since my boyfriend’s older sister recently had a baby and she lives in the same city as us. He also has a younger brother who lives near us. Jay’s parents are insistent on staying at our apartment over his brother or sister’s place when they come visit because they find it the most comfortable. I like his parents, but do find their constant visits a little overwhelming. Jay agrees, but isn’t comfortable confronting them about it. 

Anyway; their last visit was three weeks ago. Jay had a business trip scheduled. They asked if they could still stay with me even though Jay wasn’t going to be around. I asked Jay if they could maybe stay at one of his siblings’ places instead, but our place is definitely the biggest and most comfortable so he felt bad asking them to cram in to his brother or sister’s spot. It wasn’t a huge deal so I agreed. They day before they were set to arrive Jay left on his business trip. He’d had a stressful week and so the apartment was pretty messy when he left. I didn’t want his parents to come stay in a messy place, so I spent my whole Friday night cleaning for their visit- doing all the laundry and putting it away, washing all the sheets and towels for them and setting up the guest bed, dishes, vacuuming. Jay was very grateful, but if I’m being completely honest I was a little annoyed by the situation- me hosting his parents and being the only one prepping for their arrival despite there being other family members nearby who could have stepped in (I did share that with Jay, and he understood and apologized for putting me in that situation.)

Anyway, his parents are set to arrive tomorrow and Jay and I have both been slammed with work for the past few days. I left to go home to my family today, and admittedly left the place a little messy because I was stressed and rushing. Jay just got home from work and texted me, saying he’s super annoyed that I left the apartment messy and saying he doesn’t have time to properly clean it before his parents arrive. I pointed out how I cleaned and took care of his parents without his help last time, and mentioned that he’s not the only one busy with work and that we both need to be taking care of things equally around the house. He told me I was being spiteful and is now being short and cold towards me. I really feel like he’s viewing this situation selfishly, but he seems VERY annoyed with me.

I've got my own website and have been using that to learn all aspects involved (design, development, database design, seo, etc). Over the years it has grown into a mature product with about 1500 organic visitors a month in quite a niche subject.

My friend's partner is a medical specialist and he occasionally treats me, for which I pay his regular fee. Apparently my friend told him about my hobby and a while ago he asked whether we could swap services. He treats me for free while I help him out with his website for free. 

I told him I'm not a professional, but that I'm willing to try and if it doesn't work out I'll just go back to paying him. My expectation was that I had to make some code adjustments on his website but after a few chats it turned out it was SEO related to get (more) new customers to his site. 

I immediately told him that even with a professional online marketer it's not guaranteed that you'll get the results you want and that it will be a long and slow process with loads of tweaking and experimenting. I know the high level theory, but not the details. He still said he wanted me to try. 

I did many hours of research on his profession, his competitors and Google's algorithm. Based on that I advised him on what to do and he didn't understand, so I rewrote a few of his pages as examples. He partially used those, but left most of it as is.

I've got a full-time job, so only could do this in the evenings and weekends. By the time we were at this point, we were three months in. He treated me about 4 times (45 mins). I think I put about 30h in. 

At the last treatment he told me that there wasn't as much progress on his site as he expected and that his partner misjudged my skills. He wants me to pay for treatment again. I'm completely fine with that. No hard feelings, I didn't enjoy it that much anyway but I wanted to help out.

However, he now insists on me paying retrospectively for the treatments as I benefit from them and he didn't benefit from my help. He also increased my rate. I started off on ""friends"" rate and he says that's not applicable anymore?

I've always worked out of the home, doing very physically intensive work, such as retail, then dog grooming, and stripping. For the last 5 years, she's worked from home for a tech company, and most of her work requires her to solve customer issues, sit in meetings, and tech support. Occasionally, like once a month, she builds hardware.

When I was a stripper, she would constantly make remarks about how she wishes she could get paid to look pretty and be sexual with people. She's butch and puts and has a lot of insecurities about feeling unattractive, and puts a lot of validation weight on sex, so I know these are just marks of jealousy, but she has no idea how demanding that job was. I came home aching, bruised from entertaining on stage. Emotionally exhausted from playing therapist and traumatized from having personal boundaries crossed on a daily basis. 

Then with dog grooming, I'm lifting heaving dogs, hunched over giving baths and haircuts, and on my feet for 8 hours at a time. Im shit on, peed on, bit, scratched, and scolded by pet parents when their matted dogs need shave downs. 

Most of the time she wakes up whenever she wants because her boss doesn't check on when she actually starts working. She just has to be available for the company. She spends a lot of her time on the clock playing video games. She has board meetings every day for about an hour and once a month might have to build small devices, which I have helped her build when she gets behind from what honestly feels like slacking off until the deadline hits. 

Today I got home from work wanting to shower immediately because we had to clean out what we call ""the sludge"" at work. It's a 10 galleon fur trap in the plumbing of the grooming salon. I come home, get in the shower, and she starts doing dishes, making my water cold. Why couldn't she do the dishes while I was at work? Why immediately now when I'm covered in dog sewage? Then she got irritated with me when I didn't have the brain cells to think of dinner, and I apologized because I was so exhausted that I was fine with whatever decision she wanted to make, to which she told me that she was mentally exhausted today too after being in a meeting for 5 hours. A meeting? What I would give to sit at home and collect a paycheck just for listening to tech bros yak yak yak. I rolled my eyes because my back feels thrown out from grooming all day.

My friend of 5 years just broke up with her gf and is staying at my place. She is having a hard time but for some damn reason thinks it’s okey to bring random people to hook up with in my apartment. 

I get that some people gets over a breakup by looking for something fun but  its. Been. Every. Single. Night. For. A. Week. 

I don’t even know where she does it, I live in an apartment where I got one bedroom and then a “living room” with a a kitchen next to it. It’s important to know I am a male that lives with my gf and we both work full time so she brings people over when we are at work. 

Last night im me and my gf went out to dinner only to find them in my BED. Then she said that the kitchen floor wasn’t comfortable and my bed was. I started to scream at her telling her that she is a bad, irresponsible person and to get the fuck out of my apartment.

My friend if 5 years just broke up with her gf and is staying at my place. She is having a hard time but for some damn reason thinks it’s okey to bring random people to hook up with in my apartment. 

I get that some people gets over a breakup by looking for something fun but  its. Been. Every. Single. Night. For. A. Week. 

I don’t even know where she does it, I live in an apartment where I got one bedroom and then a “living room” with a a kitchen next to it. It’s important to know I am a male that lives with my gf and we both work full time so she brings people over when we are at work. 

Last night im me and my gf went out to dinner only to find them in my BED. Then she said that the kitchen floor wasn’t comfortable and my bed was. I started to scream at her telling her that she is a bad, irresponsible person and to get the fuck out of my apartment.

Ever since he got a boyfriend he has been bragging. At first I was happy for him. I said congrats and I was glad he seemed happy. He would say how great his boyfriend was. He’s not the most mature friend I have, but he’s funny. So it made sense he was acting with the puppy love young phase. Now, I am perfectly comfortable with my friends’ PDA around me. So him talking about his boyfriend all gushy did not bother me at all, I thought it was cute. I’m a big fan of romantic gushing. 

The problem started when my friend started saying things like “should I invite my boyfriend to the discord server” “I’m thinking about inviting my boyfriend” “I don’t know if I should invite my boyfriend.” Everyone in our entire friend group said invite him if you want to but no pressure. We just ignored it because he kept going back and forth. This has gone on for about a month.

Then today my friend said “I plan to invite my boyfriend but I can’t if I don’t have the reassurance you guys will behave properly. Can I get what I need to prepare or we gonna act like children?”

This upset me. So I asked “FYM behave? What do you think we’re going to do?”

“I mean act like humans not monkeys I can see (friend name) plotting already.
Im gonna introduce him and do activities where y’all look like normal human species for 2 hours while he’s gonna be here getting to know my friends. Im gonna plan it out. If all goes right I’ll boost y’all to hold on Val.”

(These are all messages directly from text)

I told him he seems embarrassed of us and I don’t want to meet his boyfriend if he is going to treat me that way. I also told him to F off with his boosting, lame bribery. I wasn’t going to do anything bad or mean, I don’t think any of our friends would. And at this point I don’t want to meet his boyfriend. I was extra offended he thought he needed to plan ahead activities to do for a meeting over a discord server to make us look normal. It’s discord we just had to type “hi.”

I mentioned before he is not the most mature friend that I have but most of my friend group makes immature/sexual jokes. So I understand where he is coming from. But I am disappointed he acted like I don’t know how to stop. I always stop if someone tells me to with jokes. He acted like he was embarrassed of our friend group and sense of humor (it is just immature humor, nothing sensitive or offensive.)

My friend is now upset and went silent after I said “Sorry your boyfriend won’t find us funny. Not my problem.”

So: I think I could be the asshole because of the way I acted to my friend. By getting so upset, defensive, and swearing. I could also be overreacting greatly about the activities thing. Maybe he just wanted to plan a smooth first meeting. My other friend expressed she is also upset and feels like our friend doesn’t trust us. But we are sensitive and emotional people.

But nothings worked. Well we finally got convinced by some friends to get tested to figure out the source of the issue, after months of denial, and the issue is on my end, unfortunately, since I have Klinefelter syndrome (didn’t even know, but it explains a lot of things from my childhood I didn’t really think much about before).

Well, despite my sudden diagnosis, I thought this meant we’d go the adoption route. But my wife is very against it. She says she wants to experience the pregnancy herself, especially now that she knows she’s totally healthy. So she’s interested in visiting a sperm bank. 

And here’s where I might be super selfish. I don’t mind raising a child who is not related to either of us, even if it means going through the arduous adoption process. But I feel like knowing our child is related only to my wife and not me (and instead just some random guy) makes me feel…uncomfortable and a bit left out in a weird way. I get that this may be a super immature “all or nothing” mindset, but idk that’s just how I feel about it.

I told my wife this is a dealbreaker for me. And she got super upset, and said that if she doesn’t experience her first child via her own pregnancy, she’ll always resent me. I asked her to keep this discussion between the two of us, but I guess it leaked to her family because her parents are really mad at me. They keep saying that if I truly love her, then I’ll make her happy. And that either way, the baby won’t be related to me so it doesn’t matter in the end, and that one I see the baby and hold it, I’ll forget I’ll about that stuff. Which, again, I get where they’re coming from, and they’re probably right. But it’ll still sort of break my heart in a way. And I don’t want to agree to bring a child into this world until I’m absolutely sure, you know?

obviously a throwaway

I (14F) and my mother (47F) Have an amazing relationship, yes there are a few up and downs along the road but she has been nothing but kind and supportive to me, i love her so much, a **kind request to not slander her in the comments.**

Let me begin by saying I have major procrastination issues, I'm pretty sure it has something to do with anxiety and its an unhealthy coping mechanism, I also have a crippling device addiction and my parents have tried helping me overcome it but to no avail.

I used to score very well on all my exams earlier and i was motivated to study, however sometimes i would have nightmares that i didn't study for an exam until a night before and failed that exam the next day, I would occasionally wake up sweating and having heart palpitations in the night or experience insomnia. I recently figured it was due to academic stress, in my country we are judged based on our academic performance and i was outcasted and singled out from groups solely due to my academic performance at times.

Then got a phone and it became my anchor it was the only reason i didn't have anxiety anymore and it kept me sane, until i started using it too much, my mother and father tried their very best to help me but it didn't help, fast forward to a few months later, i have my first terminal examinations and my nightmares literally start coming true, this made me have panic attacks. Ofcourse my mother consoled me and i came out of the exams with average marks. This lead to me procrastinating again and again and again over and over, now it been two years, then second term of Ninth grade comes around as usual the cycle repeats itself, except this time it is the first year after Covid and the course has practically tripled itself and i have no clue how to study for it in the night before my exam. my mother tells me to study beforehand but ofc i don't listen because of the dumb fucking person i am, but this time my mother is tired of it, she is fed up of my panic attacks, I've asked her for help but she says that i will just be given meds If i get professional help and she has sent me to the school counselor instead. She says that I cant go to her for help with panic attacks anymore, Idk what do to my dad says its okay if i fail, but if i do i will get held back a year which scares the living shit out of me.

Before i had my first out of country holiday with my mom and friend. It wasn't enjoyable as i expected than i wanted to be because my mom interferes on the food we wanted to eat. She only wants to eat at McDonald's since doesn't want to eat the local foods which is frustrating for me. She doesn't want to try new things. I want to enjoy the local foods and their culture. Whenever we spend she will convert the price to our local currency. Then end up not buying it because it was too expensive for her.

We went to an amusement park, she doesn't want to ride the rides. She just sat there while me and my friend tried every ride in the park. It's no problem to me since that was the only time i had a liberty to do what i want. We're supposed to go to another tourist attraction but she said she wanted to visit her friend.

She gets cravings like that all the time and to be fair non of us knew what to decide to eat that evening because we had eaten everything we usually did and we couldn’t think of anything within our budget. We were all broke and I didn’t want to disappoint her by saying no or saying it was too expensive.
The location was a little far and we usually have to get a taxi or an Uber. 
I was going to get it when I got this idea to ask my sister who was in town to buy it on her way home . She had told me earlier she was going to see her friend and wouldn’t be long . So I called to ask her about her location and she told me she was about 7 mins away from the restaurant and about 20 mins from the house (that’s when you’re driving) and so I told her about the request and she accepted. 
I called her 1hr 30 mins later to ask where she was and why I haven’t heard from her. She told me she was now leaving her friend’s house (the distance is considerably farther) and before I could ask her why she didn’t tell me, She hang up. So I walked to the place and bought the food and texted her not to buy the food again to which she replied “finally “ and picked an Uber because it was less expensive than the taxi after comparing the prices and when I came home ,my mum declined to eat the food because our older sister already served her. 
She came home hours later and I sat her down and asked her gently to let me know if she can’t do something but telling me she’s minutes away when she’s hours away is not fair. 
She started to talk about her reasons I’d heard before so I cut her off telling her I didn’t want to hear it but that all I’m telling her is that she shouldn’t do that . And she replied that if I didn’t want to listen, she has no reason to listen to me and put in her earpiece increasing the volume claiming I was ruining her mood and then I replied that claiming I was ruining her mood was nonsense. Then she got angry taking out the earpiece yelling that she was insulted and making the same points that she was making earlier on .
That I didn’t know what she was doing and she could have been busy.
That she’s an adult and doesn’t have bear the responsibility of everyone’s dinner( it wasn’t for everyone just my mum) 
When she claimed to be a few mins away do I know if she had gotten an Uber or was waiting for one ? That was a new one.
I told her during the time she was yelling the first two points that I agree with her that she doesn’t have to put that burden on herself and shouldn’t say yes to something that’s clearly an inconvenience which creates misunderstandings.
I don’t know if she heard me but she kept yelling about how I disrespected her by saying “nonsense” to her.

I gave birth through c-section.
For context, I was not ready for pregnancy and I was from start on the edge about it, and everybody knew that, I wasn’t hiding it.
Everyone said that it’ll be alright and that I don’t need to worry. I thought I had support system and that people will help me go through this time. 
I was very very wrong.
My parents basically didn’t even care about me. My mother made my pregnancy hell. She constantly fought me, made her self a victim although I literally worked my ass of for money they received (won’t go in much detail for anonymity reasons but I had some extra time and improved their business massively). 
My partner on the other hand was perfect till that moment. When I say perfect, I mean it. He would do anything for me, he really wanted this child, family with me.
He works in another state and is not here often. From moment I found out I was pregnant till birth he was with me 2 months total.
When he was away he never wanted to talk about things that bother me, my AC unit was broken (and other things) during summer and i was heavily pregnant and when I would complain he would ask not to bother him because he works. He never remembered dates of ultrasounds. Once I had big scare at ultrasound and he didn’t even remembered I had one that day. I had no one to talk to. Nobody checked in on me, nobody asked me how I was. I had irrational fears, I was constantly worried about earthquakes, wars… if anything happens I’m alone and I can’t run. Every women says that it’s so annoying having to hear all the advices but I had none. I didn’t have any belly rubs, no one cared about my back pains, no feed rubs. I did baby shopping on my own, every ultrasound on my own,I ate poorly because I didn’t have energy for cooking, I couldn’t sleep. I was crying every night. I checked in hospital on my own. Spent there 10 days and gave birth through caesarean. When I got home my partner was there and he help me massively with baby. But then he wanted to have sex after 10 days and made me to go to walk although I was I pain. 
He’s great father but I feel disrespected and betrayed from him and  everyone around me. I was all alone during my most vulnerable stages. Tik Tok mommas really helped me and I don’t know how I would have made it without them. I felt like someone understands me. But at the same time I was seeing all the cute pregnancy videos with their supportive partners and families and I felt so so sad because I didn’t have that.

for a little back story, my parents were never together. i am basically the product of a christmas break fling. 
i live currently with my mother and 2 half sisters (9f) (5f). my dad married my step mom a couple years back and is heavily pregnant with my 2nd brother. at my dads house i have a 2 half siblings (2m) (4f) and a step sister (9f)
anyways onto the actual story 
my dad wants to give away my room upstairs and have me set up a room downstairs in the guest room, so my little brother and soon to be other brother can have a room upstairs for themselves. 
it may not seem like a big deal to many but i have dealt with issues of isolation in my dads family for years. i never feel like i belong there. as silly as it sounds having a bedroom upstairs makes me feel like im actually acknowledged as a family member in his home, since i only spend every other weekend at his place. 
i have communicated this to him before and he has said that he understands ( which he obviously does not understand since he is the youngest and never grew up in a split house hold) but he just never seems to take me seriously. i have not told him about me feeling isolated in this moving rooms situation because it just seems pointless to me at this point. i tried to argue with him but he stated that he needs the room upstairs so he can monitor my younger siblings. and since im only there for weekends its just not practical. i guess i can understand that… maybe i am being too bratty and spoiled.
idk i just feel like he doesn’t consider my feelings or anything regarding this…
like i said growing up in a split household and having to switch between 2 different places suck. i feel like i am constantly in the middle and ignored and pushed out since i really just dont fit anywhere.

We bought a new house last month and it came with a big, beautiful garden, including a nice pear tree that's right by the brick wall to the neighbors garden. I love pears!  
To clarify: Our tree doesn't hang over the other property but since the neighbor's garden has a higher ground level than ours, it is very easy for them to reach over the wall and pick the fruits.  


So a few days after moving in I was in the garden and saw the neighbor lady picking our pears. She seemed a tiny bit embarrassed upon noticing me but when I came closer she said that the previous house owners didn't like pears and always allowed them to pick the fruit so they won't spoil.  
Fair enough, but I told her then that I happen to love pears and I'd like to keep our crop.  


She was visibly miffed when I told her that but she left the fruits she picked on top of the wall (....where I cannot reach them) and left.  
I tried not to think much of it, but the next day I encountered her husband doing the same. Picking the fruit. I told him the same thing I told her already and he replied that it's only some pears and that the world would be such a bad place if everyone would make such a fuss about it like I do.

I wasn't aware that I was making a fuss? I simply thought that if it's my property and my tree and if it doesn't hang over to their garden - can I not keep it? Why does he think he's entitled to our crop??

I just left then because I was so mad and I didn't wanna risk saying anything mean, but I talked to my husband and he said that the neighbors are right and I shouldn't worry about it, afterall we can just buy pears in the supermarket and it's no big deal.  
Yeah sure, technically he's right, but I just can't get over the entitlement of these people! If they think they have the rights to things that aren't theirs, will it stop at just fruit trees? Or will they suddenly show up in my garden, playing ball and acting like they can do anything they want like in some creepy netflix series??

I don't want some ""neighborhood war"" or whatever but I find their behavior preposterous. Am I really the ass here for telling them to keep their paws off my crop?

She spoke with our eldest sister and they decided to split the expenses 3 ways between us. Host sister is known to be stingy with her money outside her immediate family. To not ruffle any feathers I agreed. Keep in mind, myself and our eldest sister have hosted turkey day and incurred all expenses without anyone chipping in. So I was budgeting to chip in about $100 max. In the past Ive hosted, with the same number of people (15+) Ive spent about $250. I didn’t skimp on the amount of food or quality ingredients, I bought truffle butter from a specialty store FFS. My sisters went grocery shopping for all the foods. That night host sister texted me that she added up all receipts and it came out to $250 each. I sincerely thought this was a mistake and asked if it was $250 divided by the 3 siblings. She replied no. It is $250 per sibling. I was gobsmacked. I was incredulous, angry, and asking myself what on gods earth did they buy? So after a little while of going through all the stages of grief I called our youngest sister who tagged along for the grocery shopping. Side note : youngest sister just lost her job and is currently job hunting. She has also hosted turkey day before, incurring all expenses. She already knew why I was calling. She said our host sister basically tripled up on everything. Triple turkeys, triple amount of sides (corn, green beans, potatoes, bread, milk, drinks, alcohol etc…) She kept telling them it was too much. She said our niece, 23yo, daughter of host sister was also throwing in “day of” snacks. Obscene amount of chips, dips, cookies, ice cream, cakes. This is in addition to the all the pies they purchased. They went to checkout and she kept telling them “hey the total keeps going up, don’t you think we should cut back on some stuff?” Host sister said no. The kicker to all of this is, our eldest sister was somehow roped into paying for the grocery haul. So in essence I don’t even owe the money to host sister, I owe our eldest sister. After the call I call host sister. In the most even tempered princess voice (host sister is known to have her feelings easily hurt, quick to get defensive and can hold onto a grudge for ages) I ask about the expenses. She said that things are expensive and it is what it is. So I asked if I could see the receipts. She immediately gets defensive, says not to chip in any money and says she cant wait to see me on Turkey day (sarcastically) and abruptly hangs up. I try calling, no answer. Call my nieces to ask for their mother and they say shes busy. So Ive decided just to give the money to eldest sister and call it a day.

We moved into his dad's house. This house was not owned by his dad, just rented by him for a really long time and it was full of his stuff. His dad left on deployment and agreed to pay for a room while he was gone. Me and bf split rent unequally, he payed more, because I am a broke college student and he makes good money at a full-time job. 

I had originally told him I would only live with him over the summer because I knew I couldn't afford it long-term, and I could be living at my parents for free. But even after I ran out of savings, he said he wanted me to live there and would pay for my share of our stuff. I thought this was really sweet.

When I first moved in I spent a good chunk of my savings on decorating the house. I bought new curtains, wall decor, shelves, lamps, plants, carpets, outdoor patio lights etc. I intentionally picked out stuff that I really liked for future use because I'm not going to live with my parents forever, and I spent a good amount of money on it.  When it was time to move out I tried to pack up the stuff I had bought and my boyfriend got really angry. He told me I was being selfish and than he had assumed the decorations were for his house not for me. I told him I would leave the curtains and outdoor lights for the house but I wanted my lamps and wall stuff. He insisted that I was being selfish and we got in a massive fight.

I think it's not fair for him to feel entitled to things I bought even though he supported me financially. I told him I couldn't afford to live there long-term and would have moved out at any point if I was a burden to him. I didn't plan on living there past a few short months when I bought the decorations, I thought I could afford it. We only stayed together because we were having fun and got comfortable.

I ended up letting him keep everything, I figured we'd move in again soon anyways. However this went sour because his dad came back and ended up moving out permanently from that rental house. When he did my boyfriend offered to give him all the decor I bought. And even had the audacity to say you're welcome when his dad thanked him!! I got in a huge fight with him about this and he told me I wasn't grateful enough for what his dad did for me?! He said his dad gave us the chance to live on our own for cheap by ""letting us live there."" All his dad did was pay for a room? His dad didn't want to lose the house and didn't want to buy a storage unit for all his stuff. My boyfriend told me I owed his dad and the least I could do was leave the stuff I bought ""for the house."" This just really confuses me because its not like his dad owned the house, it was just a regular rental agreement with a landlord.

So his dad moved away with some of my stuff, and my boyfriend took some of my stuff back to his new place.

I’ve always been close with my cousin Ray (28M) I had a toxic relationship with one of his good friends when I was in my 20s. Let’s call him Luke.

Ray and Luke met in college, they were teammates on the basketball team. Once they graduated, Ray moved back to our hometown, Luke followed and they got an apartment together.

I met Luke through Ray and we started intensely dating.

Then I got pregnant and he started acting  strangely toward me, told me he wasn’t ready for kids and it would get in the way of his future (which he thought was an NBA career 🙄). I had a miscarriage, which was absolutely devastating and traumatic at the time. He ghosted me shortly after, stopped returning any calls or texts. 

I didn’t see or talk to him again for years. That was 2015. In 2018, Rays little sister, got into a car accident. I went back home to be with family. At the hospital Luke apologized to me for how things ended and said he wasnt immature and didn’t appreciate what we had. We started hooking up again, poorest of judgment of my part. Things were good until I realized he had a girlfriend, who was pregnant. He had kicked her out and she was living with her parents, but they were still together.

Once, I found about her I flipped out. All the unresolved emotions of the miscarriage and the fact that he was having a baby with someone else sent me over the edge. I found her on media and messaged her that we had been hooking up and that same night I slashed his tires.

He was livid I told her. We had a big blow up resulting in him getting in my face. Told me to delete his number and he never wanted to see me again. It caused a bit a rift between Ray and I, I feel like he didn’t defend me. I get Luke is his best friend but I didn’t think a 6’7 dude should be in my face yelling and I expected my cousin to do more.

Anyway life went on. I followed Luke’s instructions and haven’t seen or talked to  him since. He never made it to the NBA, but did manage to have another kid with another woman. I have since gotten married to an amazing man and we have a one year old. 

We spent thanksgiving with my husbands family last year and had planned to spend with mine this year.

Ray and his wife recently bought a house and want to host, awesome. Rays wife let me know Luke will be at thanksgiving, not awesome. 

The thought of seeing or talking to this man makes me sick. I cannot think of anything more awkward than sitting at a dinner table with my husband and someone I had such a dramatic past with.

Rays wife tried to talk to him about it and he told her I need to “get over it,” I told her to tell him if that’s the case he’s choosing friends over family and I won’t be there. 

I’m so upset. It’s not like this man is an orphan, he has a mother, a father, and not to mention 2 children he can spend the day with. Why does he have to spend thanksgiving with my family?

They’re high school sweet hearts and my BIL is also my best friend. My sister and I are extremely close and the three of us have always looked out for each other. My sister MIL is not too fond of us and our family, lifestyle, way of upbringing. She is very religious, stern in her ways, believes women should stay home and raise children (the way she did), etc. My mother raised us to be very independent, speak our minds respectfully, and follow whatever paths fit suited to our desired lifestyles. Very non judge-mental and free minded. MIL has never truly approved of my sister or her outgoing and extremely funny personality, but they both fake it for the sake of keeping the peace. Fast forward to the beginning of the month, my BIL and sister just had their first baby. Prior to the birth of my beautiful niece, my sister and BIL expressed firmly they did not want family or guests for thanksgiving and that they wanted to celebrate their first holiday as a small family. My mom offered to bring them a small Turkey and Ham for the two of them in the morning, as she would be going back home to host Thanksgiving for the rest of the family. MIL, on the other hand, has taken it upon herself to invite herself over for Thanksgiving to my sisters house, saying she doesn’t want to go to her family’s house for Thanksgiving this year. BIL has mentioned multiple times he will not be cooking and doesn’t want anyone over, however, his mom believes that doesn’t apply to her. My sister has come to me, multiple times, on how this woman invites herself over unannounced almost every weekend, requires my sister and my BIL to cook for her and expects them to be okay with her coming over whenever she wants. My sister, while a great person with a kind heart, is very non confrontational and avoids conflict and problems. My BIL has no problem standing up to his mother but only to an extent, as he doesn’t want to make his mom mad. My sister has been very exhausted from hosting people at her house since the baby was born, barely any sleep, uncomfortable, you know, life as a new mother. She expressed to both me and my mom that she doesn’t want her MIL there at the house for Thanksgiving. 

I finally told my mom that I’m considering sending a message to MIL stating if she could please respect my sisters wishes of wanting to spend their first holiday together as a family so that my sister and BIL do not have to worry about being any kind of hosts for the holiday.

Tammy had met Abe out at the club, while she was out with friends getting over her long-term relationship that has recently ended. Abe seems nice, but he is not really Tammy’s usual type. I figured he was just a rebound and didn’t think too much into their relationship when she mentioned they were going on dates. But after a couple dates with him, they were official, and she claimed that he is the love of her life. I am a firm believer that there isn’t a timeline for falling in love since I know it just happens, however my sister seems to know nothing about this guy, and the things she does know just don’t add up. He is from another country, which I don’t think is an issue, but Abe said he is here seeking political asylum from his home country. He never elaborates on why he is seeking asylum, just that he was in danger. He was married and has a child in his home country and got divorced and left the child there. He hasn’t seen or spoken to the child in over 6 years. I know everyone has their reasons, but if he believes his home country is so dangerous, he had to flee, wouldn’t he have taken his child or done everything in his power to get him here? He was also married again about a year ago, but he was separated only six months later. Abe says that his ex was cheating on him, and he also says that his ex-stalks him and calls his mom to tell her terrible things about Abe. He claims that she often sees him out with Tammy, but Tammy has never seen the ex in person. Abe always seems to know where his ex is and what she is doing, but claims he has no contact with her. Because his ex-cheated on him, Abe uses it to validate his trust issues with my sister. He always face-times her and makes her show him who she’s with, and if she doesn’t answer when he calls, he yells at her. When they first became official, they got in a fight because a past fling had sent a text to Tammy. Abe got very angry, even though Tammy had not responded and blocked the fling. Abe continued to not talk to her for a week and told her to pick up her things from his apartment. He then denied ever telling her that and blamed the silence on her not communicating with him. Today I was Facebook stalking him, trying to piece together some bit of who he is, when I noticed that some of the profiles that liked his post were just profiles that belong to him with different variations of his name. There are probably 5-6 profiles that I have found that belong to him, all with different variations of his name. His Facebook that he used to friend my family doesn’t even have his real name on it. I know that I might just sound crazy, but something feels off about Abe. I’ve even talked to Tammy about my concerns, and she admitted that if it was one of her friends in this relationship, she would probably think they were crazy.

We’re both artists and frequently attend local and a few international fan conventions (anime, Comics, etc.)

We’ve been table partners for 5 years now since we were old enough to legally apply. We just ended up working well together as our styles and interests are different enough to not steal each other’s clients. However, while my partner views conventions as their professional job and goes all in, I do it as a hobby and to support them.

My family is strict and would’ve never agreed to let me pursue art full time.  So I got a degree, then found a full-time job after school. My art is not as nice as theirs, since I didn’t invest nearly as much time developing it. I almost never make back the money I spend to book tables and print merch. 

My friend, on the other hand, has done well for himself. He can make enough money for the year by simply hitting a few staple conventions. I go with him most, but I usually skip out overseas as it’d be a money sink.

When the convention is close enough, I’m the one who drives. My partner doesn’t have a license and I’m not lugging heavy merch on public transport.

This year we got into the staple conventions my partner dubbed the “money maker”. The tables aren’t too expensive and the turnout is typically huge. The only problem is the tables are a lottery, and my table partner isn’t the luckiest.

I managed to get a table for the 5th year in a row, and it’s a given that I offered the secondary artists position to him. He’s already made plans around this and has started ordering his next batch of prints to prepare, though the convention is still months away.

The problem is my workplace has recently informed me of a training conference taking place that same weekend. It’s not mandatory to go, but it will affect my job performance and I’ve been working hard all year to get a promotion. My manager has already made it clear that attending this conference would pretty much seal the deal.

But if I go, then I won’t be able to check in for the convention, thus disqualifying our claim on the table. I already asked the organizers of the con if I can give the table to my partner, but they said no as it’s against their rules (There’s a long wait list if people drop out). 

I want to go to this conference, I know I would only lose money by going to this con anyways; but when I even mentioned not going to the con, my partner flipped out.

He said I was pretty much dooming him since this con makes him the most money and he wouldn’t be able to afford his rent or stuff without it. I feel really bad about this, but I don’t think it’s my responsibility to manage his finances. What would he have done if I hadn’t even gotten the table in the first place?

I consider her one of my best friends and she has expressed the same sentiments to me. She introduced me to a group of friends a year ago that quickly accepted me as one of their own. 

Four months ago one of our mutual friends B (28) used a slur that I found offensive. I privately asked B if they'd avoid saying that slur around me in the future. B freaked out on me and harassed me to the point where I needed to take a mental health break from the group. 

A month ago I began slowly talking to the group again and seemed to be welcome back with open arms. Last week, a mutual friend of K's reached out to me and told me that in order to remain in the group, I need to apologize to B. I refused, mainly because B hadn't apologized to me. 6/8 members of the group have deleted my number, blocked me, and refuse to meet up with me in person. 

K has remained my friend, but continues to be friends with the group. It doesn't bother me that she's still friends with them. I expected her to be. What bothers me is that she continues to talk about the group as if I never left. I've asked her to not talk about it for a few days because of how upsetting the situation is... yet she continues to tell me about the fun things they're doing with me gone. 

I understand that it's been a stressful time for her as well, but she didn't lose 6 close friends in the span of 24 hours. I have been avoiding her for three days now. I feel horrible for avoiding her, but I am not in the mental state to listen to stories involving my former friends.

So I (21F) moved in with my BF (23M). We moved into his dad's house. This house was not owned by his dad, just rented by him for a really long time and it was full of his stuff. His dad left on deployment and agreed to pay for a room while he was gone. Me and bf split rent unequally, he payed more, because I am a broke college student and he makes good money at a full-time job.

I had originally told him I would only live with him over the summer because I knew I couldn't afford it long-term, and I could be living at my parents for free. But even after I ran out of savings, he said he wanted me to live there and would pay for my share of our stuff. I thought this was really sweet.

When I first moved in I spent a good chunk of my savings on decorating the house. I bought new curtains, wall decor, shelves, lamps, plants, carpets, outdoor patio lights etc. I intentionally picked out stuff that I really liked for future use because I'm not going to live with my parents forever, and I spent a good amount of money on it. When it was time to move out I tried to pack up the stuff I had bought and my boyfriend got really angry. He told me I was being selfish and than he had assumed the decorations were for his house not for me. I told him I would leave the curtains and outdoor lights for the house but I wanted my lamps and wall stuff. He insisted that I was being selfish and we got in a massive fight.

I think it's not fair for him to feel entitled to things I bought even though he supported me financially. I told him I couldn't afford to live there long-term and would have moved out at any point if I was a burden to him. I didn't plan on living there past a few short months when I bought the decorations, I thought I could afford it. We only stayed together because we were having fun and got comfortable.

I ended up letting him keep everything thinking we would move in together in the future and I would be reunited with my stuff anyways. However this went sour because his dad came back and ended up moving out permanently from that rental house. When he did my boyfriend offered to give him all the decor I bought. And even had the audacity to say you're welcome when his dad thanked him!! I got in a huge fight with him about this and he told me I wasn't grateful enough for what his dad did for me?! He said his dad gave us the chance to live on our own for cheap by ""letting us live there."" All his dad did was pay for a room? His dad didn't want to lose the house and didn't want to buy a storage unit for all his stuff. My boyfriend told me I owed his dad and the least I could do was leave the stuff I bought ""for the house."" 

So his dad moved away with some of my stuff, and my boyfriend took some of my stuff back to his new place.

Vans like mine are the reason the space between handicap parking spots are so wide. 

This afternoon I exited a store and cruised across the parking lot towards my van which was parked in the first handicap spot, with a wide stripped area to the right side where the ramp will fall into. As I approached my van I noticed that an SUV was parked in the handicap spot next to me, but had parked so poorly that the car was about 1/3 of the way into the stripped area. Upon closer investigation of the SUV I discovered that they did not have a handicap license plate or placard hanging from the mirror, which means they are parked illegally. 

I proceeded to drop my ramp and discovered that sure enough the SUV put me in a pickle by parking so poorly into the strips. I now had a decision to make. Either I sit outside in the cold until the owner comes out, or go back inside the store and ask for them to make an announcement for the owner to move the car, or I use my superb driving skills and figure out how to squeeze in the space between my ramp and the SUV, possibly scratching the SUV.

Since I was cold and really needed to get home to use the bathroom I decided to go for the squeeze. My chair has a center drive wheel with caster wheels on each corner and the most I can drive the caster over the side of the ramp is about two inches which gives me almost enough room to straighten out inline with the ramp to enter the van. I say almost because the back of my left armrest made contact with the door of the SUV and made quite a mess of the paint, right down to the metal.

Max is a sweet kid but has a difficult time in unfamiliar situations and can get overstimulated easily.

A little while ago, my husband was across the country on a work trip, while I was home with Max. I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.

I called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.

I called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), ""Sarah."" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.

I should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.

She showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, ""well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X..."" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.

A few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.

To be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

I have 4 roommates. 3 of them are buddies of mine from last semester. The last one is a random assigned to us. This past Saturday I was at a tailgate for my schools football game and one of my other friends almost got into a fight and then I almost got dragged into a fight. The whole thing hand me angry and excited. When I went to the cafeteria to vent and let everything out the random room asked insensitive questions like “was there any blood?” Or “who won?” I told him that’s not cool to ask right now and he didn’t seem to get it so he kept doubling down. It got to a point where he was told by me and the other 4 people at the table to shut up. He kept going. Eventually he starting saying messed up things like “stop being a P*ssy” and “get your tampon out of your butt”. Even while he was walking away he wouldn’t stop. My friends had to stop my from hitting him. We tried to explain that he was being insensitive. Fast forward to today, I sent him a text basically saying that what he did wasn’t cool and not to let that happen again cause I was very close to attacking him. He got defensive and said I was the problem and not him and I could have “roasted him back and moved on”. When I walk back to my apartment after class I tell him that I wasn’t interested in roasting cause I was genuinely mad. He tried roasting me a ton over text and said I should have just confronted him in person but when I tried to he because evasive and left quickly. I’m worried that before he left I started to raise my voice and cuss at him so I ask Am I the A-hole for cussing him out after everything",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4813545,public,top,self,AITA for snapping on my roomate,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1dm1d/aita_for_snapping_on_my_roomate/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I got worried that he did
something like really bad or something of that nature. (He's a good kid and it seemed very out of nature for him to get called into the office) I texted him back, asking why/what happened as I took a nap during lunch
but, he didn't end up responding in that moment due to him being with the principal, I would obviously assume….. We both have the same period 7 class together, and it was about 20 minutes into the period
when he texted me that he was okay, and a few minutes later he showed up to class. Of course, naturally I was curious to why he was pulled into the principals office
and I asked him why. However, he was clearly reluctant to tell me as he was beating around the bush. And then
he said he couldn't tell me because quote ""That's how rumors spread"" end quote, I was confused by this because I feel like he knows I wouldn't go around telling
everyone that he did such and such and ended up in the principals office. I feel like being upset over him not telling may seem a bit childish to some people reading
this post, or it seems like I'm making a big deal about him not wanting to tell me as to why he ended up in the principals office. But in my point of view, as it seems today he doesn't trust me as much, as I trust him and I didn't prod anymore after, because he was clearly adamant on not wanting to tell me and seemed to be getting
annoyed. And I didn't want to pull the don't you trust me card and made it seem like I was forcing him into telling me.  I don't want to talk about it with anyone I know because I don't want to spread that he was in there. I really care about him and trust him but it doesn't seem as if he trusts me.
