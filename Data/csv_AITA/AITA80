She has only come once for our wedding, so we haven't seen her in years and wanted her to meet her grandkids (5 and 2) 

I really don't know her at all. My only interaction with her has been the wedding. She wanted to wear something cultural but I asked her not to wear white (traditional mother of the groom color in the Philippines) and she told people behind my back that I am a racist bitch and ugly. When confronted she just cried and said she was blowing off steam and accused me of racism.

I've hardly spoken to her in my life, so that was my one impression of her. I know she was super anxious about coming alone, so I tried to be as welcoming as possible. MIL came and I thought things were ok, but then she began receiving all these deliveries of food and a family member drove an hour to bring her a casserole.

I was confused and when I talked to the family member, she said MIL's husband had contacted her and claimed she was starving and he was ordering what groceries he could, but any food they could bring her would help. I was even more confused. We have food in the house and I cook every night.

I talked to MIL she admitted she had been calling her husband crying because she was hungry. She said I didn't make her breakfast (didn't know I had to. I eat something quick before work) and didn't tell her she could eat our food or use our kitchen (again didn't know I had to) so she just hadn't been eating.

I could feel my blood boiling and yelled why wouldn't you just ask. I said she humiliated me and should have come to me instead of running to her husband like a cry baby. She began sobbing. My husband came in and backed me, and MIL kept screaming for us to get out. I did but muttered it is our room.

All of her stuff is gone now. She must had left through a back door. She ignored our calls, so I sent a text, but now family from America and from back in the Philippines are calling us disrespectful assholes.

Since she got engaged amy's been incredibly entitled. She was bad before as she was the golden child and insanely spoiled, but she's gotten so much worse. She made me her maid of honor and it's been a living hell. She's had me organize 3 bachelorette parties. Literally be her wedding planner, communicate and arrange everything because she ""can't deal with the stress"".  Not to mention she's stolen literally every. Single. Detail. I wanted for my own wedding. 

She demanded I cut my hair and don't wear makeup on her day, when asked why she said she doesn't want anyone looking better than her. I said no and she told me it was a compliment because she was saying I'm pretty but I said I'm not cutting my hair. it's past my waist and I've spent 7 years growing it from a pixie cut, she wants it shoulder length. I said I'm happy not to wear makeup but my hair stays. She dropped it and apologized for asking. 

3 days later she had me round for the night, we had a few drinks and I started to feel sick. I couldn't get upstairs so passed out on the couch. When I woke up I still felt crap and went for a shower. That's when I noticed Amy had cut my hair in my sleep. I screamed at her and she said now I have no choice and I should've just listened to her. I called her a psycho and sobbed the whole way home.

 I got my hair fixed as best I could but it's now just below my shoulders, I told her I wasn't coming and no longer MOH. I returned my dress and sent her an invoice for all the money I spent on the parties and invested in the wedding (About $2,000) then blocked her.

Our dad called me and told me he knows I'm upset but it's her big day and I'll kick myself forever if I miss it over a fight. He said he will pay me back as long as I attend and I can't get extensions. Her friends are contacting me saying I'm an AH for billing her things I chose to pay for. Most agreed what she did was extreme but pointed out she always finds a way to get what she wants and ""hair grows back but she won't have another wedding."" 

I do not want to go but I want my money and the more I think about it the more I think they have a point but I'm just so mad

We dated for roughly a year and a half then I broke it off right around the end of our senior year. Although the relationship didn't end ""well"" (she was pretty upset/called me derogatory words/etc), I managed to firmly end all contact with her. Also it might be of use to mention that there was no misplay here (no cheating or otherwise any significant issue/drama), I ended it mostly because I learned over time that we were just very different people with different ethical views.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a couple of days after the breakup, she started to send me messages attacking me for breaking up with her, calling me a dick, etc etc. I don't remember exactly what I said back but I do remember I tried my best to keep it civil. I blocked her on every platform I could, as blocking her phone number/snap only led to her messaging me on instagram, gmail, alternate instagram accounts, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point during the next 8-10 months, I unblocked her main instagram account. Right around 10 months after breaking up, she messaged me asking us to get back together. I politely replied no, and she never messaged me again. She ended up getting with a new dude maybe a year and a half later after our breakup.

&amp;#x200B;

Speed up to a couple of days ago (\~3 years after breakup). After having an enlightening mushroom trip, I gained a greater feeling of happiness and appreciation toward all humans. Following this thought, I decided to message my ex. I sent her a follow request (I don't use ig very often so I didn't realize you could send a message without both parties following each other). The next day I woke up to ""why did you send me a follow request?"". I said something like ""oh I was just gonna ask you how you have been as of late?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Around a day later, I got a couple of messages. She messaged me saying we could call later on to talk it out. I agreed. When I called her, her boyfriend picked up and said something like ""yo, you know that dude on her insta profile? yeah that's me. stop fucking texting my girlfriend"". I replied with ""oh yeah I saw you."", ""ok bet, cya"". After I exited the call, I typed out ""best wishes"" then blocked her. \~20 minutes later, I got a message request from HIS instagram account. His message said something like ""hey, what happened to the call? why did you pussy out? Don't text her again or I'll report you to the XXXX (local police department). I have connections there and I know this isn't the first time you've harrassed her."" I responded with something like ""you're a funny dude lol, best wishes"" then blocked him as well.

Past few months, my mom is literally getting mad over me for not wanting to go shopping with her, for most of the males we dont enjoy shopping nor walking around for 2-3 hours and not buying anything. And she literally is grounding me for it? So idk what to do. I really wanna go shopping with her, but she always buys me things, and wastes her money on me and my brother, and i just dont want her to spend money on me, and i can't tell her that. So I'm just saying that i don't feel like going with her, and she just sais its because i want to spend time on games, phone etc.. 
Im always telling her that we can go somewhere like parks or somewhere around the city, but she doesn't want to

Her part of the story:

As i said she is a single mom, ans she just sees me like 2-3 hours per day, because of her job, and i go to school in the morning (7PM-12PM), and on the weekends im at my dad's house, they are divorced.

My (m24) sister (f34) has been struggling with fertility issues. She started doing IVF sessions (or so we thought) and so far she's done 3 sessions but none of them was successful. My mom and dad are funding these sessions because they always wanted grandchildren and my sister is their only hope (I'm child free).



Recently, I found out that the money they gave her for her IVF treatment has been going towards other thing like house renovations. I discovered this by hearing her and BIL talking. I confronted my sister. She confessed that the money goes into renovating her home but claimed that she and her husband were doing this so they could sell the house and start ivf treatment ""for real"". I told her if she asked my parents for ivf money again I'd tell them. She said nothing.


On thanksgiving dinner, she asked mom and dad to pay for another IVF session and promising them of having kids soon. I was mortified upon hearing this. I said nothing til later after she went home I called her, put her on speaker and had my parents in the room listening. I called her out on asking them for ivf treatment when she was using the money towards house renovations. She told me that again, she's renovating the house so she could sell it but I doubted it since her husband inherited it from his dad and swore to never sell it. I told her I'd tell our parents but she told me to f off basically but my dad spoke up and she immediately hung up. Both our parents were shocked and devastated. This caused a huge problem between them. She yelled at me and started crying the next about how I alienated her from our parents, turned them against her, and ruined her plans to be a mom.

For the most part we've been extremely close and Daisy is marrying her boyfriend next month.

Abi has asked Daisy to be her maid of honour, however Daisy has asked her sister instead. This is completely fine with Abi as she understands that with things like this family comes first. The issue is Daisy's sister has excluded my wife from almost all of the planning going into the wedding, which I could kind of justify if she hadn't been consulting other friends outside of the family and asking them for input and suggestions.

The nail in the coffin for me is yesterday my Wife came back home in tears after finding out Daisy's sister has organised a Hen party and not invited Abi. At first I tried to console her suggesting it's a weird choice but it could be family only and then they'll have a proper party later, but no. Daisy's sister has invited all of our mutual friends and made it clear its a ""going out celebrating and drinking"" type of party, not a close and quiet family one.

Abi is distraught and I'm pissed. I know Daisy would absolutely want my wife to be there on her final celebration before she gets married but the issue is its a surprise party. I'm split between what to do, as I really don't want to ruin Daisy's surprise but at the same time I can't stand by whilst my wife is needlessly excluded.

I've text my friend asking to meet to talk as they're the sort of couple who goes through each others phones and I don't want to risk Daisy seeing my message to him but we haven't had chance to meet up yet.

Thisvwas our first time hosting Thanksgiving.  I begged her to please allow me to make the food and she could spend the day watching football and help with the dishes afterwards. 

She called me silly.  

Her dad is not as polite as I am. He asked ""WHY THE FUCK IS THERE HAIR IN THE STUFFING""?  

Her mom found a hair in the mashed potatoes.  

I just kept my mouth shut.  

Now she is upset with me for not helping out and letting her be embarrassed.  

I bought her a box of hair nets a couple of years ago.  I brought them out and reminded her, gently, that I had told her about her hair in the food.  

She is calling me a dick for letting her screw up our first time, maybe last time, as Thanksgiving hosts.

At first I laughed it out because I thought she was joking, but when she stared me dead serious, I knew it wasn’t a joke at all.

For context, today I was asked to get the vacuum to pick up a big piece of dog fur under the Christmas tree. I did so, only to accidentally yank off the charging thing, which was glued to the shelf. The vacuum had apparently been charging, and I didn't know that. I just so happened to have my phone in my hand, and when my dad saw, he yelled at me saying that if I didn't always have my phone in my hand, this stuff wouldn't happen. Thing is, this is one of the very few times something like this has happened. another thing is that I need my phone on me to help control my urges. As a guy with autism, I have urges I can't exactly control (ie, random noises or jumping off the walls), and my phone helps distract me.

His death is kind of a sensitive topic.

What started it all was her being upset with the way I cleaned in the morning — I just swept all the dirt, washed the dishes that were in the sink, and took out the trash. After I was done, my mom came at me for not picking up trash that wasn’t mine: empty mail, boxes, plastic wrapping that my brother and his wife left in the living room. 

I used to clean my other brother’s — let’s call him A —trash but I just stopped because A(27), his wife(28), and kid(8) leave a bunch of trash out in the common areas of the house. Then my mom gives me shit because I don’t clean up?

Anyway, my mom’s telling me how I need to pick up the trash, I told her it wasn’t mine and she said it doesn’t matter (she never gets on to A for this). After like 10 minutes of her insulting me for various things, I ask her to stop talking to me and leave me alone. She then uses her favourite retort of all time: “One day you’re going to wish to talk me and I will be dead.” or “One day you’re going to wish I was around and I will be dead.” Our arguments always end like this, however minor or major. All of my siblings have heard the same thing, even my dad sometimes. 

So I reply: “Tell that to R.” She goes silent, hasn’t spoken to me since. The reason I said this was because she used to tell him the same thing, so why does she still use that comeback like she didn’t bury him? Life isn’t promised and it bothers me that she uses this comeback every. time. But I feel like an asshole for saying it because yeah, it’s my brother, and he’s dead, and the grief was really hard. 

So, AITA?

TLDR; My mom likes to get on my ass about small things and whenever I ask her to leave me alone and stop talking to me, she says “One day you’re going to wish to talk me and I will be dead.” or “One day you’re going to wish I was around and I will be dead.” My brother R died at 19 six years ago. So i told her “Tell that to R!” Because she used to tell him the same thing, and he died before her.

For starters my sister and I haven’t had the best relationship and a lot of it possibly had to do with the large age gap we had. I was the  little sister that always wanted to be around my sibling which she didn’t really like  and we didn’t become close or build a friendship until we were closer in age. 

Our personalities clash a lot because I  like the keep the peace in every interaction I have and my sister can be argumentative and one sided at times.  So one day myself ( 26F) my sister (33f) and some acquaintances decided to go out with friends . Some of the people we’ve known for years while others have only spoken to each other in passing a couple of times. While we’re on the way to one of the bars someone starts playing music and with every song that came on my sister would make a comment about the lyrics such as “ oh my gosh this is a lot” or “this song is inappropriate turn something else on” so finally the girl my sister was speaking to said my sister was being annoying. 

While we’re at the bar my sister was visibly annoyed so she told me that the girl playing the music made rude comments to her but she addressed it so everything’s fine. The rest of the night was fine and everyone laughed and enjoyed themselves… or so I thought. While we’re on the way home my sister told me that she didn’t like how someone  she didn’t really know called her annoying and asked me if I would say that to someone. I told her that I probably would but wouldn’t use that exact verbiage because it can be a bit harsh and context on a situation is important. 

I also told her that the girl that called her annoying seemed nice but probably should’ve stayed home because her energy was a bit off and shouldn’t have made some of the comments she did( for context the girl that called my sister annoying had to work early the next day so it seemed like she was annoyed with anything and everyone that night ) 
After the conversation I thought everything was fine but now my sister disinvited me to her birthday party and said we’re better off as sisters and not friends.
I asked my sister why she felt this way and she said it’s  because she would expect her friends to stick up for her.

Because of this he has been coming around my house a lot and hanging out with me there. I currently live with my sister and her boyfriend and we have been living together since May of this year. 
When I first brought my new man around my sisters boyfriend told me straight up he did not want to hang out with him and did not want to even talk to him. He had his reasons and they were related to past PTSD that had nothing to do with me or said new boyfriend. Since then he has ignored every nice advance my boyfriend has made and he has made comments along the lines of, “I just don’t fucking like that guy. I don’t want to hang around him.” Which doesn’t make sense because he has refused to even speak to him. How could he form an opinion of not liking him?
He has even gone to the lengths of telling us to be quiet at 9pm on a Saturday night when we were in the kitchen just laughing. Because he wanted to sleep. This I understand but we weren’t even being that loud and it was the way he went about it 
I’ve asked a few times if maybe he could just give him a chance and he will see how nice he is but he has refused. 
Naturally this has upset my boyfriend as he has been nothing but nice and attempting to get to know my family. My sisters boyfriend has made this hard on him and wont even say hello when my boyfriend comes over. 
A few months ago we had a conversation about this because I was beginning to feel upset by the way he was being treated. Her boyfriend told me I didn’t know what I was talking about and that he was never rude to my new boyfriend. Her boyfriend  ended up apologizing to me. I didn’t really see it as genuine because it took my sister crying for him to change up his opinion. 
I think he should have apologized to my boyfriend which to this day has not happened yet. 
Recently, my sister and her boyfriend had thanksgiving with his mother there. They were having dinner until around 8:30-9:00 pm which is when I came back to the house with my boyfriend. 
We began getting ready for bed since he had to work early the next day. 
He in turn made the mistake of walking down to the kitchen to wash his hands without a shirt on. This upset the gathering downstairs and my sisters boyfriend made a remark to him like, “put a shirt on when my mother is here. We don’t mind when you do it around us but my mother is here.” 
This made my boyfriend embarrassed and he walked upstairs. To give perspective he was going to be down there for two minutes then right back up stairs. 
My thoughts on this are, her boyfriend could have pulled him aside and spoke to him in private as to not cause a scene but instead chose to embarrass him this way. 
This, stacked on with everything else, upset me and I told her I did not want to hang out with her boyfriend the following day as we were suppose to all go get a tree together.

We have discussed having pets in great detail, but ultimately agreed against it. We both decided *together* that we shouldn’t have a pet and we were both very clear on the decision. Some of my concerns with pets were: I am horribly allergic to pets and cannot simply take a daily medication to control the symptoms, we just renovated much of our house (including having original hardwood floors completely redone) and I’m concerned about things getting scratched and the dog having accidents on the floors, our backyard has a very short fence which any medium-sized dog could easily jump, we have lots of fragile things in our house that we have collected or been gifted, etc etc. 

All the reasons aside, we both agreed that we would not even consider pets again for a number of years, until we both felt comfortable with the idea. I have grown up with dogs, so I knew eventually (in several years when we are hopefully more financially stable and set up for pets— again, this was all made very clear) I would like to go and pick out a dog to adopt together. I made this all very clear to my girlfriend and reminded her of this conversation several times because she continued to bring it up. 

 Well, fast forward a couple of months, she calls me and tells me to come outside. I step outside and I can see the silhouette of a big dog in her car. Just out of the blue on a random day— a huge dog that is not hypoallergenic and that has never had any training of any kind. 

I was extremely upset by this and I ultimately asked her to bring the dog back after reminding her of our agreement. She tried, but the shelter was full and the dog is still living with us. The dog is generally well-behaved but has major separation anxiety. She poops on the floor every time we leave and has completely chewed through the bottom of the door trim (also original to the house and not replaceable as it is no longer made.) Now every time we come home something new is destroyed.

At this point I’m at a loss and extremely upset. I also don’t know how to go forward because my girlfriend super attached to the dog. My girlfriend and I have had it out over and over but can never come to a good conclusion. It’s just a constant point of friction between us. 

I just feel like she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion and acted on impulse.

I used 15k of my money and he used $600. I didn’t mind because he had a lot of bills (or so I thought) that he had to spend money on so he wasn’t able to save any, and it was going in my name anyway. The business was a moving business, we would move peoples furniture to their new house.


The first issue is I found out he was telling me we didn’t have any moving jobs when we actually did, he was having his friend move furniture with him and taking my half of the money and paying his friend $50. So that really hurt my feelings because I felt betrayed by someone I thought was my best friend.


We spoke about it and I forgave him. He didn’t do it again to my knowledge after that. Now comes a month later. He starts saying he needs more money because his bills are going up. I agree to take a small pay cut because I believed him. A few months later I decide I want to change what the business does. He agrees because it means he no longer has to work and it’s basically free money for him since I would do all the paperwork since he’s not good at that.
The new business is going extremely well, we start making lots of money and now his bills mysterious go up. He starts asking for small amount like $200 to $300. Then he starts asking for $1000 to $2000, all the while we are both getting $1000 a week. I end up giving around $25,000 extra despite telling him I’m struggling to pay for the expenses of the business.


A week goes by after I tell him that and he has ignored me since. I then get I call from his wife saying he’s in jail for a DUI and a hit and run (hit a vehicle not a person) and that he crashed their vehicle almost killing their daughter. I get a hold of him and he said he need $800 for commissary. Like what on earth. So I go off on him and he explains he’s been using the money for drugs. So I stop talking to him. His wife calls me again and says I should give her his paycheck so she can make sure he’s not spending it on drugs. I tell her no, that I don’t trust either of them. She calls me a homophobic slur and that I was using her husband. I said I’m the one who saved invested the money while he just snorted it. She hung up. I don’t know how I could have been using him. We were paid equally despite me doing most of everything.
I quit giving him money. He wasn’t legally a partner or even hired as an employee, I was just giving him the same as what I pay myself since it was his idea to start a business and did contribute $600 at the beginning.


A few weeks later he gets sent to rehab where he runs away, his wife passes away from an overdose, and now about 4 months later I get a message from some kind of jail service. He says he has been arrested for violating probation, and he wants to catch up. I’m sure any conversation will devolve into him asking for money. Am I the asshole for ignoring it?

My best friend(28f) has an on off relationship to her fiance (m35). It has been this way for 6 years.

She comes crying to us, saying she hates him and will never see him again until she gets back with him and he is the best thing that happens to her.

To summarize what they have done to each other :
- he cheated on her five (5) times for varying lengths 

- she scratched his car

- he verbally abuses her

- he said in a public speech that his girl bf was the most important woman in his life 

- ditched her on their anniversary bc girl bf had something come up

- absolutely a monster on law

Much more.

So any way. After the 6th time they got back together I told her to not talk to me abt this any longer. She is free to do and love who she wants. But I am unsubscribing.

Cut to 4 months ago. He proposed because she literally gave him an ultimatum.

So she comes exited to me to tell me the news. Their last break up was 6 months ago.

I told her I loved her. But again, I want no part in this.

She didn't get it. And then asked me if she at least could use my discount for various stores to buy stuff for her wedding.

Trough work I have discount in various bridal shops.

She tends to lose focus/isn’t able to focus on two things at once which has started to become an issue for me

I haven’t said this to her face, but the amount of times I’ve tried to talk to her only to get ignored for something else has started to hurt my feelings. I used to retell whatever she didn’t hear, but recently I’ve started to say that it’s nothing and move on. 

This time, we were talking and she started looking at a child’s toy for her nephew. (And when I say look, I really mean reading the super long item titles on Amazon, which admitingly hurt my feelings more than usual) I tried to explain what I wanted to get my dad for Christmas (twice) and she didn’t pay attention to either.

Only after she stopped reading the title did she turn to me and say that she wasn’t paying attention. At this point I’m feeling a bit sad and disappointed so I just told her it’s nothing. She asked again, what did I say? I reiterate that it’s fine and it’s nothing and get up to walk to my room.

What proceeded to follow was a little bit of screaming (Mind you from this point on, I didn’t say anything and just let her yell at me. From past experiences, trying to add my part just hurts me more.) She told me how I was manipulating her emotionally, I knew she had ADHD which was a learning disability and meant I should go easy on her. After she finished yelling at me I went to my room to be left alone and try to forget what happened.

I’m guessing she didn’t want to calm down though, because not 30 seconds later she barges into my room and screams in my face more about it. She continued to talk about how I was emotionally manipulating her, and ended the one sided conversation by telling me to never go into her room to talk to her again. And she’s always in her room.

This whole interaction hurt my feelings a lot, even though it’s not a rare occurrence for her to get mad at me. She usually blames it on PMSing but now she’s using her ADHD as an excuse too.

I think there might be some more underlying issues with her regarding feelings, because after getting mad at me and letting it out to my face, she’s all 
sunshine and rainbows afterwards 10 minutes later.

I ended up taking the pacifistic route and choosing to not directly go to my father’s funeral; but meeting up with my family before the funeral and going to the dinner after his funeral.

So, my father did ended up putting me in the will after all. He stated in his will that my brother would end up getting all of his stuff (*surprise, surprise*), but he was willing to split the money in half if I ended up going to his funeral but have “a zero” taken off if I didn’t, and the rest of the money would go to a “back-up charity” instead. 

That would mean that if my father originally had $10,000 left on his bank. So, that means that me and my brother both would have gotten $5,000 each if I went, but I would only get $500 if I decided not to go and the rest of the $4,500 would go to charity instead. Which is exactly what happened. 

And, at first, I was willing to just take the second option, until my half-brother told me some about why he assumed the will was written how it was. So, my half-brother and my father had some falling out. Because of that, my father set in his will that the “charity” that my money would have been donated to Salvation Army’s which my dad chose because my half-brother’s GF had a gay brother and my dad wanted to spite him by having my money go to an well-known anti-LGBT charity. 

So, me and my half-brother hatched a plan to well… deceive my family into finding ways to seeing how I could end up having that $5,000 instead because I did “technically” go to his funeral by attending a part of it… and because I told my family that a part of me couldn’t completely miss the funeral because I did miss my dad in some way. Which, ugh, was a lie but that lie was motivation enough for my family to help me see how I could get my half of my father’s inheritance.

At the end, I succeeded and I already ended up having the full $5,000… that I ended up giving to my half-brother’s GF’s brother as a form of apology about how vindictive and homophobic my father was to him because of how he wanted to spite his son.
 
My family, however, is really conflicted about this. Many of them really feels betrayed by what I did, and thought that I really hit a new low by continuing to be petty and disrespectful toward a dead man, even if that dead man started this whole thing. A few of them, however, weren’t all too angry and stated that -since this was all legally processed- the money was mine and I had the right to do what I wanted with it. 

I did end up talking to some friends over it and they were conflicted about it. They told me that, even though my father was an AH about how he set the whole thing up, I was also an AH for trying to “get back” at a dead man and stupid for potentially putting myself into legal trouble over a grudge.

My parents have been married for years and I always idolized them up until I was somwhere around 10 or 11. I started noticing that mom was a control freak and pulling dad by the nose in this marriage. But dad never complained even once and did everything my mom asked.

When I was 15, it was revealed Jordan was not my dad's child and was born from an affair of my mother's. Further, dad knew the entire time and never said a single word to keep the family together. It was astonishing to me how everyone quickly got over it, except for Kacy who moved out as soon as she got a chance because she couldn't stand mom. I was amazed dad stayed. And I ended up forgetting all about it and moving on like everybody else.

Cut back to yesterday, my mom was back at it again, shouting at my dad and told him to sleep on the couch for the night. Of course, I went to speak to her on dad's behalf. She was in the bathroom and while I was waiting for her, I saw texts on her phone that drew my attention because of the heart emojis. And when I looked at them my heart sank. My mom has been secretly in contact with the man she cheated on dad with and all texts suggested that the affair was still going on and it clicked to me that it must be what she and dad were arguing about.

As soon as she came out of the bathroom I went batshit crazy, screaming at her and I said some pretty nasty things. However what she said in response drove me over the edge. She said dad ""wasn't enough"", as in, he didn't do enough for her. All the things dad has done for us and the Jordan issue came back flooding to me and I don't know how, but I found myself having slapped her in the face. The room totally went silent and we stared at each other for quite a while until I snapped back into the realization that I just slapped my own mom. It didn't help that dad was right at the door and saw everything. I went back and locked myself in my room, cried myself to sleep because I'm really disgusted at myself. Sure what she did was wrong but what capacity did I have slapping my own mother like that?

Lillian has wanted to be a doctor since she was in 5th grade. She used to slack off hard in school, get detentions regularly, and do poorly academically until we told her that if she wanted to be a doctor, she'd have to learn professional behavior and get good grades. I honestly think that is what turned her around.

She got into a top public university and was premed when she initially started college at 17.

However, she suffered from mental health problems in college, even withdrew for a semester or two, and did not do so well in organic chemistry.

Ultimately, Lily graduated a semester later than intended with a degree in economics, cum laude.

She got a great internship AND job right after. I felt that was life telling her she was meant to be a businesswoman, not a doctor.

My wife ""Bianca"" is an accountant, but her mom ""Danielle"" was an anesthesiologist and it was stressful as hell. Dani never had time for her kids and was always stressed about work. Similarly, my brother in law ""Tom"" did medical school abroad because he did not grow up in the US.

Tom's a smart dude, but had to pass board exams and failed a few times. Tom and his wife ""Kelly"" lived in a VHCOL city with 2 kids, and they were surviving on his wife's income. Kelly would call my wife sobbing because they were so stressed about being new parents on so little money and because she didn't know if Tom would ever pass.

I reminded Lillian that medicine wasn't for the faint of heart. I told her that the most intelligent and resilient relatives in our family were cracking under pressure; so how could she withstand it when she cracked in college?

However, today, despite our warnings, Lillian called us and showed us this ""presentation"" about how she was trying to apply to medical school in 2029.

We were aghast. For one, she already earns great money, so why pivot? It makes no sense to attend medical school financially.

Moreover, we are worried that Lillian will not survive medical school - that she will be left with 6 figures of debt with no medical degree or not match into residency. Her science grades are not the strongest. She earned a B- in Orgo 1 in undergrad and some B+'s in math and statistics.

We are getting old and are both close to 60 at this point. We want to know that we can retire in peace and that she's on her way to a better place instead of taking on risky ventures like med school.

My SIL AND BIL"" Zach"" and ""Olivia"" have 2 kids, one of which also took risk by founding startups. It was stressful for Zach and Olivia, who had to pay Nadine's expensive NY rent and worry about Nadine ever getting a real job.

I'm not as soft as them; I'm putting a stop to this right away.

FIL desperately wants this divorce to go through as he is paying out his ass in alimony. FIL's wife, we'll call her ""Anne"" is tbh something of a gold digger and is not happy about this. Every time they see each other she harps on the divorce. 

We recently hosted a sip and see for our son (no one was allowed to hold him or get close to him, yes we do care about germs) The party was just beginning and FIL and Anne were questioning Ken about the divorce. Ken went on a rant about his ex and I gave MIL a look to shut him up.

Anne began giving Ken shitty legal advice that sounded made up. ken snapped at her that isn't how the law works. Anne yelled at them that he needs to do something and called him lazy. Ken is kind of a shit stirrer, just likes to fuck with people, so he said maybe he should just forget the divorce because it is so much work and really MIL wants a party. He could throw her a party. Anne believed him and started yelling. 

At this point I told them all to stop, but Ken began laughing about how the alimony is for nothing because MIL hasn't paid for a thing since she met him and she is just hoarding it. Anne then called MIL a bitch and said FIL needed to take care of her, whatever that means.

Finally I snapped and told Ken and Anne to get out of my house. I'm done with both of them. they said they would behave, but I told them to get out. Anne put up a fuss but Ken just left.

Today, something very silly happened and we don’t know who’s in the wrong (if anyone is). 

I asked my partner if he wanted us to have lunch together but mentioned I’d still need at least another 20 minutes to make my lunch. This was at around 1:20pm. He said that was not a problem and he’d wait for me before heating up his lunch - this would only take a minute or so. 

So I start making my food and lose track of time, it takes me around half an hour but when I finish I tell him I’m done and he gets to the kitchen to start heating up his lunch in the microwave. Before his food is done, I sit down and start eating. He sees it and says in a jokey way “that’s rude, I waited all this time for you to finish your food and you couldn’t wait an extra minute for mine?”

I thought he was half joking but he seemed a little annoyed - I kept on eating anyway because I thought I was being attacked for no reason. He comes back from the kitchen with his food a minute later and is not happy, particularly because I didn’t stop eating after he complained. 

We were annoyed at each other for 15 minutes but then went back to normal afterwards so this is def not a big thing but now that we’re laughing about it, we want to know, AITA for not waiting for his food to be ready after he waited for me?

Some important context:
1) we almost never eat at the same time because we eat different stuff so we never really coordinate timings 
2) he never asked me to wait for him to be done and I didn’t specifically ask him to wait for me either
3) he says what made it worse was that it was already quite late and he was really hungry but decided to wait anyway

Our relationship is very healthy and I’ve never been happier. There is one small conflict that keeps coming up and I’m not sure if I’m being ridiculous.
He almost never brushes his teeth at night. He says he brushes them in the morning, but he leaves for work before I’m awake so I never see it. To be fair, his teeth are pretty white and he almost never has bad breath. Most the time, I wouldn’t guess that he had bad dental hygiene if I didn’t live with him. … but sometimes before bed I can see the plaque build up on his teeth. It’s gross, and he gets angry and refuses when I ask him to go brush.
To be fair I should also add for context: this man showers every day, sometimes twice a  day. I usually shower every other day or so, but I struggle with depression and when it’s bad I’ll shower as little as once a week. I’m good about using dry shampoo and doing “hoe baths” with wipes, but still. I know it’s a bit gross, and he never judges me for that. He’s so kind and understanding. The few times he has reminded me to shower, it’s been very gently. I did respond defensively a few times early on, so I feel it’s a bit hypocritical for me to be upset with him getting so defensive about his teeth now.
HOWEVER, oral hygiene is a bit different! Greasy hair won’t damage your overall health, whereas plaque build up and tooth decay really can! Even during my worst off phases, I brush and floss daily. I know different brains struggle with different tasks, but he won’t even talk to me about his aversion to nightly brushing. We have such great, open communication about most everything else, and I stopped being defensive about my hygiene habits like a year ago.

I came home for Thanksgiving this week, and since I live several states away I really only see my brother like once or twice a year. He’s 22 and in the last few years, he’s been a pretty grumpy person. It’s disappointing honestly but I also hope things will be different “this time.”

So we were sitting on the couch together and I was cuddling my dog and making kissy noises and saying his name. My brother was watching football, and then very defiantly said, “I’m just being totally honest here, when you’re annoying like that and make noises, it just makes me want to leave and not be around you. I’ll have a conversation with you but if you’re just going to sit here and make weird noises, I’m going to leave.” 

I defended myself and said like, what the heck, you see me once a year and you’re just so annoyed with my presence you can’t stand to be around me? Then he called me selfish and said I need to adjust my behavior depending on who I’m with and that the world doesn’t revolve around me. I thought this was just insane, since he’s the one dictating how I should behave! 

I feel so gaslit and hurt in this situation, but idk, maybe I’m the asshole?

Around 18 months ago we found out VIA FACEBOOK that a childhood friend of his had proposed to his girlfriend. At this point, I’d met the groom to be (24m) once and the bride to be (24f) never. Me and my bf lived together at this point and still do. We speak about getting engaged next year as we’re saving to buy a home and settle down properly. Around a month after the proposal the groom asked my bf to be the best man. He was confused as they have grown apart massively over the years but overjoyed and of course accepted. I was excited for him too, and suggested the four of us meet up for dinner to celebrate, I added the bride to be on all social media as I already had her SO but wanted to make an effort. That night they created an event for their engagement party.. I was not invited. When my bf asked if I was invited he was told no. Although I was upset I wanted to be polite, so gave my boyfriend a lift and was shocked to see that other gfs who aren’t that close the couple had been invited. 

Fast forward a few months, and my bf was told by the groom he would not be allowed a plus one. As they “didn’t want any non-serious partners” my bf explained this wasn’t the case, and even offered to pay for my place if money was an issue. The groom refused and said there’s no way I will be invited. But said I MAY receive an evening invite. 

Many of our friends don’t like the bride to be, she has a reputation of being controlling af. 

Fast forward to now, the wedding is in 6 months, I have met the bride to be a few times in passing and each time suggested meeting up properly. My bf has seen the groom very little. And rarely talks about the wedding obviously to protect my feelings. But it still hurts and as the day draws closer I don’t understand it. 

I have now found out the bridesmaids have plus ones yet the best man does not. The brides hairdresser’s husband even has an invite. And a few of my friends who barely know them have been invited. 

After this I said enough is enough, I’ve done nothing to the bride or groom and even tried to make an effort. So I asked my bf if he would consider just stepping away from the whole thing. He said he’s in too deep and it would be an ‘awkward’ conversation and I should just go to the evening but I feel I just can’t. And out of respect for me and our relationship he should take the stand and not be the best man, either go as a guest in the evening with me, or completely step away. I was surprised he didn’t do it originally and the longer it goes on the more upset and angry I get.

This is going to be a bit messy – I had to cut a lot out due to character limit.

During the first lockdown in 2020 I got a call from my dad asking if I knew where my mum was? I did not. She had travelled down to England (from Scotland) by train to meet up with an old boyfriend from high school. Her tablet was still logged into facebook with evidence of my mum’s emotional affair and plans to meet up. She was cheating on my father (she’d done it before) and she was ignoring lockdown.

Mum came back and attempted to act like nothing had happened. Dad said that he wanted a divorce. My dad then told her to leave, and she said she wasn’t leaving. The issue with this is my parents had custody of my 13-year-old nephew. He has trauma from early childhood and is autistic, this can manifest in difficult behaviours that my mum can’t handle. Their relationship is very poor, and my mum has resorted to screaming at him in the past. Dad said that he wasn’t uprooting my nephew. Either mum and nephew stayed in the house, or dad and nephew stayed in the house. Mum left. 

Mum then started gunning for 80% of assets in the financial settlement. This was a shitshow to be honest. I can’t even keep track of what she was trying to demand she was entitled to. She was also fighting him over the house – she wouldn’t accept what the house was worth when he offered to buy her out and was pushing to have him sell because she thought she could get more. I’m of the opinion that it should be a 50% split. 

Through all this, my dad was struggling to manage the betrayal, pandemic and my nephew. I offered him my support and time – I was there for my nephew. My mum tried to speak to me multiple times in many ways. I told her that I was furious with her behaviour and didn’t want to speak to her. I eventually said we could communicate by letter, but we weren’t discussing the divorce. I still found this very difficult. I still have some unopened letters from her that I can’t bring myself to read. 

My mum is severely depressed and has been since I was born. She also lives in a lot of pain. She was an alcoholic when I was a teenager and when I was in my early 20s she was coming home from a night out and fell down some stairs and broke her back. She ended up in a back brace for months and with metal rods in her back. This must be agony. I also have depression that I’m struggling with, and I know I should have more empathy for her but I’m still angry. 

My grandparents (Dad’s parents), my dad and other relatives have said things like “You only get one mum” and “she’s still your mother” but I’ve shut that down with a careful “You can love someone but understand that they’re not good for you” due to my nephew being around.

It has been known to snow in July, and while winter isn’t as bad as other places, you will likely die without a home. I am a poor college student lucky enough to live off of my parents’ GI bill.

This friend (17f) isn’t close, I haven’t seen her in 2 years and no meaningful conversation in 3. I have zero personal obligation to her.

The conversation, which was over text, went like something this:
“Heyyy”
“I need some help… I’ve been kicked out”
“And I know I we don’t know each other well, I am kinda pregnant”

Now I am thinking: OH SHIT! Please don’t say I am the father! Wait… I’m a virgin.
As I am freaking out, she texts me that she needs a place to stay. Okay, I am skeptical, something smells fishy but I allow it.

I have her over for 2 days and she is nice enough. No problems, even talked about Kant with me, but she drops the ball that she got kicked out of her family’s house, the homeless shelters, her boyfriend’s house, and has burned all the bridges she has.

What the hell did she do?

I call up my best friend and ask if we can do some checking to see if can’t find this lady a place. Every shelter, affordable housing program, etc. Knew this lady by name and said they aren’t legally allowed to talk.

Ofcourse I asked her what was up. I was told that everyone has it out for her, lies and corruption is why she is in this position but I do not believe her, after all I personally know most of her friends and a shelter director.

After she said she needed to leave to apply for housing elsewhere, she called me again once she got rejected, saying she has no where else to go. I am not looking to adopt TWO kids (remember she is pregnant), technically I could but I am not exactly flush with cash and I have dreams of my own.

I understand she could be down on her luck but what do you have to do to get kicked out of everywhere right before winter, which they don’t kick people out for minor issues. I ain’t her only friend too, why are they all mad at her?

When my then boyfriend (28 M) now husband and I was going to announce our pregnancy to our parents my MIL surprised us and said she already knew. Because I was sending out signals.. I wasn't showing or anything so I thought it must have been small signals that someone who had been pregnant themselves would notice. And she refused to tell me what I had done that gave it away and said I would just not do that in front of her next time. But no hard feelings.  It's the first grandchild for both family's so the joy is never ending.  A couple of moths later my boyfriend and I decided that we want to get married, but we don't really fancy parties and decided just to invite our moms out for dinner and then ""accidentally"" visit the court house first and surprise them. After the wedding my MIL again said that she knew, and I was the one who had given her the signals! I was choked, because I had not spoken to her at all. Other than inviting her out for dinner, to celebrate the baby's gender. The rest of the day went well and was filled with joy, but I did notice my mom(58) and MIL whispering a lot to each other. When we got home I went to my moms and asked what it was all about( she's our neighbor). She said what I was not allowed to tell my husband, but my MIL never logged out of his samsung account when she got his old phone. So she can see our messenger conversation.. I WAS FURIOUS!

I, Jane (23f) am the only child in a small family. My family is made up of me, my mother, my uncle, my grandmother, and my aunt. My grandfather recently passed, so we're even smaller. When I was very young, my mother had an argument with my aunt Emma (33f), and cut her off entirely. She also banned me from seeing her, talking to her, and I've never been allowed to do so. All I've ever heard is how much my mother hates her. My mother and I have an awful relationship so I never dared go against her. She even has the nerve to ask my grandmother to cut off my aunt, and yells at her when my grandmother refuses to disown her youngest child.

I'm 23 now, and haven't seen my aunt in 4 years. I recently moved out, I'm distant from my mum, and I was thinking about my family. I'm very close to my grandmother, and I thought, why not get to know my aunt? I recently learned that she asks about me, we went to the same school, and have things in common. I also learned that we even look very similar, but that's something my mother vehemently denied growing up.

I decided to be brave, and told my grandmother that next time she talks to Emma, she can give her my number. My grandmother is absolutely delighted as this family rift breaks her heart, and if she can't reunite the sisters, she'd love to see my and my aunt in contact. She's going to pass my number along, and I'm excited to get to know my aunt, if she wants to know me!

I'm not planning on telling my mother, because I'm genuinely terrified of the response, and my gran has agreed not to. But now I'm starting to feel like a jerk for going against my mother. I know she mistreated me growing up, but she knows how to turn on the charm when necessary and I'm now feeling bad for going against her. I really want to get to know my aunt, and part of me is really hoping she gets in touch with me, but my inner child is absolutely petrified that I've been TA.

All went well, but a week before our scheduled flight we went to a thermal bath with her family where I caught a serious ear infection. This resulted in me being in a lot of pain, having to run around to ENT specialists and doctors. While my infected ear got a bit better it spread to my other ear.

Seeing an ear-specialist today she said that I can technically fly, but I would be in a lot of pain due to pressure differences during flight and might even rupture my eardrum resulting in long-term or even permanent hearing loss. 

Now I would call off the flight personally as I like my hearing intact, although the chance is little there is still a chance of permanent hearing loss and lots of pain. Sure we would also lose money (although I could reclaim some of it via my insurance) but my girlfriend just won’t allow me. 

She feels that I am just “simulating” and she is pissed off at me for being sick and not wanting to go. I received little to no sympathy and she just wouldn’t understand my position, and that don’t feel well, am already in a lot of pain and it also pains me having to cancel the trip (I mean I was the one organising it in the first place).

We were in a talking stage for about a month before he asked to make it official around 3 weeks ago and then a week ago he broke it off using his poor mental health as an excuse. He is, now, dating between two new different guys despite him telling me how that 'he doesn't want to break up with me, but he has to in order to prioritise his mental health.' Fishy.

During my time with my now ex-boyfriend, I introduced him to one of my closest friends and they got along really well, started hanging out with each other even when I wasn't there (I live around 3 hours away as I am studying in a different University while they both study in the same University). I was ecstatic that the people I value most are getting along well and becoming friends. I found out today from my best friend of fourteen years (19F), who lives in the same university accommodation as my ex-boyfriend and was the one who introduced us to each other, that he is moving out and going to live with my close friend. She had not mentioned it to me before at all, and this is the first time I was hearing of it. I immediately message her to which she casually responds that he is moving in. I explain to her that I feel betrayed as she never asked for my opinion on it. She explains that the decision took place only a few hours ago and it was last minute as she needed to put someone's name on the lease, which I didn't know previously. She then continued to say how she is going through a lot and is juggling many problems right now and that she would have told me in her own time and own pace.

We phoned and I explained that I wish she would have asked me beforehand to which she explains that it was a last minute decision, and that she was going to tell me about it another day. She also tells me that she thought that me and my ex were on good terms as she messaged him and asked him about the breakup. However, never at any point did she message me and asked me how I felt. I tell her to leave it as I don't want drama (as I myself have had quite a rocky month regarding things such as my relationships and mental health) and that I hope everything works out for them. She leaves me on read and texts me later, making herself out to be the victim, saying that she is really upset with me as I was really rude to her and that I know that she would never betray me so she doesn't understand how I came to the conclusion that I did. She ended the message saying that she needs some space and time. I left her on read.

First post here, changing names for privacy &lt;3

I, Jane (23f) am the only child in a small family. My family is made up of me, my mother, my uncle, my grandmother, and my aunt. My grandfather recently passed, so we're even smaller. When I was very young, my mother had an argument with my aunt Emma (33f), and cut her off entirely. She also banned me from seeing her, talking to her, and I've never been allowed to do so. All I've ever heard is how much my mother hates her. My mother is a raging narcissist, and I am often scared of her and prone to anxiety around her, so I've always just done as I'm told. She even has the nerve to ask my grandmother to cut off my aunt, and yells at her when my grandmother refuses to disown her youngest child.

I'm 23 now, and haven't seen my aunt since my grandpa died. I recently moved out, I'm over most of the emotional abuse I got growing up (not going into details but it was bad), and I was thinking about my family. I'm very close to my grandmother, and I thought, why not get to know my aunt? I recently learned that she asks about me, we went to the same school, and have things in common. I also learned that we even look very similar, but that's something my mother vehemently denied growing up.

I decided to be brave, and told my grandmother that next time she talks to Emma, she can give her my number. My grandmother is absolutely delighted as this family rift breaks her heart, and if she can't reunite the sisters, she'd love to see my and my aunt in contact. She's going to pass my number along, and I'm excited to get to know my aunt, if she wants to know me!

I'm not planning on telling my mother, because I'm genuinely terrified of the response, and my gran has agreed not to. But now I'm starting to feel like a jerk for going against my mother. I know she mistreated me growing up, but she knows how to turn on the charm when necessary and I'm now feeling bad for going against her. I really want to get to know my aunt, and part of me is really hoping she gets in touch with me, but my inner child is absolutely petrified that I've been TA.

She lived at home until last July.

My parents are separated and I do 1 week each. Usually when she would have friends over at one parent’s place i would go to the other one. Since she moved out my mom and sometimes my dad started rented her room for short period of time when I am not here.

Me and my sister are not close but friendly. 

My bestfriend Luke 18M and I often have sleepover at each other’s places. I don’t often talk to my sister about personnal stuff but this summer I asked some advices about my relationship with him. 

This week my dad went on vacation with his GF and my mom rented Ana’s room for the week end so me and Luke decided to have our sleepover a my dad’s. Just take out, games and movies. 

Friday night my sister came over with some of her friends. They are all around 27/29. They were around 7. I know some of them and they were a little tipsy. 

She told me that they wanted to have a little get together and sleepover but her appartment was too small for all of them so they decided to come at my dad’s.

I found it a little weird that she didn’t asked but she used to do stuff like that all the time. I said ok and that me and Luke would go to my room. Some of them that I know asked us to stay a little and have a drink (legal age is 18 here) because they wanted to know how I was doing. So we stayed a bit and I answered some questions like how was I doing, how was uni... It was nice to catch up with some of them.

After a while they started drinking more and they started talking about some more personnal topics like their hook up and they started asking questions about my sexuality, I got very unconfortable, told them I didn’t want to talk about it but they kept insisting. It’s when I understood that my sister told them about our conversation. One of them told me that he was gay and that I could ask him anything. Honestly it sounded petty creepy so Luke and I went to my bedroom to watch a movie. 

Around 1 am Luke fell asleep and I was on my phone when I heard a knock at my door, I thought it was Ana but it was two of her friends who were verry drunk. They asked questions again and the guy kept saying that he could show me everything I needed to know and they both kept trying to go in my room. Luke woke up, got scared and I physically pushed them out. After that we packed our bags, took an uber and went to his parent’s.

I got back home today and told my parents that I didn’t want to have to deal with my sister’s friends ever again. I told them that her friends got drunk and made me and Luke unconfortable and they agreed to talk to her but they think that I am overeacting a little and they feel weird trying to restrict their adult daughter.That it is a little controling for me to ask that.

November he was about 10 days late on rent, which was only $300 after we deducted some work he had done. We charge him less than 1/3 of what we usually rent it for, which is $1800 (1000 sq ft fully furnished / all bills in major metro) We are renting it to him for $575. 

He told us he was enrolled in college online, and working towards his degree. He didn't enroll for this past semester or the next one. Didn't find this out until after he moved out here.

The whole gist of this was to get him out of my wife's sister's place in rural Minnesota. He was miserable working a dead end job doing night shifts etc. Now he's not appreciative of this opportunity and doesn't seem motivated to make more money or go back to school.

I met with his girlfriend a few weeks ago to discuss some ideas with her

She was happy with everything. When I gave her quotes (to go 50/50) she told me that she couldn't contribute for various reasons, such as birthdays in her family. I told her that I'd cover the cost

She kept trying to make changes to the arrangements to suite her and kept mentioning all of her family members she'd be inviting. Her FMs weren't discussed initially and it's important to note that my dad doesn't like most of her FMs. She did this all while reminding me that she couldn't afford contribute

Because of this I started excluding her from the arrangements as I felt that she could either contribute financially and make demands or not contribute and go with the flow but she couldn't do both

She phoned me recently and I let her know I was going to add more items to the party to ensure that the guests would be better accommodated (adding further to the cost) and she happily agreed and told me to do it

She started mentioning all her FMs she would be inviting. I mentioned to her that I already had to reduce the number of guests due to the cost of catering 40-30. I invited 30 people knowing they wouldn't all come thus leaving space for SOME of her FMs

I asked her to wait a few more days for me to see who had confirmed so I could confirm the space available for her FMs. She asked why that was necessary as her family could just eat from the food I had arranged. I told her that wouldn't be possible as only 30 people would be catered for and we couldnt exceed that. She then offered to contirbute to the catering, I told her that the limit would still be 30 because what she offered was less than 25% of the catering cost

She then screamed at me saying that she told me that she was inviting her FMs, why did I not ensure that they would be catered for. I told her that it wasn't fair for her to expect me to cover the cost of this entire event by myself as well as all of her family's food if she exceeded the 30 people

I cut the call and sent her a message explaining the breakdown of the costs and assured her that I would cover the cost up to 30 people but couldn't do more than that, she blocked me

I feel she has now soured the whole experience by turning what was supposed to be a nice surprise for my dad into her family reunion that I am supposed to pay for

(Sorry for mistakes and if it’s a little bad this is my first post)

So all this started in a group chat and basically every once in awhile John (fake name) would post a photo to that group chat of an art piece he “drew” and I’ve never seen him drawing any of these art pieces during school in fact I’ve never really seen him draw in school other than stick figures so I got a little suspicious.

The next time he posted some of “his” art (which was a drawing of Nezuko) I searched up on Google and went looking for it and not even a minute later I found the photo he traced and this really annoyed me because I’m an artist myself and I’m not a fan of people stealing someone’s art. I went onto a private chat with them and I asked them about it. They said they just referenced it which is absolute BS because that’s not what referencing is but I let it slide and just told them it made me uncomfortable and to stop or credit the artist. they didn’t listen and kept on doing it so I kept on reminding them btw this went on for months and I told my friends every time they did it.

I even had a FaceTime with my friend finding all the artwork they’ve traced. During that FaceTime friend told me that they’ve been posting “their” art to TikTok so it went from being bad to I’m pretty sure straight up illegal. They’re even making fun of the art that “they” did saying stuff like “I made him little goofy” or “ he’s a little baby faced but that’s ok” and I know that that’s not bad insults but that’s still rude to the REAL artist.

I basically snapped after that and I went to them with all the evidence I’ve collected and told them what a crappy person they are. we had a big fight over it obviously and I will admit maybe was a little harsh on him but I was dealing with that for months so I still think it was well-deserved. Some people hated me especially their parents because apparently I was in the wrong so yeah. After awhile (2 weeks) we kind of just forgave each other but we weren’t really friends anymore.

Obviously, I turned around and closed the door. I mentioned it to my wife who wasn’t shocked or appalled and actually had a chuckle over it. She asked a couple questions of me and ultimately said we should just drop it. 

AITA if I drop this? Should I have a conversation with my son about this?

I had left my parents' home in Vermont and ended up working as a maid in a hotel in Miami. I am not ashamed, but it was not nice. It was there where I met a black man named Oscar, he wasn't rich or anything but he offered me certain security and love in a moment I was feeling really alone and hopeless. We moved in  together and I got pregnant. Our baby was born and Oscar named her Tayesha, I was ok with that name at the time.

When she was only 3, Oscar was arrested for drug trafficking and sentenced to 15 years in prison. I decided to not let that destroy my life or my daughter's future. It was hard but I got a new job as a waitress and did my best to rise my girl alone, until I reconnected with my parents and they started to help us more. At first I felt bad for Oscar but I came to realise that he only had himself to blame for how he ended up. Not only he break the law but he also could have put me and our daughter in danger. I stop calling her by her birth name because it reminded me too much of Oscar and I start calling her Taylor, I didn't legally changed her name.

I never had any contact with Oscar after he was arrested or tell Taylor the truth about her father. I always wanted to tell her when she would be mature enough and at some point I decided that moment would be at 16. So, when after her last birthday in february, i explained to her the whole story. She was shocked, of course.

At first, she didn't do anything about it but a few months later she said that she wanted to talk to his father. She had research about how to arrange a call with an inmate in Florida and was decided to do it. I didn't like the idea at all but didn't stop her. I don't know how the call actually went or what did the say to each other, Taylor didn't say much about it and I didn't really want to know. She seemed to be happy about it.

She said that she planned yo talk with her father again at some point and send him a letter. A few days after the call, she told me that she would prefer for me and others to start calling her Tayesha again. I thought that was very dumb, because she didn't have any memory of being call that when she was baby. Also she had always known that was her legal name but never complained about being called Taylor. I ignored her and keep calling her Taylor. She didn't like that and we have been arguing about this issue a lot. My father agrees with me (althougt he had mostly avoid the conflict by just calling her ""darling"" as he usually does) but my mom thinks I should respect my daughter's preference regarding how is she named. My daughter has recently insinuated that me not wanting to call her by her ""real"" and ""black"" name is racist somehow, which I think it is beyond stupid. She had never cared about being ""black"" in her life. Race has never been an issue in our family. I can't avoid thinking all this is because something Oscar said to her.
