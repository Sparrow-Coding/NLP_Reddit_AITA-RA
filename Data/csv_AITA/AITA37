I’m asking because I’m genuinely starting to second guess myself and if I’m wrong, I obviously wanna make a change.

Today I was at Walmart with my partner when we came across the Christmas section. I saw a random italian flag they were selling in the aisle so I picked it up and said to my partner, “What the fuck is this?”. I wanna be clear I said that in an inside voice. Nothing loud whatsoever. At the other end of the aisle (we were at one end) there was a small family of two parents and two kids. My partner immediately hushed me slightly angry and told me to be quiet, there’s kids. We kept walking and talking and I maintained they’re just words, it’s not my responsibility to censor myself in public because kids *might* overhear. Plus, it’s Walmart. I’m poor as hell but cmon, you get what you pay for, it’s not a Whole Foods. 

He kept maintaining though that you just cannot swear in public or at least within distance of kids (honestly I didn’t even see the kids there until he pointed it out, I’m not exactly keeping an eye out for children when I go grocery shopping). I added that I have 9 younger siblings all ranging from 1-12, they don’t swear in public nor do they repeat what random strangers say. It’s parents responsibilities to make sure they’re not parroting random strangers in public, that’s not my job. I’d get it if I was swearing to be insulting to someone but I just was pointing and laughing at the Italian flag in the Christmas section. I even asked my best friend and she agreed that it’s stupid for me to censor myself in a Walmart if all places cause children might hear the F word. But my boyfriend maintains it’s messed up to do that and even added that I’m bad for attempting to justify it.

Again, I told him he’s not obligated for anything at all. He still insists and gets upset. I don’t want conflict so I cave in.

Me and my first girlfriend were celebrating her birthday. We were at a club with her and my friends and she had wanted to dance. The club we were at was set up so that the dance floor was like a stage so that everybody in the club could see who you are and watch what you were doing. Me being a fairly big introvert at the time was already a bit overwhelmed at the whole thing so I really wasn't comfortable with dancing in front of everybody. So I had told her to go on ahead but I didn't want to dance.
She looked crestfallen but went on ahead. About 5 minutes one of her friends comes up to me.
""Hey do you want to dance?""
I respond again no I'm good. They leave and another 3 minutes go by. Same thing happens again. 2 minutes go by same situation. Minute goes by. Now it's my friends and at this point afterwards I'm asked about 20 times in 10 minutes.

This keeps happening from the same people until the last time when I had been told that my girlfriend had started to cry because I didn't want to dance and both her friends and mine had been trying to get me out there. At this point the anxiety that had been building up just hit and I still refused. And we soon left the club afterwards.  I felt bad then because I had made my her cry but I really didn't want to put myself in a situation that in my head felt l was being forced to do and was something that I had was uncomfortable with.

However looking back at it I realize that could have been a situation where I could have come out of my shell and enjoyed myself. It could have been seen as me being uncaring because I didn't go out of my way to push myself for my girlfriend. In fact one friend told me afterwards that sometimes you just have to suck it up.  However I was already in a situation that I was uncomfortable with and was being pushed to my limit.

My cousin and his girlfriend had a baby in August. We're not close, only see each other once a year at most. Outside of that one get together, we don't talk or text at all. 
When his daughter was born, everyone in the family, including me, bought them a gift from their registry. In my country it's customary to give people to get you a gift for a baby, a specific kind of candy, or a thank you card or text. Nobody in the family received a thank you from them, not even a text. To be clear, there were no complications and mom and baby were both fine. 

We had a party yesterday with the family, where we all saw the baby for the first time. Again, cousin and his gf didn't mention the presents to anyone. Other family members mentioned to each other how they were hurt by this. I then said to my uncle (not cousin's father, a different uncle) how if they have another baby, I probably wouldn't bother with a gift anymore, because obviously they don't appreciate it. My uncle said I would be TA in that case, because they probably just forgot and didn't do it on purpose. I think it's just basic decency to at least thank someone for a gift.

It's not the best house by any means, but it was all we could find. 4 of the rooms are relatively large rooms with a nice amount of space to live in, and then there is one TINY room.

I live downstairs in the room pretty much at the front of the house. We had discussed who would take the tiny room and agreed whoever lived in there would pay less rent. One of the girls, we'll call her S, agreed to stay in that room and we had a somewhat loose agreement that if she didn't like it, we could *DISCUSS* moving rooms. Everyone kind of forgot about this agreement because it wasn't really an agreement, I think only one or two people acknowledged it via text.

Fast forward to a couple days ago, we have a house meeting, and S says she wants to move rooms. She says the room is too small, she can't do her work (she studies architecture so she needs to draw/make models) and there is mould in the room. She hadn't mentioned the mould before - I assumed at the time it wasn't that bad (I'll get back to the mould later)

None of us want to switch, and it's an awkward silence of waiting for someone to come forward. Eventually someone comes up with the idea of doing name in the hat and whoever gets pulled will move. I don't like this idea - most of us don't, but at this point I'm getting nervous about the situation, and I don't want to be a part of it. I kind of skedaddle for a bit to calm down and by the time I return, the whole thing has happened and it's MY name that gets pulled out of the hat. I freak out. I don't want to move, my room is my safety and back at home outside of university I live on a sofa in a cluttered living room, so having my own space finally is important to me. I leave the room, likely visibly upset and not wanting to show that because I'm thinking 'well, this is fair, I can't complain, I kind of agreed to this'. I calm down a bit later but I'm not happy with this turn of events.

Later that evening I go upstairs while S is out and peek into her room, just to understand what I'm getting myself into. And then I see the mould. I see it, freak out, and two of my other housemates look too and are disgusted. It’s bad. Apparently, the landlord won't do anything about it and want the mould dried out so they can just paint over it.

Either way, I don't want to move into this room. And I'm going to refuse to move because I think this situation is dumb and a stupid solution to the issue. My room is my space, I've been living here for 3 months now, and I don't think it's fair that I'm being told to move out of it. Nobody should be living in that room until that mould is removed. I'm considering telling S to sleep on the couch until it's resolved, but I feel bad about invading her privacy to see the room, so I haven't mentioned to her that I've seen how bad it is yet.

naturally john is very upset over this, i’ve been trying to be as supportive as possible, i know losing someone who was that close to you can hurt and i want to be there for him. he has been pretty distant and quite towards me since it happened but i really didn’t want to pry. well last night he broke down crying and we finally talked about it. im not going to lie and say hearing him talk about her that way didn’t hurt but i really just wanted to be there for him.
after talking for an hour or so he asks me for a favor and brings out one of her sweaters he’s kept and asks me to put it on. i was so confused that i didn’t really say anything and then he tells me that he just wants to hold her one last time. 
this is where i feel like the asshole. i got up from the bed and walked right out the door. he started calling for me and he was crying but i just felt sick to my stomach i had to get outside. i cant stop wondering if there were times he was thinking of her while he was with me. he didn’t follow me outside and i eventually drove home, after i told my sister about it she said i was a total asshole for just leaving him and that he was just trying to “properly grieve” but the thought of me wearing her clothes so he can pretend she’s there instead honestly makes me sick.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4855854,public,top,self,AITA for not letting my boyfriend “properly grieve” his ex?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zczlrb/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_properly_grieve/,all_ads,6,,,,

We’re in college and have a long winter break. My roommate initially told me that he’d be going back home for break, so I thought it would be a fun idea to have my two cousins (17m and 19m) visit me this year and stay with me, on an air mattress in the living room. We all grew up together and are super close. They would only stay for 5 days, so nothing crazy, just enough time for a quick visit.
     I floated the idea around my roommate, and as soon as he realized that I’d be staying over break he decided that he’d be staying too-and that he’d be uncomfortable with my cousins staying while he was home. I get why he’d be uncomfortable with having my cousins stay while he was home, so I said ok and told my cousins it was a no go. I did think it was annoying that my roommate changed his mind about staying last minute and only after he knew I’d be staying.  I also was a little bit annoyed because if he was already planning on going home, than why couldn’t he stay an extra week so my cousins could visit? This all happened a couple of months ago, so I kind of just gave up on seeing my cousins for the rest of the year because I don’t have a car to visit them, and they have a car but no money for a hotel right now. 
    Fast forward to today- today I get a text from my roommate letting me know that he had a change of plans and now might not be home until after new years. This really annoyed me because now that he is staying longer over break, it means my cousins could have visited without breaching his privacy. I confronted him and told him that now there’s no good reason that I’m not seeing my cousins this year, because of him, and he got super upset about it, and told me I wasn’t respecting his comfort levels.

I.e twice a week.) This did not work for her and she began smoking again recently after saying I should not interfere every day.

So I got mad at her said ""How can you be selfish enough to want me to respect your boundaries but not respect mine, I asked you not to lie to me so you find loopholes. Also miss Willpower and do not need me to help you stop doing drugs everyday you're at eight times in a week. You're asking me to follow every boundary you made and getting mad at me whether I follow them or do not. Then not following my one fucking simple boundary of not lying to me.""

For context yesterday and two days prior (we live together) she asked me to give her space so I left her be for the night and the following day until she would I assume say she is okay now. She has this listed as a boundary and that she would say when she is ready as a boundary. Then went off on me and swore profusely at me for ignoring her.

God Mom texts me and asks me where im going to be this weekend, I said my Dad (I already knew where the convo was going) but I said that I can try to move things to see what I can do.

I played two games Thursday, right after the first one God Mom asks “Still leaving us to go with your dad?”, “Yes ma’am”, “You’re abandoning us to hang out with your Daddy?”.

She even says I’m like my mom, putting everything else before basketball (isn’t true, I live 45 min from school and still go to 6:30 practices, argue with my mom to play for them, play for them sick, etc).

We argued before I moved my stuff for the next team.

We got home that night and I said, “I would go if I would’ve known last week”, she says “You still would’ve made the plans, and left us”.

Friday in athletics I wasn’t t feeling good, I felt like shit. I got rude with my coach so he left and God mom came over.

Athletics ended with me reminding her I couldn’t go she says “I talked to your mom, she’s talking to your dad”, I guess I made a face because “You didn’t want me to talk to your mom, did you?”.

“No”. “That’s what I FUCKING THOUGHT! Get out!”.

Anything in me that wanted to play quickly left. But now me and her aren’t talking, only through my mom even though she has my phone number.

We've always been able to barely scrape by by reusing some placeholder images that can barely be considered appropriate for the situation, but that's as much as you need to know. We can't hire another programmer because our results aren't good (i.e. We use placeholder images) so the company refuses to increase our budget.

Anyways, the good illustrator, A, was completely swamped with work since he was helping B make up for his deficit. His schedule became close to the programmers', which isn't very good. In my experience, programmers can work whilst half-dead, while illustrators cannot. Therefore, A's work has become worse. 

So, as project manager and resident jack of all trades, I took some of B's work to free up A, then used photoshop and other things to create illustrations, on top of my usual programming work. 

Then, A found out, and basically went on strike. Apparently, it's 'fine' for other illustrators to do work, but it definitely isn't fine for a programmer to butt in where he isn't needed, and that programmers should keep to programming. That reaction was actually expected, because B warned me that A really fucking *loves* face, so I initially hid the fact that I was helping with illustration from him. Regardless, A refused to illustrate anything for around a day, so we went even further out of schedule. 

So, when I was reporting to my supervisor, he, a former illustrator, decided to forfeit my salary, because apparently 'I sHoUlDn'T hAvE iLlUsTrAtEd OvEr HiS hEaD."" 

I guess professional illustrators hate it when others take their work?

She is in the tween stage where she is into electronics, fashion, and makeup.  However, she also still occasionally plays with her dolls and toys.  I do not discourage her playing with the toys. I like that she still enjoys dolls and her toys, but I see her playing with them less and focus on things like her Switch and tablet so I don’t intend to invest more money into a waning interest.  That being said my daughter put dolls on her Christmas list.  My mother had asked if I was getting them for her or if she should.  I said, “You can get them if you want, but I think it’s a waste of money as she doesn’t play with her dolls often and she is getting older and is playing with her Switch and games like Roblox more than she plays with dolls.”  This apparently pissed her off but she is passive aggressive so her revenge had to be through my child.

My daughter saw a commercial for the dolls and mentioned having them on her Christmas list.  My mother turned around and said, “Oh I know I wanted to get them for you, but your mother says you are too old for dolls so you will have to grow up and stop wanting them because I am not allowed to get them for you and she won’t.”

My daughter became very upset after hearing this and started crying because I was “deciding what she wants and forcing her to grow up.”  I explained to my daughter my side and what I actually said  and we made our peace over some hot chocolate.

I am not passive aggressive.  I am not sure if I’m an asshole, but I know I was a bitch because I was pissed.  Once my child went to bed I told my mother what I thought of her stunt and I told her I never said she couldn’t get them or that my daughter needs to grow up, I just thought they were a waste of money that could go towards something that she would use more and that the only person that needed to grow up was her and to stop causing fights with her passive aggressive manipulations and that if she had an issue with what I said she should have “put on her big girl pants and come to me instead of upsetting my daughter.”

She told me I was an asshole for speaking to her that way and she will get whatever she wants for her grandchild.  She also said that I should respect that maybe my daughter just wants to be a kid a while longer and I should be encouraging this instead of forcing her to grow up.  She also involved my father and brother in the fight.  My brother is on my side, dad is on the fence as I was taught to respect my elders and parents.

I'm a graduating senior and I've spent the past 3 years swimming for my schools JV and Varsity team this year and have swam for a club team for about 6-8 ish years. I've never been one of the fastest swimmers, but I do my best to keep pace with everyone and get out of the way when necessary.

I live in a relatively tropical location, so swimming is fairly popular here.

I've noticed that throughout my time as a swimmer, that the culture of these swim teams and clubs are fairly ""toxic"".

The coaches of these teams (whether school or club) often pay no attention to you if you're not one of the fastest members of the team, and/or are commonly rude (yelling and insulting you if you are not making the time). 

The members of these swim teams also can be very vulgar and mean I'm not against making dirty jokes but I joined my clubs discord and they were saying so really horrible things about women and race that made me really uncomfortable. These members also will often talk shit about people for being slow behind your back and will ignore them even when that person was pretty nice.

There's also this culture of ""loyalty"" to a specific club or school. If for whatever reason a person needs to switch clubs or schools, I've seen other swimmers that used to be friends with that person ignore them because their a ""traitor"".

So the reason I may think I'm the asshole is that I was never crazy in to swimming. Like I said earlier I am not fast by any means, so maybe that's why the coaches did not have time to coach me? 

Idk, I could really use some help on this.

Friday, I was working the electronics line when this big dude, probably 6'4 330# comes in with a speaker. IT was a busy day, considering it was the first of the month. We had a long line. 

The big dude was hollering at me about having to wait in line and how he's been waiting for 30 minutes. My teammate told him that he had to wait his turn like everyone else, and when it's his turn, we'll tend to him. He fired back with ""that's some straight up bullshit.""

AT that pawn shop, we have each other's backs, and the owners tell us all the time we have the right to refuse service. After this dude kept trying to bully and menace his way to have his turn, I decided to invoke that right. 

I chime in with ""tell you what, we're not interested in your item. Take it elsewhere."" That prompted our security guard to step in. He didn't do anything, but the big dude kept talking, asking me why I needed him. I explained that he was causing a scene and it's his job to make himself present when a customer causes a scene.

My husband and I made a freezer packet of Trader Joe’s chicken chow mein for the kids for dinner, which isn’t usually met with enthusiasm but they are ok about it and all have eaten it plenty of times. My older son (almost 8m) came to me and asked not to eat his red peppers. I knew he did not typically eat red peppers so I told him that if he ate his other veggies besides the red peppers, he could still have ice cream. My daughter did not eat most of the chow mein except the noodles. She has eaten that same TJ dinner before multiple times, and eats each and every individual ingredient sautéed like that on a regular basis. I told her that if she wanted ice cream that she needed to eat the chicken (about 1oz) that she had not eaten and to eat half of the veggies (about 1oz) - I told her that she could pick out certain veggies if she’d like. She started to fuss a little and I told her that if she really didn’t want to eat those veggies, she didn’t have to but she wouldn’t get ice cream. She was even offered a rice and beans dish in the alternate, though that is a dish she won’t eat but it’s what we had on hand and could separate and eat if she really couldn’t eat the chow mein veggies.

I brushed him off, and my daughter ate half her veggies with a bit of fuss after she knew I was serious about her not getting ice cream if she didn’t eat half.

My dad, his gf; and my siblings came to visit (I live across the country) over Thanksgiving. From the start, I could tell something was off about my dad‘s gf. 

She lied about having lived in my city in the past, all it took was looking at her LinkedIn to prove this. When I confronted her, she said “oh- I meant I traveled here for work.” Also found out she lied about being a nurse - she works as a receptionist at a Dr’s office. Didn’t confront her about the second one. 

So right off the bat, I think she’s a phony. They’ve only been dating 3 months. She doesn’t have kids of her own. 

My siblings and I bickered throughout the trip as normal, over petty shit siblings fight over. My dad‘s gf was appalled at this and scolded us every time. At one point she even said “I can’t deal with this” and walked out of the restaurant bc my brother and I were debating politics. It wasn’t hostile, just a heated discussion. My bro and I laughed it off and were taking pics together 5 mins later, while my dad‘s gf was still storming in the bathroom. She’s not used to being around large families. And she’s not used to being around “kids” never having had any of her own. 

She also kept trying to control me, like when one of my sisters and I wanted to go to a bar &amp; she didn’t want us to go, even though my sister is 22. She went out with my dad and wanted it to be “just the two of them” but then flipped when me and my sister wanted to go out because “how could my dad let us go after our behavior”.  Or when my phone died at their hotel and instead of calling me an Uber to get home, she told me to stand on the curb (in freezing weather) and get myself a cab at 2 am. The last night they were here was my final straw. 

They ran out of beers at the concession stand at a concert we’d gone to, so I told them I was going up to the next level to get a beer. His gf goes “Really? Why can’t you just enjoy the show without having to drink?” I’d drank 1 beer; she was on #4. I lost my shit. I got into her face and asked her “(Name) why are your eyes so red? Maybe you’re the one that needs to hold off on the drinks. Please stay in your place and stop trying to control me, a 26 year old.” My dad was livid and told me to apologize. I told him I think his gf is a bitch and a phony, I’m not sorry, and went back to my seat.

Don't worry harmless... I thought anyway. So it was both of our days off ok, and I decided to send him his wife and his kid breakfast from one of the casinos out here (I'm in Vegas).

 Anyway I told the door dash driver what I was doing to take off whatever sticker or tag that had my name because I wanted them to be mildly confused and have breakfast on me. She thought it was funny and agreed.

Then for lunch I sent them 3 sauce only pizzas (the idea made me laugh - also I had the pizza place put his name on the box to drive home the confusion).

Then I called him "" how was lunch"" he was like you dick lol. 

So this is where the problem starts. Apparently he and his wife have decided to be a little more frugal... Which is fair with the economy and all. She was fine with him ""buying"" breakfast but was rather livid when he ordered 3 large sauce only pizzas. I laughed because it was funny to me, but he asked me to apologize to her, so I did. She calmed down a bit, called me an ah and that was that. 

My other female friend was saying that I am definitely an ah because I don't know how badly the conflict could have gotten and depending on how severe the need to tighten up the purse strings is I could have caused a huge fight.

We have lived here for about 1 year now and recently got a new neighbour (3 months). And our neighbours have been stalking and spying on us since they moved in. It’s a family of four living over there with a mom and a dad and young children which I don’t think are involved in the stalking. It’s the two parents. I have caught both of them of them outside on the lawn several times throughout the morning (5 Am) roughly just standing there pretending to do stuff like move garbage even though I’ll watch them through the window and see them taking extra long to do so. Not only this but they always happen to leave their house at the same time that I do, I’ll leave for 8am at my work and they will happen to leave at same time. I even switched my time at work to try and evade them which they’ve magically seem to change there schedule too and often leave at same time as me. This kinda stuff has been going on since they moved in, now heres were things get interesting. So I go to buy some snacks at 1am, right (this was last week) and as soon as I shut the door to leave, I look in their window and I see the dad come walking towards the big window to watch me. Now with me wanting a baby with my girlfriend soon I can’t have no creep around my family or potential child so I needed to cut that shit out right away so I stick the finger at him and start banging on the window telling him to stay the Fuck away from my family. 

He calls the cops on me, nothing happened and lied to the cops, basically was told by PD to just go back inside. Now I thought he learned his lesson but on my way to work yesterday I saw his car on the road on my way home from work (I’m pretty sure) which followed me for a few blocks until I escaped, I then got home and ran inside. Sure enough 3 mins later my neighbours home.

I then had a talk with my girlfriend saying she needs to stay inside until I can get us a new place to stay, and explained to her how it’s not safe. I told her I will go to work and work overtime, for her not to worry about the bills just to stay home until we can move out (which will be soon). She gets upset at me saying im acting psychotic and then gaslighting me, even mentioning my mother who had bipolar before she passed. So I told her she’s either kicked out and staying out of the house with her family, or she’s staying in the house with the doors locked until we move. I don’t want her creeping around this house in broad daylight while our neighbours are around. 

She’s upset after this argument, and today she left for work, I am scared she’s going to come home at the wrong time so I took today off. It’s currently midnight as she’s not home yet. I think she’s still mad about our fight

I would come home crying everyday because of it. My mom (Mexican) said the school wouldn’t do anything about it because “ it’s wasn’t an issue” and my dad (Swedish) said the same. 

Later in the school year I got fed up with it and said something about her darker complexion. It offended her and she told her parents. Parents told the school. Right away there was a meeting. The principal dismissed it since she was bullying me the whole year. 

Though something I’m sour with us when I was being bullied for being light and her making me cry everyday wasn’t an issue to the school, but one comment about her and the school had a parent meeting. 

Now to the actual thing that happened at thanksgiving. My family is super divided in whether the girl or me was in the wrong for the reply.

She is a nice person, and I consider her a good friend, but there are numerous reasons why we just don't work romantically. We have not been together in years but have stayed friends.

I have been with my girlfriend now for over a year. I have always been open and honest about my friendship with her. I have not hid anything. I've told her she can look in my phone as I feel I have nothing to hide.

Recently instead of her coming to my house after fixing her car at a male friend's house she decided to go out drinking with him instead, and it really caused problems in the relationship.

The next day she wanted to see my phone, and I showed her.

There were texts that she sent me that she felt were inappropriate. I didn't really think they were. She talked about a day we all got together and spend a day on the river, and she referred to it as ""best day ever""......she sometimes would send heart emojis.....she told me I was very handsome.

I should have let her know that if we are going to be friends she shouldn't talk like that. I own that. There was never any sexual talk or photos or anything like that.

She has been the person that I talk to for support for years, but that has dwindled since I met my girlfriend, but we do still talk. She doesn't have anyone to help her in her life and it makes me feel good to help her. I never thought giving a single mom raising a teenage boy advice on what goes on in a teenage boys mind, or helping them to stay sober and giving her advice on how NOT to get taken advantage of in a relationship was inappropriate. I really just thought I was being a decent human being and a friend.

My girlfriend says that it's inappropriate to be friends with her just because she still has feelings for me. I've never reciprocated any questionable flirtation. I have since told her that for us to remain friends she needs to respect boundaries and respect my girlfriend and our relationship and she has agreed she was a little out of line and she was sorry. She wanted to send an apology to my girlfriend up until she posted a sarcastic comment on Facebook.

Sarah and Rick have been dating for a bit, and so have me and James, so we all knew we would be living as two couples in an apartment. 

Roughly a month ago, me and James got into a fight. It was heated, but we solved everything. Rick overheard the argument and became super mad at James for something he said. From then on, Rick announced he wasn't friends with James, and has yet to speak to him since. No one really gets why. Even more sucky, but manageable.

Anyway fast forward a bit, I have issues with turning the lights off. I always have. It's especially bad when I'm depressed/stressed, which I became after my grandfathers cancer diagnosis and then passing, plus legal issues that requires a lot of traveling, and other family stuff. So my bad habit gets worse.

The apartment was billed an additional $15 extra due to electric overcharges. This is really common in the apartment, but Rick made a point to the group to turn off lights and save money. But he starts getting on me about my lights being left on. I’d apologize and say that I'd work on it. He texts me every other day an essay to tell me about how he doesn't want to pay more money. He never talked to me in person, and always complains about how many times he had to turn them off. I felt bad at first, but after about the third essay/text, I became quite frustrated. It was the same thing every time about how he doesn't want to pay the extra money and it's an easy task with a few lols or lmaos. I tried to compromise with my forgetfulness and offered him to pay $20 at the end of the year to make up for my negligence, but he didn't comment on it. 

Rick started going into my room without asking me so he could turn my lights off, then would text me days later about it. Sometimes he would text me when James leaves on the lights, but didn't seem to care if I said it wasn't me. I started pushing back even more because I felt he was being so unreasonable. 
I want to emphasize that I am still trying to turn lights off, but he's so on me about me costing extra when he has a PS4, and Xbox, aTV, a rice cooker, and the dishwasher, all things I never use, PLUS he puts the thermostat at 23C (73F) and I never see him do anything about these habits to save money. His dad also gives him all his money and I am paying off my rent with the job I'm holding up.

Lately the arguing has been super intense and I ended up screaming at him over texts, telling him he's being totally unreasonable and he needs to stop texting me or blaming me. Not my finest work, but he's too busy to talk to me in person and it's been a good week since I've asked to talk with him. Now it's like every little thing will become an argument.

I try to pitch in as much as possible every year, following my aunt’s lead and discretion. However, I just went full-time at work in April, so my schedule during the week is pretty limited. This means I cannot help my family as much as I have in the past.

Over Thanksgiving, my workplace gave everyone the day of, Black Friday, and the weekend off. I took an extra day off the day before Thanksgiving as well.

My aunt planned to put up our Christmas lights the weekend after Thanksgiving, when I would be completely free to help her.

Instead, we did very little that Saturday due to a late start and her being tired, and nothing at all on Sunday due to her still being tired and unhappy about her own work schedule (However, she is currently in the middle of a stint of two weeks off). She asked if I would be willing to help her early in the morning this past week before I left for work, and I agreed. She also said that she could work on some decorations on her own, due to the sheer amount we have.

Despite her understanding that my time in the mornings is limited, my aunt is still upset that I’m “not helping her,” (not true) complained that she put up 95% of the Christmas lights by herself (which she understood she may need to do), and this evening, ranted about me “just sitting” before going to bed.

As I mentioned earlier, I am more than willing to help my aunt with whatever she asks. However, she likes the decorations a certain way, so I’m afraid of starting things on my own. And how is it my fault that she didn’t take advantage of the FIVE DAYS OFF that I had the week of Thanksgiving, and that I can’t do anything while I’m at work?

I have a Ryuk funko pop. When it first came out it was I think like 20 something bucks? Now it's almost $200 in the condition I have it in.

It was one of the first pop figures I COLLECTED and took care of. The Ryuk is also valuable in a sentimental sense as a cousin (25 now) got it for me when it came out as a gift, and she got cancer a few months after, and to make sure I kept it pristine I got a protector for it since it was one of the few gifts I had from her, and when she beat cancer I never thought to take it out then it got vaulted so I knew I needed to keep it on. So it is in basically pristine condition.

Anyways as for the story: On thanksgiving day I take them to my room and my little cousin sees them and asks to play. I take down the squirtle and dragonite and let her play with them but then she sees Ryuk and wants to play with it too. I told her no and that that was really expensive. She said she wanted to play with it in a grumpier tone and a pouty face and I again said no. I looked over to her older sister for help and she kinda just shrugged at me. I told her she definitely coudln't have it. She whined and went over to her sister. (Now for some context this shelf is fairly high up, and our entire family is short, hell I'm the tallest dude and I'm 5'6, however my step-dad is incredibly tall and is the only person in the entire family who could reach it without a ladder and the only ladders are in the garage so I knew it would be fine.) Anyways later I went to help my mom cook, and I come back up to call em for dinner and there I see it, the box opened violently and it was damaged and her just playing with the toy. The box significantly jacks up the price. I panicked and shoved her off of it and tried to save the box.

She ran to her mom and she yelled at me for ""hitting her"". I yelled that I pushed her and she broke my box. and asked her how she got it. My aunt told me that it was just a stupid toy, and that she wanted to play so they got it for her. I told her that it was an almost $200 stupid toy and since the box is ruined she would have to pay me the full price. She called me ridiculous. I told her that she was ridiculous and that she would have to pay maybe 60ish % of the full price. She called me incredibly ridiculous and my parents backed me up and she ended up leaving and my parents basically settled and got her to pay me $150 since the box was so damaged. (like the top was just straight up ripped off).

On Wednesday, I agreed with my roommate that after my final exams on Thursday (the next day) we could go to the mall and do some holiday shopping. I also agreed to drive to the mall since it isn’t walking distance (I have a car but he doesn’t).


Once Thursday came, I felt tired and didn’t feel like driving. Also, I drove him numerously before throughout the semester already, and he did not contribute his fair share of gas in my opinion, so I didn’t want to drive him more. For example, this includes picking him up from clubbing at 2am and hospital volunteering shifts at 9pm. To be fair most of the times we were going to the same place (and hanging out together), but he could at least show some appreciation. 

Anyways, on Thursday, around 3 hours before we were supposed to go, I told my roommate I wanted to take the bus because I didn’t feel like driving. He responded by saying I’m being very rude and inconsiderate because he already planned his day’s schedule on the assumption that he would be getting a ride to the mall. He said he doesn’t have extra time to spend on the bus (which naturally takes longer). Also, he said I made this last-minute change (from car to bus) last week as well, which makes it especially annoying that I was doing it again.

Which was true, I had already planned what I’d do with the cameras, use 2 as a gift for my works white elephant game,give 2 to my cousin and his fiancé for their wedding, gave 2 to my sister and 1 to my parents to share and kept 3 for myself so I can use during my travels next year. 

When I repeated my intent around keeping the cameras, most of then backed off, but the tone of the group chat changed. My friend told me that Hilary was very upset that I was not offering them to her and they brought up the fact that they’re very good friends to me and do so many favours. They asked me to reconsider my plans for distribution.

I’ve been recently learning about boundaries in therapy so I feel like me doing what I did was wrong, but now I’m second guessing whether or not I should have included my friends in the distribution of cameras. Or maybe it was a dick move to show them in the first place?

Some backstory, My roommate and I have been living in a 2 bedroom apartment for about 1.5 years now. We really only became roommates because of mutual connections when both of us were on the hunt for roommates in college. When we first moved in together last fall everything went pretty well and we talked and sometimes hung out. But I went home for 1 month for winter break while she stayed in the apartment. When I came back for the spring semester things started getting really awkward. Like we wouldn’t talk to each other, and didn’t hang out at all. She also would sometimes send me texts with little things she thought I should fix (wiping the stove top after I cook every time, being more diligent on cleaning, throwing away the trash faster). Some of these things I admit I don’t do the greatest job at, but it’s not like she also cleans everyday and keeps up with these chores. 

Anyways, this past fall semester, as we were approaching living together for 1 year, I decided that I still wanted to try possibly building at least an acquantive type relationship, so we hung out once before classes started, but despite this we are still awkward. Now even more so than before. Previously if we saw each other in our common spaces, we would do a little smile or like a “hey”, but now we don’t even acknowledge each other. This past semester, there has been some things that she does that gets under my skin, but to be honest I can’t figure out if I’m just being dramatic or not. I go to bed early around 11/11:30 PM since I have 9 AMs all week and need to be up early, my roommate however is a night owl and sleeps around 2/3 AM, and wakes up at 11AM/12PM. This means that she is often awake while I am getting ready for bed. We have an in unit washer/dryer and sometimes she will wash her clothes late at night, vacuum, watch videos with the sound fully turned up in the living room, or sometimes even cook with the vent fan on. I don’t want to come off as picky and rude, but this really bothers me. A couple nights ago she starts washing her clothes at 12 AM, and she doesn’t finish until almost 2 AM. Mind you, our washer sometimes makes loud banging noises when it’s too full. I still want to be respectful to her since she clearly is a night owl, and I am sure sometimes I am also loud getting ready and cooking breakfast at 8 AM.

We are inside and Im talking to Tyler about some random stuff, how the day is going, etc. Anna, emily+zella get the stuff they want and the Manager(Mitchell) has to go do something, Tyler has to check them out at the counter. I go back to talking with tyler for a few minutes before I go up and buy a pack of gum and put gas in my car. At this point Im getting rushed and I go up to tyler and say bye. I get done pumping gas and we back home

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever we got back to the house I opened snapchat on my phone. I saw a message from Tyler. It went along the lines of ""That tall chick was pretty cute ngl"" I was confused at first, because all of them are pretty tall. Emily and Anna is 5'9 and Zella is 5'11. Emily happened to glare over and saw the text(I really couldnt give 2 craps) and she doesnt do anything. I message back tyler and asked which one. He goes the tallest one which is Zella.

&amp;#x200B;

I show zella it and she goes haha, He ends up asking for her snap(she doesnt have it because her parents) and only has IG. Tyler said he was gonna make a move on her, I told zella that and she didnt feel comfortable with it, It is also important to note that tyler has had a bunch GF in the past and none of them had made it past 3 months. I tell tyler that zella didnt feel comfortable with it and he kept pushing it a bit. And even tried to get me to give him it. There is a different knowing someone your whole life and then just meeting someone and trying to get in a relationship with them. I will say whenever I transfered schools this year-Anna and Emily helped me to get use to it, I would say that is different(Personally, and we became really close) everyone at the house who was in high school agreed with that. Tyler kept pushing, pushing me to give zella number to him and I said no every time. Zella also said she wasnt gonna get into a relationship in High [school.One](https://school.One) of the times I responded to him saying ""You not gonna get a solo shot on her, Im going after her too"" which was just to throw him off.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4855659,public,top,self,AITA for not giving my friend a girls Phone #,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcy53w/aita_for_not_giving_my_friend_a_girls_phone/,all_ads,6,,,,

I (31 m) recently found out a close friend (29 f) thinks i might be her sons dad (7 m). Long story short, she says she just found out his ""dad"" is not his dad so that narrowed it down to me and this other guy that died of drug overdose. Dont worry about the guy whi she thought was the dad, he wasnt helping out financially, he just occasionally hung out with the kid. She told me all this right before Thanksgiving and said we should get a DNA test to be sure this time. She was already coming over to have Friendsgiving with me and my wife (27 f)  but her son is NOT welcome at his ""dads"" house now that he isn't his. Thanksgiving rolls around and even though I've seen the kid a dozen times, now I notice the kid looks a bit like me. I get why it's a struggle to puzzle it out because she definitely had a ""type"". My wife falls in love with this kid. She's saying he looks JUST like me and letting him lick the spoon (which is MY job lol) and told him to pick the music and she already got along with his mom as well. So they stay in a hotel (we had a few friends over who were taking up the pullout sofa) and the next day my wife buys my ""son"" God of War ragnarok. She has said she doesnt want to give birth and she seems pretty sure, so I'm sure my ""son"" seems like the answer to her prayers. As you can tell from the title... we get the news back that he's not my kid like a week later. Me and his mom get on the phone and she's really sad. Outside of the physical aspect, she's my friend. It kills me to think of breaking the news to the kid and my wife and some members of our friend group that have always hated the kids dad for not pitching in monetarily. I don't have an issue with pitching in and my wife bought him a 70 dollar game not 24 hours after meeting him. 😐.  I think it's in everyone's best interest to leave things as they are. I did tell my brother though, because I wanted to know if it was legal. He said that lying to everyone is a HORRIBLE idea and that after Christmas we should come clean.  He thinks that keeping ANY secrets is always bad and will always blow up in my face. If my ""son"" finds out I'm not his real dad years down the line... will it matter after I give him a great life and teach him how to reset a wifi router or whatever dads teach their kids? And as for my wife... she said she doesn't want a baby to torpedo through her body ( her words) and she already likes this kid... so it's kind of like a Christmas gift to her 🤔  right?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4855656,public,top,self,WIBTA If I didn't tell them he's not my son,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcy49x/wibta_if_i_didnt_tell_them_hes_not_my_son/,all_ads,6,,,,

It was my first time being vulnerable with him about something and I cried to him. He became uncomfortable with my crying and walked out on me during a weak moment. He reached out not long after saying he “was having trouble handling my emotions” and asked for a two week break from our relationship. Betrayed and frustrated I broke it off entirely telling him if he can’t be with me during the hard times he doesn’t deserve me at all.

The breakup broke me and I reached back out very soon after asking to get back together but he declined. He said maybe I was right and we should be apart. He suggested that I needed to spend time working on myself. Although I was emotionally gutted by this I tried my best to heal and just move on.

Flash forward to about a month later I’m starting to be doing slightly better but we began communication again. At first it was just catching up but it escalated. We agree to becoming FWB with NO commitment. Secretly I was hoping he would fall in love with me again.

Eventually months passed and we did become quite close again. Practically back together, but not. Still FWB with no technical label. Despite still pining during this time I made a new friend from work who I started becoming close with.

Work friend let me confide in him with everything I was dealing with and more. He actually listened. We began talking more and more and then seeing eachother more and more. It became apparent how compatible we were the only problem with him is that my face hurt from the amount of smiling and laughing I did around him. It felt like no time with him was sufficient I needed more. Suddenly I was rainchecking on my ex bf to spend more time with my work friend. Although I could sense my ex becoming frustrated with my growing emotional distance he assured me this was okay as we weren’t exclusive and even encouraged me to keep getting to know my work friend.

Finally I let my heart win. When I realized I was in love with my work friend I almost immediately confessed my feelings to him. He told me he felt the same for awhile. Nothing ever felt so right. I called my ex and told him I wanted to end our FWB relationship and be platonic. 

My ex blew up. Suddenly he couldn’t live without me. He asked me to move in with him and told me he actually wanted to marry me one day. He went from crying, begging me to get back together with him and saying that he never wanted to breakup in the first place to being angry at me and yelling and calling me horrible things. 

I feel immense guilt especially because he was saying I abandoned him and he threatened to off himself. But also I feel blindsided. Why now? I do think I deserve to give things with my work friend a chance. But maybe I’m selfish for falling for someone new while still being FWB with him?

At night it regularly floats around subzero temperatures (currently it is 27°F) and during the day it seldom goes above 45.

For some reason, my roommate (18M) has been running his three fans since arriving on campus back in August, including one he keeps in front of our shared window, which he props open with a piece of wood.

At first, I was convinced he did this as a means of cooling himself off at night, but as we progressed into the school year and he kept doing it, I’m convinced he’s got other reasons for it. 

Despite being an incredibly outdoorsy type (he racks his massive downhill bike in our dorm) he doesn’t shower every night, and his gas is pungent enough to have woken me up on multiple occasions. The guy smells horrible and I believe that him keeping the window open is his way of handling it.

But I can’t handle having the window open.

It’s just too fucking cold.

I’ve slept in our dorm’s common area before simply because I can’t handle this kid’s unwashed ass and sleeping in freezing temperatures at the same time. He and I generally ignore each other, and I don’t want to start a conversation with him about his lack of hygiene or the room temp for fear that he might mess with my stuff when I’m gone.

I have half a mind to just shut his fan off right now and close the window, as I’m sick and wearing three layers in my own room just so I can work without worrying about hypothermia, but it is his stuff that I’d be putting my hands on and I don’t want to overstep.

My mother can't stand this. One of her friends...we'll call her K (35/f) comes up a lot on my mother's dime (we're 1,500 miles away from the old home town) .

She historically buys my mother tons of alcohol regardless of where she is in her recovery.

I said ""no, I won't come over while K is there, like I've said in the past, but if you want to come over here I'd be happy to celebrate with you and grandma"". My mother freaked out and went on this long rambling argument about how Christmas is about forgiveness and I was going to miss having a last Christmas with my dying grandma because ""of stupid things that happened long ago. None of those things you say she did happened. And regardless She's in therapy now!"" (I have proof of these past issues) I explained I'm happy for K getting treatment, but that it doesn't change how I feel, and maintaining this boundary is important for my mental health.

about a month after we got married, she started talking about how she didnt like the smell of the cigarettes, especially in the apartment. eventually she started making comments about the drinking too. after some struggling from the almost decade of smoking nonstop, I was able to make the switch to vaping, which I thought would stop the smell that she hated, and hardly ever drink anymore.

this was fine for a while, and I heard no complaints from her until about a month and a half ago. she started saying that she didn't like the vaping either, and asked me if I could quit. thinking that it was the smell again, I promised her that I wouldn't do it if she was around, and only would do it if she wasn't in the room, or if I was at work, etc. she said okay, but it seemed like something was on her mind. still, she didn't bring it up for another week.

now, it has gotten to the point that we can't get through the day without her bringing it up, and asking what it would take for me to quit.

His mother tried her best to diffuse the situation. 

In the end, they let me stay at their house, although things were very tense. We left and each time we came back Alejandro’s father never acknowledged my presence other than a curt greeting.

I have no problems with them at all. I just want to keep to myself and not interact with them. I'm awkward around kids. I don't know how to interact with them very well. I don't want to have kids, so I never counted on knowing how to interact with them aside from being friendly and straightforward with them.

He said ""Look, don't do this just because I told you to, but do it for him"". He pretty much wants me to do to this for him, and I just want to love him from a comfortable distance.

Around 3,5 years ago we started hooking up. Almost 2 years ago our relationship changed and I admitted to having feelings. We kept hooking up, hanging out and talking every day. Both of us have dated other people over the years, but end up back together. 1,5 years ago he said he loves me and 1 year ago we both admitted we are more than friends but less than dating but he said that he sees me as his person. He often says he loves me, I’m his person, I’m an amazing etc.

Everything became a huge mess on a party a few weeks ago. We had decided that I would stay the night and we hooked up + having “us time” before everyone arrived.

This was a party with his friends and colleagues and I knew very few. I noticed that he kept checking to see where I was and how I was doing. Rather late he was wasted, we sat and talked amongst just me and him. Then a woman interrupted us, talked over me, just in general acted as if I was a problem. She then made moves on him, he didn’t stop her and I just got up when I realised they would kiss. One of our friends saw what happened fuming. She basically was grinding on him kissing him. I walked back into the room and just said “bye” and walked out. He got up 30 sec later and body blocked him so he couldn’t grab me and try and talk. 

We kept arguing and fighting for days after. Then one night I just told him that for us to keep seeing each other I would continuously be hurt because he keeps doing stupid things just because he want to do them with complete disregard to how it affects me. I told him it was better if we just ended everything and not to be even be friends. He was very upset and refused to leave, because he didn’t want things to end. He promised to never just leave or disappear on me no matter what. However he texted a week later that he is indeed leaving because this has negatively impacted him and his mental health, he also said it’s because he doesn’t want to continue ruin everything. Haven’t spoken since.

So, am I the asshole for reacting the way I did at his party and after, when we’re not dating?

Father in law has always been irresponsible with money and wants to borrow 5k.
As mentioned in the title, he gave my husband an earful for taking out a large mortgage for our current home.  He knows interest rates in Sydney are skyrocketing.  He knows we have a young child as well.
He has siblings to ask.  My husband's mother (father in law's ex-wife) as well.  All of them are settled and have no mortgages.  The fact that he is embarrassed about asking them is NOT MY PROBLEM.

Husband pretty much said OK without asking me.  He reckons 5k is no big deal.  
For me, it's the principle AND the fact that we are the last ones FIL should be asking.
Why should WE have to be the ATM?  
I told my husband that we are not in the position to lend money.  It might be 5k now, but this will set a precedent.

When Alejandro first introduced me to his family his father blew up. He began yelling and telling us that it was wrong and immoral to be gay. That gay people were perverse and dragged you into a lifestyle that took you down a bad road. After a lot of shouting between Alejandro, his sisters and his dad. His mother tried her best to diffuse the situation. 

In the end, they let me stay at their house, although things were very tense. We left and each time we came back Alejandro’s father never acknowledged my presence other than a curt greeting. I tried my best to try to start conversations with him about things that might be interesting (he works in a trade and I tried my best to look some stuff up about his specific trade and talk to him about it), but he always shot my attempts down.
 
Eventually my husband and I got married. His father didn’t show up to the wedding or even call to congratulate us. Along with some other very upsetting interactions with my husband’s family, I decided I didn’t want to go back to his family’s home. 

I always encouraged my husband to visit, but I myself would not go. I told my husband why and he confronted his father again about his treatment of us and our relationship (on a trip to his family’s house that I didn’t go on). His father told him that he was a disappointment and that his lifestyle was not something he could ever support. Because of this my husband cut off his father for a year. He didn’t speak to him or visit his family during that year (though he did see his mom and sisters without his father on a family trip). 

Eventually, his father apologized to my husband and they have both made up. 

Here’s where I feel I might be the asshole. My husband wants to visit his family for the holidays. I’ve suggested that we both go to our respective families and then meet up at my parent’s house for Christmas. He is upset at me because I don’t want to visit his family.

There’s a kid in our school known for being dramatic. He gossips, makes fun of people, references TikTok CONSTANTLY, and pulls “pranks”. He’s kind of an all around asshole, but we talk occasionally since he’s actually an okay person. My other friend, Olivia (not her real name) started dating this guy Will (also not his real name). I’m really happy for her as she seems to be genuinely happy on her relationship. However, the kid who I will now refer to as Jake, decided to start a rumour about their relationship. He basically said some stuff about how Will treated Olivia and then also about their s*x-life (neither of which were true and he had no proof either way).

ONTO THE STORY:

I was walking home with some friends one day when suddenly Jake runs up behind us and tags along. I was a bit put off but brushed it off nonetheless. Slowly, the conversation morphed into a conversation about Olivia and Will. He started to gossip about them having s*x and I said that that was super inappropriate and that it was none of his business. I’ll admit that I did lash out a bit, but I just didn’t think it was right of him to say that.

The next day, I came to school and immediately told Olivia and Will what happened. They were both shocked and angry, rightfully so. Will then went on to text Jake that he was being a jerk and that he was never to butt into their relationship again or he would personally make sure that he was expelled. Olivia’s older brother somehow found out and also texted Jake. Jake exploded and said that Olivia’s brother was threatening him, that I lied about him saying anything, and that everybody hated him. Obviously victimizing himself.

That night, Jake blew up at me. He texted me that I was being toxic and I was ruining a good friendship and he never even said anything to me. I barked back that he was still being and asshole and that he should stay in his lane. He then tried to gaslight me into genuinely considering whether I’d just dreamt or imagined him saying those things. At one point, he texted me saying “scroll up. look at our texts of the past two years”

 I felt like this was a really low blow and it cut me deep since I’d been ranting to this guy about my poor mental health for a while. Now I’m afraid to get him in trouble because he might leak evidence of my mental state to the school and therefore my parents. 

I ended up blocking him and avoiding him but it’s getting tiring since we have mutual friends. I feel as though I ruined a good friendship with someone, but then again I also feel like sticking up for Olivia and Will was the right thing.
