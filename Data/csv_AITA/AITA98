When she cooks, it's good food, good recipes, and I genuinely enjoy most of her dishes. She is also a heavy smoker. I don't know if it's due to the smoking, or other factors, but she frequently coughs hard and rough. It's bordering on hacking. It's been getting worse over the last few years.

My biggest pet peeve is that she doesn't make ANY attempt to cover her coughs or redirect her face when coughing. This ends up putting me in a situation where I completely lose my appetite for her food when she is preparing it, because she very often open-mouth coughs/hacks over the food she is preparing, or *has* prepared and is serving on the counter. I'm at the point now where, if she's making something I'm interested in eating, I'll pay close attention to her process while she's making it, and choose whether or not to indulge if she's been hacking over it in the kitchen.

I haven't said anything, but I'm at the point where I can't get the thought out of my head after she's coughed on things, and I generally will just claim that I haven't eaten and then make myself something later. I will also wash my hands just about any time I touch anything in the kitchen.

I'm a F 36, my brother is 33. During this year my brother has been asking my credit card to buy his stuff (iPhone, iPad, games, collectibles, etc) since he messed up his credit and now he had no cards on his own.
He always pays on time and we never had an issue, recently I've noticed he was spending way more than usual, pretty much using all his source of income. He manages a laundry mat and he spends all the earnings.
I got worried and called mom, she got angry and asked me not to lend it again no matter what, he still owes her a lot. So the last time he asked me for the card I refused, he went straight to mom and asked for hers. She refused too, but she told him to stop spending that much and pretty much an earful. 
My brother called me afterwards and got pissy, saying that I shouldn't have tattletale and other mean things. After that he pretty much stopped talking to me and refused to receive my packages (I work all day and in my country some packages need a signature). 
So today out of the blue he wrote me about my status on my visa, we both renewed at the same time 10 years ago, and I told him that I haven't checked on it yet. Which is a lie, since this Saturday I plan to schedule my appointment.
I plan on letting him do it on his own, so the question is. AITA?

Most of the week she lives with me and I just came home from work, now we didn't had any plans but we knew we were going to see eachother tonight.

One of the first things after saying hi and the usual kiss I give her, I asked her: 
""Are you ok? You look very off.""

She said she smoked weed.

At this point, for me, our social interaction feels fake as I'm the sober party.

So I asked her if the next time this happens she can let me know in advance before seeing eachother that she is not sober. I told her I don't need to know exactly what she has used and it can be 5 minutes before.

I just want to ""ready"" myself that the first 10 seconds of our ""greeting"" may not be the usual.

If we don't see eachother after use, you do you.

She says she feels possessive traits like with her exes coming from me, that i'm not her parent who she has to check in with and also: you see what 'status' i'm in when you see me so I don't feel the responsibility to tell you upfront.

I told her so that I can make a decision beforehand if I want to deal with a not-sober person at that moment.

when i was 13 me and my grandmother who adopted me when my parents left me on her doorstep, were decorating my sister/aunt’s house. 

i had been up all night the previous night with my aunt/sister’s 6 month old and i was deliriously tired.

i wont lie i have a bit of an attitude problem so i know alot of times i keep arguments going that shouldn’t. 

my mom was upset that i wasnt decorating the tree how she wanted and we got into a semi argument. i ended up in tears because she told me christmas was better before i was born.

today we were all around the table talking about the worst thing anyone had said to us, and without thinking i repeated those words.

thise words have haunted me for the past 4 years of my life. i think about it everytime i look at her. every christmas i think about how she wishes i wasnt there, how my presence irritated her.

she pulled me aside later telling me i needed to “get over it” so i told my dad who said he’d handle it.

also some extra info about my grandma/mom

shes 62/63 now unsure which, because i honestly cant care enough.

she’s making me stay home for college and i have to go to the military afterwards.

she starts arguments for no apparent reason and is a chronic complainer, she once told me nothing i do will ever be good enough for her.

My sister and I went to different schools she went to a “normal” public school while I went to a private high school due to scholarships. This boy after boy thing never caused me any problems but I would tell her to maybe start making better choices since she would be out of school 2 years before me. I didn’t want to change her mind but I wanted her t stop and thing for a moment about her future but she didn’t. 

This boy to boy thing didn’t stop even getting to the end of her high school days. She announced one day that she had gotten pregnant and was planning on keeping the baby. My parents weren’t too happy but we’re kinda forced to comply and so they put a 100k into a savings account for the child’s needs.(my parents were both store owners and owned many around our state). This amount being put into the savings account left having to live off little money until I got a job and started to pay for everything. I was having a talk with my sister one day and asked what she would use that amount of money for, she said something along the lines of, “who cares it’s my money now.” I tried to give her some advice on how to spend the money to better her child and herself but she brushed it off saying she doesn’t need help from me. 

After high school was done I got a full ride to a few different colleges. Around this time my parents stopped putting money into the savings account and told my sister to add on to it we’re her and her baby fathers money. And with that I went my way and she went her way. A few days ago I got a call to meet up with my family. Before we get to that story I think it’s important to know that I make almost 500k yearly and I don’t really spend my money I never have even when I was younger. Back to the story when I got to the house I found my sister and her baby father with an upset look on their face. My sister quit her job because people were “sexualizing” her(I put that in quotes because my sister was know for lying about things like that.) They proceeded to say that they both became addicted to gambling and wasted the saving money. 

They came to me and my parents asking for use to help them out. They asked use for an amount so absurd that I don’t spend that amount in 5 months and they need it for 2. I told my sister that’s she should have made better choices or to be “right” but because I cared and I walked out.

I’ve been in the picture a long time and my husband’s father is not all that warm to me - we barely have a relationship, unlike my husband with my family.

This was unexpected, based on how my husband described his father when we first started dating but it is what it is. I did think we’d have more of a relationship by now but my husband says this is normal and he reserves all his energy for him. Fast forward to my pregnancy and his father’s behavior has been at times off putting. When we told him, he asked if it was an accident, which I found insulting as a woman in my 30s and we had advertised we were trying for a family. Then he told my husband we could not name a child after him because his mother was Jewish and you cannot name a child after a live person in the Jewish faith (he and my husband are both vocal atheists). So for two months of my pregnancy, we were discussing if we had to come up with a new name. He gave us his blessing but then said we could not use his middle initial. 

All of this has really soured me on the name. Especially since I was actually pregnant for this whole ordeal. It doesn’t sit right with me that I was pregnant and actively very sick and two dudes in a room decided I had their blessing for what I can and can’t name my child. It felt like weirdly controlling behavior for a situation that is just supposed to be nice.

My husband says his father now says he’s honored and I am overreacting, but I just really resent that this entire process unfolded as it did and I’m being treated like the unfair one now. He also says his father said he has no right to tell us what we can and can’t name our child but that seems null to say after he told us no in the first place. I no longer really want to name my child after the guy and my husband thinks I’m being petulant. I feel it was a weird and off putting response to something that was supposed to be nice and I wish he was on my side. 

TL;DR : Husband’s father told us we could not name our child after him and then two months later gave us his blessing. I told my husband I am no longer sweet on the name and would rather use it as a middle name and he thinks I’m the asshole here.

I would converse like we usually do and she would just give those monotonous responses, when i would want to have the sweet conversations we usually have.

Every time I would give her one of those looks that are like “really?”, she would just say “sorry, I’ve been addicted to my phone recently”.

So this weeks dinner, i was hopeful that we might talk the way we used to (the times when she wasn’t constantly on her phone). But this time she was on it even more when I just decided to leave mid way through. I don’t have any desire to feel as though a technological product is better company than me, so why waste my time?

She has told my friends what has happened and told me that me leaving was “hurtful” and “uncalled for”. Even though on multitude of occasions, she would see that I was visibly irradiated by her scrolling through memes , even if she would try to show it to me, it would make me even more annoyed.

I have informed her of my reasoning and she spewed the angle that I was “overthinking” it or being “overly sensitive”. My group of friends have also said that what I did seemed “unreasonable” and that I shouldn’t leave a loved one stranded in a restaurant.

I (25f) was dating my boyfriend, “Joseph” (28m) for 2 years. The other night we decided to watch the new Top Gun movie. Now I’m the kind of person who gets emotionally involved in movies. A small aside, he would get upset if I would watch any movies with any “Attractive actors” like Vin Diesel, The Rock, Sylvester Stallone, etc. Even watching Yellowstone was out of the question because of Kevin Costner. Anyway back to the story. Of course anyone who watched the original Top Gun movie knows that Val Kilmer was in it. Now he is one I consider a “Celebrity Crush” like others can have. Well in the movie when it played Iceman’s funeral, I cried my eyes out. (It also hit me harder because Val Kilmer had battled throat cancer in real life affecting his speech). Joseph looked at me and asked why the hell I was crying? It’s just a GD movie and Val is still alive. I was puzzled. I asked “I was just crying in the movie because the character died. What the hell?” I also cried when Old Yeller Died. He all of the sudden got up and said “well you know what, just go be with him then. It’s over!” And stormed out. I’m confused and hurt.

I am currently doing Engineering and have to pay off a lot of college loan so I work part time as well. I don't go out that much to eat at restaurants (3-4 times in a month)
 Don't drink a lot and thus save money.

Now coming to the story, me and my girl have been in a relationship for 3 years. It's pretty solid and another thing is she has a weird obsession over lizards. Not those lizards roaming around the walls, these are house lizards I don't know which type since I couldn't care less.

Now me and my girl have keys to each other's house.  (I live in a On-campus hostel where outsiders are not allowed). One week back,  my girlfriend was out working at her job and I went to her house. She would come back in 2 hours so I went and waited there. Popped open a Beer, sat down and started watching some show. I had a shitty day where I got yelled by our professor for sleeping in the class. (I already get excellent grades and that good for nothing professor does not know how to teach).

Anyways then I suddenly felt something crawling around my neck and shoulder area and I immediately swapped at it. Found out it was that damned lizard roaming free around the house instead of being in its closure. 

Obviously this can be attributed to my careless girlfriend. And since I was a bit pissed , I got up went to the window and threw that motherf*ucker from the 12th floor of her room.

Now here is the catch, I thought that Lizards are like cats and that useless thing would survive any fall. So apparently they are not and can die from Fall damage.

Now my girlfriend arrives home, asks where is her stupid lizard and I tell her about it. Next thing you know she has a horified face as if I have done something horrible and she starts physically assaulting me with her handbag! Talk about Drama. I could have called the cops on her or sued her but I didn't since I felt guilty about throwing a reptile.

Anyways she wasn't talking to me the next day so to make up for it even though it was just a misunderstanding on my part about the lizard. I got her a new lizard. And this one was the good kind, much more expensive too than her previous one. I went to her house and tossed it at her and told her next time keep it in the enclosure. Okay so maybe I shouldn't have tossed it at her, my bad. But she got even more pissed and told me she doesn't need a new lizard and she needs Camaile back ( Camaile was the lizard name .....yes, she named her lizard haha). Anyways I think she is overacting and it's been a week and she still won't talk to me. Even though I have apologised and evem brought a new lizard for her which instead of accepting it, she is refusing to foster.

And it was technically her fault for leaving that lizard out of enclosure.

This was super loud crying and I hesitate to say almost seemed like it was an attention seeking thing as it woke me up. I definitely understand that being perennially sick in some way weighs on her.

She accused me of of questioning whether she needed to see a doc, to which I said yeah I am.  I understand she feels like crap but in my mind this kind of sick is something you just ride out. She wasn’t too happy that I was downplaying it.

Last week was pretty stressful so tensions have been pretty high. Last night I could feel I was getting more sick from a cold but thought it would be OK, well I wake up just sick as a dog and have my partner do the morning tasks. He does, no problem, my issue lies with what happens next. He had a dentist appt, work party and meeting with friends today, I thought maybe he'd take into consideration that I was sick as a dog at home taking care of a newborn, a 9 yr old and a dog. 
Nope, he had originally told me he'd be home around 19 (7pm) but didn't show up until 21 (9pm). He gets home half drunk with no idea why I'm sad, I tell him I don't wanna talk about it because he'll just ignore my feelings and make out like I'm being unreasonable. 
Well after a while of seething, tearing up and trying to calm down I explode. I yell that had the situation been reversed i would have never left him at home to suffer alone, he says that he'd never expect me to miss and event like that and *drum roll* I was being unreasonable. I told him to fuck off and that he was an asshole and now I'm too raged to get the sleep I need to get better. I know he'll also still expect me to wake up tonight with the baby since he's got work in the morning (which is fair but at least offer).

She’s blocked on everything and I got a new number after I left about 2/2.5 years ago. My younger brother (17) still lives with her. He’s very non-confrontational and has been calling me more often to talk about things. Never badmouths her but for him to even speak to me about it is concerning because this boy never talks about ANYTHING. 

In September my brother had trouble at college (hadn’t been going and our mum got a call from the college saying his attendance was too low for him to continue) and she forced him into a full time job (wanted rent) he didn’t like at the big chain retailer she used to work at. This is when I started hearing from him more frequently, she was awful to me at 17 and had planned to move to a house with not enough bedrooms and put me in the shed (I have a younger half-sister &lt;10 who she thought needed her own room). Hence why I’m worried.

Bonus: he was offered the shed after me so half-sister could have a bigger room. He said no.

Because of college she stopped his driving lessons, the car she promised him she sold, my paternal grandmother (she raised us with dad) got him back on his course but our mum stopped giving him money for lunch, took his phone and Xbox etc. anything she could do she did. 

My brothers not a bad kid he doesn’t drink or do drugs, he’s never out late, just obsessed with his Xbox. When my brother left high school our mum enrolled him on a level 1 college course when he was capable of doing level 2. He was the only one on his course with a maths GCSE! Everyone thought he was on level 2, we only found out the truth when my nan went into the college! 

My brother wants to go and live with my nan at the end of this academic year. I want to help him get some of his stuff when I’m back at my dads at Christmas. When I collected my stuff there were a few big bits broken/missing. 

I had to buy my bed and mattress for my shed, we had just started coming out of C19 and I hadn’t been able to get a job so I spent what little birthday money I had left (I tried to save it for food because I didn’t get dinner and got locked out at night) and bought them. The mattress she kept and the screws had been pulled out of my bed frame like nails.So I anticipate difficulty getting his things in June so want to suggest moving some small things at Christmas.

 He has an Apple monitor that he got for Christmas 3 or 4 years ago, that’s one thing I don’t think he’ll be allowed to take and she’ll 100% give to our half-sister. He needs to focus on things like that in June.

 I don’t want to give our mum reason to kick off and try to contact me, my mental health can’t take it. I’d kick off or breakdown if I had talk to her again. I wouldn’t go in. Just want to be outside for support and help him carry his things to our dads so he can take more.

They have stayed over pretty much every night since the first date (I knew them for four years before that), although during the day we are both at University. So the only time they are usually at the flat is the mornings and evenings after dinner. My partner has been paying for their own accomodation during this time and their general expenses for their own flat.  

My flatmates have just told me they want to discuss my partner contributing for power. Whilst this makes sense if my partner was going to be living with us more, they are officially leaving the country tomorrow, and we will be long distance from then. During their time at my house, electricity use would be breakfasts and some dinners (which I would have made for my own anyway), and maybe 3 showers a week. 

I don’t feel comfortable asking my partner to pay money for parts of power use over the last three months. To me this feels like ambushing them for money with no choice given to decide that they would rather have us stay at their apartment instead of staying at mine for so long. 

I understand paying for power if they are living here, but given this conversation wasn’t made until my partner is just about to leave, I don’t think it is my responsibility to ask my partner to pay up. Please note that before this, I had asked my flatmates if “Do you have any worries (Partner name) staying over so often and if there was anything you want to discuss” which they responded “No it is all good” to.

I don't like her bracing her hand on top of my thigh because the asymmetrical resistance causes my hip and lower back to kink after a minute. It's caused a few fights.
Today's fight was because I brusquely said ""no hands, or both. I can't do the one hand on my thigh thing.""  Am I the asshole here? It's been well known for weeks now that I don't like that, and that it's at the least a weird distraction that feels like she's directing or attenuation my movements, and after a moment it makes my hip and lower back hurt enough that I have to stop.

My GF likes to put her hand on my thigh during sex, right on top of the quadriceps muscle.  She does this when on her back with me kneeling and holding her legs back towards her chest.  So the problem is that she'd either brace herself against my thigh, or grab and pull me by my thighs, and this adds resistance and makes my balance more difficult; especially when it's only one hand.

Today, I brusquely said ""no hands, or both, I can't do the one hand on my thigh thing.""  She said ""I wasn't pushing or pulling  on you hard"" and left the room. She wouldn't apologize, and insisted that I get on the bed and physically demonstrate what is okay to do in that position.  I refused because I was pissed that she denied my experience and somehow made me into the villain for asserting my preference that she not touch me in a certain way for the Nth time. Pretty much ruined the day for us both 

In the past, I'd just quietly continue as long as I could bear the discomfort, and stop when I had to. But a few weeks ago I told her why I had stopped one time.  I've also used my hand to move her hand off my thigh on a few occasions. 

Being on my knees, balancing on a soft surface and thrusting my hips is already pretty taxing on a mid 30s lower back.  The added resistance is like a countdown to back pain and an unwelcome distraction.  

GF says that she's inside her head making sure she's not pushing or pulling too hard, and that it's hard for her to enjoy herself.  She said she like to cuddle and touch during sex, or else it just feels like just randomly and impersonally thrusting at her pu**y.

Is it reasonable for me to tell her she can touch my knees, my arms, herself, or probably do ANYTHING within reason besides pressing her palms against my thighs while we're in this position?  I feel like it should be enough for me to say I don't like it. Am I the asshole here?

Things I did wrong: being curt with her initially, and refusing to demonstrate the ""correct"" way afterwards. Standing my ground about needing her to acknowledge that I got upset because she won't stop palming my thigh in this position.

In large due to our age gap and that our father passed away when I was 2yo. I grew up with my mother and always saw myself as a single child. Even though my mother would talk about my siblings. 

Starting from when I was 14yo my siblings and I have made some attempts to create a relationship. But it has never worked. We are fundamental different people, and if we didn't share a family connection I would never have spent time with them. So we are low contact.

I had a rocky start in my work life, having a degree i couldn't use. I got tavk to school for a new degree when i was 30. It worked out good and I'm today working a high paying job. 

From my days living on minimum wage and studying I have learnt to take care of my money. I was recently able to buy my own house,  I don't have children and no expensive hobbies.  All this adds up to me being able to put money away each month, which is a big deal for me. A security.

When my father passed away we decided the inherentence so my mother (they were married) got 50% and us children split the other half equally.  My siblings didn't want any of the memorabilia my father collected.  Little value but cool things. I have them now.

Any way. The other day my sister calls me. I'm a little taken aback but OK. I can live with awkward small talk for 20 min. Out of the blue she asks me if I have a will. I didn't think but just blurt our yes. 

She then asks me if her and my brothers children är the beneficiaries.  I'm honest and say no. I have met my brother's two girls once when I was about 20 yo. I have never met my sisters children.

She then starts to question who I will leave everything to. I say that father's memorabilia will go to a aviator museum. Some things will be given to close friends as they hold shared memories. The rest is to be sold and together with my savings be split evenly between an organisation helping people with alcohol and drug addiction and cancer research. 

My sister is livid, telling me that that is money that can make a big diffrent in my siblings children's life. Sure, but I don't feel obligated to provide that for them. If I wanted to leave my money to someone it would be my bf's son. I have seen him grow up and been like an aunt to him.

Now my brother is calling and saying that I'm being cruel and that I am stealing both the past and the future from his children.

I tried to explain the circumstances as to why I thought I didn't hear her and open my door, but I was still punished even though she understood that I wasn't on the phone or taking pictures of myself.

To be fair, it wasn't a HARSH punishment, and she knows I'm *active* in that department, so I don't think she was shocked, but recently it's been awkward between us. I'm still pretty ashamed of the whole thing myself, too.

The photos being taken are this weekend. Our photographer told us what props she had on hand and said she’d perhaps have more by then but didn’t fill us in. This all happened within a span of 16 hours

Anyways, here’s where I might be the asshole. Yesterday I found someone on Facebook who was selling infant sized Santa hats. She told me she had multiple pre-made in each colour/size from a craft show in early Nov, and two already made in their size, so I said perfect! $20 each so $40 and I’d pick up the next day (today). Cash preferred. Sounds good, a bit expensive, but hey, it’ll be cute for photos and I’ve got cash in my wallet. She suggested 10am but I asked for later in the day. We agreed on 6pm rather than 10am as the twins had a doctor appt at 1030 and then I had a dentist appt for myself at 1. This left time for us to get everyone fed/changed/loaded up in the car and drive there without running late. 

My photographer messaged me at 930 this morning and said she had a bunch of hats we can use (elf, santa, reindeer antlers, etc) so I thought perfect! That saves me $40 for something we’ll wear once or twice before they outgrow them. I messaged the girl selling the hats and told her “hey! Our photographer messaged me and said she has Christmas hats and headbands we can use while there. I’m going to have to cancel picking up them tonight. Happy holidays, and thanks anyways!” 

She replied by telling me how rude I am, how she stayed up late to make them by hand and how big of an asshole I am to someone like her. I responded by asking what does she mean? She said she had two already made that I would be picking up, plus numerous others already made from her show. To me this meant she had them pre-made and laying around waiting to be purchased (maybe she made too many for her craft show or they didn’t sell as well as planned) not taking custom orders and making them as the orders came in? Also any person who was doing custom orders (that I’ve purchased from) has required a deposit or payment upfront just so they don’t get screwed if the buyer ghosts. 

She kept telling me how awful I was and how rude that was. I’m not sure if I’m TA because she didn’t tell me she was making them that night - she initially told me she had them already made and ready to go. I gave her as much warning that I was cancelling instead of waiting until the last minute. I messaged her as soon as I replied to my photographer. I even sent the seller a screenshot of our conversation and circled where she said she had them premade leftovers from her craft show. She kept being rude to me, saying I was cheap and a ghost, so I apologized again and left the conversation. 


TL;DR- messaged someone to buy baby Christmas hats, she said they were pre-made and leftovers from her show, then I cancelled after I found out our photographer had props for us, the seller said I was rude and said she made them by hand last night.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4821973,public,top,self,AITA for not buying Santa hats?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3v5hf/aita_for_not_buying_santa_hats/,all_ads,6,,,,

I (21) and 7 of my friends (all 21)  over the summer started a book club where we drink, smoke weed, and read smut. We all bring food and laugh at bad AOT fanfic. 

The main problem began when one person, let's call them Ryan, continued being inappropriate and out of control. They've thrown up on our host deck several times, repeatedly have gotten crossed-faded beyond their means, and made uncomfortable comments to another member's boyfriend, including calling them a trans slur (The boyfriend is trans, and Ryan is non-binary. Feel how you feel about that). They get pretty hostile when not sober, like yelling at us for not letting them drunk drive and telling them they should maybe stop when we think they're going too far. The book club had become not very fun.  Another member would invite people to come without asking the host and was also weird with the boyfriend. After an incredibly lousy night, someone reacted badly to the weed, and Ryan stole their water and got a bad attitude about it.

 The host decided to trim the book club down, removing Ryan, non-essential members, and anyone else who was causing problems. There had been attempts to talk to Ryan about their misbehavior and ask them to keep it in check, but they continued to act up. The book club was smaller and definitely improved. This, I feel, was totally right.

This is the part where I want to know aita. We didn't tell the whole group that the book club was trimmed down. We never intended to not have a book club with the big group, just less often. We didn't want to disband the whole club because it was our last summer before some of us moved states away. We wanted a reason to keep visiting each other. We knew the reaction would be hurt feelings, and we didn't want to end friendships over something like this.  

Once they found out, they were all pretty upset, especially Ryan. They called the host a liar and accused them of being a fake friend. They also claim they had no idea that their behavior was a problem; mind you, they were told several times their behavior was an issue. They and other ex-members were very upset and even blamed people who had nothing to do with the decision to trim it down. They reacted exactly how we predicted and most don't even talk to us anymore.

Fast forward to today, he has still been using the same water bottle. He says he wants to reach a world record for keep using the same plastic bottle for years. 

Today at Uni, he stepped out to go to the bathroom. I took that opportunity to grab his water bottle and throw it away. He only noticed it was gone on his way home and said I am the asshole for throwing his water bottle away without his consent. I told him several times I'd do this at the first chance and he just laughed at me. It's super unhygienic and he harms himself drinking from that bottle for almost a year.

I know I probably am an AH, but I want to know if I'm legit or if I've been crossing the line.

For some context, I (16 f) have divorced parents. I live mostly at my mom's bc of school. So, I never rlly knew why my parents divorced. My mom has waited 2-3 years before being able to move (lockdown mostly). It was okay, and I was able to move on pretty easily. The only thing bothering me, is my parent's sexual habits. They're rlly into kinks n stuff. It wouldn't bother me at all if i didn't hear them having intercourse during those 2-3 years. Thinking abt it makes me sick in the stomach. It makes me rlly upset that they still fucked with their tools and whatnot as a divorced couple. But I guess I understand. Now that they live apart, they've done this way less anyway. 

Now to the reason why I would be the asshole. Yesterday, my mom had a phone call with a friend of hers. She was venting abt how my father is toxic and a manipulator, she called him a narcissistic pervert and other stuff. She also said that when she told him she wanted a divorce, they argued, and she told us she kissed a pole hello. She said that if she would've stayed with him she wouldn't be here anymore, that him being nice is just a facade. I know he gets another type of physical w/ her, but only in a sexual way, so I never questioned the sounds of it for my own sake. This conversation surprisingly didn't rlly shock me as I'm used to my mom screaming horrible things abt/to my dad. I want to believe her but IDK, It's hard, I love my dad. I'm mostly just uncomfortable around them especially when one is staying over for the night for xyz reasons. 

She said that they were through, that she's done with him, she claimed being over whatever he's up to, not accepting all shits from him, being an independent girlboss woman in stem type of shit yada yada. She also mentioned a girl that I heard is a new girlfriend? I don't rlly care abt her. She told her friend to give her her number, she rlly insisted. It makes me upset that she has the audacity to fuck him then tell her friend abt how bad he has been to her. 

I don't give a fuck who they screw, but U can't just do this, and then say that. It just seems wrong to me. After her phone call, she went to walk the dog. I took my chance to tell her ""U shouldn't be screaming Ur conversations."" As I implied I heard. she proceeded to shrug ""well.""

When she came back, she said it was none of my business in a rlly hard tone, and I should've closed my door etc. Even with my door closed I would've heard but well. She looked rlly unhappy. I didn't tell anyone except now. AITA? 

I want to add that I'm not kinkshaming my parents, I'm kink friendly or whatever, it's okay, I'm just v uncomfortable regarding the situation.

Also I know how serious this is, as U don't call anyone a narcissistic pervert like you'd call Ur bestie a bitch, I just don't know how to deal with this yet.

I don't know if he really notices it or not but I truly care about him ALOT and I try consistently to bring him food that he likes on school days so that he's eating something. (he's told me and others about his ed multiple times so I'm not like bringing it up out of nowhere yk)


And I think that at first he miss understood my messages thinking that I was trying to say hes poor and I want to buy him food, rather than me saying I want to eat his thanksgiving food because he has a ED and I want him to get better. He said ""you don't need to buy us food we will be fine without it"" and I'm not exactly sure what he meant by that. I then attempted to further explain that I meant it in a more caring way because I know he suffers from a ED (I didn't specify that in the first messages). I also said that I suffered from a ed myself so I know how it feels in that situation, he also recently broke up with his partner and I'm afraid that might of sent him into a relapse.

I know people are gonna say ""you care about him why do you think you're a asshole"" but the reason I feel like the asshole is because he's currently at a family members house with his whole family about to have dinner, and now I feel like I brought up the fact that he has a Ed when I shouldn't have, because he probably wasn't even going to be thinking about that until I brought it up. Also, after I sent the second messages he left me on opened for a while now (he usually never leaves me on opened) so now I'm kinda panicking trying to decide if A: he's mad at me for what I said and doesn't want to respond/doesn't know what to say Or B: he hasent responded because hes currently with his family and can't right now (I doubt this though because he just posted something) Also on top of the fact that I said I struggled with a ed too I feel like he could be mad that I said that because I'm overweight and hes underweight so I haven't of struggled as much as him so he thinks is rude for me to compare myself to what hes going through? honestly I have no clue what to think I sound like I'm jumping to conclusions but I'm really trying not to I just don't know what to think.

I was asked to be in the bridal party. My bff has a TON of friends and with it being COVID she opted for no children or +1’s understandably. I had been seeing someone for about 6 months and really thought they’d be a great addition to the reception party. I asked my friend if and only if a place happened to come open (someone declined their invite) if I could bring them. I explained I likely will never been in another wedding and it would mean a lot to me to have a date. Very few of our friends date seriously and almost all are anti marriage so this was one of a few weddings I’d even go to in our group. She did give me a +1 shortly before the wedding and I was insanely grateful. We kept it on the DL. 
Fast forward to a few weeks ago. She made a post about “normalize not letting others dictate whether or not you have +1’s at your wedding”. Again, I was very grateful and didn’t push to have a +1. I took some offense at this because we’d talked it through and I thought had moved passed it. I made a TikTok out of hurt that said something along the lines of “when you realize those closest to you never cheer on your relationships”. She took a screen shot and asked if it was about her post. I confirmed and explained my hurt in her publicly rehashing something I’d been venerable about. She apologized and then old me “I missed the point” and “not everything is an attack” seemingly dismissing my feelings about her post. I doubled down that it was hurtful regardless of intent and that if she felt so strongly about this she should probably bring g it up to the people her post was directed at directly and privately.

I'm a 35 year old mother of four. I have been hosting Christmas for my immediate family for the last decade, and this year would have been no different, but things have changed recently. My dad died in 2020, and this devistated my family. As a result, my younger sister, we'll call her T, came home for the funeral. I hadn't seen her in five years and when I say that she was on drugs, that is an understatement. She was thin and grey, and her teeth were partially missing, broken, or black. I didn't want my kids around her, and I told my mom that I would not be around her as long as T is there. My mom assured me and told me that she wouldn't be around because T would move back to her state. T did, for a while. Then she moved in with my mom for a few months, so I cut them off. My mom told me that I had to get over it because she had rights to see my kids. I did not. I didn't talk to my mom for as long as T and her useless husband lived there. The husband of the moment, F, threatened my mom and others, so the cops were looking for him. As a result T and F took off and moved to another state. Fast forward to the September. I was at an event for my kids, and my mom walked in followed by T. She never even warned me that T was coming. I asked if T was living with her, which she affirmed. I let her know that my original rule stands. I will kot have my kids around her, nor will I. (She looks worse now than the last time I saw her). My mom told me that I didn't have a choice, she could see her grandkids anytime she wanted. I told her not to contact me, and I left. My husband says I was right to place this boundary, and whatever I do is up to me and he'll support that. It's Thanksgiving, and I haven't seen or talked to my mom in 6 weeks. I  did hear through a cousin that T is doing okay. She isn't using, though she has had three jobs since she moved back in with my mom.

Yesterday in biology class we were warching a film about mammals. Me and my friend were bored so we decided to write on my hand with an ink pen. 
My whole hand was covered in words and 'Feminism' was written on my middle finger. There was a free spot under my finger that's in between the little and the middle fingers. So my friend ( G ) asked if she could fill it in with another word, but not tell me what it was and I agreed. When she was done, I looked to see what was written on it, and it was '#Girlboss'. Seeing that made me feel angry ( since I've told her not to call or reffer to me as a girl) and really uncomfortable. I started feeling very dysphoric so I sayed to her that I'll wipe it off. She looked very confused as to why I would do that, but I was still not comfortable with coming out to her so I just stayed quiet and kept it on. 
When I got home, I washed it off and again told G (trough text) to not call or reffer to me as girl. Since she didn't reply to me, I tought that she might be transphobic. So today, during lunch break I asked if she was transphobic. She replied saying she wasn't transphobic but just didn't care. 
As we were walking down the stairs, G sayed that feminists call other women girlbosses so that's why she wrote it and didn't want me to erase it.

I’ve been in the picture a long time and my husband’s father is not all that warm to me - we barely have a relationship, unlike my husband with my family.

This was unexpected, based on how my husband described his father when we first started dating but it is what it is. I did think we’d have more of a relationship by now but my husband says this is normal and he reserves all his energy for him. Fast forward to my pregnancy and his father’s behavior has been at times off putting. When we told him, he asked if it was an accident, which I found insulting as a woman in my 30s and we had advertised we were trying to family. Then he told my husband we could not name a child after him because his mother was Jewish and you cannot name a child after a live person in the Jewish faith (he and my husband are both vocal atheists). So for two months of my pregnancy, we were discussing if we had to come up with a new name. He gave us his blessing but then said we could not use his middle initial. 

All of this has really soured me on the name. Especially since I was actually pregnant for this whole ordeal. It doesn’t sit right with me that I was pregnant and actively very sick and two dudes in a room decided I had their blessing for what I can and can’t name my child.

My husband says his father now says he’s honored and I am overreacting, but I just really resent that this entire process unfolded as it did and I’m being treated like the unfair one now. He also says his father said he has no right to tell us what we can and can’t name our child but that seems null to say after he told us no in the first place.

A little bit of context before I begin, me and my friend, Oswald, are both in drama club. I'm their closest friend, but it doesn't feel like it. 

A couple days ago, my drama club had a party at a restaurant after our 2nd show. I rode there with some of my fiends from stage crew, Oswald drove by themself. On the ride there, me and one of my friends were getting high in the backseat, high enough to where you forget what existence even is. I didnt want to feel real when we got to the party, I havent been doing well lately, and Id rather not go to social situations, so Ive been numbing myself before going to partys to try and make them bareable for me. We eventually arrived and got in, then the stage manager said somebody left their phone back at the show. Someone made a comment that it was Oswald's, but I just assumed that they were on their way and would get it when they got there. 

Back when everyone was leaving the show to go to the restaurant, someone found Oswald's phone and thought they had already left. They hadn't. So then Oswald was looking around everywhere trying to find it. Eventually they gave up and tried to use their cars navigation system to get them to the restaurant, but that fails so they try and go back to where they started, but crashed into a sign trying to. They're able to get ahold of their mom, who helped them try and calm down a little and drove them to the party. Oswald went in, trying not to draw attention to themselves, they thought that if they found me that they would be able to join in on fun and feel better. But I was zoned out staring at someone, completely lost in my head. They tried communicating, but I brushed them off and didn't dully acknowledge them. I wasn't able to fully acknowledge my surroundings. 

They eventually left and cried in the bathroom, texting me later that night: ""i can always count on you to be help me out i'm not great but at least i try go tuck yourself "" followed by, ""go fuck yourself*"" I saw the text the following morning and didn't know what i did wrong. I was unaware of most of what happened. 

I just wanted to get high because social situations make me feel like shit right now. I'm so tired of trying to keep up with everything. I feel like shit for letting Oswald down, but at the same time I feel absolutely drained by everything around me, I don't understand why people expect me to cheer the up.

Let me explain, ever since I was young the way people eat either made me calm or sick to the point where I have to leave.
Say if you are normal decent human being, you will eat your food, close your mouth whilst doing it and not make audible noises when chewing.

My step mother (36f) is the opposite of what I call the ideal eater. She would actually *chomp* her food, i will be able to see the food moving around in her mouth, which has made me physically sick to the point of throwing up before. 

I have avoided eating in the vicinity of my step mother now but I don’t mind eating with anyone else if they have basic table etiquette.

This issue may seem like an over exaggeration but I had to stop having dinner with a friend because of this. It’s a deal breaker. 

A couple of days back, we had a family dinner with relatives as well and it was home cooked at my step mother’s house. I came as my father advised me to come. It was all fine until my step mother started eating, my eyes started twitching, my body started shivering, my teeth started grinding and I was on the fringe of losing the minuscule sanity I had left.

I nicely got up before I could even divulge and went to one of the rooms that were free. My dad followed me and said “you are 18 now! if you don’t like the way people eat, you suck it up and deal with it”. I on the other hand was getting visions of the food moving around my step mother’s mouth and told my father to give me a second. I proceeded to run to the bathroom and throw up.

He comes back and tells me I deluded myself to the point where my body rejects the thought of eating in that specific manner. Which may be the case, I don’t know. This is something that has happened since the start of my time. 

My father kept telling me that I’m being disrespectful and that I need to get checked up as “I have gone too far”, as i always leave dinners when my step mother starts eating.

However, after yesterday I feel like I do need to say something but my other brother told me not to. 

Every Wednesday I pick up my niece Jen (10) from school and we hang out. This has been since she started school in September. Kim only texts me the day before if there is going to be a change so when I didn't hear from her I assumed it was like every other Wednesday. Come to find out Jen's school was actually having a grandparents' day and my mom went. My mom texted me that since she was already there and Jen was done with school at 12 instead of 2, my mom would just bring Jen to her house and I could pick her up there. At 3 pm Kim calls me and is confused about where Jen was, my mom didn't pick up when she called, she knew my mom was at Jen's school that day. Kim was pissed at Jen for not calling her and telling her where she was. I told Kim that it was not Jen's fault and that she probably just assumed that the adults involved handled it. I made a comment that I had also assumed Jen got out at 2 since I didn't hear from her and she apologized for not communicating with me but she was still blaming Jen for some reason. When I took Jen home I went in with her and as I thought would happen, Kim starts yelling at Jen about how come she didn't think to call her and tell her where she was. Jen apologized and said she thought she knew. I didn't want to argue with Kim in front of Jen, so I just kind of interrupted and got the subject changed. 

Unfortunately, this kind of stuff happens all the time and I usually don't say anything because I'm not the parent. It seems to be just getting worse though and they yell at her for even the tiniest things. Jen has been asking to come over to my house more and more and I am starting to see why.

Tony and Mike are friends but dislikes a lot of things that Tony does but is very non confrontational. 

Tony will often cook but not clean. He will leave his rice on the counter for weeks on end and not clean it. Mike and I have seen cockroaches, flies and mold coming from the house but we don’t clean it because we don’t know what he’s going to do with it. We have also cleaned up after Tony multiple times and it’s very frustrating because the rice sticks to the pot and really stinks. And he ashes his weed onto the plate which sticks onto the plate. These are all Mikes pots/pans/dishes and I was grossed out so I just order out for me and Mike. 

He smokes weed non stop. It’s fine to smoke weed once in a while but it has stunk up the entire apartment and everyone but him has a purifier which doesn’t do much. 

Also, we had an incident where he’d constantly blast very loud music until 2-3 AM and a neighbor complained so he stopped. He also got very angry because he felt the neighbor didn’t handle the situation properly because they left a note on the door. He was going to ask the landlord to ask other tenants to see who was complaining about him. 

He recently stopped working because of a medical condition and has been home blasting the heat nonstop. Because it is only Mike’s name on the electricity, he is liable for the charges. So Tony asked Mike to cover his portion and it has been 6 months since he last paid. I told Mike he should tell Tony to pay but he is very non confrontational. Mike is probably owed around $3,000. 

Back to the electricity, he loves to walk around basically in his underwear so even in weather that is not very cold, he is blasting the heat. We each have a unit that can provide heat or a/c and the landlord has insisted that this unit should not be used for heat as it is not efficient and very costly. Mike and I have not used the heat anymore because one time, we received a retro bill for an additional $600 due to what we believe is the a/c unit from the last winter. And Tony asked us to call the electric company to ask why it’s so expensive. But putting 2 and 2 together, it was obviously the a/c unit. However, Tony still blasts it.

After buying what we needed, I pulled into the parking lot outlet to the main road, and prepared to make a left turn out. I had to wait since neither side of the street was clear; each side had 1 car approaching, but it was clear after them. The car approaching from the left slowed way down, then turned into the parking lot entrance past me. This car got SUPER close to mine, like there was maybe only 2 inches (or less) between us.

This startled the hell out of me. Thankfully they didn’t hit/scratch my car, but I leaned on my horn, then turned around and followed them back into the lot. I got out and approached the driver. “Gee man, you sure got close enough to my car,” I said angrily and sarcastically. I then called him “stupid.” The guy responded that my car was parked way over the middle line and that that was all the space he could give me (I was unaware of this). My husband confirmed this was true; that he’d not said anything at the time because he didn’t want to be a “backseat driver”.

I told him I was sorry if that was the case, that it was an oversight on my part, but that that still doesn’t make it okay for him to get that close to another car; it is not ever okay to get within INCHES of another vehicle! I told him he should have stopped his car and waited until I was out of the way (since there were no other cars behind him at the time). Because of my turn signal and the fact the car approaching on my right was nearly out of the way, it should have been clear to him I’d be out of his way momentarily. He said that there was no risk since he came in so slowly, and that he shouldn’t have to waste his time because of my mistake.

“We’re talking about 5 f\*\*\*ing seconds or less,” I said. “It ain’t gonna kill you to stop your car for 5 seconds, dude.” And I said that even if there was zero risk of a collision, it’s *still* bad to get that close to my car because of how startling that was for me. Like legit, my heart did wild massive leaps. Me having a car get that close to me had a much worse impact on me than him having to stop and wait for a few seconds would have on him. I called him “narcissistic and selfish” because he cares more about getting to his destination 5 seconds sooner than the feelings and comfort of others.

We argued for a little while longer, and and the end I flipped both my middle fingers up and shouted at him to go f\*\*\* himself, then stormed off.

We have a small living room/playroom at my house. It’s where the kids toys, dollhouses, and play kitchens are. My kids are 6 and 3 for reference, both potty trained.  

When my sister in law comes over with her two kids, both in diapers, she insists on changing them in the living room on the carpet. Doing so makes all the kids have to stop playing and move somewhere else until she’s done changing the diaper. I mind because we literally have a changing table in my daughters bedroom and she’s free to use it. I’ve asked her why she does it there and offered the changing table, but she says she doesn’t want the kids to miss out on what’s going on around them… even though all the kids have to stop playing anyways when one of the kids gets changed. And honestly, it’s a little gross when she’s changing a stinky poopy diaper in the middle of the living room which is right next to the kitchen (open concept type of house). It’s started a weird little fight before.

Despite their age, the two of them are nothing more than children who should be back home with our parents. I say this because neither of them has a job and everything of theirs is paid for by our parents. This is because of a sweetheart deal in which all their expenses are covered while they are in University. I was never given this deal as I chose to become a welder over “higher education” and work full time as an assembly line welder. Despite the writing on the wall, I made the mistake of moving in with them.

These past two years I have come to regret this heavily when they started shirking their obligations. To stop the downward spiral I have tried talking things through with them. Unfortunately, I would be met with nothing but excuses like they can't do X because they need to “study”. I have tried speaking to our parents but they would just excuse their behavior. This September things went downhill when I got promoted and was switched from night shift to daytime work. This coincided with my brother and Jake altering their schedules to only go in two days a week. For all but those two school nights, they would stay up late gaming which wouldn’t be an issue if they were quiet. This wasn’t the case and almost every night I would get woken up by their noise. Like the housework talking things through didn’t work and our parents were useless.

Everything came to a head this past Monday during a gathering between my family and Jack’s for Thanksgiving. I was very tired and cold at the time which led to me not eating and just sitting with them.  This led to them asking why which resulted in me blowing up on them and going on an expletive-filled tirade. This was in front of not only those directly involved but my grandmother who was shocked. This led to arguments between everyone with my grandma saying that I could stay with her. I wound up taking her up on this while I find a new place.

Over the past few months we have been endlessly arguing and it’s ended up in an even divide. Me and Katie, Lacy and Jess (fake names). 

Me and Katie were ill for a couple days so we were out of school. Lacy and Jess proceeded to tell everyone that were bad people and chatting sh*t about them (we don’t). Luckily, after Lacy and Jess told the story, no one really believed them as the arguments were very petty. 

In my opinion, these arguments happened because we weren’t compatible so we just needed a reason to cut each other off. But, me and Katie were talking to each other and both admitted that we had spoken to Jess and we both still like her. This meant that it left Lacy as the only factor that tore the friendship in half. 

In school i’ve been skipping lessons with her in purely from the burning hatred i have for Lacy. She’s picked up on it as is telling people i’m being ‘unreasonable’. Which is fair, but with the backstory of what she’s said, I think i’m being perfectly reasonable. 

I suffered with anorexia and am recovering from it. It’s been about a year so it’s not too bad. But, she and Jess would call me fat as a ‘joke’ and talk about how skinny they are in front of me. Surely it’s self explanatory why that’s weird and why you wouldn’t do that. I didn’t say anything as Ididn’t want to cause any issues at the time. I also only argued with them once and the rest of the time i simply sat and listened. 

Lacy herself has started argument after argument and we’ve only started having issues after she joined the school. She has also decided to hang out with my only other friends (I was bullied so I don’t have many) which leaves me and Katie alone. I’m furious.
