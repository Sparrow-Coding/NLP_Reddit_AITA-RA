Hello,

To start, I don’t live in US but in Europe. So, if you don’t understand something, you can ask me.

My girlfriend doesn’t work/study and I gain money thanks to payed scholarship/beginer work. I make less than minimum wage (~200€ less) and her mother helps her with rent. I got financial help thanks to a social help, 420/month cause of my position and my age (it is written in the help). We share this 50/50 so she doesn’t have to ask a lot of €€€ to her mother but I cannot avoid myself to think this is not fair because I’ve earn this money. She doesn’t work because she quit in may to work with children 14 days in july. In august she got surgery and she couldn’t work august and september but no she can.

My boyfriend (19m) does coke, I thought it was “occasionally” whenever he would think about things too deeply and go into full mental breakdown mode, but, he always has a line in his pocket tin.

I stay at my boyfriend’s apartment at times, but, most of the time, I bring him over to my apartment as he won’t do coke in front of me. But, this guy has be on a frenzy recently, maybe it’s because of his father &amp; issues they have been having. But a couple of days back, when i stayed over at his, I told him I will shower when he leaves and go to classes. 

He leaves, I proceed to search his apartment and i find it in the most expected place behind his only painting, which had a hole behind it (?). I flushed a fat bag down the toilet by doing a bit at a time so it doesn’t clog up. I proceeded to leave, but, he called me that evening panicking and called me things. He proceeded to hang up and call me in the morning to apologise.

But I can tell he still holds a grudge.

My fiancée and I had set some rules to sort out guests. We had rules that would affect mostly distant family we're not really close to and plus ones. We didn't allow plus ones to anyone not engaged or married and we wanted to narrow it down. It's not a financial issue but more of a space issue since the reception would be hosted at my grandma's house that is huge indeed but not huge enough to host around 20+ plus ones for people who aren't in committed relationships.

Josh and his gf Kate have been together for 6 years and recently he confided in me that next year he's planning to propose. They're still not engaged yet so Kate would not be invited as his plus one. And we wouldn't invite her as a normal guest either because neither I nor my fiancée are close to her.

When I made that clear to Josh he was upset and kept trying to convince me to include Kate and how it's ridiculous we're excluding his long term partner. He accused us of being disrespectful and trying to invalidate and micromanage his relationship. I told him to chill out and that it's not as deep as he's making it out to be and after all this is mine and my fiancées special day so he doesn't get a say in the rules we set.

He then told me that he's stepping down as groomsman and skipping our silly wedding all together and that he won't value my wedding above his relationship. He said I used my wedding to justify disrespecting his gf and he wants no part in it. I kept trying to explain how it's not personal and deep and it's just how it is. He refused to listen.

Names changed for obvious reasons.

My sister and I have been friends with ""Millie"" for close to 10 years now. Her and my sister ""Stine"" are especially close. About 2 1/2 years ago Millie met a guy on a youtubers minecraft server and they hit it off. Said guy is already close to 30 years old. So when me and Stine found out about them ""dating"" less than a year ago, we were of course, less than pleased.

We couldn't deter her from dating a guy at least 15 years older than her so for her savety we came up for some rules, that i think are very fair:

1. No meeting irl until she was 18.
2. No sexual interactions until she was 18.
3. No meeting the guy alone for the first few meetings. Always have at least one friend with you.

As you can guess she broke almost all of them.

We found out about it yesterday while she was visiting. They have been ""officially dating"" since Halloween when they met at his place (as far as I know no sexual interaction), however their three year aniversary is march next year.

I the ensuing discussion Millie was angry we weren't supporting her like her other friends did (most of them are way younger between 12 and 16). We countered that she broke out trust and if we didn't support her we would have already told her parents, which calmed her down. Our discussion endet without a conclussion and not with a bad atmosphere but I could tell it weighed on Stine quite a bit.

**For some context:** Me, Stine and Gina grew up in households where missdeeds were severely punished to the point we got better at hiding everything. The punishments were regular ones, no TV, no PC, fixing the stuff that was broken etc. so no abuse.   
However my parents were always more relaxed then Millies. Hence why we haven't told them anything. Talking to them, especially her father freaks me out for several reasons.

They told him they did not want us to get married- and I moved in to his house and only saw my family 2-3 times per year for about 5 years. 

My family came and kind of ambushed us one day where they knew we would be. They asked my husband if they could put everything behind them, they agreed- and I was thrilled that everyone could get along. For years I thought everything was going well. My husband even went to a few events like basketball games with my family and without me. They babysit for us and although they aren't perfect- I feel like they've tried really hard to mend things. We got married, got pregnant- I felt like life was perfect. 

About three years ago, my husband found out his dad has cancer and his best friend screwed him over on a business deal at the same time we had a newborn. He spiraled into a deep depression. 

He picked a fight with my family about a year into depression and has since decided that he hates everyone again and never wants to see them again. He's angry that I don't want to completely cut ties with my family and feels that I owe him “100% support”. He told me he will divorce me if I can't go an entire year without seeing my parents and siblings, including attending my youngest brothers wedding. I cannot agree to this- but I feel like I'm being the bad person. 

Am I really being unsupportive of my husband by refusing to miss my brothers wedding? 

We went to therapy at my suggestion, where he yelled at the therapist the whole time. 

He takes THC tincture all day and refuses to see a doctor about antidepressants. 

He has also cut ties with his whole family over multiple fights that have happened this year. We didn't even celebrate Thanksgiving at all and it broke my heart.

So, my husband (33M) and I (28F) were flying back from our wedding anniversary trip. The flight was 3.5 hours long but was delayed for 2 hours initially and we had been waiting at the airport for very long time. My husband loves the window seat and I prefer the aisle, neither of us like the middle and we don’t take it. So we book one aisle and one window in the same row and leave the middle seat for grabs. We don’t mind people sitting between us so we are cool. This time we have a woman in her mid thirties board the plane with her maybe 6-ish yo kid. The kid was sat in the middle seat of the row in front of us and the woman between us. We greeted and smiled and before the plane started my husband asked if I could grab his headphones from the cabin luggage which I did. The woman realised that we were together and asked if I wanted to switch the seats with her to which I responded no and said that I like aisle and he likes window so we were fine. She was visibly sulking but we ignored and carried on. Now, the flight starts to take off and her kid started squealing and screaming with joy like really excited and the guys sitting with the kid got annoyed but asked him to calm down. The mom saw this and asked if it’s ok for me to move to his middle seat so she could sit with the kid and take my aisle, I politely denied and said the kid looks under control now. Then she started screaming at my husband said, “It’s a good thing you don’t have kids because your wife definitely doesn’t know how to be a mom and what it takes. She doesn’t know how hard it is to be away from the kid and can’t help him. She doesn’t even care that you guys are sitting apart. But I think you can do the wise thing and switch with me.” To which my husband calmly said, “if we were travelling with kids we would have made sure to book our seats in advance together which doesn’t look like you did.” She got mad and asked for the crew. The crew came in and we told them everything. The flight was full the cabin crew couldn’t help and the whole flight she tried to elongate her legs to our sides or crisscross her legs on the seat, took both the arm rests, snored and slept and poured water on me. While deboarding the flight she called me an AH and said people like me shouldn’t be allowed to travel.

Recently, one of our experienced employees left suddenly, meaning we had to find someone new. Originally, we were going to have a week or 2 transition from the old to new hires. This would give us time to do induction packs etc etc. but the bosses behind the scenes told the two new replacements to come in a day later - with no one knowing until the morning they were here that they were working. 

I was suddenly thrown into inducting and training 2 new employees. The end of month is extremely busy and I had all my other tasks to do. But I went through everything I could with them, showed them around the office and allowed them to help me with some of my tasks. 

I had to type an important document for someone who was going to potentially pass away very soon. I politely asked the two new employees if they could leave me for 10 minutes to get these documents done. They kept interrupting, asking for things to do. I kept my cool and kept giving them things to do. This document was almost done late because a 10 minute task turned into a 30 minute task. I was annoyed, but felt like they could not stop hassling me and eventually just left them to their own devices for a bit while I caught up on the days work. Bearing in mind, they work for a different team. There were plenty of others who could have helped them. 

I ended up leaving an hour late and only had a 10 minute lunch break. I missed an important voicemail from my health provider because I needed to do all my tasks - plus train these two. I am taking my only day off for the week tomorrow to do training again. I feel angry and burnt out because I had no support from anyone else, and my workload suffered because of this. I was more then happy to help them, but it got to a point when they just could not leave me to do my own work. They even used my swipe card during lunch so I couldn’t even go out to get fresh air

They kept apologising for stuffing me around. I admit, I did come across a bit annoyed at times toward the end when I just wanted to get done what I needed to the entire time. I felt more like a babysitter with a restless toddler.

My mother (57) is living with my sister (25) in a 750 sq feet apartment which was my grandmothers and now my mothers. 

Please note that even though it might not seem a lot to what I assume is a mostly US audience considering we're from Eastern Europe this is considered more than enough for two people (during my childhood at one point 5 of us lived in it). The apartment is in the center of the capital city and taxes for it are high. With current immigration from Ukraine and Russia the realestate market exploded with unrealistic prices for purchase and rent. My sister wants to move out and live independently basically meaning our mom would have to pay for it alone (utilities alone are around $200 while she makes $650 per month). 

I make considerably more and have helped them in past by investing in some renovations like charging windows, floors, doors etc. 

Point being is we can sell it for a very high price or even rent (even though the salary in my country is many times smaller then in the US the apartment could easily be sold for $250k).

I am pushing my mother to rent or sell this apartment as  it's becoming a burden for everyone and I've told her can no longer support her lifestyle because essentially she doesn't want to sell the apartment due to sentimental reasons as she inherited it from my grandmother that we all loved. 

Selling the apartment would be potentially used to help me and my sister solve our housing as we are both renting apartments and obviously for her as well as wr would by cheaper houses/apartments in city outskirts. I know she's been reliant on my self and my sister but I don't want to finance her anymore as I want to focus on myself.

He lives in a flat share with 2 of his friends. I live in one bedroom apt.
Given that arrangement, it made sense to stay at my place - we are in my place every night for the past 2 months, so we are effectively living together already. He has keys, stays there when I am at work, just as if it was his place.

I just wanted to make it “official”, make more space for him, get rid of stuff that he might not like, organise stuff so that he feels more like his place, etc. I adore having him there, sharing the place with him and overall being near him so I wanted to make sure that he knows that i am committed to the relationship and that it is not just accidental/out of convenience that he is there.
I don't really care about splitting rent or cleaning schedule (i make double what he does so money is not an issue and if i can use it to make his life comfortable, i happily will), it was more targeted toward - Hey lets make sure you feel like this place is your home and you do not feel like just living at someone else's place.

His response was, that he thought about it before, he thinks of us as living together already. But he has a lease contract until August 2023 in his flat share and he cannot let the guys down.
They or he would either have to find some to replace him or his friends would have to pay for the whole rent.

I was flabbergasted, I did not want to push, so I just asked what does he mean and where are we now (because I did not understand if we are actually living together, if something is changing - i was confused, because there are organisational things to do - would he want his name on the door, the lease contract, should i get different towels etc - and he just skipped all that).
His response was, that he has the lease until august and that he understands that i wanted him to move all of his stuff here, but the lease is still there and that he just considered this as resolved and that he does not understand what is there to talk about. I tried to explain my position to him (he can have his things wherever, i do not care about that. I just wanted to make it our place and), but it did not really worked so we just stopped talking about it and watched some Netflix.

I was sad, because I wished a bit for perhaps different reaction then the massive meh (this was the first time i asked someone to live with me, so i think i just wanted the nice evening of us sharing the moment) it ended up being so I was not really super talkative, he asked me what was wrong.
I told him that it felt like i had to explain and excuse myself for asking him to move in and that i just do not understand where we are. Next morning we went to work and did not really talked about it further and we just small talked. 

He is angry at me because he thinks that i am being difficult and forcing him into stuff.

   First of all, I would like to apologize in advance fo my grammar. English isn't my first language... 

So first some context... My parents got divorced when I (f20) was around 7yo. My father isn't a very good man. He would trade time with my sister and me for a bottle of alcohol. I stopped wisiting him regulerrly when I was 15.

Two years ago my grandparents from his side died. It wasn't unexpected so we were all ready. What they owned was splited between my father and his two brothers. I was listed at the will as a safety measure, so my father wouldn't sell the apartment and spend thet money on alcohol. I tried to maintain some contact with him, but after some really bad experiences, I stopped contacting him. 

   For some time everything was fine. I am in contact with my uncles and their families, and we have some sort of an relationship. Last week one of my uncles reacht up to me and asker, if I could convine my father to give his part of land to him and his other brother. I said I would try but I couldn't promise anything becouse father has been ignoring my calls for past few years. 

  I talked about it with my mother, and she suggested, that the parcel should go to me and my sister, so why should I give it to my uncles? The problem is, that I don't want anything from him, nor from my uncles. I want to end this hunt for who gets more and who can ripp of who... But on the other hand, my uncles are counting on my help. I feel like they are low key trying to presue me into that. They are saying that it would be better for all of us. I don't know, would it? After all this time I don't want to loose relationship with my uncles for a part of land I don't even want.

My brother let’s call him Jesse has been with her for 6 years. Soon after they started dating that’s when I started to fall for her.

Marie has autism and that always made me feel bad for her. During their early relationship me and Marie had sex. We both agreed not to speak on it ever again.

While he was gone I helped her out and did housework. Me and Marie started watching a movie after we got done cleaning. Things got pretty steamy. One thing led to another we did not have inter course but I fingered her. We realized what was happening and both freaked out. I left immediately and have not spoke to her since. 

My brothers been home for about a week now and hasn’t said anything about it. I had to get it off my chest so I told my co worker about what happened. She said that I am a horrible person because I took advantage of a woman with Autism and I had an affair with my brothers wife.

I came to understand that her boyfriend came the previous day to help her “study” AP maths. Which i’ve come to understand that he doesn’t actually help her study.

I realised that he was going to come back the next day to “help her study”. So, I would see then if where i suspected the limb came from was true. The next day after school he came back with her and I gave them 30 minutes to settle down before I checked up on them. I go 30 minutes later to see that she was near topless and he was in boxes. I go into shock and i tell her to get out off my house. I pack her a little bag and told her to go do that somewhere else. She proceeded to sob profusely but they both left and I can only assumed she is at his house and has been for the last day.

This is another story about John (someone from our last story), buckle up. This will be a long story!! Also this is a story from owner 2&lt;33

Me and John were really good friends in 2020 and we did everything together. We even somehow got into dressing up as fictional characters together. He started a little before me but I soon after bought my own and we cosplayed together. Two years in the future (in around February this year) I borrowed his Nezuko cosplay. After a week of me having it in my possession he sent me a text.

“Hii (my name)!! I wanted to let you know that I want you to keep the Nezuko cosplay! U look really good in it and I get gender dysphoria from it, so you can keep it!”. 

I thanked him a lot and then carried in with my day. A couple months later we had gotten in a teeny fight and he very politely asked for his cosplay back, I told him I would give it back to him the following day and I did. 

This is where it gets interesting. I heard from some of our mutual friends that he had been spreading rumours about me. One of them being that I apparently stole his cosplay. I’m not going to lie, in private with my friend I did shit talk John a lot but that’s only because he had been playing me for ages while we were dating. 

I lost a lot of my friends due to this rumour and I got really upset about it to the point where I sent him a suggestive message about how much I hate him and a bunch of stuff like that. He showed his parents who showed my parents and I got in heaps of trouble for that message.

Apologies for any mistakes in this text, English isn’t my first language.

For context, my bf currently lives with us as well and we are planning on moving out but it takes time. We live in Europe and the costs of heating our apartment are extremely high. Initially I didn’t want to turn on the heaters at all this winter.

Back to living with RM, at first she was reluctant to turn on the heaters as well because of the costs. Although she has a well paying job, she somehow managed to spend all her money on not apartment-related things and this month, me and my bf had to pay for everything, rent, gas and electricity. She didn’t even buy groceries.
The last few months I was deemed unfit to work and it has made money an even bigger problem, I‘m living off my savings and my bf pays for a lot, if not most things. I felt terrible for that and I want to get back to work as fast as I can. Until then, I try to save money wherever I can and that means turning off the heater at night.

RM complained to me about this really passive-aggressively. I tend to be very short tempered in disagreements so I try my best to keep my mouth shut so I won’t say or do anything shitty. Later the evening I told her the reason I turned it off at night was because of the costs and because the idea of a gas leak or explosion while I’m asleep gives me really bad anxiety. Costs being the bigger problem though. RM’s argument was that she was cold when she gets up in the morning which sounds kinda ridiculous to me. Even if the heaters are on, it’s cold when you get out of bed in my opinion. My bf and I told her that the costs are still a big problem and leaving it on over night is just a waste of money. She said if it was such a problem to us then we could turn it off over night back on when before she gets up (3 or 4am). We obviously said no, and she rushed out of our room and went to bed. The next morning, she was really loud. Neither bf nor me ever wake up when she goes to the bathroom etc, but this time we did because she slammed every door open and shut until she left for work. It was really annoying and I just wonder if she did that on purpose because we wanted to turn the heaters off over night (btw the heater was on all night) but maybe I’m overreacting.

It’s all so ridiculous and it made me so angry I wanted to lash out on her but I know I shouldn’t. My bf wants to talk to her again today but idk if I even have a right to be angry. Maybe I’m the bad one all along and should just keep the heaters on at night and stop complaining.

My sister has had an issue with my SO pretty much since weve been together (7 years). Not sure why or how it started and neither does anyone else but its always been bitchy remarks, shitty FB posts that are clearly aimed at her, ignoring her at get togethers etc. Ive fallen out with her many times about it and she usually eventually apologises to her/me.

So this year, around 2 months ago, we got married and they weren't in a good place with each other so my SO didnt want her to come to the wedding but i insisted as she was still my sister. I thought maybe seeing us married might snap her out of whatever issue she has with her. Her and her Fiance ignored us pretty much all day (which was fine tbh). Then at the end of the best man speech (by our brother) he said something along the lines of ""To a long marriage"" and she was seen by multiple people (and heard by some) to say ""and the divorce"".

Unfortunately one of the people to see this was my now Wife who, understandably, was furious and asked me to sort it. I asked her nicely to leave as i didnt want to make a scene and she did and we had an amazing rest of the day.

Now initially my parents and brother didnt believe she had said anything until mulitple people, including both of her own children (who very much dislike her), told them it was true and they were then on-side with being very annoyed at her etc.

After this my sister went on a big ""you all hate me"" and ""i have issues"" parade which she has done before and i just had enough and have cut ties with her and my family are aware of this and dont have an issue with. When i asked my mother what her stance on it all she said she only goes down to my sisters house to see her grandkids now which were fine with.

Now i find out yesterday that my Brother and Mother went out for a meal with her and are basically fine with her again to which i got really fucked off with my brother and he snapped back with ""you expect me just to not talk to my sister?! youre a f\*\*king idiot if you think thats the case"".

My family (me + wife + 2yo) is getting ready to sleep. Between our bedrooms is a bathroom and the toilet pipes are about 6 inches from my sisters pillow. It is a loud toilet, as evidenced by the many times I was jolted awake by my sisters flushing growing up. My sister had a very hard time with lack of sleep early post-partum, has ongoing related sleep issues, and tends to be vocal about her needs. But for irrelevant reasons my sisters family still strongly prefers that room. So it has become the household norm not to flush that toilet at night when she sleeps in that room.

A bug then hits me hard and fast. I bolt to my parents’ bathroom (not that far -- 17 paces?), but I don’t make it in time. After recomposing myself, my angel of a wife helps me clean it up … until our child starts vomiting too. After cleaning up my mess I find that our child is doing better. We then run into my mom who had been cleaning up after dinner.

We tell her that our son is doing better and that we are going to try to get back to sleep. During our exchange my mom made sure to remind us not to flush the toilet. Considering how crappy I still felt, that I had created a vomitsplosion because I avoided my sister's no-flush-zone, and that our infant son was potentially really sick, I was taken aback by that comment. I replied that we were sick and we would go to whichever bathroom we needed. We then went our various ways, didn’t need to use the bathroom that night, we felt better the next morning, and life went on.

Or so I thought. My wife was absolutely incensed by my mothers comment about flushing, and texts with/among my wife’s family reinforced her strong reaction. She spoke with me afterward, saying that this was yet another case where my mom  treats my family worse than my sister and her family, and that the comment was incredibly rude.

While I agreed that her statement about the bathroom was untimely and insensitive, I didn’t think it called for a stronger response than what I’d already said. This was in part because I knew that my sister can be capable of really impressing her needs on others — and because I knew my mom was physically present during my sisters hard first post-partum month. And, because my mom (like myself) doesn’t always think through everything we say. However, since I defended the level of my reaction and told my wife where I thought my mothers mind was at the time, my wife thinks I’m defending my mom instead of my family. I disagree because I think I defended my family to the level that was appropriate at the time and because the disproportionate response that my wife’s frustration seemed to solicit would only worsen an already degrading relationship.

So AITA? Should I have, beyond countering her insensitive statement, told off my mom and/or asked her apologize to my family?

anyway i tried to tell them about my appointment. nothing graphic just got the appointment and things im excited about. i got nothing and they moved on. i did tbh, push trying to talk more about it second time around. just a ""oh im excited for you bro :)"" or ""ooo what are you most excited about?"". because 1. i would love support and 2. id love to help them learn about this and i just got kids books from my doctor and i want to segway to that. this time i got some annoyed silence from a and some more agressive convo changers from e.

i eventually apologized, though a little upset and passive agressively, saying I just didnt have alot of family to talk to about this. and e told me to just talk with friends. i was hurt cause its not the same thing. 

next day my mom tells me one of them told her i made them uncomfortable and shell find someone for me to talk to if i really need it. i was really pissed off. mostly cause a had once tattled about me telling kids on a trip i was hanging out with my pronouns, because we got in a fight. I couldnt tell if it was one of those situations, cause we didnt have a squabble before this. 

 i tried to talk to them about it a few days later. a said she never said that and e said she only said it was awkard. i apologized and said i kinda only pushed it cause i was nervous about their silence being from something else, because of the making fun of trans people jokes they make. a claimed they havent made any in the past month, but she just did the night before (misgendering some kid she didnt like) and the day after. i said i really just wanted to make it not awkard.

they kept ignoring me and literally played a video over me. i kept trying to talk and e said i just kept pushing and made the convo awkard for everyone by constantly trying to talk about that. that they don't know how to respond to that. i get that, so idk did i fuck up? i apologized and im work to get those pre teen info books for them to make this a better transition for the family.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4832989,public,top,self,AITA for pushing talk of me being trans,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6rqp5/aita_for_pushing_talk_of_me_being_trans/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

(Sorry for mistakes and if it’s a little bad this is my first post)

So all this started in a group chat and basically every once in awhile John (fake name) would post a photo to that group chat of an art piece he “drew” and I’ve never seen him drawing any of these art pieces during school in fact I’ve never really seen him draw in school other than stick figures so I got a little suspicious.

The next time he posted some of “his” art (which was a drawing of Nezuko) I searched up on Google and went looking for it and not even a minute later I found the photo he traced and this really annoyed me because I’m an artist myself and I’m not a fan of people stealing someone’s art. I went onto a private chat with them and I asked them about it. They said they just referenced it which is absolute BS because that’s not what referencing is but I let it slide and just told them it made me uncomfortable and to stop or credit the artist. they didn’t listen and kept on doing it so I kept on reminding them btw this went on for months and I told my friends every time they did it.

I even had a FaceTime with my friend finding all the artwork they’ve traced. During that FaceTime friend told me that they’ve been posting “their” art to TikTok so it went from being bad to I’m pretty sure straight up illegal. They’re even making fun of the art that “they” did saying stuff like “I made him little goofy” or “ he’s a little baby faced but that’s ok” and I know that that’s not bad insults but that’s still rude to the REAL artist.

I basically snapped after that and I went to them with all the evidence I’ve collected and told them what a crappy person they are. we had a big fight over it obviously and I will admit maybe was a little harsh on him but I was dealing with that for months so I still think it was well-deserved. Some people hated me especially their parents because apparently I was in the wrong so yeah. After awhile (2 weeks) we kind of just forgave each other but we weren’t really friends anymore.

He doesn't make anyone aware of this, he just lets her in and she walks about as if she owns the place, using whatever she wants.
They use the communal living room space to watch movies and cuddle, eat, and leave no room for anyone else to use it while she is there. This can be from anywhere between several hours to a few days. It has been happening 4 or 5 days a week. 

Why it annoys me is because I'm supossed to live here too, and taking turns should be a thing in my opinion. One would think its obvious to take turns between entertaining a guest in this communal space, and then a fellow flatmate using the communal space for their purposes also. 

I work 6 days a week and recently I've been having very long hours. When I come home all I want to do is sit on the couch and do the dumb puzzle laid out on the coffee table because it relaxes me. Sometimes I eat dinner while I watch tv there or chat to my other flatmates. 

All I asked him is if he could please tell me before someone comes over, I feel very uncomfortable when someone is just there in 'my' house without my knowing or expecting. I feel like its rude, inconsiderate and inappropriate. I am also the only girl in the house so it gives me a whole feeling of instability, even if it was his dead grandma's cat's best friend's neice, its just not nice to do according to me. 

One of my other flatmates disagree with me and say im being rude for wanting to take turns. He says its very rude of me and that they're not being rude at all for hogging the living room.

but recently, he took it too far. 

my steinway is my most beloved possession.its my number 1. about a week and a half ago, i went to this event out of town. it was a one day/one night, so i returned home about a day later. well, i returned home and my piano wasn't there. just my step-dad chuckling while counting bills in his hand.i was already angry more likely sad when i didnt see my piano there. not only was it basically my best possession but it was also the last thing i had of my dad since my parents divorce. he bought the steinway for about 70-78k. my stepdad sold it for 90k. i obviously blew up at him , broke a couple of things and ripped some of the bills he was holding his hand. and cried in my room after.

but, my stepdads a huge sneaker head. he has 5 racks of shoes in our garage, all adding up to 18k if not more. he also has some under the bed in moms room. i gave them away. some to thrift stores, some people on the street. i mailed some to family members on my side who he's never seen/ met. i did end up making 9,000 of my own from buyers. he called me a worthless bitch and that i shouldve left with my dad all those years ago. 

im still beyond heartbroken about the piano. i also recently found out that the person he sold it too won't sell it back, meaning there's most likely no chance i'm getting that piano back ever again.

After a couple of months of not speaking, he asked me to go out and we had a good time.. Around midnight, he tells me he missed his train and asked if I’d stay at the bar and have another drink while he waited for the next one so I agreed.

Out of nowhere, he starts telling me he’s in love with me and how he’s experiencing “bad karma” from how he treated me last time. I guess I didn’t realize how drunk he was because within a few minutes, he turned into a different person. 

He came back from the bathroom without even zipping up his pants and exposed himself to the whole bar. He started chugging vodka sodas like crazy and turned into a drunken mess and couldn’t even stand up. 

I told him I was leaving and went outside to wait for my Uber. He followed me into the car after making a huge scene falling on the sidewalk and losing his hat and breaking his glasses. The Uber driver actually asked me if they should take him to the hospital. I said no and just gave his address so he could be gone. I just didn’t want to deal with the situation anymore. 

The next day, he started talking to me like nothing happened and asked me if I kept his hat and glasses safe. He said he wasn’t even hungover but He says he doesn’t remember anything. I flipped out and told him not to speak to me until he pays me back for the $300 Uber ride.

He basically refused and said he didn’t ask me to do that so he doesn’t owe me anything and said i’m being dramatic. 

I told him I threw out his glasses, which he claims makes it “even” because they’re expensive.. 😒

They didn't ask my opinion about getting a dog now, and I never wanted a dog yet. If they did I would've told them that I don't want anything to do with it, because even the smallest things stress me out easily.

Been talking to this guy every single day for 3 months. We’ve had tons of great conversations but I did feel he kept making excuses about why we couldn’t meet up or why a certain time wasn’t going to work for him anymore. 

Then finally some of the talk got sexual. And we planned a hook up.

Then the day of he told me he had gential herpes. I took it well but said I was undecided but still wanted to meet and talk and I ask him some questions. He said no problem and that he was excited to meet me. But then…

Then he said would I hate it him if we rescheduled because he was asked to work late. I felt like that was a lie and him copping out. And I told him that.

He said if why do I even want to meet him if I think he’s that sketchy and I said “wow…”

Then it got nasty. I basically said I felt he might be a catfish bc of the amount of times he puts meeting off and said I didn’t know what to believe. He says he just wanted to reschedule because 8 p.m. when he gets off work is “late.” 🙄 (not for a hook up is my thinking).

I went on about not believing him and reminded him if may be bc of the trauma I had with my ex (we both had past narc relationships) and even apologized saying I was feeling anxious etc. but just didn’t want to be being lied to.

He said I had nothing to worry about.

I told him I was feeling weird about all of it and figured if he wanted to see me he’d make time and 8 wasn’t that late.

I told him I was very frustrated we hadn’t meet yet and the day we were supposed to he bails.

He argues he’s not bailing, just rescheduling. He says he’s sorry I cannot “accept” that he has to work. 

My psycho mind activates. (Not accept???) 😤😡

I go on a bit about how I feel and the disappointment.

He says this entire conversation is unhealthy and he likes his low stress life and is afraid to meet me (because of my reaction/how agressive I am).

I apologize and say I understand and wish him the best.

Sad. I miss him but thinking he may have never given a shit and just wanted a friend to text. I saw him active (online now status was on) on tinder the next night to (checked from a fake profile like the psycho I am) so obviously he’s not heart broken but I am a little bit over the loss of friendship we had.

     Fair, but I believe that this is not good for long term health of a series or franchise as its often the individuality of a series that gives it its strengths.

I have 3 kids. A 5yo, 3yo &amp; a newborn. My 3yo has a peanut allergy. The last time 3yo was exposed to peanuts directly, 3's face became red &amp;swollen, &amp;hives appeared everywhere. I carry an epi pen wherever we go, &amp;I always have one out on our counter at home; easily accessible in an emergency. SIL &amp; BIL have been made aware of this many times.

SIL also knows that my kids have a snack cabinet and a snack drawer in the fridge. Unless otherwise stated, my kids are only allowed the snacks that are in those areas.

Now, onto the 1st issue. I went into labor with my 3rd child 3 weeks ago. My SIL &amp; BIL had previously offered to watch our other two kids while H &amp; I go to the hospital to deliver our 3rd, no matter what time of day. We called to let them know, they came over &amp; H &amp; I left. This was around 7pm, &amp; our 2 kids were ready for bed at this time. SIL has put them down for the night before. We left our car w them. H would pick up the car after I had the baby.

When H &amp; I get to the hospital, we realized we forgot the hospital bag for our baby&amp; Snacks for the nurses. We don't live far, so H called BIL &amp; asked him if he could drive over &amp; drop the stuff off (using our car) &amp; then go back to our place. BIL suggested that SIL put the kids down for the night, &amp; then he &amp; SIL would LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE, drive our car &amp; theirs to us so they can leave our car w/ us, because after all, ""they'll be fine for 30mins"". H said ""No, I'd rather not."" BIL said ok to H and showed up by himself to drop the stuff off. I texted my SIL to let her know what BIL had suggested (WHILE IM IN LABOR) and to let her know that I am absolutely not okay with what he said. She seemed surprised that he would say that and reassured me that she'd never leave the kids alone.

After I return from the hospital, I noticed that 3yo had big hives on back, chin, and thighs. I was confused, but 3 seemed fine so I applied medicine &amp; figured accidentally came into contact, like if SIL had eaten something with peanuts prior to watching them.

FFW to today. I open my freezer in front of my 5yo who says ""Oh! Uncle gave us those before bedtime!"" pointing at a small bag of Reeses in a zip loc bag, high up in the freezer; it's only for when H &amp; I crave PB.

I questioned my 5 year old more, who insisted that BIL had given it to both children, BEFORE PUTTING THEM TO SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT. My 3 yo couldve gone into anaphylactic shock while they were asleep and they wouldnt have known until it was too late. I was shocked and horrified.

We haven't told SIL &amp; BIL that we don't trust them anymore, yet. But, my MIL is defending SIL &amp; BILs accident.

I told her I wanted to rest a little. 

Then the interrogations began. Every 5 minutes (I listened to songs and when I switch to a new one I look at the time) she asked me ""are you hungry?"". And every time I would say ""no"". After 20 minutes of this, I could hear that she was furious, so when she asked me for the fiftieth time, I said ""a little"". Otherwise, when I say I'm ""a little hungry"", we eat in about an hour to two hours.

This time she said ""fucking finally, come on, put on your jacket and let's go"". I just think to myself ""fuck, please let there be no food there"". In about 15 minutes we arrived at the restaurant, during the drive she talked about how she used to go here when she was going out and how nice it was. I just prepared my stomach and brain for hell. 

We sit at the table and she already had a problem with me. I wanted to order water, but she tried to order Coca-Cola for me. Thank God, the waiter brought me water and her a cola (she ordered that). It was obvious that if we weren't in public, she would have already lashed out at me. Now we should have ordered food, but I wasn't hungry. I told her ""a little"" not to question me because she was also irritating me with the question. I tell her ""oh, these are big portions"" (they said so on the menu).
""well, you can order half a portion"". I don't know if they would let it be done, but fine.
""I won't order anything, though. I'm not really that hungry-""
""WHAT!!!! So I brought you here to have fun and to eat, not for you not to eat anything. You will order something and you will eat until the last crumb is gone from that plate, do you understand!?""
 
""Well, fine, I can order, but I won't eat because, as I said, I'm not hungry"" 
""Well, you eat it or I'll go home""
 Knowing that I didn't have any money with me, I tried to calm her down while thinking of ways to repay the restaurant and ordered the smallest portion of something they had , but I couldn't even eat half of it and I was blouted until the next morning. At least she stayed long enough to pay, but when we got home, she started yelling at me. She called me a selfish, ungrateful bitch and a liar because I told her I was hungry when I really wasn't and asked me ""why did you say you were hungry if you really weren't!?!?""
 ""because you asked me every 5 minutes ""Are you hungry"" and I was getting anoyed. By the way, when I say that I'm ""a little hungry"" it usually means that we will eat in an hour or two, not in 15 minutes!"" She shut up after that, but I have to ask, AITA?

Ok so basically soon after I woke up I went into the bathroom to take a shower, to which then my roommate (who normally has his door open) jumped out of bed and said he needed to clean the shower and that he was sorry it wasn't done etc. etc. I asked why he didn't do it right after he was done using it to which he replied ""it only takes 5 seconds chill."" I started getting a little mad because if ""it only takes 5 seconds"" then why isn't it done? Why didn't you do it right after you used it? He didn't like that I was getting mad and said ""Well if you're just gonna get mad then I'll take even longer."" Which got me even more mad.

For some backstory:  When we first moved in there was ""some sorta grime on these (his) dishes... oh well!"" \*puts them in drawers anyway, no washing.\* He takes baths and would never clean the bathtub when done leaving it gross, leave out pizza boxes, trash, NEVER cleaned up his messes in the kitchen, forgot to flush the toilet, etc. One time he got a bunch of tartar sauce stuck on the ceiling, and left it there for several WEEKS! (wtf man!!?) His dishes piled up in the sink so high that I didn't have a lot of room to do mine in.

One time, I made meatloaf and let him have some. He took his fork from its 3 week home (the sink), stuck it right in my meatloaf (didn't even rinse it off), and then took a bite out of it. He clogged our toilet (this was the 2nd time) and so he got a plunger, started aggressively ""plunging"" the toilet, splashing brown poopy water everywhere, DIDNT EVEN UNGLOG IT, and proceeded to PUT THE DIRTY PLUNGER IN THE FREAKIN' DISHWASHER!!!!!

He’s a great guy with a daughter in college and a very amicable relationship with his ex wife. I’m a widow with no kids. We don’t live together, but I could see that happening in the future. Maybe marriage too, but that’s not something I need - I had a wedding already. We’re both on the same page about that. We travel together, have amazing sex, see tons of movies and concerts. We talk every day. He has been very healing for me to be with- my husband died 5 years ago and I had to take the beginning of our relationship very slowly and he was so supportive about it.

This last summer he mentioned he was going to go to Jamaica for a friend’s birthday the beginning of December. He didn’t invite me, so I assumed it was a boys trip. On Thanksgiving I found out that most of the friends are bringing their SOs- 9 people total. I was shocked when I heard this and when we were alone I asked him why I wasn’t invited. He just said “You weren’t.” And I started crying because I was extremely put off. It made me feel very small. I kept asking, and saying I’d like to go, and he clammed up and literally wouldn’t say anything. He comforted me, like rubbing my back, which was really odd.

Now I can imagine lots of reasons that I may not be invited. I’m younger than them, or maybe they only have a certain amount of room at whatever place they’ve booked.  There was also an incident about 2 years ago where I blacked out and made a fool of myself in front of his friends- right after that I quit drinking and have been sober since. I could understand if that made them uncomfortable but I see them fairly frequently and it doesn’t feel that way. I make more money than most of them, and always pay my way with everything that we do. But the issue is that he won’t tell me why- I sent him a text asking him again, and laying out reasons that we’re going through my head- and he said he was sorry but again wouldn’t tell me why.

Not knowing the reason is making me crazy- and I’ve not discounted cheating. He leaves Tuesday and I am thinking of asking him to not contact me during that time. I’m going to block him and his friends on social media, because I think seeing that stuff would make me sad and jealous. Not talking to him for the week he would be in Jamaica would really be about protecting my sanity, but I know it will come off as punitive to him. I want a chance to work through this issue when he gets back, and if I talk to him while he’s there and hear about his day in Jamaica,  I’ll be snippy and we’ll get into fights that aren’t productive. I don’t know if we’ll get through an issue like this, but I’d like the chance to try.

She motivated me to pursue an engineering career (I wanted to also, but I thought I wasn't able to do it), she cried during my graduation, and we usually support each other in relationship matters and other kind of big stuff on our lives.

So, I got into piano lessons and my teacher is really cute. I was talking to B about my piano lessons and mentioned that my teacher was cute and if she thought I should ask her out. She said that I should and that was it. She then proceeded to talk about this new guy she met online 3 months ago, how wonderful he is and how he sees the world so differently she's dumbfounded by him, now that's good.

Now, the issue I'm having is, while she was talking about how great this guy was, she started saying stuff like ""I haven't felt so excited for someone since I used to date you, hell maybe I feel even more excited and in love!"" And she then proceeded to compare how she felt when she was with me to how she feels when she's with him. She says ""I felt so good being with you, you were awesome, but this other guy is just amazing, I just feel this in a whole other level.""

I started to get irritated, since I don't care if she dates someone else, that's good, but the fact that she kept repeating how she felt more in love now than she did when she was with me was unnecessary. I just told her ""Hey, I think X is cute, should I ask her out?"" and she then goes full ""Yes I met this guy who makes me feel way better than you did back when we dated"". I let it slide, but today the topic resurfaced, she started asking me questions about love and stuff, and then she told me that this new guy was just his friend, and I told her ""Right..."" And she asked me ""We really are"" and I told her ""Sure, even though you told me that what you feel for that guy is way stronger than what you ever felt for me"", and she was taken aback and told me I was overreacting. I told her that I didn't mind if she met guys or had feelings for them, I told her that I didn't like being compared, and even less her saying that ""he has stronger feelings for her than he ever had for me"", she tried to brush it off.

I (f20) live with my roomate (f22) in a two bedroom apartment. I’m a sophomore in college with a job while they work. Weve lived together since August and it’s been going fine until their boyfriend came over to visit in October. I didn’t care that he came over and he left soon after he came but soon he started coming back and staying the night. Repeatedly. I didn’t mind and said that I was okay with him being over and normally she would ask if it was alright if he came over. It’s escalated since then and he’s now here more than he’s not (like 6 nights out of the week) and I’m starting to get bothered. They’ve stopped asking if it’s alright for him to stay over and I have no idea when he’s going to leave. It escalated to the point that I asked him to stay away for a little while because his prolonged presence here started to take a toll on my mental health.

I was annoyed that they were annoyed because this obviously upset me and they treated it like I was unreasonable for not wanting him in our apartment constantly? I understand that it’s her apartment too and I’m glad that she’s happy but it feels like she’s becoming co-dependent on him and doesn’t care about how it affects me. Flashforward to tonight and they said he was going to come over tonight when we agreed on tomorrow and I’m just lost. Am I right to be upset at all? Am I crazy?

I didn’t disclose this to my host family, as it doesn’t really affect my daily life as long as I take my medication. We didn’t go through an agency and she never asked about my medical history. 

After an eighteen hour trip I arrived at the airport in my host country and (long story) my host mom found out about my bipolar disorder. I explained why I didn’t disclose it, but she was furious.

She took me to her house, spoke with her husband about it, and they decided that I needed to leave the very next morning. They told me to stay in “my” room in the meantime, where it was freezing and I had nothing to eat or drink. 

The next morning they dropped me off at a train station and told me to figure it out, I’m on my way home now. She said I left her without childcare, and I said her own prejudice is leaving her without childcare. 

I’m angry at the way they treated me but I’m also starting to feel bad that they have no one to care for their kid.

My family is relatively big and from a European background whereas whilst he is also from a European background, has a small family and his parents divorced when he was 5. 

He has made it clear he is going ahead with the wedding because it’s what I want and I appreciate it. I’ve made effort to not involve him too too much in the planning process, only discussing what will be planned and asking for his opinion, but up until this point he hasn’t needed to organise anything on his end. Again happy to take the reigns. 

Traditionally we lead a few dances with the guests and the groom says a speech. He isnt too comfortable about dancing all together or public speaking so we agreed he would do 2 dances and a short, simple speech that we could write together. After that, if he feels like dancing he can otherwise it doesn’t necessarily bother me if he chooses not to. 

He tends to overthink situations and when he gets in a low mood, mentions that he doesn’t want to do a big wedding and is looking forward for it to be over so we can live our lives together - not wanting anything to change from how we are now. 

We are happy and have minor arguments about stupid shit at the very most. We live together and he is absolutely amazing when it comes to helping out around the house and making the effort to do what he can to support me and it’s vice versa 

I don’t really know how I can help him realise that whilst there will be a few things I’m sure he isn’t too keen to do , it will be a happy day and we will make the most of it and have fun.

We are in the same graduate school program and have the same friend group. She is one of my best friends at school, and we do lots of fun things together: watching shows, going out to clubs, going to the beach, etc. She is a super awesome person, and I really enjoy living with her.

There is one minor thing that we've had a few discussions about, and it regards our use of the common area. She lived in our apartment for a year (with a different roommate) before I moved in, so she kind of set the tone for how the apartment is set up/used. She supplied the kitchen table (it was already here before I moved in), though the rest of the furniture was about 50/50. It's a pretty large table — about 4"" x 6"" — so we can easily both sit at it at the same time, with our computers and room to spare.

The issue we've been having is that she does all of her work at the kitchen table, all day, every day. She is a really stressed/overwhelmed person when it comes to schoolwork. She takes her meetings out there and is usually doing work from about 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Meanwhile, she has the larger room (we pay equal rent, but I think it's fair since I have the parking spot because I have a car), and she has two desks in her room. She prefers to work in the common area because she wants to separate sleep and work, which I totally get... but because she's in the common area the whole day, that means I have to do my work in my room (I get distracted by the meetings). At this point, the only time I really spend in the common area is when I'm eating meals. I sit across from her while I'm eating, and she will be typing furiously and focusing while I sit in silence, which makes me feel kind of like I'm in someone's office.

We've talked about it a few times, as I told her that the common area for me feels like it should be a place of relaxation and I feel awkward hanging out there or watching TV if she's doing work. She said she's totally fine with the noise and has been super accommodating. That said, it's still really hard for me to feel like the common area is relaxing for me. I only have a couple of times per day to relax, and the kitchen table (to me) should be somewhere that is work-free at mealtimes. I've asked her a few times if she could let me have the kitchen table for 30 minutes just to eat my oatmeal and get a breather from school (she said I could always feel free to ask), but she always seems a little peeved when I do.

WIBTA if I asked my roommate to move one of her desks to the common area and work there instead of the kitchen table? I don't know if it's too late in the game to ask, but it feels like that would help us both separate the work/school and relaxing areas.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4832862,public,top,self,WIBTA for asking my roommate to move her desk to the common area?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6qbi9/wibta_for_asking_my_roommate_to_move_her_desk_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,
