I (42f) am on the verge of cheating on my partner.(44m) . We've been together 20+ years, 3 children, house etc.
Our sex life is dismal, in the last 3 years we've had sex a handful of times. Partner is on medication that causes erectial dysfunction and won't go to a doctor about it. As a result, he never lasts long enough to get any kind of penetrative sex going. It has all boiled down to hand jobs and oral. We've bought toys etc but they barely get used. He won't talk about it either
I want more, I want to be railed into next week. I want someone that actually wants to touch me and make me feel like they are in my bed by choice rather than obligation.

So my parents and family have been extremely religious (catholic) since always. Very closed minded too. There are hundreds of issues that we don’t address because of that. I personally, even tho believe in god, do not agree with church ideologies, and specifically not with the way they manage the religion (at least in my country). I grew up surrounded by it and i think am traumatized in a lot of ways.

When my brother came out as gay a few years ago, he stopped going to church (which by the way, we go to every sunday without an excuse). My parents at first put up a fight, they always made him feel guilty about not wanting to go anymore (they still do sometimes) but with time, they stopped trying to make him go to church. Ever since then when I try to not go at least a day (doesn’t matter why) they immediately shut me down, not really caring if the religion doesn’t work for me or makes me feel uncomfortable. One time they even grounded me because i said i couldn’t go because i had a lot of homework. They always make me feel guilty and like the bad guy because i don’t “devote my time to god”. 

Lately it’s been a constant problem because i haven’t sacredly confirmed (hope i said that right) because i moved to another city and here they had already done it in school. I personally have no interest in doing it, and i think god wouldn’t like me to do it if i’m just there because my parents made me, not because i wanted to. 
Also i haven’t confessed in a while, and my mom has been bugging me about it saying i need it (even thought i’ve expressed multiple times that i don’t feel comfortable doing in it because of the priests here at my city).

I don’t know what to do, I feel like i’m trapped, and if I come against them they’ll either hate me or just make me feel guilty about it all my life.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4848684,public,top,self,AITA for not wanting to go to church anymore or follow religion?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb63qc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_church_anymore_or/,all_ads,6,,,,

In college I met my now husband who is also Korean. He’s not adopted like me but his parents did move to the u.s from Korea when he was around 10.

No we did not give her an english name as well since the name really isn’t that hard to pronounce and I wanted her to have a name that was from her culture.

We did a little family get together with my family yesterday so they could meet her but my mom kept bringing up how “hard” her name is to pronounce. I explained to her many times how to say it and yet she still kept getting it wrong which felt on purpose. After the millionth time of me correcting my mom about her name she yelled at me and said I shouldn’t have given her a difficult name and I was setting her up for failure and years of bullying.

They left shortly after that but I’ve been thinking about it since then. I don’t think foreign names should be considered difficult and they certainly shouldn’t if it’s your family. I know kids can be mean and bullying is common when it comes to names but I would hate to raise my child to think she needs to change herself to make others feel comfortable.

I was 14 when my mom passed away and it's been 8 years. There is a lot to this story, but I'll try to keep it as short as I can. 

In 2014 my (then 37F) mother passed away tragically, leaving behind me (now 22F), my brother (now 10M) and my father (now 50M).  I was 14, my brother was 2 and my dad 42. 

Two years later my father remarried. Me and my stepmother get along just fine. My brother calls her mom because he was too young when our mother passed. He does know he's not stepmother's biological son and she does her best to help us honor my mother's memory. 

Me and my dad had our differences when I was growing up to become who I am now. We had our struggles, fights and all that teenage stuff until I moved out. Then, separated, we learned that we do care and love each other. I make sure to let him know when he steps out of boundaries with me, and he does the same.  

Recently I've blown through all of my money. I got into debt when I really didn't have the need to spend that much, as my dad still supports me, and I've repented my choices over and over enough times. I know it wasn't right but I can't change what has been done, I can just work with what I have now. 

My dad knows about this. 

Thing is, this month is my late mother's birthday. I was searching for some nice pictures of her when I noticed my external HD is having SO.MUCH.TROUBLE. working.  It's not connecting the way its supposed to, it shuts down out of nowhere and I'm really afraid I'm going to lose the photos and videos me and mom have stored over the years.  

So I contacted my father and asked him for help. 

We've been through a lot with my mom's memories, as her side of the family took all the film photos and albums, and I was left with the digital version (not all of my childhood memories, just the ones that happened AFTER the digital camera was made accessible). 

My dad straight up asked me: HOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA COST ME? 
So I said: I didn't research it yet, I just thought you should know and I'm afraid to lose all the archives. You can do whatever you want, if you want to choose an HD yourself you can. 
Dad: This was the time to use your own money. This is what it was for. 

I was floored. My dad knows I'm in debt, he knows I can't afford the device, he knows everything that has happened to me. I really don't know if I'm acting entitled because I'm really hurt he wouldn't consider how much this means to me and how much I want to keep my mother's memory alive. Just because he moved on from being a widower, doesn't mean I'm not my mother's daughter.

Ok, so I(19f) had a crush on this guy back in high school that lasted for about 5 years. During this time period, he got increasingly less charming and more terrifying instead. I don't want to go back down memory lane, but he just wasn't a good person.

 I attended a boarding school(I've graduated) and so my classmates and I are really close and are like family, so we're always getting updates on how other people are doing. The only person who would update me on how that guy was doing however was my best friend, which I thought was weird but I hate confrontation so I said nothing. It always bothered me how she was always friendly with him, despite what he did to me. She would do his hair, comment under his post on Instagram, facetime him, and do other things that always rubbed me the wrong way.

I finally gathered the courage to tell her this when we were having a heart-to-heart session, where she apologized for not ""being there for me"" and promised she wouldn't ever bring him up again. This was back in April keep in mind, so I thought we were past this. Apparently, we weren't. Just yesterday we were face timing catching up for lost time since we hadn't seen each other in a while. She was sharing details about her current hookup when she suddenly got really excited and said that she had to tell me something. Someone had asked her to be his girlfriend. I was excited until she said that it was someone I knew. After guessing wrong a few times, she told me that it was my assaulter. I was sad but still tried to stay positive for some reason like a dummy, so I put a smile on my face and asked her if she was going to say yes to him. She said, "" Of course not. Why would I do that?!"", and I eased up a bit, before she said that she didn't want ex GF drama......not because of what he did to me. ok then.

After sleeping on it, I realized that I was fed up with her casting my feelings so I confronted her about it and really tried to be as kind as possible, because its not like I wanted to fight, I just wanted her to stop unintentionally hurting my feelings. However the more I talked to her, the more frustrated and upset I got. She kept using excuses saying that she didn't know I still cared about that ""situation"" and even said that I never told her about what happened in the first place, which pissed me off because she would suddenly backpedal and claim that I only spoke to her about  the guy and our problems  in high school! She kept apologizing but it felt like she just wanted to end the conversation so in anger I told her that I needed space and that I didn't want to see her for a while and that she was just the worse. I felt as if I was really aggressive though.

A little backround. I suffer from anxiety, o.c.d, and insomnia. So it's not rare that I spend nights awake and with severe anxiety.

I'm not a music man, but I like to play guitar, so in nights when I cannot sleep, I grab my acoustic guitar and play it until I'm tired. (Usually before sunrise). However, I live in a neighorhood where it's all houses, even though i make sure not too bother anyone, one of my neighbors complains often. I play classical guitar, folk or delta Blues, nothing too loud.

Anyways, a neighboor two house from the left of mine complains, she comes over and says her cats gets stressed by the sound (I don't know how, but i don't know nothing about cats) I try to tell her it's a way to calm my anxiety but she won't budge. The thing that bothers me, is that when I complain about her cats pooping in my garden she says ""it's their nature"" (It's not that common for them to poop there, but it's often)

I'm afraid to confront her, but at the sime time I like to play guitar to calm me down, I don't even use amplification, it's me and an acustic. (When it's day time and I have time, I do bust out my telecaster). The neighbor between us never complained.

I don't want to stop playing guitar when I can't sleep, specially if calms down my anxiety. But I don't want to cause anyone trouble. No one has complained except her, but I don't talk to my neighboors that often.

I have a pretty wide margin of tolerance for regular stupidity and mental health.  I’m not a confrontative person and I stay out of business unless it touches my inner circle.  

These things didn’t feel minor and they directly affected me or my own.  A weapon brought to a school, impaired driving, someone ignoring serious health issues, someone spiralling mentally in public and more. 

Confronting and / or ratting people out has had very uncomfortable consequences for the person, but it prompted a change that ultimately got the person out of the dumpster fire they were in.  

It’s also irreparably damaged my relationships single every time and I don’t think it was appreciated at all.  I was definitely the asshole in their opinion. 

My husband agreed my ‘interventions’ were not an overreaction and other people affected were typically thankful ‘someone said something’. 

It feels like total shit to be the only one to ever say anything when there’s literally a crowd of people watching an oncoming train wreck doing nothing.

My college gives me 6 guest tickets. I’ve already decided on my parents, my sister, and my maternal grandma to come which leaves me with 2 tickets left.

Here’s the issue. Out of the 2 remaining tickets, I want to give one to my middle school teacher who has become like a second mother to me since I left. I always pictured her being at these big life events with me. I told my mom this and I thought she would understand since they are actually pretty close as well. She got mad at me because she thinks I should invite my paternal grandmother in my teacher’s place.

Truth be told, some things went down a few years ago between me &amp; her and now I don’t really have any love left for my paternal grandmother. I don’t communicate with her anymore and I pass on trips where one of the stops is her house. Bottom line: I don’t want her at my graduation. 

My mom just starts on a whim about the fact that I have a living grandmother and she should be there at the graduation because she’s family. I’m also being accused of passing on family to give a ticket to an outsider. Honestly, my old teacher feels a lot more like family than my grandmother ever did.

I just feel like it’s my graduation and I should decide who I want there and who I don’t. I really don’t know why she’s making a big deal out of this since she knows what went down and why I won’t go down there or speak to my pat. grandmother anymore.

He doesn't listen to anything his parents tell him to do, not even when the rest of us try to tell him to listen. He shoves his tablet in people's faces and tries to make them play the games on it even when they say no thank you. He physically fights his dad whenever his dad does something he doesn't like, or tries to get him to do something he doesn't want to do.

It also annoys me greatly when I witness either my sister or her husband tell him ""If you don't behave you're not gonna get dessert"", and then they say ""Okay, that's it, you're not getting dessert"", but then they proceed to give him dessert anyway and he doesn't even eat it. Or when he is given a proper punishment, only for him to directly tell his parents that he's gonna go do the thing that landed him in the corner again.

But I just cannot help but be very annoyed by him when he doesn't follow directions. I actually don't know if it's annoyance or overstimulation that turns into annoyance when it doesn't stop.

I (18f) was meeting up with my BFF (Courtney) (18f) at a cafe since she said there was something she wanted to tell me. When we sat down at the cafe she burst out crying and told me she just found out that she was 6 weeks pregnant. I asked her how her bf (JJ) (19m) reacted to the pregnancy. She said he was shocked and terrified so they both went to his parents to ask for advice on what to do. Courtney said she that his mother (Jane) was ecstatic about the news and said that both her and his father (Paul) would help raise their grand baby, but even though Paul seemed happy he also seemed somehow uneasy. Courtney also told me that her and JJ had a talk with his parents and Courtney suggested abortion since she had just started university and JJ was still learning the ropes of his dads business (for context they both live in a one bedroom flat and have no room for a child) Jane went ballistic saying how dare she even think about killing her own child and that she would just have to drop out of university and be a stay at home mum, while JJ would be the breadwinner. Paul told her to calm down while Courtney and JJ looked dumbfounded, after a while they went home. Courtney asked me for my input and I said ‘if you don’t want the baby and to be a mother then not to have it, you have load of time to have kids in the future’, to be fair she was happy that she had a friend on her side to tell her she wasn’t a monster for having an abortion. That night her and JJ decided to get an abortion since they were in no position to have a child. A week later JJ’s sister was having a party and invited family and friends, While I was talking to Courtney at the party Jane comes up and starts screaming how excited she was for her grand baby. Everyone heard this baring in mind it was only me, JJ and his parents who knew about the pregnancy, then loads of people were congratulating Courtney on her pregnancy and asked why she didn’t tell them sooner. Soon after Courtney and JJ scurried off with Jane and Paul somewhere private to explain that Jane should have announced that. Jane asked why since it’s was such a ‘important thing since it was their first grand baby’, Courtney explained that they were going to have an abortion and Jane went crazy. A screaming match happened between Courtney, JJ and Jane while Paul tried to reason with Jane. A few minutes later Jane storms out and screams ‘How dare you corrupt Courtney into killing her own child, I didn’t tamper with her pills for nothing’. The whole place went silent then another screaming match occurred but more people joined in. In the end some people said that I was good at supporting my friend while other said I should have kept my nose out of so AITA?

Things have been going well, other than the fact I have been having trouble with our roommate's cleaning habits.

The common areas such as the kitchen and the living room are never clean unless I clean them, food stains/dog hair on the counters and tables, empty bottles and miscellaneous trash, dirty dishes not in the sink, plates and bowls on the floor (he lets his dog eat his leftovers). There will be no water left in the Brita filter and no bowls or plates to use. Things will stay like this for days unless I clean them, and then the cycle repeats again.

I cleaned up after him for a good month until I said something, and it has been a few times this has been brought up but eventually he goes back to the same habits.

In other ways he shows he is just careless, one day one of my sandals went missing... just to find out he apparently threw it in with his clothes to wash and it shrunk and now one of my sandals is permanently smaller than the other one. Like how does that even happen?

I am asking this question now because my boyfriend and I left for a week to visit family for Thanksgiving, and what I returned to was just super disheartening.

Stains all over the kitchen counter, multiple trash and food containers lining the living room, clothes and crumbs/dirt all over the floor, kitchen rag on the floor, and of course dishes and other utensils everywhere...

I ended up sweeping the floor and cleaning the counters because I just could not keep looking at it every time I left the room, I went and started scraping solidified smoothie off of the rim of the sink and encrusted cookie mix off of the counter that I know would have been easier to clean up had he just done it when he made the mess. The next day there was just more trash and spills on the counter and mess on the floor and I feel defeated.

He also asked to borrow my favorite blanket because it got cold while we were away, and then he apparently washed it but left it for a week without drying it and even after washing it again the mildew smell is still so strong it is now basically unusable.

His room is even worse, but honestly I don't care because that is within his space and that's fine. I don't feel like I am asking a lot to keep the common areas clean, especially since we take care of his dog while he is at work (we work from home) and have cleaned up some of her messes that she has made as well.

I have started to use the common areas less and less now, I do not feel good in a space that is cluttered with trash or dishes that take 5 seconds to put away. My boyfriend tells me we haven't hung out in the common area with our roommate in a while but how do I say I am tired of looking at the state of the apartment and I'd rather be in our room?

I told him that I felt like his gagging sounds rude and immature when I’m trying to make a nice dinner for us.

In front of the shops are two public street parking spots. The only option for parking in this complex is a $95 parking pass that ONLY allows parking AFTER 5pm until 8AM. So I have not purchased it and anyone who doesn’t purchase it parks on the street, which is the majority of the 24 tenants. 

I bought a Ford E250 that I’m converting that I parked in the parking space in front of the shops, and have been driving my Subaru as it gets better gas mileage until I can get it sold. I switch out vehicles a few times per week to keep both of them running. However, for the past 4 days, I haven’t been home much and have kept the van parked. 

Today I get an email from the leasing office asking me to move my van because some of the shop tenants have been complaining that it is blocking their street view. I said no problem I will move it when I get home. 

But then later, my neighbor sends me a picture of a letter on my window shield that reads:
“Dear Inconsiderate Person,
MOVE THIS STORAGE UNIT ON WHEELS (dramatically underlined). I, TOO, AM A RESIDENT AT (apartment complex). FOR 4 DAYS THIS UGLY VAN HAS BLOCKED MY BUSINESS FROM STREET VIEW. YOU ARE INFRINGING ON MY ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LEAVE THIS THING HERE. THESE SPACES ARE FOR EVERYONE. WE HAVE SEEN YOU DRIVING UP IN YOUR SUBARU AND USING AS A STORAGE UNIT. MOVE IT TODAY. 
(Name)”

Getting a pair of shoes that I left from a prior trip out of the van this morning was evidently “using it as a storage unit.”

My van is in no way impairing the view to the sign on her shop, or any of the others, and her shop is perfectly viewable from even across the street. I wish I could include pictures. The shop signs are clear as day and my van isn’t that much taller than any other car.

We got our cats 3 years ago, a week before I got married to my wife.

So we have 2 cats, they're siblings. One of them is deaf and my wife found him online and is the sole reason for getting cats in the first place, and when we got there, they sold us his sister for free, a 2-for-1 special as they had to come together, which was fine by us. 

Anyways, they're both raised well and have all of the freedom to do whatever they love to do. However, they are filthy, I tried cleaning them and they give me a hissy fit. The female really likes to just chill on top of the litter which sometimes is full of pee clumps and poops. I tried punishing her with water spray on her face to not do that yet she keeps doing it over and over. They like to jump on top of our dining table and relax there. Many times we had to clean off the litter sands off the table because it's where we eat.

My wife's mom came to spend Thanksgiving week with us and stay with us. She brought up how our cats are on the table a lot and it made her uncomfortable to eat with us. During her entire stay she ate anywhere else she could besides the dining table and I felt bad but my wife was fine about it. They don't have a good relationship but that's beside the point. 

My mom is currently spending her week with us and she expressed the same discomfort about the cats relaxing on the dining table and warned us about the spread of disease from touching the poop and contaminating the table, which can spread E. Coli and other diseases. 

I dont mind cats but for over a year now I've been telling my wife about how I think we should give it away to others who might take better care of them financially because to me, in my opinion, they are just a waste of money to keep taking care of them, vet check ups, buying their food, and generally keeping them alive and healthy. I don't see much benefits from owning them.

We just got our firstborn over the summer and he's 4 months so I am a little worried about if our cats could possibly give him a fatal disease as he starts crawling and walking and exploring and all that.

So please help me here, would I be the asshole to give them up, and if yes, then is there an alternative way I can go about how to resolve this issue?

Brother and I don't have a relationship, we don't speak at all, I haven't seen pictures of the niblings over 6 years despite asking numerous times, and we only communicate through his wife's phone because he won't give us his number. 

we all live in different cities

I've tried this last month to initiate communication with him and it failed, after the first call, he hasn't replied to any of my texts. during that call it was clear he didn't want to repair our relationship with me and my sister (45f - she and I are very close, she lives in another country)

I know he is going through financial difficulties, and I was even asked by our aunt 3 times to help him. I said no because I don't have the funds, and my family (husband 45m) comes first, which is what everyone in my family always say to me. I am the breadwinner. we don't have kids, but we barely make by every month.

Since I said that, aunt is not even speaking to me, and then I realised I have not been invited to any extended family get togethers since I got married (I'm gay) 6 years ago and she lives in same city as me. she had a birthday party on the weekend with all the family and I wasn't invited. realised it's been going on for very long time.

I'm hurt, and just tired of all the games and fakeness of saying ""we're all family"" but yet I am the one who gets looked down on and ignored, and I'm only ""family"" if I cough up money.

In the past I have financially helped my brother with thousands of $, not paid back, but when I came out as gay it seemed fine, I assume because I was still paying? But when I had to stop because my finances took a hit, and then I got married, I got the cold shoulder.

With all that in mind, should I continue to send money to the niblings? It's not their fault they're innocent children, however I'm pretty sure my brother is using the money I give to them out of their accounts.

I think I should stop, but will that destroy whatever little relationship I have with the kids? I still love those kids but is it an AH move?

My GF is pregnant and due in March. She is currently struggling with a low self esteem due to the transformation her body is going through,  pregnancy related acne on her face and back and severe back pain that pretty much means she has to spend any hour she isn't at work in bed. She probably should stop working because her body clearly can't handle it, but the problem is that she usually gets depressed if she has to stay at home for more than 2 days. Especially now that she has to spend almost all her time in bed.
Recently she has been feeling more unhappy than the happy and I am starting to really worry about her mental health. I worry about her long term physical well being if she continues to work and I worry about her mental health if she decides to stop working. Unfortunately, I can't be at home all day to try and cheer her up and even though I have taken 6 months paternity leave, the paternity leave isn't until after our baby is born. That is why I have been thinking about calling my in-laws, to ask if they could call her or come visit her more often. Now, my in-laws are not the most attentive parents and they rarely call or come visit us and I know it frustrates my GF. Just to be clear, it isn't due to a lack of love on their part, but they are, very stereotypical to the region they live in, not very talkative, nor are they  good at talking about emotions. I know my GF would get furious at me if I asked for her permission to call them, but cureently I don't see any other solution. I am really struggling with trying to manage both 24 hours of work per week, writing my master's thesis, being a fulltime house-husband taking care of all the chores at home and a comforting BF. So, redditors, WIBTA if I, behind my GF's back, contacted my in-laws, explained the situation and asked them if they would start contacting my GF regularly?

     We both moved out into a house less than a month ago and we thought having Friendsgiving would be fun for all of our friends. I was the one who planned everything, she just said yes to the questions I asked her(ie dates and people to come). For context, her and her boyfriend, who I’ll call Chris, have been in a pretty toxic situation. 
  
  Firstly, he has a porn addiction that he refuses to accommodate for his girlfriends feelings. When she found out he was watching porn it upset her and she told him that if she was going to continue this relationship with him, that he needed to stop. He has not stopped watching porn, regardless of her feelings. Secondly, he refuses to stop smoking weed around her and when they’re seeing her family. Thirdly, he only started hitting on her when she turned 18. He went after her after her birthday and lovebombed her. He is 26 btw, she’s 20. His best friends, all around the same age, participate in gross behavior like going to college bars to pickup girls and things like that, disgusting, I see where he gets it from. 
  
     So, after the dinner, Chris spent the night and woke up for work at 6 am. He went through our kitchen like a fucking tornado and woke me up. He left all of the lights on and slammed the door on his way out. I was furious, I had to leave that day to go out of town and I didn’t get enough sleep because of that asshole. Fast forward two days when I come back home, his car is in the driveway. I wanted to talk to my roommate when I got home about Chris and he was fucking there. I ignore them and do my own thing, until I have to take a shower. There is piss all over the toilet seat. Absolutely fucking not. I told him “the next time you use our bathroom, put the toilet seat up” He gives me a half ass “yeah fs” and leaves. The next day, I text her and tell her we should talk when I get home. I go knock on her door and the argument starts.

     I say “I want to hear what you have to say first” and she goes “it’s about Chris coming over all the time isn’t it” and I say yes AND stop inviting him to our friend gatherings. The whole argument lasted an hour or so, and pretty much revolved around me explaining why our friends don’t like him and thus stop bringing him around for big events, and her counter arguing that I don’t respect her decisions to stay with him and to bring him around. I try to tell her, listen, I don’t care what you do in your free time. I don’t care if you waste your time with that cuntfuck, it’s your choice. I am telling you that I do not want him at big friend events because it makes us uncomfortable and we do not like him. She starts crying and storms out of the house and slams the door.

I (F22), had a friend (F23) who has two children (M4 &amp; M5). Her kids are developmentally delayed (I never judged her or them for this) and therefore the boys would get into things they shouldn’t. They don’t fully understand the consequences of their actions and would create messes/problems that weren’t always the easiest to fix. 

In July, she messaged our group chat with me and one other girl, saying her sons had flooded the bathroom upstairs in her house. They had stuffed things in the toilet and sinks and water came pouring out. The water seeped through the bathroom floor and was dripping out of the light fixtures in her kitchen. She came to me and our other friend to vent about it, but what frustrated me was that she said she had no plan to fix it or tell her landlord about it until she was moving out. My boyfriend works in disaster restoration and frequently deals with water damage/floods, so I decided to talk to him about it. He told me to pass along the message that she could get sued or evicted for not reporting the damage as stated in her tenancy agreement. He also said that if she left it untreated, it would run risks of growing mould which in term could do damage to her and her sons health. 

I went and told her this information, trying to be helpful, and in turn she got mad at me for giving her unsolicited advice. Stating that I shouldn’t have brought my boyfriend into it and that I was causing her more stress and anxiety than she already had. She told me she couldn’t bring anyone in to fix the problem for a few different reasons: her house was dirty, she had no money, she was already afraid of getting kicked out, etc. We started arguing because of it and I told her my boyfriend would’ve been willing to come in and dry out the damage so she wouldn’t have to tell her landlord/spend money, but not anymore due to her attitude toward me and my spouse. She got upset with me, saying she didn’t want advice she simply wanted to vent about it then left the groupchat in entirety. I haven’t talked to her since. 

I cared about her and her sons’ health and didn’t want her to end up sued or evicted which is why I inquired to my boyfriend about it.

Tw: abuse

A little bit of backstory. My twin brother has a problem with agression and violence. We were 14 when he came at me with a knife the first time. Before that he had given me a few black eyes and poured boiling water on me. He came after me with a knife three times in total. My mother (single mother) was present every time he did that. It was one of those big knives, as long as the underarm of a normal person. There was no punishment for him. His explanation is that I didn't submit to him and therefore deserved what i got. 
Now, all of that is in the past. Both my mother and my brother feel like I should be over these incidents already. My mother says that brothers just do that sometimes and that i should move on. (Her brother did not chase her around the house with a stake knife)
My brother continues to threaten my life if i don't do what he says or threatens to smash things. 

Now, onto the issue. My brother wanted to eat a yoghurt that i had kept for myself. I asked that he please won't. He did it anyway. My mother was there and told me that he should have it, because he asked so nicely. I blew up. I have also run away from home. My mother has called me dramatic and tells me that i keep calling her a bad mother (i never said that, i just ask her to please make him stop threatening me and she then takes this as she is a bad mother). I don't know what to do anymore. Every time i ask her if she can please make him stop she tells me that she's just so helpless because she doesn't want him to have to move out. I cannot move out because of money. I do not want him to have to leave either. I do not want him to suffer i just want to be able to say no and then not be threatened or ignored. 

I am posting on here because i really do not know if i am being dramatic. He hasn't physically hurt me for two years. He just keeps threatening to do it and I would like him to stop. But should I be over what happened with him? Was it dramatic to run away?

 I didn't include everything he did to me, because that would be really taxing for me to write down.

Things have gone really well and my husband took our son to adopt a cat. We knew it was risky since I wasn’t sure if I would be okay having one in our house 24/7 but my sister-in-law said she would take him in if I really couldn’t cope with it. 

My dad came to visit yesterday with his family and they saw the cat. My younger sister has wanted a cat for forever but my dad hasn’t let her get one because he knew I wouldn’t ever visit if they did so she’s angry at me for getting my son one since I’m the reason she couldn’t have one. My stepmother said I should’ve told them I was over my phobia so they could’ve got one too and that I should’ve told them we had a cat now to avoid upsetting my sister.

We’ve had the cat for 5 days so it’s still early days which is why I didn’t mention it. I tried to explain to them why I didn’t say anything but my younger sister is still angry with me and my stepmother is siding with her.

We both have a history of mental illness and I’ve been trying really hard to do things to better my mental health. He tries as well but his idea of helping his mental health is definitely different than mine. 
Through time I noticed that when he smokes, he does really silly things that just make no sense like putting things in spots they don’t go, or ruining a meal he’s cooking (burning, accidentally dumping pepper on it, etc), forgetting to turn lights off or lock doors. I’ve also noticed he’s less considerate when he smokes, and less able to be emotional supportive and that I have to do most of the mental work. 
When he doesn’t smoke, which he has gone several periods of time without smoking, these things aren’t an issue at all. He’s way more on top of things and I enjoy interacting with him much more because he does act different when he is or isn’t high. 
In the past we both agreed it would be better if he only smoked twice or three times a week, and he would try it for a week or two then go back to smoking however often he wants to which then obviously makes the issues I talked about repeat. He typically doesn’t smoke more than 5 times a week but part of me does feel like it could potentially be negatively affecting his mental health. Some of his friends have tried to say I’m controlling because of this, but if he acted like himself when he was high then it wouldn’t be an issue for me. The lack of emotional intelligence and responsibility when he’s high is a major major turn off because I just feel like his mom. 
The reason I’m wondering if I’m the AH is because I was in an abusive relationship with a guy who was a HUGE stoner, and so was my mom so the smell of weed on his breath is a trigger for me and I don’t want to project that onto him because he is a good guy. A lot of times when hes high he does many things that remind me of how my ex acted when he was high and it makes me feel disgusted. I also don’t want to be controlling. We’ve both agreed its best if he smokes 2-3 times a week but its like he has no self control after a couple weeks and the repetition is making me really upset because when we’ve discussed it he always says he values our relationship more than weed.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4848530,public,top,self,AITA for asking my boyfriend not to smoke more than two to three times a week?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb4xno/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_not_to_smoke_more/,all_ads,6,,,,

He has no interest in college &amp; I supported him being jobless for a few months until he landed a higher paying job. He sells solar now knocking on doors, when he first started he loved it and would pull 12hr days w his co workers. Well when you land a deal let’s just say it’s a fat chunk of change. Therefore now he rarely wakes up on time and will go buy coffee (hour+) before heading to turf on a good day by like 3/4pm? He comes home before it gets dark so 7, sometimes even 6 or randomly mid day if he ran an appointment and closed a deal.I’m honestly fine w this, it gives us lots of time together and he makes so much that we keep a roof over our head &amp; then some. I tell him all the time how proud I am. Well today I’m starting my donation cycle which will be exactly a week and a half. Smoking would be detrimental &amp; it’s not worth it. The problem is that if he gets home and I’m already high, he starts getting upset. ‘What’s funny? Well I don’t get it bc I’m not lit. Must be nice?’ It’s too the point where I will have a hit ready for him so he can not feel left out or bothered. Today I mentioned how in a perfect world he would wait to smoke w me in another week, he laughed it off and went straight to the bong. I knew I had to ask directly &amp; so I did, he caught a huge attitude and said that he doesn’t smoke for me and just because I made choices for my body doesn’t mean I can control his. I said I would feel alienated hanging with someone who’s high as hell while I’m sober and hormonal. I reminded him that in the year we’ve been together when have I ever asked for support? Meanwhile I’m always supporting him no questions asked. This is where it got ugly, he proceeded to say something along the lines of ‘You’re really going to act like I’m not a good partner bc I want to smoke while you can’t? I break my back everyday to keep a roof over your head.’ (It was a lot more vulgar) As someone raised with general labors and fully aware of the economic climate currently I replied with ‘You don’t break your back? You refuse to even work most days.. you are privileged and have got very comfy in your lifestyle.’ I appreciate my partner, like I said I tell him all the time how proud I am but to aggressively cuss &amp; claim hustler feels wrong?

I have always been close with my mom! I have a great relationship with my dad, we’re very similar therefore we do clash a lot of the time about minor things. I ideally wouldn’t be living with my parents still however there is a massive known housing crisis where I’m from so it makes sense currently to live with them and save money. My dad works all over the world for months at a time then will take a month or two off. My mom works full time, as do I. When my dad is home he typically is off work therefore it is only me and my mom working. My dad is also in his 60s, close to retirement and is getting noticeably more impatient, bored and agitated with things. He expects a lot of my mom when she’s home to be more energetic and upbeat but she can be tired from work related things, etc. My mom is 20 years younger than him and is nowhere near the stage of life he seems to be at and I do think she struggles with managing this. 
If I’m not working an evening I will normally go to the shop or have a drink/coffee with my mom in town that evening which could be sometimes 4 or 5/7 days a week. We would typically take an hour, maybe 2 but rarely. This lately has been hugely upsetting my dad as he says my mom just eats and goes to sleep once she’s back after we go out, and that he never sees her asides from early morning and at night. That she spends all her time with me, and even if we don’t go anywhere she will just stay up for ages in the evenings and speak to me lol 
I don’t know what to think. I don’t want to upset or create issues between my parents by spending ‘too much’ time with her, but I also do not see any harm or wrong in taking an hour out of my day to spend with her and talk about our day? I feel it’s ridiculous to even have to worry about it. If anything happened to her tomorrow I would be devastated I didn’t spend enough time with her over stupid things like this.
I feel it’s down to my dad to make plans with my mom if he feels he doesn’t see her as often as he wants to, and that it’s nothing to do with what we choose to do together. He sometimes comes with us for a drink but he more often has no interest or seems a bit petty so stays home.
I can sense my dad getting irritated at me more over tiny things, which can only be due to the fact he’s secretly got this huge built up annoyance with me inside lol but it’s creating so many silly arguments between us and i feel it’s genuinely going to damage us unless it somehow gets resolved or I just find somewhere in a different area to move to.

A couple months ago, she ended up coming to the city I live in and said that if I was looking for a roomate, she'd be up to living together again. I was excited as I had just had my previous roomate move out.

Since, she has done the bare minimum to move in and give the place a chance. She is still as messy as she was when we lived together before. I work a part time job waitressing as well as attend university full time, so I do not have the time to clean up two people's messes on a regular basis, so often when she is here the place is a state. 

A month after she got back from being out of town for three months, I was smoking weed and we were hanging out. She mentions that this other girl we both know, Kate, is thinking of moving to the city and wanted to know if we'd want to move into a 3 bedroom with her. I told her there'd have to be a bunch of criteria met before I'd think about, but ultimately said I'd be interested.

The next day, Laura told me Kate and her had a conversation about it. They both started looking for apartments. The place we're currently in is a 2bed, 2bath apartment that we pay only 600/month (each) for that includes everything. Most apartments like ours go for 2000/month, especially since it's located in a nicer area of the city.

Suddenly, Kate had quit her job, had a new one in the city and is now staying with her partner until we find a place.

At veiwings, Laura was getting excited, but I was not. I ended up telling her I didn't know if I actually wanted to move or not. She told me that if I didn't want to, she had to because Kate had already set up here and is ready to get a place. She also told me that she would not support me financially with rent because she can't afford two places, so if I decided to stay where I am now I'd be on my own.

A week later, I told her that I would move out with them but also be searching for my own place.

She has left again because her grandmother has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I told her to stay out as long as she needs. I thought that since she was not in the city, and with everything going on the apartment search was on hiatus, because no one told me they were still looking.

 I get a message that says that we were offered a place for dec 15. I didn't reply the whole day. When I called Laura, I told her I felt a bit blindsided and that it would be a stupid idea for us to move out that day because a week later we'd have to go to our hometown for christmas. She told me it was fine, but tried to guilt me with how nice a place it was and how Kate has been stuck at her partners place. She messaged me later to say that if I wasn't going to be ready by jan 1st, they were going to go ahead and move on without me.

I just have such an uneasy feeling about giving up this apartment.

I’ve noticed little things here and there that made me think he might be a little racist or sexist, but usually nothing concrete that I could bring to my fiancé as a real gripe. For background I am half Puerto Rican and half white. 

It’s usually little things like when in group convos he looks past me when I speak and pretends he doesn’t hear me. He’s always commenting on how is wife is so skinny and I’ve heard him also tell her not to eat certain things which just bugs me as a woman. It’s hard to bite my tongue. He always has outbursts and tantrums whenever we see him and he talks down to my fiancé often. 

Over thanksgiving he went into a whole speech about how it’s BS that some companies are looking to hire more people of color rather than more white men, and that his managers have told him they’re looking for more diversity and have enough white dudes for now. He thinks this is outrageous and that they should just hire the best people, ie. the friends he recommends who are white. He was shouting all about this at a restaurant next to me, a clearly mixed raced female and also right in front of our waiters who happened to be black. When I tried to speak up he talked over me and acted like I was invisible, but there is no way he didn’t hear me as I was seated right next to him. I was super triggered by this and got emotional about it later when I brought it up to my fiancé. It felt inconsiderate as I have dealt with unequal pay to my subordinates, racial discrimination in a predominantly white geographical location, and have 100% Hispanic relatives who have had it even worse, including my own mom. Fiancé pretty much agreed with his brother and thinks I’m overreacting. I feel this incident was indicative of the guys character and I don’t want to be around him to be honest. Am I overreacting or am I just totally out of line? 

I don’t want to interfere in their relationship and was planning to drop it until today my fiancé sent me an article about how white men are speaking up about discrimination against them in the workplace.

I owe my life to her I feel, and I always let her know how much I appreciate her help.

My mom is a good equalizer and great with numbers so I call her to see if I’m tweaking, or see if it really is what it’s supposed to be. I explain the situation and immediately she’s not listening to what I’m saying and just “mhm-ing” “uhuh-ing” and I told her I just emailed my boss like why is my tuition for my kid so high, she asked me about something for rent top up and asked if I applied for the program she sent me. I said “ yeah, but I’m not talking about rent right now, I’m talking about tuition for my daughter haha” she cuts me off and was like “OHH YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT TUITION NOT RENT“ I asked her with the 5 minutes I had been talking and mentioned my work ,and my daughter, and my boss etc had I not been clear? She told me not to get snappy with her and I got frustrated. I said “that wouldn’t have happened if you weren’t literally going out of your way to not listen to what I was saying?” “ oh my god OP it was a mistake I made that I caught” and I hung up on her. I hung up on her because I kind of felt like she was being insensitive. I literally just called her because I was asking for a break down of numbers and I needed to vent about the day I’ve had. If she needed to talk to me I’d at least act like I was involved in the conversation totally not disregarding what she said. She’s my only support circle at the moment because she’s all the family I have here but I have no intentions of reaching out right now because I just feel so high strung. I don’t mean to be disrespectful or anything but this sort of thing happens a lot and it’s one of my biggest pet peeves, because I would never let someone talk forever and at the end be like “ oh yeah I wasn’t listening by the way, here’s a suggestion for something completely unrelated in what you were talking about.”

I was at a bar with a few friends and Brad celebrating an event. All good so far. I was probably on my 4th drink that night but still aware of what was going on around me (who I was with, what drinks were being ordered etc.). Anyway, it's Brad's turn to order the round of drinks and he refers to one of our friends (who had gone to the toilet) as a r-t-rd while he was gone. In the past, Brad had used language that I had previously found inappropriate and I had kept my mouth shut. However, this time, something in me might have triggered, I was not ok with this word being used, regardless of the context and I replied politely saying that he should not be using this language as it is inappropriate and in 2022 context (I know people unfortunately used this word in the 2000s when it may have been ok unfortunately back then), is not acceptable nowadays. His response was that I was ""talking woke sh-t"" and I should ""chill out"". I didn't and kept arguing.

I tried to explain that in present day the r- word is offensive and is as considered bullying and discriminative but he refused to apologise or change his chance and kept saying the word aloud, almost shouting it protesting his stance on me being ""soft"". I tried to play devil's advocate (which I shouldn't, I apologise) explaining if he used the word in private it was a different story but he should never use that word in public (or at all I fully should've said this, I'm sorry I should've held my stance) but he was on the defensive it was ok to use this language. The person who he was referring to, who I could tell was uncomfortable but agreed with him (much to my dismay and honestly disappointment) agreed with him so I was going to let it go.

Oh, and then he said it was some demonstration of ""white prejudice"" I was displaying by saying this language was offensive (I'm half-half descent). By then, I had enough, told Brad ""it was digustinh all he said"" and no matter his justification what he said ""was offensive no matter what"" and walk out. heading home.

I was cleaning the property a few days ago which resulted in me going in and out of the communal stair quit a lot.

A few days ago, when I was about to open the stair door. I heard “you stole my pizza” echo through the stair. Loud and not a private conversation. 

This was when I noticed another neighbour was in the garden with her dog and just started walking up the stairs. She had no food in her arms so guessed the comments where directing it at her as she was in their line of sight. She looked unfazed, like it happens a lot and continued to walk up the stairs. 

So it seemed that top floor flat ordered food but their buzzer is broken.

I was outside when the same neighbour greeted a pizza delivery guy at the main entrance. He asked if she ordered the pizza and she said no. Asked what flat he was looking for and said the instruction say to ring all the other neighbours to open the door.

She said that is rude and let him in so he did not continue to hit all the buzzers.

So these entitled tenants are telling delivery person to ring the other neighbours instead of saying call me and I’ll come get the food. The entitlement angered me.

There are people in the stair that work different working patterns, studying, etc. so they can’t walk down three flights of stairs.

So I asked my previous tenant, let’s call her M if she experienced any problems. She said not really but commented on the entry system not having a silence button as her buzzer would go off and she wasn’t expecting anything or anyone and sometimes the partying got to her. Her buzzer in the last couple of weeks was going off till 3/4am. People heading up the stairs.

So I reached out to another owner, let call her N. N was the neighbour I saw walking up the stairs. I asked if she has experienced her buzzer going off at all times of the day. N said she switched her handset for a option to silence the buzzer. This is not stress her dog out and family members. N also commented that someone damaged the door and refused to repair it.

I contacted the letting agency out of my own record after a few days of failure. I reached out to neighbours and someone passed me contact details. They emailed back straight away saying they will sort it out. 

Well I was sitting in the flat after another long day cleaning and heard the same entitled tenants where taunting outside N door saying she was a bitch and was going to sue her. And I am not 100% sure but something about cooking smell. Please note N is asian.

It was only my two sisters and I (my other sister 23 F, I’ll call her “Lee”). We were having normal conversation, and the topic was something about how we have “problems”. Basically our daily mental struggles. I said, “well, hopefully when I see the physiatrist, I can figure out what the problem is”. Completely unprovoked, Vic said, “there’s probably nothing going on, you just want there to be something wrong with you” and there was a bit more comments but I don’t exactly remember what they were because I was taken aback.By now, I shouldn’t have, because she’s done this kind of thing before. We’re having normal conversation and then she just says something rude for no reason. A little bit after, I said, “what’s your problem with me?” In reference to the fact that she’d done this before. I’ve also asked her that before, but she never says what her problem with me is. 
        It was kind of a lukewarm argument, since I kept thinking about a quip I could’ve said to her in response to her first comment. Later, when we’d finished our dinner, I went, “I figured out a quip to say in response” and then Lee got upset with me and said that I “always have to keep it going” and I tried to explain that’s not what I was doing, I genuinely thought it was a good quip, &amp; I was trying to make light on my sister sudden outburst, so I said it in a funny way. I never even got to say it, because by then they’d stopped listening to me, and Vic went to her room. Later, my mom asked what happened, and I explained what Vic said. Lee said that Vic behavior toward me is in response to our parents being too lax with me and my brother (we’re the youngest). My mom basically told Lee that Vic and her were not my parents, and that they acted the same way when they were 17, and Lee cut in, denying that they acted the same that I do. My mom said that the reason that my sisters feel that me and my brother are “unruly” is because normal adults their age are usually out of their parents house, so they feel cramped living with two teenagers. I stayed silent through this, because if I had said anything, I knew Lee would feel like we were ganging up on her. My mom are sure to tell my sister that she isn’t saying it because she wants her to leave, but because she forgets that I’m only 17 and they’re full adults. After my mom was done, I explained Vic’s behavior and why it was shocking to me, and I told Lee that whenever I come to her to tell her about an argument that Vic and I had, she always jumps to defend her like her life depends on it. Lee got upset and said, “so I’m the bad guy, huh?”&amp; left.So I’m thinking that maybe if I just hadn’t spoken to Vic at all than this whole thing would’ve never happened.

My mom never attempted to contact her sperm donor and instead raised me herself. Only last year did I track my dad down using AncestoryDNA. So, I'm trying to view his life decisions as objectively as possible.

I met my dad for the first time EVER last year. It did not go well. I also discovered that his personal life is kind of a mess. He is divorced from his first wife (48F), with whom he has 3 children, 2 of whom he is paying child support for. He also squandered his ex-wife's inheritance while having affairs.

Last week, my dad called again. He told me that he is getting remarried to a 25-year-old Asian woman that he impregnated. Her parents are demanding proof that he can provide for her, but he's flat broke and owes $15K in child support/alimony.

My dad asks if he can borrow a few thousand dollars to ""save his face until the wedding"" (his words). I say I'd *love* to help, but I'm barely solvent: I owe $100K in student loans, I earn barely $40K per year due to my ""useless"" liberal arts degree (his words), my rent is being jacked up, I need to help pay my mom's medical bills, etc . . . 

. . . but actually, I have $0 in student loans because I attended college on a scholarship and worked to pay off the rest; I earn six figures a year as a freelance copywriter and author; I just bought the condo I'm living in; and my mom is perfectly healthy.

I (20sF) have Been married to my wife (20sF) for over 3 years now. We moved out of state from my mom a few months after getting married for work reasons. 

My wife doesn’t like my mom because she is super overbearing. She still treats me like a kid. Things came to ahead a while ago when she chose not to cancel insurance on me when we had asked her to. My wife ended up texting her very firmly what we wanted and ended her text with “thank you for your concern.” My mom thought this was rude and she then brought up everything else that we had told her off for and said “I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around you.” I tried to explain that we weren’t attacking her we just need her to not question everything we do. 

Currently, my wife is pregnant. She told me she wasn’t comfortable with my mom being at the birth. So, I told my mom she could come 4 months after the birth because that’s when I could get time off to spend with her and the baby. My mom didn’t like this but seemed to accept my explanations. 

Recently, my mom threw a virtual shower for us. It was kinda awkward, and towards the end my mom asked my wife to show her belly. I’ve told my mom before that my wife doesn’t like to be in pictures and when my mom has asked for pictures of her belly before we just told her it made my wife uncomfortable to do so. My wife had to tell her no three times before she stopped. 

I texted my mom the next day saying thanks for the shower but that wasn’t cool of you to ask that much. My mom just didn’t respond. So a few weeks later I sent another text saying I was frustrated with her for not responding and felt like she didn’t care about our boundaries, and then she finally responded and said that she’s frustrated too and hurt by it. 

She then emailed me a list of every time she felt hurt by us. Bringing up things I thought we had resolved before. She also said she was disappointed that she can’t be at the birth and jealous that my in laws would meet the baby before her. I explained all those times were because she crossed a boundary and we were just trying to communicate that to her. 

My mom responded and asked how I could be so mean, and that she has apologized and taken the high horse through all this. She said “maybe I’m just a bad person.” 

I told her she was being emotionally manipulative by saying all this. She hasn’t even fully apologized and by her saying she’s taking the high horse implies she hasn’t done anything wrong. I explained that all I really wanted was a genuine apology for what happened at the shower, but it didn’t seem like I was getting one.
I told her I was done talking to her for now, and am thinking about cutting contact.

Right now, we are doing long distance and can only visit each other once a month at most. This time, when I went to visit him, he was sending me pictures from his phone (that we had taken while going out) and I saw his text with his friend who he used to have a crush on. I was surprised because they haven't talked in 4 years and asked him what it was about. A little context about this friend: they used to live in the same state and studied in the same high school. Later, he moved away for university and stopped talking to her. So, when I asked him, he said it was because he will be going home for holidays and reached out to her to see if they could meet.  Now, I trust him completely and I know that he is not someone who hides things intentionally. But I was hurt because I had asked him multiple times about his plans for when he visits his home. I had asked if he would be meeting his friends because I was excited for him to go back after years. And he had never mentioned about meeting her or any of his friends for that matter. Since we are long distance, I felt a bit betrayed because we don't get to share our daily experiences anyways, and the only way to keep each other updated is to share these things. 

When I expressed this to him, he said he didn't think it was a big thing to share. I know that even if he had gone to meet her, he would not have done anything out of line but I share every little detail with him because I want him to know what's going on in my life. He said that he would've let me know if they were going to meet but they have not yet decided if they will have time to meet each other.

For some context, I'm currently living with my grandparents, helping them around the house and whatnot. As they're settling and have decided they're going to retire in their current home, they have slowly been remodeling here and there, with my assistance. I have no problem helping them, and even enjoy doing so, as I love and care for them and appreciate everything they've done for me.

Recently, they have decided they want to start their own herb and veggie garden. I offered my help and they said they'd let me know when they'd need me. I think this would be great for my grandma especially, as she definitely needs something to keep her busy instead of laying in bed, so I'm very glad to be there to help her.

Fast forward to today, which is the day before my birthday, and my grandma says she has an early birthday present for me. She wants to take me with her to a plant depot to pick out a couple herbs and veggies, and some soil for her starter garden. I thanked her of course, and went along, happy to get her out of the house. And I know this garden will benefit us all when it comes to me trying to cook fresh and healthy dinners for them. But deep down I was just kind of sad that she said this was a gift for me. I didn't expect any gifts from her period. And I do believe it's the thought that counts. But am I wrong to feel like this was more for her, than for me? I dunno. 

A bonus moment today while out with her: 
(Context: I make dinners 5 nights a week and work fri-sunday nights) she got mad at me as I was unable to finish the dishes last night after dinner. I was beat last night in all honesty, the dishwasher was running already and the sink still had more dishes in there. I left a note saying I'd get to them today (which I did).

M: I’m not abusing them. They were fighting over a toy and I took it away because they refuse to share. If anyone is being abusive it’s you for false accusations and emotional abuse.
F: You don’t know what you’re taking about I don’t abuse anyone.
M: You just stated that you were going to try and get the girls taken away from me because I am parenting my children that is abuse. You always lie about everything and you’re so disrespectful just stop.
F: I’m not disrespectful you just need to be grateful for everything I do.
M: You mean how I confronted you as a minor about stealing hundreds of dollars and then stating that the money was used on utilities so I did end up using it since I use the water, and electricity.

My sister and I have a cat and mouse dynamic, we would constantly get into argument. To me, she is always rude and inconsiderate, not only to me but to my mom as well. Anyways, I came home recently for a week of mid semester break and honestly I missed having my bedroom and being alone (after months living in student dorm). Prior to landing, i ran into some minor issues at the airport and wasn’t having a great day at all. So I was already kinda exhausted, annoyed and craved for some alone time and of course, some rest. I ended up sleeping late at night due to browsing through social media for some reason which honestly makes me feel tired.

The following morning, my sister was preparing for work. It was 6am in the morning. I was half asleep when i heard she started playing music off her phone speaker which woke me up. Initially, I didnt mind the noise and was just waiting for her to finally get out of the house. Then she came into my room and started to look for her things (she moved into my bedroom when I was away) and made a bit of noise as well. I looked at her and didnt say anything but she could see that I was annoyed. I hoped that she would’ve get the hint and make less noise in general. 

But nope, she was still creating so much noise along with her hairdryer (i know she cant help this one). I was so drowsy and couldnt even get up so I just hope it wont take too long and I could get back to sleep. After a moment, she came back into my room to look for her other stuff and started searching through my desk and made noise again. I looked at her once more and in her annoyed tone, she said “what? Just go back to sleep. I was just searching for my stuff” to which i asked her “can you atleast be a little quieter in the morning? I really need my sleep. And you dont have to create so much noise when scouring my desk”. She got really defensive when I told her that. “Its plastic! I cant help the noise!” She responded angrily. After some words exchanged, she stormed out of the room by slamming the door really loudly which infuriated me.

So I got up, pushed her and took her phone, then threw it outside. And then went back to my room. Which started a fight between us. My mom was there to calm things down cause yeah it was that bad. After both of them left the house, I took the time to calm myself and now I feel bad. I know I shouldn’t have reacted that way but I really could not help myself. Im planning to have an honest talk with her after both of us calmed down. I guess both of us is kinda in the wrong here but what do you think?

I’ve been engaged for 2 years, our wedding kept getting postponed over the past few years for obvious reasons. 

My fiancé has not been actively wedding planning with me, but one thing he kept insisting he would do was sort out the hotel for our wedding night. He kept reassuring me it would be done, and he kept bringing up the name of a fairly posh, well-known one. I never asked or expected this, but it was a pleasant feeling to be considered like this. Now, it’s a week until the wedding, and my fiancé goes to me, nonchalantly “I booked the hotel by the way. It’s not the one I had been saying as they had no availability but it’s one that is just as good”. 

I wasn’t really surprised at this, considering the cost of the hotel and the last minute-ness of it. But then I asked him which one he had booked in place, and he told me his parents had booked it for him, as they ‘had contacts’. I looked up the one they had booked, and it had mediocre reviews and was on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

Out of curiosity, I looked availability for the one he had initially said he was going to book-they had plenty of rooms available for our date. But it was very expensive and I told him if we could not afford that, then I would have understood. But I was upset that he had made another excuse, and that he did not even discuss the hotel situation by me before delegating it to his parents, who have no idea what I would want/need. He completely neglected to tell me as if I was an afterthought. I did not need anything fancy or expensive, but I had hoped to look and book a decent hotel together with my fiancé as a mutual decision as it would be us who stays in the hotel and not his parents.

I told him politely I was not comfortable with the way the hotel was booked, that I was not asked and nothing was discussed with me and that I would prefer us to choose one ourselves, and asked if the hotel could be changed. He then got angry at me, saying his parents had called in favours to get us this hotel booking, and that I should be more understanding to his situation and that I was being controlling and unreasonable. 

I asked him if he had booked the hotel himself, would he change it to make me happy - to which he agreed that he would straight away. This essentially confirmed that his parents had done all the legwork and he was just given orders to make me agree by force or manipulation, which I was not willing to do. I said to him that I would not be staying in that hotel and that his parents and him had made a big mistake by not running their decision by me before booking it, and that the responsibility was on him to fix his mistake. This ended up escalating the argument and he admitted that his parents think lowly of me and that asking to change the hotel would stoop their image of me even lower, so he was not willing to even bring up changing the hotel to his parents.
