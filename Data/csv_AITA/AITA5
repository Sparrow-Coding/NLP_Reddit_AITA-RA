In my program is Ella and Lucas. Ella brought Amelia into our group during year 3/4. They quickly hit it off and Amelia was asked to be in Ella's bridal party. Side note: Amelia did not indicate to have any other strong friendships in the area.

Amelia confided that living with her parents was not going well, so I offered by spare bed. In less than 24 hrs, I had a roommate I had only known for months. Things were fine, though any time I left I felt was guilted for leaving. I'd return to an empty apartment and find Amelia was with Lucas. Both Amelia and Lucas told me they would never date and each cited their own reasons. I had no reason to question them, though other friends and classmates consistently asked me if they were dating. I always stuck up for them.

Fast forward, I move into a house with Lucas, Amelia, and another roommate. I still clearly did not see the warning signs. One month in, while going on vacation, Amelia says to not worry about what bed she was staying in since she and Lucas were together. I thought it was a joke, only to be confirmed by Ella upon arrival. She said she had known for a while and was asked to keep it from my other roommate and myself. Turns out, their first kiss happened months ago while Amelia was still living in my spare. 

I felt my trust had been betrayed and I had been disrespected as a roommate. Once home, I had very minimal interaction with Lucas and Amelia. Finally, Amelia sassily said ""are you just going to ignore me the rest of our lease?"" I explained my hurt, but the conversation went south. She said she would have known \[about the relationship\] sooner had I not always been around. 

3 mo later, and Amelia still hasn't talked to Ella and no apologies were made. I suggested a convo with all the girls so I could set boundaries while home, and everyone else could try to mend bridges. I'm open to small talk in group settings, but while at home I want to exist without the pressure of conversation. That idea was shut down by Ella. Not my best move, but I kindly tried to explain that it was a red flag to have an absent friend surrounded by drama in their bridal party, so Ella should really try to talk to Amelia or consider removing all of this tension from her day. That was not taken well. 

While I was out of town, Ella decided to meet with Amelia. After returning, Ella asked if I'd be able to control myself at her bachelorette. I tried to explain where my opinion lies on friendship with Amelia, but suddenly Ella no longer understands why I'm still upset and wants me to forgive and forget. I feel stuck in my lease and would've never chosen to live with a couple had I read into the warning signs. To this day, Amelia tries to antagonize me by saying hello in a snarky tone when I don't greet her.

Yes I'm aware of the age gap, all I'll say is that we really do believe age is just a number and our 25 year relationship speaks for itself.

About a year after we started dating Tina got pregnant. This was a surprise to both of us. I didn't feel ready to become a dad young and Tina was still going through her divorce, so she didn't feel it was a good situation to bring a baby into. After much discussion we decided to put the baby up for adoption, and thankfully found a great, secure couple looking to adopt.

We didn't end up having any other kids of our own, but Tina has 2 daughters ""Lisa"" (36F) and ""Amy"" (33F). We had a rough start but it's been years and get along very well now. Amy's getting married very soon.

A couple of years ago we got in contact with ""Liz"" (23F), my bio daughter, and she's doing well for herself. Liz sort of hated us at first, so I let it be and didn't push her. She's more open with the idea of knowing her bio parents now.

Liz got offered a position in an interning program, and holding a small lunch to celebrate. She called asking if me and Tina would like to attend. 

The issue is this is the same day as Amy's wedding. I explained that we wouldn't be able to attend because of this, Liz pushed and asked for the ceremony time. She said we could make it to her lunch and just leave early to get to the wedding, but she'd like it if we came.

This doesn't work at all because, again, Amy's wedding and we have to be there earlier than regular guests. Amy would be upset if we weren't there as well, so I told Liz it's just not possible.

Liz got angry and said she never should've bothered asking us in the first place, and cut the call. 

Lisa and Amy know what happened and they think we're in the right - again the wedding was planned first, and Liz's event is just a lunch, nowhere near as large scale as a wedding.

Both Tina and I sent a message to Liz after but she didn't reply to either, so she's clearly angry/upset.

 AITA for destroying my parents marriage?

I live with my parents and 7 yr old brother. We moved when I was around in 3rd grade due to the fact that cost of living was getting way to expensive in our old town. Before we moved, we all got along very well. A very average suburban family with little to no fights and two siblings that got along well. 

This all drastically changed when we moved though. My parents started fighting more. It was over stupid things like the color of the new car (that was GIFTED to us by my mothers dad), but they were fighting nonetheless. I have to assume that they fought before this, but they never ever did it in front of my brother and I. What neither of them knew was a year before that I had found very solid evidence of my father cheating. At first it was just scandalous pictures of some girl but it devolved into selfies of him and that girl. All of these photos were taken in hours he should have been at work. 

My 9 year old self decided it would be better not to mention this because I didn’t want them to separate. I don’t know when I decided to tell my mom about the photos, but when I did it all went to hell. In the end, my father was kicked out. My 9 year old self was used as some sort of outlet for his emotions via our daily FaceTime. He cried to me telling me about all the bad things my mom did. 

He tried to show me evidence of HER cheating however they were very easily disproven by a simple look at some floor plans (my mom works in a hotel restaurant with several floors, he thought because she was in the hotel building section that has storage on the bottom floor with one of her male colleagues she was automatically cheating).

After he was kicked, he was sent to some sort of recovery center for half a year and then he came back with little to no incident. After a few months back, he became insanely off and has been that was to this day several years later. When he’s not being insanely cold or acting mock nice, he’s yelling.

Here’s the part we’re I am not sure I am the problem. Recently, I have been yelling back. I will admit that a lot of the things I say are far from nice but I just cannot take called useless, a brat, selfish, etc over the stupidest of things. 

Groan a little when he asks me to take out the trash? I’m a selfish, worthless, brat of a human being who deserves nothing. I pick up my brother and take him out of my room because he barged in? I’m and entitled abuser who shouldn’t have even been born. (My brother is a whole other story though)

I know I yell back, but this feels like a bit much. On the other hand I did partially ruin this mans marriage by rating him out.

I told my parents and sister during family dinner and my sister immediately started crying and cussing me out. Her 5 year old has Down Syndrome. She told me she no longer wanted me carrying for her daughter and that she didn’t trust me anymore because I “hate” people with DS.

I told her while I empathize for her situation, I couldn’t bring a child into the world who wasn’t able to care for themselves appropriately. I also will be working 12 hr shifts at the hospital— I simply did not want to deal with a child needing SO much extra attention.

As Covid canceled our 2020 trip, she had the girls in 2019 and 2021, as well as in 2022 due to a school schedule change. 

I decided to celebrate by renting a condo down in Florida from Sat-Sat with the girls. The only options for a flight with a reasonable duration are at 7 AM, just before noon and at 2:30 PM. I went with the noon flight bc it was $62 cheaper per person than the 2:30 PM flight. I am on a solo income so the almost $250 difference would be a large chunk of my paycheck. However, to get to the airport on time, I would have to pick the girls up 45 minutes early. 

The returning flight gets back at 4 in the afternoon. I offered her either to drop the girls off to her on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning, and coming back at the same time the next week so she could get a full week in, and I would have slightly less time with the girls to get back to normal schedule. 

She got pissy about my idea and wanted them to be picked up at 10 and dropped back off at 10 a week later.

Her name is Hana. I have been forced to look after Hana every now and then, and she's basically just a spoiled brat who spends most of her time crying and whining. She is colourblind and can't see the colour green, so sometimes when she really pisses me off, I pull up a picture of a cauliflower or a broccoli on my phone and make her guess what it is. If she answers incorrectly, then I would lock her in her bedroom until I'm done babysitting for the night. And sometimes, when she gets really upset, she starts speaking in her native Korean, so I would tease her by yelling ""blah blah blah"" at her. After all, Korean is basically gibberish to me. Keep in mind that I am dealing with my own trauma these days, and it's no wonder that I'm always in a bad mood.

Hana must have told someone about all this, because my entire family, as well as my brother's girlfriend and her family, are pissed off at me. My father spent hours one night just yelling at me nonstop, and I am no longer allowed at some family gatherings. My brother told me that if I kept my behaviour up around Hana, then I would no longer be his brother. It's as if I've been disowned, and it stings.

Background: My mother has controlled my life since my father's divorce. My mother had me cope after she lost her children during her separation from her first husband (my two siblings, one disowned). Later my mother would downplay my feelings. Eventually, she put me through therapy for the upcoming divorce of my father. She would tell me that I was lying about everything I've said about her, but how was saying my mom stressing me out a lie, the names she would call me, or the countless fights? She constantly surveys me on the phone, tracking my every movement, even when living with her cameras inside the home. She claimed the tracking was for safety reasons. While away at university, she constantly tracks my move. I always felt like a burden child to her. 

Because of that burden, I feel awful. I feel horrible she has a depressed daughter. So I've been avoiding my family to decrease the pain. And now my stepfather is dying; I'm afraid of my mother's grief. What will it look like? Will she want me in her life more?

He is a fantastic person and has so much life to live.  
At one point I did like his fiancée and I was really excited when I found out they were going to get engaged. I was apprehensive because they are quite young (still in college) but she seemed like such a down to earth sweet heart and nothing like some of the other girls that go to that school (materialistic). She is also going to school to be a lawyer and I thought very highly of her. 
As soon as they got engaged, she flipped the script.  And this wedding is costing a lot of people a pretty penny.  
Parents from all sides are donating towards the wedding but they are still spending a lot of money and I feel like it is very irresponsible.  
She also started trying to control him as soon as they got engaged and she seems proud to do it in front of his family.  So much that she told him not to pursue an important license because she had a different career path in mind for him. 
They also want different things.  He wants to travel the world, she wants to stay close to her family. And I think both of those are perfectly valid dreams for both of them to have but I also think they are too young to be sacrificing their dreams.  It’s heart breaking.  
He’s not perfect either and can unwittingly be inconsiderate of her needs as well. 
The wedding is frustrating me and a lot of other relatives because we have to wear expensive outfits.  Women have to wear dresses and heals and are given very specific criteria.  I feel like we should have options to wear pantsuits if we want.  
I don’t think it would bother me so much if I felt she were more genuine but I have had multiple encounters with her now where it is apparent even to my son that money is very important to her and she has asked us for it at very inappropriate times. 
I also don’t want to see him make the same mistake his dad made by marrying someone too young and not having the emotional tools to work it out.  Divorce can cost more than the wedding.  
Also my husbands ex-in-laws are toxic and have picked fights with him at various functions and I don’t want to have to deal with that at the wedding.  
Even though I have a bad gut feeling about their relationship, I feel I need to be at the wedding to support my husband and my step-son but I also feel like it’s hypocritical.  If I go I am being a hypocrite, if I don’t go I am making a statement and I will be upsetting a lot of other relatives.

I (22f) and my husband (24m) got married at the court house a little over a year ago, right after our son was born. The more time passes the more I really really regret that. We didn't even actually tell anyone expect immediate family.
My husband recently got a new job and it's a complete 180 for us and we can afford to not just have one, and not ask for help paying. I am so excited. My husband is...also excited but more fo. He wants it but would be just as happy if we didn't have one so it is mostly for me. 
The original plan was to do it this tax season, marchish 2023, and just have a smaller budget. 

I have 2 bridesmaids. My maid of honor, my best friend and my husband's sister. My husband's sister and I aren't close but close enough that its nice to have her in it. 
3 days ago my best friend got a positive pregnancy test. She hasn't been fully checked but she's due sometime in July, maybe it was just me but by 5/6 months pregnant I was miserable and 100% wouldn't have wanted to be in a wedding. [It's not majorly important for the story but she has been trying for a baby for over a year. She had just set up an appointment with a fertility Dr so this is huge for her] 
I want to change the wedding to march of 24 instead of 23. It would give my friend plenty of time for her to have her baby and recover and even have baby be a part of the wedding. Plus then we could save even more money and I could get a fancier venue I live really close to the Stanly Hotel [from The Shining] and I would LOOOVE to have the wedding there. It's just so far out of the budget. 
My husband is 100% on board. Like i said before its more for me then him, but his close family is so mad. They are telling me it's not fair to change it when they are so excited, and they had it planed for this year. 
No one has to travel to get to us and no one has even bought gifts or put any money into it. The only thing they did was mark a day on their calendar. I don't understand why it's such a big deal. It's my wedding, that we are doing 100% on our own and we should be able to push it back a year if we want without having them make us feel bad. But they will not let up.

She made a Facebook post where she tagged my husband, his siblings, their spouses and my husbands ex wife. She did not include me in said post which normally wouldn’t bother me at all except for the fact that she tagged my husbands ex wife which hurt a lot because of how she treated my stepchildren and her trying to physically attack me in front of all of the children during one of her manic episodes. I told my husband about this and he stated that he would talk to her and see what her problem is. I decided the next day that it would probably be better if I sent her a text and asked if we could talk (I had other things to talk to her about and thought I would casually bring up the post). Well my sil knew that I was upset and took it among herself to try to talk to my mil about how I was feeling (which was the worst thing she could have done). With this being said, my mil ignored my text. I, not knowing this information at the time, text my mil the next day stating that I was checking back in to see when we could talk. I then get told that we can talk but if I plan to talk about any of the “Facebook crap” then she thought that was the stupidest thing she’s ever heard of and she wouldn’t have any part of it.

I did not respond, I just blocked her and my husband, who is pretty upset at his mom, stated that he would talk to her after she cooled off a little.

A few days ago I (F20) was talking with my partner(M25) and I mentioned during a random conversation that I took a pregnancy test a few weeks ago and he seemed upset.

I have PCOS and a symptom of it is irregular periods in the span of a year I barely get my period at all. On the so called night I was feeling very nauseous and figured I’d take a pregnancy test just to rule the possibility of pregnancy out. I always keep a test in my room just in case as I never get my period, hence I don’t have that reassurance that a person would normally get in a month. It came out negative and didn’t think much of it.

My partner got frustrated and told me that I should’ve told him when I took it because it concerns him too. He sees it as a big deal and couldn’t get over the fact I didn’t let him know. I told him if it was positive I would’ve let him know, butI just took it as reassurance since my body doesn’t operate “normally”. He’s a serial overthinker and told
me he feels that since I hadn’t told him this what else am I hiding. He says I keep too much to myself which I don’t disagree, but it’s never with “big” information. It’s something we had talked about before and since then I started to improve and let him know more about my days, but I feel as though you don’t need to share everything with each other. Anywho, he told me he would support me no matter what I would decided to do if it was positive, but he was very expressive in the fact that this also concerned him too which I understand.

She's extremely creative and has a unique style that i find charming. I'm more of a simple man. 
Now, i've lived in my own places before as an adult, and my wife lived with her mom so that's something my wife hasn't experienced until she married me. So i knee we'd disagree just based on her vision of ""her"" first place clashing with the fact she's married and we are a team and when we first got our own place she would show me her ideas on pinterest and none of them looked like a man lived in them. I don't blame her for wanting to feel good and comfortable about our space but i just would like to feel as apart of the home as she does. 

I've felt as though (especially in our last place) all the designs and set up of our place were her ideas of what our place should be and i never really had a say. Even when i gave my thoughts on what i felt would look good, i always got told ""no i don't like that"" or some equivalent that left me feeling unheard and unimportant. Sometimes even strolling through a Target i would point out that ""i really think that looks good"" and still receive unsolicited criticism of my taste. I work a lot due to being in the military so i chalked it up to ""she's here more than me so just let her have it"" but i was never satisfied with that conclusion. I should at least feel like i live here too!! 

About a month ago, after 2 years of riding in the backseat of our home decor, i brought up how i've felt and she started to get a bit upset and defensive before she assured me that for our new place i'd have a lot more contributions and more of a say in what furniture/design and layout our new place had.

Sunday, after we moved into our new condo I thought it'd be nice to unpack, organize, and set things up how i'd like them while she was at brunch. Her things, my things, our things. When she got back she thanked me and that was it. I had work the mon-tues for a total of 36 hours and so i wasn't home until tuesday evening. When i get home i see everything that i spent time working on setting up or organizing was completely changed and done ""her way"". I left it alone until i had decompressed from the day before i brought up how i didn't appreciate the lack commitment to her reassurance a month prior. She says she thought there was a better way to set things up and sees no problem.

I met this guy and things were going really well for about a month or two. That was until he told me… there’s another girl having his supposed kid. This girl, which he was never serious with, was 3 months pregnant already when she decided to tell him. Meaning she was before me, he wasn’t seeing both of us at the same time. Now, this was his “supposed kid,” we didn’t know for sure if it was his or not. The girl didn’t want to get a DNA test done while pregnant and made him wait until she gave birth. I stood with this guy without knowing if it was actually his kid, but it was a possibility and when she finally did have it and took the test..It was a match. My boyfriend is the father of a kid that’s not mine. During the beginning of the relationship and him finding out he could be the father, he would continually say he doesn’t want the kid. Fast forward, we are talking 8-9 months into the relationship. He knows he’s the father now. He decides to tell me he wants to be involved in the kids life. Mind you, he said he never wanted the kid and wished it was aborted.. Oh… did I forget to mention *plot twist* when he told me that he had gotten another girl pregnant.. I soon came out pregnant a few days after. BUT I was smart enough to get the abortion. Anyways, with me not having our kid and getting it aborted and then finding out later he actually has a child with the girl, I feel angry. Angry because I have to deal with him being in the kids life he said he never wanted. I had to get rid of mine (this was totally my decision. He said I could do what I want) because I didn’t want to bring in another kid under all these crazy circumstances that ended up being true. I don’t know how to deal with him having a kid that’s not mine but he wants to now be involved and take care of it when he told me he never wanted it in the first place. I don’t want him to have any involvement. I never thought he would since he’s always said he didn’t want it and he never expressed to me in all the months leading up that he would possibly want to be involved. I never would’ve continued the relationship if he would have told me he DID want to be involved. Now 10 months into the relationship all we do is argue about the kid because I can’t accept it. I have so much built up resentment and anger towards the situation. I’m just supposed to watch him raise a kid that’s not ours, after I got rid of mine, when all he would tell me was he doesn’t want that girls kid to begin with? Am I wrong for feeling the way I do?

I'm 16 and I go to a university that offers foundation studies since I skipped my year 11 and 12. I'm the eldest among all of my 6 step-siblings. My mom is remarried and is a pastor and I live with her husband who is my step-dad.

My mom wanted me to remove my phone password so she can access everything and I didn't want to. 
The first part of the argument is in my profile. 

I fought with her this morning, and I changed my phone settings. Instead of removing my password completely. I used a smartlock so that my phone will be unlocked whenever I'm at home. I hid my games among the apps I don't use and have it locked. 

She went through my phone and found nothing but still kept screaming and getting mad about other things. She said that as long as I'm under her roof, I'd have to follow everything she says and I know that very well as I hate confronting her about her ways. 

She asked me to be her guest and leave if I wanna do something for myself. The thing is I have followed every single thing she asks of me, why can't I have the tiniest thing that keeps me happy. 

I have lots of little things I like to do to take my stress off of things. I like to draw and paint, she says I'm wasting my time and If it is not school or educational I should just stop. I like to read novels and comics, and she would go ""why don't you just read your books instead of that"" 

I don't even hang out with my friends or go out, I don't talk back to her, I try to do all my chores even if I don't have time. She thinks all the other kids my age are bad influences. I don't vape, show off skin, date, or even put on makeup. I go to church with her be the  perfect child who everyone likes. 

I'm tired, I truly am. My mental health isn't well and I really want to take time for myself otherwise I'll be a proccess all over again, getting hurt, thinking I'll be fine, forgetting about it, then getting hurt again, having a mental breakdown. I want to grow up quickly and leave. Even though life is hard and I know that well. I think I need to get some help.

Well me and Lisa got into an argument after I mentioned that I didn’t want her to be drinking on my birthday as I wanted it to be with me, my mum, my stepdad and my older brother ( 21 M). We went backwards and forward about this issue and due to my autism and the anger at that moment I called her a retard. Lisa went to complain to my stepdad me and we were downstairs talking about what happened. I do think me and my stepdad have a good relationship as he doesn’t do much with me and I think he only loves my other sisters due to Lisa looking after my other sister and that non verbal sister is his own. i h gotten very very emotional about it as I feel like I never had my stepdad or my mother to love me as much and I just sta to cry and scream at him for not understanding how much I cared about not having her drinking on my upcoming birthday. My stepdad only told me that it was his and my mums decision on the matter. I just cried and fell asleep after my stepdad told me that he would talk to Lisa as well. I woken up and Lisa didn’t apologise for her actions which make me think that my stepdad didn’t care. 

  
I vented about it to my online friends who say that my stepdad was an asshole for not accepting my request.

Recently my dad has been acting different. He's been closing his home office door, and I thought I saw an active call on his phone I didn't recognize when I walked in. 

I wanted to find out who/what it was so I took his phone while he was sleeping. I found a long message history in a hidden message app. Several messages saying ""I love you"" going back several months or more. 

I called my cousin (20F), she came over. This was like 3 in the morning, and I called my sister (24F) who also came over. We took screen shots to show my mom when she got home (worked overnight). Woke my dad up and told him ""I know what you did"". My cousin called her mom(my mom's sister) and told her, her mom called my grandma. My aunt called my mom and told her. My dad gathered a few things and left. It's been 9 days. They've already filed for divorce. 

My mom, aunt and uncle have been stalking the girl he cheated with, sending screen shots of her profiles to my dad. My mom won't stop bad-mouthing my dad, and she's kept me at my brother's with her since this happened. 

Dad told me he was leaving anyway, just wasn't ready. His ""plan"" wasn't finished. He said he wanted to be in a better place financially, pay off some debt, take care of some lingering issues so it was less of a burden. He said that he was leaving early next year. I don't believe him. He also said that he really does love this other girl. 

My sister says she can't blame dad for cheating and wanting to leave, because of how mom is. She drinks a lot, spends too much money, and is never really nice. Plus, she doesn't like that my brothers wife is a different race. But I'm pissed, and no one is listening to me. Why are they not as mad at my dad as I am?!?

She listened to me but all of a sudden my mom called me, and said that I smoke weed, my mom was furious that I smoked ""in front of them"". When thats not even what I did, they invaded my home where I already smoke daily, and told me I cant smoke anymore while their here.

I can see how this sounds but there was a massive lead-up to me unadding her. We go to the same school (all girls I (F 16), her (F 13) ), anyways her and I became friends through mutual friends in her grade who I've known for longer. I added her on snap and we quickly became close friends, soon she felt like a little sister, and after a while, she started to trust me and she opened up to me about her past and her struggles. Soon after I realised she was a bit of a trauma dumper which at first I didn't mind because it was only a few things. She knew I was going through my own things and demons (still am but that's not the point), after a while I told her that I was sorry for not answering as quickly as she liked because I was focusing on my school work as I'm now in grade 12 and she went ""mhmm"" or ""k."" I was getting spammed by her constantly on both messages and snap- to the point I muted her on messages but never blocked her, I never have and I never will and because I wouldn't answer as quickly she would ask if I blocked her and I told her no since I didn't and she starts saying to me ""lies."" which annoyed me. This went on for months and after a bit, our mutual friends and my bf said ""she's being unfair to you stop talking or ask for space"" which I did so we gave each other space but she kept spamming me on snap to the point I would get in trouble with my teachers and parents for my phone going off so to stop that I unadded her. I didn't just unadd her because she was spamming but because she would constantly degrade me and call me a liar, a fake friend, tell me I don't care about her (I do care about her) and many other things that aren't true. There's been a couple of times when one of our friends has talked to her about me since my bf reached out and told her to, she made me cry so many nights in a row because of the degrading and her behaviour and our friend talked to her in general after I told her some things because she saw how it affected me.

&amp;#x200B;

She started spamming me on messages but I didn't answer because 1- we were giving each other space and 2- we would start arguing about me adding her back. The other night I was talking to her again and asked if we could sort things out in person and stuff and she kept coming back at me and saying ""add me back on snap"" and I kept saying no or ""give me some time to think about it"". She would say to me after a while a couple of times ""have you had ""time"" to think about adding me back yet"". I had loads of people telling me ""don't add her back just so she stops arguing with you"" but I had a few people say ""Just add her back"", I haven't added her back yet but Im gonna talk to her in person in a couple of days. What should I do and AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

Side note- She became super attached to me and copied my behaviour and how I dress e.g wore her school skirt the same length as me, always talking about me and even wore the exact same outfit as me to a youth group we go to.

She especially loves anime and MTG. But really she loves so many different things.  She is currently in law school and having a tough time.  So I buy her toys, or cards or whatever.  I just managed to get her Taylor Swift concert tickets despite the whole Ticketmaster thing.  

Her is the problem.  She is Asian and her parents have always hated anything that might evoke joy in her.  She didn't have stuffed animals, games, toys, anything at all growing up.  We met when she was 25 and we went to  Dave and Buster's.  I won her a little toy and she started crying. I thought I messed up.  She said that growing up she wasn't allowed to go to places left Ke that.   

Basically her life consisted of piano lessons, tutoring, school, and homework.  

When we got married her parents were not happy.  I'm not Asian, I'm older than her, I own my own company so it doesn't look like I work hard.  

But right in our vows I promised her that I would make it my goal for he to enjoy her life.  

On our honeymoon I surprised her with a box of Pokemon cards.  It was the funniest thing watching her parcel them out so she could have a few packs to open every day.  

So it was her birthday this weekend and we had everyone over to our home.  Unfortunately including her parents.  

They saw the Lego Hulkbuster in the den and called me childish for playing with toys.  Just then one of her classmates saw it and asked if it was the one I got my wife for her birthday.

And every single one of them is closely related to me by blood. With so few of us, it is a bit inevitable that when you search up one, you get search results about the others.

An un-fun fact I found when I searched up my mom to find out how long she worked at her current company (her coworker asked and they could only confirm how long she was in their department). On the first page of results was my uncle's GoodReads. He and I are friends on Facebook, so when I found it (under his FULL name, from full first to middle to last) I didn't think anything of checking it out.

Now, I get that people have different things they're into. And really as long as everyone is a consenting adult, then I figure it's not my business. However, most of the books on his Read list were incest smut. A lot were nonconsensual. All of them were ones I wouldn't want to know my uncle was reading. Why did I keep looking you might ask? Because apparently I wanted to suffer. And morbid curiosity. 

Anyway maybe I'm being a bit of a prude about this. But I don't love how easy it was to find. Or that it came up when searching my mom, not him. Meaning it probably comes up when you search for me, even if it isn't on the first page of results.

I have always been careful about what I post online. I never really thought to consider what my family posts online and how easily we are connected with a search. I mean, like I said maybe I'm being a prude about this, but I don't really want friends, employers, etc. searching me up and finding my uncle's kinks instead. These ones in particular.

So, I sent him a message on Facebook asking if he could use a shortened version of his last name (like he literally does on Facebook). And let him know how easily it came up and suggested that he may not want his coworkers to find those things either. And he got so mad at me. He said it wasn't any of my business. That I didn't have a right to tell him what to do. That if I was so concerned about it, I should just change my name. And that his ""followers"" would be confused if he changed his name on there. My aunt then sent me a text saying that it was inappropriate to look at his GoodReads and that I wouldn't want him going through my room, so why did I think it was okay to go through his things. But it isn't like it was personal, private property. It's a public account on the internet with his real, full name.

They host Christmas at their house every year and this year I have been uninvited. I don't even really want to go, we have a variety of other issues that are not really related (not that this helps). So, it isn't like I feel like I'm missing out, but the level of their reaction is making me wonder if I was TA for bringing it up and asking him to use a shortened version of his (OUR) last name.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4817254,public,top,nsfw,AITA for asking my uncle to change his name on GoodReads,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2f4yh/aita_for_asking_my_uncle_to_change_his_name_on/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

But instead of being happy and excited, I am currently upset with my mom. All she's been doing is be on her phone chatting with these guys she's never met before. One of them is supposedly teaching her how to invest and the others are just chatting. Even the moment I first walked into the house, she stayed typing on her phone while being surprised I'm here. She didn't even really looked at me nor seem that surprised. And right away she asked me about something the guy asked her...

Day and night all she's doing is chatting to one of them. When we go out, she's busy on the phone, sometimes even stop walking to type her messages. And when we talk to her she's not fully paying attention, or she'll stay her in room messaging with the guys. To the point now even talking about bank account and asking how to do this and that. Mind you, my dad is here too, but he's staying quiet or even don't seem to really mind. My mom yells at my dad alot and their relationship hasnt been the best. My siblings and I have tried to intervene and warned her of scammers. All she said was she knows what she's doing and that she doesnt have alot of money in her account to be scammed. And even getting defensive when we ask her to introduce these guys to us and teach us how to invest too. She won't even let us see her phone, taking her phone everywhere she goes.

We don't know what to do anymore. I kind of gave up and just let her do whatever, hoping she really knows what she's doing. Or maybe have her learn a lesson if something bad does happen, but I also feel bad for not caring. She did one time say that we can't stop her from doing what she wants, is her freedom. She doesn't seem to understand that we are just trying to protect her.

I figured that it's okay because I can still limit their intake of candy afterwards.

After they came home from trick-or-treating with Dad, they were both carrying enormous bags of candy, way more than I would ever allow them to have. I told them that they were allowed to pick as many pieces of candy as their age, and that I would take the rest of the candy to work and put it into the office candy jar. They both immediately burst into tears, and started begging me to keep all of their candy. I kept telling them no, while my 6YO kept insisting that he ""worked hard"" for his candy (lol). Eventually, they gave in and tearfully picked out the pieces of candy that they were going to keep.

Meanwhile, I took the candy and put it out of their reach while I decided on how I was going to distribute it to them. I created a system where they can buy back a piece of their candy for 100 Mommy Bucks each, and can earn up to 5 MBs each day for good behavior. I set up a chart on the wall where each kid would recieve points for every infraction that they commit on a given day. 1 point equals the loss of 1 MB that they could have earned that day, 5 points equals no MBs, and 6 or more points is a fine.

After I put my children to bed, I sat down and told my husband about the new system that I am implementing. He protested that I should just let them have *all* of the candy, but I put my foot down and told him that this system is going to be implemented regardless of whether he likes it or not. I made him sleep on the couch that night. The next morning, I sat my children down and explained the new system to them. They were clearly disappointed, but accepted it.

But last night when I got home from work, my 6YO immediately started throwing a tantrum demanding *all* of his Halloween candy, including the ones which I brought to the office, because ""other kids get to have it"". I immediately added a point to his chart, and told him that if he doesn't knock it off, I will just keep adding more points. I counted to three, and he just kept screaming and crying, so I added another point. His tantrum lasted for over an hour, after which he earned himself 53 points as I continually kept adding points to his chart. Once he stopped, I just sent him to bed without dinner. Prior to last night, he had 74 MBs—and with a fine of 48 MBs he is now back to only 26 MBs.

When he woke up this morning and realized the consequences of last night's tantrum, he started begging me to give him back his MBs.

Boyfriend 40m. Met when I was 21. Together almost 8 years. Six months into our relationship, his father got diagnosed with ALS and for the last 7 years (he died 4 months ago) we watched him die slowly. It was agonizing for everyone involved. Literally the worst thing I’ve ever witnessed. I fed him, bathed him, cared for him, watched the emts come to our house after he fell over and over again. I watched him gasp for air in his last breaths. We all lived together. I can’t even remember most of my 20’s because I was so immersed in his fathers illness and taking care of him. I’m so fucked up from it. My boyfriend is too but has since moved on and was happy for the first time in a long long time. Once he died it’s as if a veil was lifted. 

I’m a tattoo artist and work more than 12 hours a day with drawing/tattooing. I haven’t been able to breathe for the past 8 years with the ALS and my job and every other thing. The stress is more than I can take. I’ve been by my boyfriends side through it all being as supportive as I can. 

4 years ago my boyfriend got diverticulitis and almost died. I had to feed him and change his colostomy bag and I quit my job to help him and his father. I did this because I wanted to. 


It’s been 4 months since the death of his father. 1 year ago I planned a solo backpacking trip to Thailand next month. I need this so badly. I need to breathe. It’s been a fucking rough go and after taking care of everyone but myself for so long, in my heart I need this. 


2 weeks ago my boyfriends best friend died unexpectedly from an overdose. It was heart shattering. I can’t believe it. My boyfriend is crushed and it’s just so fucking unfair that all of these horrible things have happened to him. I’m heartbroken for him. I’m trying so hard to be there and help him while he grieves. 

I’ve stayed by his side every moment throughout all of this heart ache. I’ve forgotten about my own family and my own hearts desires. I feel like a shell and I’m spent. 

I’m set to fly to Thailand for a month, I leave in a week and a half. I feel guilty. I feel like my duty has been and always will be is to cater to him and leave my needs to get to when I get to them. I’m almost run out. I’m fucking tired and I need a break. I can’t shake the feeling that I need to be there for him as I always have. 

He’s so scared of me going away and dying. I’m trying to explain to him why I need this. He doesn’t understand the idea of backpacking especially solo. He says he’s ok with me leaving but I don’t believe him. He knows how much I’ve helped him. I’ve been his backbone for so long. He says he’s succumbed to the prospect of me leaving but a part of me thinks he won’t be ok without me even though he says he will.

I’m a goofy person who has a good sense of humor. I try not to care what others think, but, I also know how to behave myself in public. 

Amanda has a “larger than life personality” and when we became friends a year ago, confided in me that she’s tired of people trying to change her. I thought nothing of it until the following happened…

Incident A- we were at Applebees and the waiter was taking a while to get back to our table. Amanda walks into the back kitchen and pops her head in and says, “excuse me! We are ready to order!” 

Amanda was friendly about it and the place was empty, but I was still embarrassed. 

Incident B- we are at bdubs and she ordered mac and cheese. At the end of the meal, Amanda picks up the empty bowl and starts licking the cheese out above her head in the middle of a packed restaurant. Again, I was so dumbfounded.

Incident C- we are walking through the mall and Amanda literally begins farting so f-kn loud the windows in front of Forever 21 quake. People look up at us and I am so incredibly embarrassed. Amanda is crying laughing (I am too, but I’m embarrassed bc everyone thought I did it).

Anyway, the other day Amanda asked if I wanted to go to dinner with her. I was blunt, and told her that I didn’t want to go into public if she wasn’t going to act civilized. She accused me of not accepting her weird-ness and said that I am trying to dull her personality. I told her that having basic decency in public and following social rules isn’t “dulling her personality”. 

She said, “I have spent so long hiding who I am from the world and I’m so hurt that you’re wanting me to do that now.” I told her that she was being dramatic, and in private I don’t care if she rips ass or licks cheese up off the damn floor- but we are almost 30 and it’s embarrassing that she’s acting like a child in public.

He’s incredibly kind, intelligent, cute, and exceedingly funny as well! We share most of the same hobbies like playing video games, going to the beach, watching anime, etc, 

He’s a virgin, and I’m the first girl he’s ever kissed, at least on the lips as well. I told him I wanted to take his virginity away because I know that gives guys a huge confidence boost, and I’m completely enamored with him. 
I knew he’d be a bundle of nerves about it as is anyone when it’s their first time. I assured him that I’m a patient person, and that I’d be more than willing to help him learn his way around a woman. 

My bf is Afro-Latino. He said he’s always been a little self-conscious about his size because most women expect black men to be endowed with “monster cocks,” and that they’re seen as disappointing if they’re not packing. He said he’s 6 inches without pressing into the pelvic area, and 7 inches if he does. His girth is 5.1 inches. 

I’ve had 8 past partners in total and the one thing I’ve confirmed through that is that I like the sensation of feeling full when PIV is in play, so I understand what he means. but I think it has nothing to do with black men. Some girls just prefer a thicker/longer penis. 

Yesterday, we finally did the deed. He was AMAZING at oral. He ate my pussy like a girl. I orgasmed literally within 15 minutes. I couldn’t believe it was his first time eating vagina. I returned the favor and gave him head. After that, we had sex for about 20-30 min. 

He said it was the best experience of his life and that he couldn’t wait to do it again whenever I wanted to. He asked for honest feedback if he was any good at all and that I didn’t have to hold back. I told him he’s fantastic at oral, but I’m used to more girthy penises. It didn’t feel bad or anything, but it didn’t feel like the usual sensation I get. 

I mentioned that his length is good, but I suggested that maybe he could wear a cock ring or a penis sleeve since that enhances girth while you have it on during intercourse.
An ex of mine actually did that and the problem was easily resolved. I could tell that it kind of disappointed him a little bit though, but he appreciates honesty more than anything.  

Today we’ve only texted instead of the usual talking on the phone or meeting up instead to hangout. I asked if he wanted to go out to the mall and grab some Auntie Anne’s and go back to his place and hangout, but he said that he’s busy today and that we could do it another time. He’s never been too busy for me at all even when he’s swamped with assignments so now I’m overthinking what’s going through his mind since yesterday. 

I’m worried that he’ll take what I said too drastically and that it’ll potentially ruin our relationship. He’s the first guy I’ve felt really comfortable in my skin with for a while, and I don’t want my stupid comments to fuck up what we have.

Josh and I originally were going to have a smaller wedding at a resort. We were fortunate enough to be given some money to invite extra guests, so we decided to expand the wedding and have some of our second cousins and their kids, and some friends that we otherwise don’t get to see as often.

We are on a budget, so we decided to keep the “fancy” cake for immediate family and the pastor and a few members of the wedding party that we have known for the longest. We gave them the cake in boxes to take home though so they wouldn’t be eating it in front of everyone else. 

(Minus the pastor because he flew out from a ways and he is vegan so he couldn’t eat the dinner and we wanted him to have something to eat before it got too late.)

We got a couple sheet cakes. One was vanilla and buttercream with rosettes and then there was another sheet cake of pineapple chocolate chunk especially for Josh’s side of the family (because they spend a lot of time in Florida).

We found out from talking with family that there was a lot of full slices left behind on people’s plates of the pineapple cake. (Which the servers would not take home with them, so we noticed you can see it in a lot of the pictures.) We were having too much fun to notice at the time, we loved catching up with all our guests!

Apparently Josh’s family did not like the cake like we thought they would and there have been some unkind words behind our backs. We got a text from Josh’s uncle that wasn’t meant for us to see and it really stung.

We are unsure where to go from here and what to say. The cake did not go off like we hope but we think they are being unnecessarily mean.

(By the way, there was a full dinner, three kinds of cheese— even Monterey Jack— available, and an open bar that didn’t close until late. So I feel like we were pretty good to our guests on a shoestring budget!)

She and my bio dad, who we'll call Jake for anonymity's sake, were the same age. I don't know much about their relationship, but he wasn't at all interested in her pregnancy and didn't come see me until the day after I was born despite being notified that my Mom was in labor. When I was a few months old, he said he wanted to see me on Father's Day, so my Mom brought me over at the designated time and he wasn't home, so she waited. He didn't show up until 3AM the next day, drunk and pissed off, so my Mom gave him a few choice words and left. He very rarely wanted to see me, and it got to the point that when I was around 3, I asked my Mom in the parking lot of a funeral home if it was my fault he never wanted to see me. A kid should never have to ask that. When I was only a few months old he didn't

When I was 5, my Mom got married to my stepdad who at this point I consider my real Dad. He was the one who spent money on a lawyer to strip Jake of his rights so he could adopt me, he was the one who came to all of my school graduations and parent teacher conferences, he was the one who came to my middle school father daughter dance,  he was the one who came to my ROTC exhibition, he was the one who carried me across the yard after I got ran over despite his messed up knees and broken back, he was the one who taught me how to drive, he was the one who came to the hospital when I had a seizure and was diagnosed with epilepsy. Not Jake. It was all my Dad.

 When I was 13, Jake somehow got my phone number and called me. He seemed nice, but I wasn't all that interested in a father-daughter relationship because I already had a Dad, and I told him as much. I also let him know that I was okay with getting to know him, since all of my memories of him were pretty vague. He never responded to me after I said that, which did hurt. Then, when I was 18, he contacted me again via Facebook. But I wasn't interested in him anymore, I had a family, so I didn't respond. A few months ago, I turned 23 and he tried again, I still didn't respond because of I do I know he'd just try to apologize, and honestly? I don't want to forgive him, and I don't want him to say he's sorry so he can go off and tell people ""at least he tried"", I don't think he deserves the satisfaction of it. 

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I told my Mom about it and how I felt, pretty much word for word of what I wrote here. She kind of laughed awkwardly and said ""That's how you know she was raised by her Dad."" My Dad is pretty spiteful towards people he doesn't like, and I've seen it first hand how he treats them. I never really thought I was like that, I might not be the kindest person in the world but I never really thought of myself treating people like that when I was upset with them.

I (31m) put my wife (27f) in charge of watching my beloved Axolotl, Sherlock, while I was away on a trip for a few days. She knows his routine— hand-feed him once a day with frozen earthworms.

My wife seemed pissed when I was leaving for the trip. I wasn’t really sure why, as I had told her about the trip weeks ago, but she wasn’t saying anything to me when she dropped me off at the airport.

When I got home after the trip, she didn’t pick me up from the airport and I had to Uber. The house was super messy, and when I went to my bedroom to check on my lizards, I saw Sherlock floating belly-up in the tank.

I’ve had Sherlock for three years— I got him when my grandpa passed and it meant a lot to me so I was pretty distraught. I asked my wife if she had fed him and she said yes and showed me the worms she had been using. They were mealworms even though she knows he eats earthworms. I don’t know why she would change the food, but Axolotls can’t digest mealworms, and she should have at least called me if she was going to do that.

I left (with my other two lizards) to stay at a friends to clear my head. I just don’t feel like I can trust her anymore and I don’t know what to do.

A few hours ago, her parents contacted me calling me an asshole for abandoning my wife and telling me to go back and stay with her. Am I the asshole?

So onto the story when I went back to work we got along pretty good and she got close to me and one other of my coworker Ashley f29, they literally live down the street from each other. Ashley is a single mom of 3 and has known Sarah’s boyfriends family for years their moms have been friends for years and his mom owns a daycare in our area that her kids go to. When Sarah and I started being friends she was always texting me and calling me complaining about her boyfriend that he doesn’t do anything or that he doesn’t work, or complaining about her baby saying that he’s just crying and that its driving her crazy. Thing is the house her and her boyfriend are living in is owned by his mom and she makes the payments on the house so the only thing her and her boyfriend need to worry about is food. So about a couple of weeks ago Sarah started flirting around with one of our coworkers Dean m16 (yes he’s 16🤦🏻‍♀️) and they hooked up a couple times then he broke ir off because she got obsessed with him and has been stalking him and texting him from different phones (yes she cheated on her boyfriend.) Sarah told me that since her baby has gotten out of the hospital he’s been staying with her in laws and never makes the effort to go see him unless her mother in law is busy and needs her to watch him she’ll then call me or Ashley saying that he’s just crying and he’s annoying her and doesn’t want him there. I asked Ashley what was going on with Sarah cuz some of the things she’s told me doesn’t add up, she said that Sarah never wanted her baby but was against abortion so she had him and that when Ashley goes and picks up her kids for daycare (Ashley is Sarah’s ride to work since they live near each other) that Sarah never gets off to go see her son and he’s there cuz her mother in law works there and always has him there. So a couple days ago I was dropping off my husband at work cuz I needed the car that day and I decide to get off so that Ashley can meet my son for the first time and Sarah was there and she started gushing over him which i don’t mind but then she started saying that he was so cute and that he was making her want a baby and that she wants to have another one. Me and Ashley just looked at her with dumbfound faces and looking back I might have been an asshole but I told her she should take care of her first baby before having another one.

We recently got engaged and live near both of our families, about 40 mins away from my parents and 45 from his parents but in opposite directions. I have always felt very welcomed and loved by his family, and am excited to be joining it.

For Thanksgiving ever since we got together, excluding 2020, we have always gone up to his aunt’s home for Thanksgiving with his extended family. G got a new job a few months ago, and wasn’t able to take off the Friday after Thanksgiving off. His aunt lives about 2.5 hours away, so we decided this year we’d switch things up and spend Thanksgiving with my family.

Yesterday G’s mom called him to let him know that his immediate family (his parents, 2 brothers, sister and her husband) would be staying locally instead of going to his aunts and asked him what time we’d be coming over. G was surprised and told his mom we wouldn’t be coming over, because we are spending the holiday with my family. G’s mom freaked out and started saying the whole reason they decided to stay home was because G wasn’t going to aunts house. She assumed because of that, we’d split time at my family’s thanksgiving, then go to their home.

She is now telling G he needs to prioritize “their family” because when you get married, you see “the girls family more anyways.” To be honest, I’m really shocked she would say this. We see his family 1-2x a month minimum, much more than we see my family. His sister is now texting him things to guilt him into coming, saying that his mom is upset  because we won’t make a sacrifice for family and we’ve ruined their plans.

G has been firm with everyone, but I’m starting to feel guilty about it. I don’t want them to start dislike me for taking their son away. We definitely could swing by his family’s house, it wouldn’t be convenient but not unrealistic.

But I’m just trying to figure out if I 22m and my gf 23f are the assholes. So we moved out of state 9 month ago and have been doing really good in our new place have nice careers and just bought a beautiful home together with hard work and lots of savings after only being out here 8 months. Seeing how good we were doing I had a friend back home 21m and his gf 20f who were in a rough spot back in our home state so 8 days after closing on our house they moved in. At first it was nice and they helped out a lot around the house since we were trying help them out and told them before hand that as long as they helped out and saved up for there own place with very low rent for a room with there own bathroom on the main floor (my bedroom is on the second floor) they would have a place to stay until they can settle and find a place . Well it’s been about 3 months now and so far they have saved little to nothing stopped helping out as much around the house, and disrespecting us and our house. Well we had a set rent for the first three months that we agreed on which was $300 a month plus $50-100 for utilities. Well like I said it’s gotten bad, they drink every night, don’t save money let there dogs sh*t in my basement and won’t clean it up for hours after we ask, his gf is only part time so she’s home most often as everyone else works full time Monday-Friday. They room we have rented them had brand new carpet when they moved in, now it’s a completely different color with multiple super dark spots. So we asked them to stop wearing shoes in the house which we originally asked but they didn’t listen. We asked that they take better care of there animals messes and to try and lighten up on the drinking and that we don’t want alcohol in the rooms with a carpet or any food or drinks besides snacks and water. Well now that’s it’s snowy they have listened about the shoes but don’t follow any of the other rules we’ve asked. They make the house so uncomfortable after we remind them of the rules. Havent paid rent this month or utilities but go out and eat fast food whenever they like. We originally agreed to all have dinner together and them pitch in towards food and that they are welcome to anything we have and if they are home always check to see if they want thing I if we go out or if they would like to join normally we don’t ask them to pay if we offer.  But when they go out atleast once a day for fast food never offer and will either eat it in there truck out front or run to the room and eat it in secrecy either way they have been terrible house guest and don’t respect us or our home in anyway so I printed out a lease with rules stated and higher rent still not even half our mortgage and higher utilities and also put our rules down and that if they don’t follow them we can evict them in just 3 days or if they don’t want to sign the lease they can leave immediately.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4817201,public,top,self,AITA for raising rent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2em4c/aita_for_raising_rent/,all_ads,6,,,,

My wife is going with her son to see her family for Christmas as she is working on repairing a years long bad relationship and feels it will be easier if she doesn't have to split attention with them and me and my son... so, I was going to have my parents come up to see me and my son. I live in Reno, they live in Palm Springs, 9 hour drive.  


They wanted us to come to them, but we had a dog that was aggressive and very difficult to board. My wife pointed out they never come here and so it would be nice if they would help us there. So they agreed to come here... well sadly our lovely Misfit passed away and changed that variable, so my parents asked why don't I fly there instead and they'll pay the airfare and the dog boarding for our OTHER dog Rugby... and herein lies the argument. My wife thinks its not right that they want to change the plans and have us have to board our 12 year old dog, who has never stayed without us outside of our home and just had his best friend pass away.  


I share the concern, but I also see that on one side it would be my near 80 year old dad driving over mountain passes over Christmas with my mom, brother who is handicapped and has difficulty traveling, and my son (who will be with them already) and getting a hotel... or them paying for me to take a short flight down to them and staying with them and flying back with my son. So even though I don't like the idea of leaving the dog in unfamiliar hands, it does seem to be easier for me to travel.   


The extra backstory being that there has been a lot of drama surrounding my parents lately and my wife doesn't feel they have been helpful for us lately and that my mom is just always trying to get what she wants. I leave it at that and, while I have my disagreements, she's not wrong and there eventually needs to be a talk about it.

I haven't spoke to my mom in a year. My mom lost custody of my brother and sister 4 years ago after he boyfriend left them in the house while running from the police. One of her biggest problems is that she over indulged with alcohol to cope with this problem and alot of other problems. While she was signed up for parenting classes while I visited a while back, she would get massively drunk instead of going to parenting classes. Ultimately I feel as if she could've made a better effort to fight to get my siblings back. I understand that people go though hardships and use whatever method they want to cope and I can't tell a grown adult how to live their life, I also don't know if she knows or cares what type of person alcohol makes her into; unhinged as fuck. It made me not want to be around her anymore family or not. The last conversation we had was when she called me and I tried confronting her about her drinking and she just took it as disrespectful. She also tried to say she feel like she failed us and apologized and I didn't have any remorse for her. I felt like she was playing the sympathy card when her kids lives where the ones that got fucked up.

My wife (43f) and I (43f) are hosting Thanksgiving at our house this year. My wife’s family is coming over on Thursday, I’m an only child and my parents currently live abroad, so we won’t see them until they come for Christmas. My wife’s family consists of her brother (45f), her sister (50f), her parents (78m and 80f) and our nieces and nephews (3 boys, 3 girls, ages 11-14). My wife and I also have our own kids, 15f and 13m.

About a month ago, we went on vacation. The town we ended up staying in is where my wife went to college. The campus has a market that runs once a week and is open to the public. My wife wanted to check the market out. The market was nice and all of us ended up getting various different things. One of the booths there was a fundraiser for a local LGBT organization, it was a nice little booth and we saw that our son and daughter were looking at the booth, so we went to go see them. My son was showing me how one of the items at the booth was a bracelet that said something about supporting trans athletes. Our son had bought a few because he wanted to wear one to support his friend, Jaxon.

Jaxon goes to the same middle school as our son, they went to different elementary schools in the district but met in middle school. Our son is on the baseball team at school, Jaxon loves sports, like my son, including baseball, but he doesn’t play for his school or an outside team due to his dyspraxia (which affects hand-eye coordination) and his sensory issues (which can also come from dyspraxia), despite this, he is still friends with my son and all his other friends, talking about sports (especially baseball) all the time. Jaxon also plays sports with them at our local sports center or the gym. The boys love Jaxon and in their own words he’s “just another bro”.

My son has been wearing the bracelet to school, he bought his friends some, but we live in quite a conservative area, so only a few took them, the others have more conservative parents.

In our family, we dress somewhat formally on thanksgiving, nothing super elegant, just a nice button down shirt or a nice sweater and nice pants. My son was showing us what he wanted to wear on Thanksgiving, we both said his outfit was nice, but when my wife saw he had his bracelet on, she asked him not to wear it because it might “start something” with her siblings and parents. My wife comes from a very conservative, Evangelical family. He said “if someone has an issue with Jaxon, then they have an issue with me to” and said he wouldn’t not wear it. He then asked me what I thought and I said I’d discuss it with her. After that, we went in the bedroom and talked about it, we didn’t end up coming to an agreement, and I told him he could wear it, because I don’t want him feeling like he can’t stand up for Jaxon and that his friend is lesser. My wife is very upset at me because she does not want to hurt her relationship with her family.

He met both of his girlfriends at church, both of them insist there's no situation in which they would ever get an abortion (which I think enables pro-life men like him to be misogynistic and sends the wrong message to young women). He broke up with his last girlfriend literally just because he got bored of her. And his currently girlfriend knows all of this and is somehow okay with it.

I do think his lack of boundaries comes from these women because apparently they would get upset and think he doesn't trust them if he ever kept anything to himself, so confronting her was partially selfish. But from what I know about psychology, any woman that would be willing to be with a man like him and do the things they've done have issues so I do feel bad for them too.

I have a friend who has been unemployed for three years from his career track job. He’s blown through his entire 401k which is surprising since he was very successful when working. He always lived large, fancy apartments, sports cars, etc. Currently he’s broke and living on public assistance. 

I received a text from him this morning that said “A good friend would send a little cash so I can enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner somewhere😘”.

On the one hand, I have a lot of sympathy for his position. On the other, I don’t understand why he wouldn’t take some job, any job, even part time minimum wage to stretch his savings. I think his enormous pride and ego prevented him from even considering it. And I am shocked that he would ask for money to go out to dinner of all things. He lives in another part of the country or I’d have asked him over. I also have a problem with the manipulative statement “a good friend would send cash….”  I did send him$50.

I worked my way up from being a regular TA to the lead undergraduate TA to a graduate TA (where I was given complete ownership of the lab). FYI, these are the terms my professor used and told me I was the lead TA, I didn't just make it up, explaining this because I had a coworker / fake friend (who I hired) get really mad when I was called the lead TA or said that to anyone who asked me what I do. Might make a separate post about them another day.

I really cared about people learning the material and not just getting an easy A (this was engineering so I thought it was important so that people don't make mistakes in the future and know what they're actually doing), so I graded accordingly and held everyone to a high standard. Although I had high expectations for people, I knew it wasn't always easy and some people would struggle more than others so I made myself available as much as possible to answer questions and would even do 1:1 time with the students outside of class if they needed it. I introduced a weekly help session in the evenings for everyone to attend in the computer lab and I would go through their CAD models and other coursework with them and walk them through it step by step so they could understand it in-depth. I also trained a couple of TAs to help out with these sessions as more students started attending it was tough to get to everybody in timely manner in the 2 hour block.

With that said, I was strict on grading and if the CAD models weren't perfect I wouldn't give them full credit ( which is something my professor agreed with me on and told me to do ), but they could resubmit any assignment at any point in the semester and I would regrade it as many times as they resubmitted it. Also when I graded assignments I would give in detail steps on how to fix the model and what exactly they did wrong.

I was also strict with people on attending the lab on time, if they were even a minute late I would grill them on it. In my defense, this is how my professor and previous TAs treated me when I was a student in the class and I felt like this was what was expected of me and how I should act. Looking back, I regret being so strict on attendance since it was not that big of a deal if they were a few minutes late every now and then. Obviously I wouldn't give people shit if they had an actual excuse (doctor's appointment, classes, work, etc.) but there were some people that were habitually late every class and they never had a real excuse.

I wish I was a little more lax back then and didn't have such a uptight demeanor, but I would still keep the quality of instruction and grading criteria the same if I were to do it again.

We've always lived in the same house with limited bedrooms, so we've shared our entire lives. Our room is pretty small for two people, we have two twin beds on opposite sides of the room each with a side table along with a desk, a papasan chair, and a bookshelf. Other than her bed and her side table, all of the furniture in the room belongs to me, which she agrees with. I either bought it or asked for it for Christmas years ago. We both know this and agree that all of the furniture is mine.

I'm much more of a clean freak than my sister. Our room can get fairly messy when I'm busy or I have a depressive episode but I like it to be clean. I have been the ONLY one to clean the room since we were about 11-13. I usually don't mind, I'm autistic so I don't like when other people touch my things to put them away.

Any time I've ever cleaned the room by myself, I've put all of my sister's belongings on her bed for her to put away by herself. It usually takes her weeks to clean it off. Sometimes she just sleeps on top of the junk, sometimes on the floor or out on the couch. Around six months ago I cleaned the room and put things on her bed. She has yet to clean anything off and has been sleeping on the couch.

However, within the past couple of months, she's been hanging out and sleeping in my bed when I'm not home. While I'm at work she'll lounge and eat on my bed and if I stay the night at a friend's house she'll sleep in my bed. She makes a mess of my bed, leaving her books, makeup, laptop, dirty clothes, ect. on my bed for me to clean up when I get home. She leaves food wrappers and cups on my nightstand and around the room that I have to clean up as well. 

Last week I went on a week-long trip to go see my long distance partner and I came back to another mess. It was completely covered in junk. I got home at 2am after an exhausting flight and had to clean her mess off my bed before I was able to sleep.

It's gotten to the point where I don't want her in the room at all. She just claims she should be able to hang out in her own room. I tell her she should clean off her bed if she wants to hang out in here so badly and she blames me for putting the junk on her bed to begin with. I don't want her to make my bed or my other furniture messy anymore. There's no room or places for her to hang out if she doesn't want to clean off her bed so I think it's better that she just doesn't hang out there at all.

Me and my sister get along very well other than this one thing but it's becoming a real problem. We've gotten into screaming matches over this but she still doesn't take it seriously. She believes she should be able to hang out in our room and she's allowed to hang out in my bed because it's my fault her bed is unavailable.
