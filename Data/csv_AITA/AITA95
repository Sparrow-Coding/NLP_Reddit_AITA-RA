She had four children: three older daughters and one son (me). My oldest sister is 30 and I turned 20 this year. Two of my sisters have different dads. Our fathers weren't really present in our childhood, which must have been really hard because my mom was basically a single mother with 4 children for a majority of her life. I have a lot of respect for my mother because she took care of us on her own and got us all through school with abitur (we're from germany) so we can go to university and study. I was so happy when i finished school because my mom would have finally been done raising children and she could kinda start doing the things she loved again (going to festivals with her friends, roadtrips). She always told us as soon as I'm done with school, she'd go on vacations and relax, which she really deserves after all she's done for us. Then she got another boyfriend, which there were many of during my childhood. She became pregnant again when she was 53 and I was 19 and had already gone to uni. All of my sisters are doing their thing around the world as well. Now, I couldn't stop thinking, after all that hard work, having to raise 4 children on her own, why do you want to have another child this late? When we all moved out already? She's still together with her boyfriend and married him and I hope that they're happy, but the boyfriend is BARELY home and BARELY helps my mother. Like, he's at max home on the weekend... Which means as of now, my mother is raising my new brother mostly on her own, again :(. Her boyfriend owns a construction company and I guess his workers are all sick or something, so he says he needs to work all the time and can't come home. 
Sooo, I just feel really sorry for her, because when I'm home, I can tell she's getting overwhelmed having to do everything on her own AGAIN. I also feel bad, because I don't really wanna spend time with my brother, as I didn't choose to have this child, and i dont really like my moms boyfriend.

I (27f) have a cousin ""Michelle"" (26f) who I grew up with and am pretty close to and love, but she's going through a lot right now and unfortunately we had an argument so I wanted some perspective.

Back in Middle School Michelle met and became friends with ""Jared"" (25m) and they used to hang out a lot. By the time they were in high school, they would hang out almost everyday and even worked together. Michelle often cited how he was her best friend but a lot of us thought that they were secretly dating. Michelle's stepdad and my dad even had an informal discussion about how Jared should treat women because of how convinced they were that they were an item. 

Michelle constantly denied this while Jared would either laugh it off or just be silent, but none of us took it seriously until we found out that Michelle was actually dating Jared's brother ""Lenny"" (29m). We were surprised and then shocked when Michelle confessed to getting pregnant and that she accepted Lenny's proposal. After that Michelle's friendship with Jared started to spiral. Jared even missed the wedding. Michelle was upset over this and I pointed out that she couldn't expect the friendship to stay the same AFTER she started hooking up with Lenny and that she should just give Jared some time. 

Since then Michelle and Lenny had their daughter ""Sarah"" (8f) who Jared isn't involved with and I took it as people just growing apart. He ended up moving back and Michelle was happy but then sad because Jared still expressed no interest in hanging out with her, Lenny, or their daughter. Then Michelle's (bio) dad died and while Lenny was sympathetic in the beginning he couldn't understand why she was still so upset since he was a deadbeat and her stepdad was a better parent to her. 

Jared was the only one outside of family that Michelle would confess at how sad she was over the lack of a relationship she had with her dad. Michelle kept reaching out to Jared in grief and eventually she was able to talk with him at his place but when he told her to confide in Lenny instead Michelle yelled at him and then told Lenny which led to other people getting involved. After a confrontation at her In-Laws' house it was revealed that Jared had a crush on Michelle since Junior year, that Lenny knew about it BEFORE he started sleeping with Michelle and that's why Jared's relationship with both of them dissolved. Jared hates Lenny and while he doesn't hate Michelle, she's still Lenny's wife so he wants nothing to do with her as well. 

Michelle is shocked and angry that Lenny knew the reason Jared stopped talking to her and never told her. They've been fighting on-and-off about it for weeks, I know because she talks to me about it, and it's starting to get old. During one of her rants at Thanksgiving I asked if she was going to divorce Lenny over this and when Michelle didn't say anything I said ""then stop complaining."" Michelle left early after that and when I went to call her she blocked me.

It's not, I just didn't know how to word the title any better

So I had been looking after my nephew and niece, my sister's two children (nephew = 10 y.o. &amp; niece = 9 y.o.). Their school had to close unexpectedly for two days due to maintenance problems and they spent both of those days under my supervision whilst she was at work (my sister and the kids dad split up &amp; he now lives and works in a different country)

My sister is vegan and quite a militant one and all, always badgering my mum &amp; I about eating non-vegan food in our own homes even when she isn't there, returning toys I've bought my nephew and niece for birthdays and christmas, etc. She will give her children the choice on whether or not to become fully vegan when they're a little bit older. 

Note: her children are not 100% vegan yet, she is alright with non-vegan food being given to them when they go round friend's houses % friends birthday parties

Day 1: My sister had packed a vegan lunch for the kids to eat whilst at mine, which the children absolutely detested. They both didn't eat all of the food and my sister blamed me over it. I think they'd seen some chocolate that I have and got a bit upset. I know that the children have been picked on at school over the vegan foods that their mum packs for them and they want to try things the other children have

Day 2: Sister was in a rush and couldn't make her kids anything. Lunch time comes around and I'm emptying my freezer before I do a big food shop, so I put two pizzas on, a bbq chicken pizza &amp; a cheese pizza. The plan was to give them the cheese pizza, if I give my sister non-vegan food but vegetarian suitable food she doesn't get as uspet, and I would pick at the bbq chicken pizza (the bbq chicken pizza was quite big) and not offer it to the kids but if the kids did have a few slices of the bbq chicken pizza then I would not stop them. They have been/will be given the choice. Both of the kids did end up taking a couple of slices of the bbq chicken pizza

Sister asks what the kids had eaten, the kids had seemed quite chipper when she came to collect them. They told her what they'd had eaten and asks to see me inside the house. She blows her lid at me that the kids should have known about the ""dangers"" of the meat on the bbq chicken pizza first and that they should have had controlled permission before having a slice, whatever that means. I mention that the kids aren't 100% vegan and have similar foods to the bbq chicken pizza when they go to friends birthday parties. She storms off saying that I was rude about leaving the pizza open and indirectly calls me a danger on the family group chat, as if I was letting her kids stick forks in plug sockets rather that letting them eat a bit of pizza. She's the youngest so a few family members take her side by default (they're not vegan either) and are giving me gyp for it

I finished my MBA this summer &amp; had gotten a job offer early February with a very large (you order from them ALL the time, I promise) company for pretty good money. The offer required a relocation to another state (paid for), &amp; my husband (referred to as H from here on out) has been 100% on board the whole time. H left school twice in our younger years for financial reasons &amp; I offered to foot all the household bills so he could go back &amp; finish his degree (H was already a junior). He started school in August, but by October had decided it was too much work/too much effort required &amp; no leniency from professors etc. I was disappointed but if it’s not for him, I can’t force him to finish (even tho I believe he should have at least finished out the semester even if it meant failing a few classes). Since then, he’s had one job for just over a week until he decided they “weren’t going to talk to him some type of way”. That’s a whole different story. We moved in July, he quit his prior job in June, &amp; the 1-week job was end of October/early November. I’ll also note that he’s been drinking a 6-pack of beer (the 16-ounce, not the 12-ounce) every day, 6 days a week since we got here. They don’t sell beer on Sunday, so there’s always 1 day without. The agreement since before we moved was that he would help take over most of the household chores since he wouldn’t be working &amp; I’m trying to launch a career. The “help” has been minimal. He’s also kind of a jerk when he gets too far into the 6-pack. I’ve flat out said I’m not paying for the beer if he’s not going to help &amp; treat me like crap. That hasn’t stopped him from swiping his debit card to the joint account (which contains bill money) every day as he pleases. He doesn’t acknowledge he has a problem &amp; gets pissed if I even suggest it. 

Now on to Thanksgiving: I’ve made it perfectly clear for months that I want the holiday alcohol-free &amp; he’s always agreed. It was a rough day yesterday (I had to work- this company does not close) &amp; was missing my family terribly. I got home, &amp; he was on his 5th beer already &amp; passed out in bed. I was hurt &amp; livid. He woke up as I was rummaging for something to eat, walks in the kitchen &amp; says “did you wanna go get something”. I just shook my head. He said “ok” laced with tons of attitude. I said “ok why are you pissy, I’ve already had a rough day” (totally calmly btw). He said “well don’t bring it home” before heading out back to smoke a cigarette, slamming the door behind him. I gave it a few minutes, walked outside, &amp; explained my day, as well as reminded him I wanted to have today alcohol-free. His response was “we can still go out, I’m not DRUNK” before heading straight inside. So apparently I’ve ruined thanksgiving by not being willing to go out for food with an intoxicated husband. AITA?

Dad did try to protect us, but he stayed with mum until Marianne was 18 because he was only a stepdad but couldn't 'abandon' them.

But because of this I had to go through everything growing up. It was only at 14 that I could escape and refuse to see her. I know dad wanted to help them, and I love my sisters. But he could have kept me safe a decade earlier if he left when he found out. I wouldn't have gone through everything I have.

Last weekend was dad's birthday. Mums been trying to get in contact with me and for me to forgive her lately, so I've been a bit on edge. I want nothing to do with her, and I've ignored her, but it's just been bothering me a lot lately and I wasn't in the best mood that night. I tried to be normal, and the night started nice, but my half sisters were being all over the top and thanking him for being the perfect dad, and always protecting us and everything. I did get annoyed but didn't say anything while they were listened. Dad noticed I was off, and we talked later. I admitted how I felt. That he should have left and protected me when he could have. He basically left me to suffer. 

Unfortunately, Marianne overheard and got really angry with me. She's told Kiah and they both think that I'm being selfish and unfair to dad. But I'm his daughter, he should have left when he found out. I know it helped them, but I suffered so so much. Dad's tried to calm us down and say he understands all of us, but he's clearly choosing them over me again. He failed me, but my sister's just act like I'm crazy and selfish.

My brother in law (38m) is deeply religious. He was not brought up religious but he used to be a drug addict and so religion is a coping mechanism. He is not a bad guy but very naive and not too good at coping in life on his own. He doesn't have a stable income and gives a lot of his time and money in his church, he even studies theology in a university.

I really don't care about his beliefs and never discussed with him anything related to religion. 

Few months ago I was moving in with my boyfriend and since I have a lot of books, we bought a new bookcase. His brother came to the apartment at a moment before I brought in all my books, there were only few of them on the bookshelf. One of those books was The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins.

The brother was surprised of the book, hadn't heard of it before and asked to read it. Since I was reading it at the time, I said that maybe he can have it when I am done. Quite honestly I didn't want to give him my copy and hoped that this will be forgotten. However as the months passed every time we saw each other (basically on family dinners with my in laws) he asked to have the book. The last few times he even texted by boyfriend prior to the dinner as a reminder to take the book. The last time I bought him a copy for himself.  

He started reading the contents, the back cover, going through it and commenting. I said that everybody is free to have their beliefs and that this is a personal thing that I respect as long as it is kept separate from politics and it doesn't hurt anybody. He said that he wishes to read it to know the enemy. Whatever that means. I wanted to shut down the topic as I don't want to discuss this with him as I realize that religion for him is a coping mechanism from the drug addiction he had and if he falls of the wagon I don't want to be in any way responsible. Now I am expecting that the next family dinner will be a religion discussion initiated by his side that I don't want to have with him.

Every Christmas my husband (C) and I get gifts for all the kids in the family. C is a stay at home dad with no income. We are financially comfortable, not rich, because I am a college graduate. C and his family are minority immigrants who mostly work labor jobs. 
      This year while holiday shopping there were six kids total we needed to buy for. The gift we bought for D(19) was above $100. We spend the most on him because we got custody of him at 15 and raised him. D will also buy gifts for C, our child, and I, around $40 each.
        Their is a sibling group of kids J(10), A(6), M(2) who i bought gifts for. The gifts are all around $30-$35 each. Their parents are both hardworking and always buy our daughter gifts for Christmas. There is an only child U(6) who we spent $45 on because his parents buy us gifts as well and we will be buying his parents around $50 each. 
   This brings us to L(12). L and his family immigrated here to the U.S. a few months ago. L does not have an easy life as he doesn’t speak English and shares 1 bedroom with both his parents. L’s mom does not work so his dad works overtime but they are hardly making it.  
   While shopping I picked out a really cheap, $15 Lego set for L. I did not want to get him nothing because that seems cruel. I  know his parents do not have money to give  gifts back so I didn’t plan to spend more. 
   My husband wanted to add another few gifts to L’s gift so that we’re spending around the same amount on each kid. I told him I would rather not because L’s parents can’t reciprocate it. 
     My husband tells me we can afford more and L has already had a “tough year.” He says the extra $30 for a better gift would just be wasted on fast food. He says L would see his cousins gifts and know that they’re better gifts.
       I told my husband that L’s mom should get a job and give him a nice Christmas then like J,A, and M’s family. I also reminded him how I will be paying for and cooking food for the Christmas party everyone will be attending and L and his family probably won’t bring anything because they can not afford to.
     C looked hurt, as if I was insinuating L did not deserve a nice Christmas because his parents are poor. Every kid deserves a nice Christmas, I just do not think it’s necessary to spend as much as the people who will actually be giving us gifts. 
   C tells me I don’t know what it’s like to be a poor immigrant and have people treat you the way I’m treating L. C was not angry but looked hurt. I know C was brought to the U.S.  as a child too and had a had a similar life to L. 
    For the sake of peace I bought the extra gifts for L, so total around $35 for him. C still won’t talk to me and i can’t understand why. I spent the extra money, and obviously don’t expect anything else in return.

The problem is that she wants to book with a budget airline like Flair, where the reliability is questionable at best and last minute rescheduling is common. I’m not really comfortable with that. I checked flights and airlines like westjet, air Canada etc are still in our budget- nearing the max amount, but still in it. 

She’s pretty set on the budget airline, but I don’t want to risk missing the cruise, especially since she thinks flying in the day before is fine (I expressed my worries due to how common delays are).

It’s only a 3 hour flight, but I’m nervous. I saved up a lot for this (as has she), and I don’t want to risk a missed trip or extra problems to shave a hundred bucks.

It was a little pricey, little over 2.2k USD for everything, however I had been planning with friends for over a month to get it.

Those friends are my only real friends since I’m pretty lonely in real life. I’ve only been relegated to playing games that are for low end laptops before then with them, and they’ve been urging me to move on with them too. I thought it was a good idea to bring up the PC I was going to buy with my own money.

They disagreed with it, saying it was too pricey and that my uncle, who built hundreds of PCs himself, could do better. Thing is I’ll have to wait a while for him to scope out the pricing and specs of it. I attempted to explain to him that we’ve been looking for a month and this was the best.

They used that leverage to insult my friends; claiming they don’t know what they’re saying and that they don’t think financially. All the friends that had assisted me in building the PC have built their own with their own earned money. That point was conveniently ignored and them, being Asians, kept hurling insults at me.

They said that I am addicted to games and I most likely have a mental illness- saying that a Buddhist monk had treated children with a gaming addiction before. They say that I don’t know how to take care of myself or manage my money, planning on adding a limit. Then they said it would probably be a good idea to cut my wifi.

I work for my mom at a boba shop that she owns, making 12.50 an hour and working two days a week, getting around 300-600 per two weeks. I’ve been working there for at least a year, and have accumulated over 6.7k in my bank.

I couldn’t argue back because they’re stonewalled on their point of view, and kept trying to push it onto me.

I understand where their concerns are coming from, as I don’t have a car of my own and we’re planning on getting me one soon, but I am confident I am able to pay off the money and have a decent down payment, since my grandparents also gave an additional 5k for a car.

I’ve genuinely never felt so distant from my family, with them assuming all those things about me. It was made even worse when they didn't consider my online friends as real people. The people who know more about me than my own parents.

Being pissed off would be an understatement. I broke- told them that those people are the only friends I have. The only people who cared enough to know me for who I am, rather than love me for what I represent.

I genuinely don’t know if I am acting entitled or just being an asshole for avoiding my family now. Or if there is something wrong with me, because I know that at the end of the day they still raised me and provided for me.

I (23f) and my  bf(24m), I'm going to call him Tom, are more than likely breaking up tomorrow. We have been together for several years. He has become this person I don't recognize who takes everything I say extremely negative and resents me for moving to a different state. We need to break up, there's too much resentment, but I want to know if I am the AH for what led us here.  Tom and I started dating in college, I'm from the state we went to school and he was not. He's known what he's wanted to do for a long time due to his family's company back home. He has worked there over the past  6 years I was just focused on getting my degree and looking at what opportunities would present themselves. One night sophomore year, Tom and I were hanging out and might have had a drink or two I don't remember and he asked if I would ever move to where he is from in the future, I said yes thinking of it as hypothetical future talk and just a random conversation between two young people in love. I never thought of it as a serious binding commitment but apparently he did. 

We have both been graduated for several months now and he ended up moving to my state and taking a job and I took a job with a company I had interned with the summer before graduation. He did get an offer from his family's company and I told Tom repeatedly that if he wanted to take the job to take it and I would be willing to do long distance and that it was his decision. He also looked at jobs in my state and got several good offers because of his experience with his family. I did not want him to move because of me but because he felt it was a good opportunity. Now, he constantly brings up him moving here and that I must have known it was because of me and how I should thank him and appreciate his sacrifice more. We don't live together and I would go over and helped him move in, clean, always spend the night while he never came to my apartment. 

I understand it was a huge move and I was so happy we got to be in the same place but I feel like he is putting his decision on me when I never said he had to make a decision one way or the other. Tom is also angry because I won't promise him in about 3 years I will move to his state, no matter what. I have never had plans to stay in my state, I don't love it but I felt it was a good opportunity. But I feel like I would be lying if I said yes, I want there to be a conversation and to work together as a team and he would only be happy if I said yes and went along with what he wants. he wants to expand the company back home so he plans on staying for 5 years then moving elsewhere. We had talked about where we would have been willing to move. I honestly had no preferences as long as we both would have had good opportunities. I'm breaking things off because we're not healthy anymore and even though he won't admit it I'm sure he resents me.

He actually quit his job 2 weeks before everything shut down to look for another job but Covid changed that. 

From there I had to become the sole provider. Things eventually got better but husband got used to not working. We couldn't survive off of just my income (during Covid, we stayed afloat by using govt help). As things improved, I begged him to get a job but he refused. In July of 2021 I got bad Covid and couldn't work for 3 months because of treatment. I begged him to work, had friends offering him opportunity after opportunity, but he turned them all down, always having an excuse. I was worried about money so I started selling our things for money and I Ubered. He did nothing. 

In Oct 2021 I go back to work but we were so behind financially. Our lease was up Jan 2022. Told husband that he had to work because we were struggling on just my income. He said he was a stay at home dad now and that I should seek a second job or pick up more hours. This infuriated me because if he was a decent SAHD then maybe I'd consider it but he was a shitty one so I gave him an ultimatum- get a job by Jan 2022 or GTFO. 

Long story short, he didn't care and mid December, he packed his stuff and went to live with his mommy. I was devastated. 

I still worked so I changed my schedule to 3 doubles/week so we could split the kids (8, 5, 3) and he could take them when I worked. I didn't immediately file for divorce because he claimed he still wanted our family. It was all BS. 

At first, coparenting went well but as months went by, I realized I wanted a divorce. I told him, he got angry. Started using the kids against me, wouldn't pick them up when I had to work, or refused to give them up on my days, took money out of my account, etc. It was hell. 

ATP we were 6 months separated and he still had no job. I paid for everything that the kids needed. 

FF to July of 2022, my paid off car got totaled and I had to get a new one. Total payments for it was close to $500/mo. Doable but hard. 

I asked my ex for help but he said that I wasn't his problem anymore and I shouldn't have ""kicked him out"". Then my job offered me a position out of state, where my elderly mom lives and asked me to move in with her. Also my condo's company was allowing us to terminate our leases without penalty. Moving out of state meant better opportunities for me and our kids. 

I knew if I told my ex, he would not allow it for selfish reasons, so I quietly packed up our stuff, and moved with my kids. I told him the next day and said he can call/visit the kids anytime but this is what's best for them. 

We moved in August. Since then, he's only spoken to our kids once and blocked me on everything. Now the kids don't have a relationship with with their dad, who they love. They are happy here but are sad their dad doesn't want to talk to them anymore. I'm heartbroken.

We have always discussed having children and both said that we wanted them. However my wife has had some medical issues that have led to her not being able to get pregnant and possibly carry a child. We knew this before we got married and both of us agreed we could use a surrogate or adopt.

I have always wanted children whether that be my biological children or adopted. My wife said that she felt the same.

Obviously we knew the issues that we were going to have and were not in a rush to start a family yet.

However my wife has been saying for the last few months that she doesn’t think she wants to adopt anymore. I told her that we don’t have to decide yet and just see how we feel when the time is right.

This was fine for a while but a few weeks ago she said that she would never adopt as she couldn’t see the child as hers. She just wants to use her eggs and carry the baby herself or she won’t accept it. As I said earlier in the post this isn’t possible.

This has led to arguments as I feel that she has misled me. She says she hasn’t she has just changed her mind. 

She is calling me an AH for not supporting her decision not to adopt. I said I do support her decision because if she’s not going to accept the child as hers then she definitely shouldn’t adopt.

I love my wife but I feel like she just said what she thought I wanted to hear and now she is saying that I’m forcing her to get pregnant to anybody that will listen to her. 

We sat down and talked and she said that she will not adopt and now she doesn’t even want to have children. She said that she never wanted children and if I do then I need to divorce her. 

I thought about it and decided to ask her for a divorce.

We go on short breaks a couple of times a year, with one big holiday around summer time. 

I suffer with various mental health problems and I don't have any friends, so I haven't been anywhere socially for easily the past 5 years. Over time I had just accepted I was going to have a shit life, but recently I've decided to get help because I don't want to live like this anymore. I have come to realise that I can't just rely on the mental health system, I have to put in the effort and help myself, so I'm trying my best to get out and actually leave the house and interact with people.

I came up with the idea of going on holiday. Just a city break somewhere so I can go out and explore. I asked my fiancee (31F) if she would be ok with me going on holiday for a few days and I got a resounding ""no"". My argument was it was the equivalent of her going on holiday with her friends - I'd never stop her doing that and I'd happily look after the kids on my own while she was away. The only difference is I don't have any friends so I'd be going on my own. It wasn't in any way a replacement for our family holidays and of course I'd pay for it myself, but she was having none of it. She said if I did go on holiday, she'd take the kids on holiday somewhere else, which I said wasn't fair because I want to spend time with the kids too. 

I just feel kinda deflated at this point. I was making progress in facing my issues, but I really didn't expect the one person I'm closest to in the whole world to react the way she did.

She got married this year and before her wedding (only immediate fam) she had an event for close family/friends.

1 mo earlier, I had broken up with my bf of 1.5 yrs. I found out that he had cheated on me, and had lied to me about many things. He also had online posts accusing him of sexual harassments and assaults, by many women. This was also my 1st boyfriend and break up and very traumatizing. I was in a really really bad mental and emotional state for about 6 mos. Tara then had a ""bachelorette trip"" a month after she got married. Of course I wanted to go to celebrate with her, but it also was a nice mental escape for me. A couple weeks post trip, she was being distant and avoidant. I called her later to ask her how she was doing and she tells me that she has been re-evaluating our friendship because she feels like I wasn't there for her during her wedding festivities. She said she was hurt that I didnt offer to help set up at her prewedding event, and also that I did not treat it as a bachelorette trip but rather as my own personal vacation (maybe because i posted an insta post of myself and not a post about her? But i would post about her on my stories). I couldn't believe I hadn't offered to do that! I felt ashamed for not stepping up during such an important time in her life, so I apologized and she accepted.

Things went back to normal, but then a couple weeks later she started to become avoidant again. I would reach out, but she was very curt. Over the next 4 mos, we have barely talked. All texts were initiated by me and Im frustrated. I texted her a couple of days ago saying I feel like I've been the only one that has been putting in effort. She replies that she agrees she hasn't been putting in effort, and that even though I apologized before, she still feels hurt by the lack of reciprocation by me earlier this year. Again, I'm surprised to hear this. She also knows I was going through a breakup, but I don't think she realizes the depth of the struggle I went through (she's never been thru a breakup before). 

Overall, she has been with me during some tough moments in my life and I agree that it was shitty of me to not offer to help/be there for her, but I LITERALLY was mentally and emotionally incapable to do so at that time, hence why I didn't even THINK of it in the first place.

I'm upset that she isn't giving me a bit of compassion and grace for a really low moment in my life. It's just unfortunate that my breakup and her wedding happened at the same time. Also, I tried to reconnect and make amends and learn from her critiques, but she chooses to ""be distant"".

We’re both in our mid 20’s, I have met his family on countless occasions and we talk about the future together – I’d say things are getting pretty serious quite quickly.

Last month his sister came back from a 1-year exchange program, showed him and his flatmate pictures of the many places she visited, and they (he+flatmate) decided right away they wanted to drop everything and do something similar (traveling around) for 3 months next summer. He told me as if the decision had been made and there was no room for discussion

Even though I didn't like the idea, at first I thought it wasn't my place to be upset about it because we didn't know each other for that long and he was free to do whatever he wanted. But as I saw he was very serious about it and never even asked my opinion on the matter or discussed it with me before deciding to go, it started bothering me. Especially when he started talking about quitting his job and what to do with the apartment while they were away. It just seemed like a bunch of big decisions where I was not taken into consideration

Eventually I told him it was bothering me. He told me he understood where I was coming from but that trip was something he really wanted to do. He said he indeed hadn't thought about how it would be to stay away for so long, but that we’d had a lot of time together before it happened - but he also wants to go backpacking before that

A couple of days ago we talked about it again and he said some things that really bother me. He said he feels like soon enough life could get serious (meaning “maybe in 2 years we already have a kid and it’s not just the two of us”) so he wants to enjoy life and travel around and use the money he's been saving from his hard work before that happens. That really upset me. I am finishing my studies and hopefully will start working soon, so I can't drop everything and just travel around with him now. He's free to go and do what he wants with his money, but I don't think it's fair of him to expect to go and enjoy his life without me and then come back and pick things up from where he’d left them, settle down and have kids. I want to get a job, earn my own money and enjoy life with him before having kids

Tbh I don’t have a problem with the trip itself, just the duration and its implications, and I agree expecting him to just not go would make me the TA

I’ve asked a few times now if he could make it a shorter trip (maybe a month?), but he says no; it would not be enough time. I tried to be more understanding and just let it go, but the more I think about it, the more it bothers me

He says this is his first real relationship and he usually acts somewhat impulsively, so maybe that’s why he doesn’t see the issue with his plans and reasoning?

I want to remain anonymous, so I’m gunna be as vague as possible.

   At the time, I (18M) was invited to live with Uncle (24M) and Aunt (26F) across the country. We all always had a great relationship. The only terms for my residents there was to give them rent and help out around the house. I didn’t shirk my responsibilities and payed what I owed. We got along well and life was great.

  After several years, I met G (22F). G wasn’t a complete stranger, I just knew she was close friends with my aunt. Aunt always joked around saying that we should start dating but I never really took it seriously. I ran into G randomly one day and we clicked immediately. We weren’t officially dating, just seeing each other a lot more. I told Aunt what was going on and my interest in G because she always talked about it. Aunt said that she was okay with what we were doing. She seemed pretty indifferent to the situation, but I didn’t think much of it. Then, life took a turn for the worst.

   The weeks following I noticed a dramatic shift in the household atmosphere. Aunt and Uncle weren’t talking to me unless it was chore or rent related. I would try to talk to them but only would get simple responses. G also told me that Aunt just vanished on her, not responding to any text or calls.

  Everything came too a head when I received a text from each of them. Aunt sent me a long text explained how ungrateful I am and how disrespectful it was for me to go behind her back and get romantically involved with her best friend. Uncle sent me a very short text saying that I need to be completely moved out by the next day. My name was not on any legal documentation binding me to the house, our agreement was strictly between us. So technically, he was within his rights and I was out of luck. 

   Now, what makes me feel like TA is the effects it had on our family, or rather, the lack of. I was on opposite coasts from everyone, so I didn’t expect any help from any of them. However, there was never any discussion on what happened and no one ever called me and asked how I was doing. I was completely on my own and living out of my car. I was being ostracized and I didn’t know why. I would call my dad on occasions and I heard that Aunt and Uncle still visit my other relatives regularly and they carry on like nothing happened.

  That was years ago and I’m doing much better now. I’ve haven’t spoken to Aunt and Uncle since then and I’m completely no contact with my entire family including my parents (everyone just stopped talking to me). I don’t have any regrets with my actions though. I met my soul mate out of it and I’ve been married to G for over a decade now. There are times when I think back on how everyone reacted to the situation and it makes me feel like I’m in the wrong. I’ve come to terms with not seeing my family anymore and I honestly have no interest in reconciliation, I kinda just want to know if it was all my fault.

Background: My 16yo stepdaughter constantly pushes boundaries, breaks rules, lies and manipulates. Both her biological parents are aware of this but have a difficult time sticking to boundaries as she plays them against each other. Anytime stepdaughter doesn't get what she wants she claims she's going to go live with her mom if her dad doesn't break up with me. (He has ft custody.) She used to be able to manipulate him much easier before I took on a caregiver role.
Recently, her hatred and behavior towards me has escalated. I kinda question whether I am physically safe. She has been passive aggressive in the past, but is getting more aggressive.

Last weekend she apparently put some kind of a liquid in her shampoo and showed it to her dad as ""evidence"" that I was fucking with her shampoo. And told him that I put cat puke on her floor. In case it needs saying, no I didn't do either of these things- or anything else maliciously.. I'm not a weird, petty, piece of shit. He obviously knows she's lying and she has therapy on Monday- we will be addressing this. It's disturbing and hurtful.

So circling back around to my original question, I was discussing with my husband how his lack of boundaries in the past has helped her create this narrative that I am a giant asshole. 
I had told him weeks before the first incident in question that if he wasn't going to give her consequences that I felt were adequate, that I did not want to be responsible for her or her friends when he wasnt home. 
He plays in a local band that practices weekly, and on this night it was the third week in a row that she had brought friends home while he was still at band practice. The previous two weeks he assured me he would address it and it would stop, and it did not. So when her friend Evelyn (whom I really like) came over before he was home, I told them that Evelyn would have to wait outside until he got home because Kaileigh was choosing not to follow the rules. 
There was also another time where Kaileigh was told she was not allowed to have a friend sleepover, and she just told her friend to come over anyways. Dad was sleeping after working basically 24 hours straight, so I ended up having to bring her friend home in the middle of the night.
I feel situations like this make it really easy for her to tell all these stories to her friends that aren't true but for them to believe they are. So then she will be talking to her friends on the phone about what a bitch I am and they egg her on and plot to do some pretty fucked up things to me.
He thinks I could have been more personable while still holding my boundaries and that I am just as much a part of the problem.
I admit I could have been more personable but I don't think I was mean at all. I also don't always come off like I try to or think I do.

Send her a message at 08:54 - saying: are we not in a hurry?

She enters the car at 09:00 and tells me i have to drive her first because she needs to be there 10 minutes early?(first time i hear of this).

I tell her no, cant do that. Which ofcourse ignited consequences of unreal proportions. Im not sure I can handle this anymore. Any advice? Might I be unreasonable for sticking to agreed timetables? Too stubborn? AITA?

Last Christmas was the first one since my mother remarried. Im not particularly close with any of my step siblings. We talk once in awhile, and spend time together when i’m in town, but I don’t live in the same city as the rest of my family. 

Anyway, last year I only got my mother and two siblings something for Christmas which became a bit of a fight. I was told I was slighting my new family and “making it clear i didn’t see them as family” by only giving gifts to my biological family. I understood and apologized for making anyone feel hurt or left out and said i honestly just don’t really know them as I wasn’t around them much. 

This year, I don’t know what to do. My financial situation is a lot different at this exact moment and im struggling. I don’t know how i will even afford basics, let alone gifts for the people i always give gifts too. I cannot fathom how I would possibly add 5 more siblings and a step parent to the list.

We’ve been broken up for 2 years, and although we don’t get on particularly well, I often try to make things work as best as possible. 
The issue began when she informed me our son was vegan, almost a year ago. She’d been vegan for a few years at this point, but we’d agreed we would let him do whatever he wants. Tell me if Im wrong but surely a 3 year old(at the time) can’t make the decision to be vegan- when he still doesn’t even know the meaning of the word. 

Me and the ex ended up having a massive argument about this when she told me, because I don’t believe he could make that decision for himself. Just because you ask the kid if he wants to be vegan &amp; he says yes does not mean he knows what it means- he still can’t tell me the meaning of the word. 

I have him 3 days a week &amp; don’t feed him a vegan diet. He eats whatever I’m eating, and is fine with it. I’ve even asked him if he’s cool eating meat &amp; having cow milk with his cereal etc and he says yes. The kid doesn’t care about what he eats, but ex gf has now found out, and gone mental, saying I’m disrespecting his right &amp; has also told our son that it’s not okay what he’s eating  &amp; made him fearful of food. 

I want my 4 year old to have a good relationship with food, and he was fine before she started interfering with his diet.

I never knew how I felt about her except that she was an amazing friend who I loved talking to, but the more I talked to her I realized that I’m the happiest with her and not in just a friend ship way. I started having dreams every night where we would hold hands or do something sweet in a “coupley” view. I ignored these dreams considering I figured she was straight and only saw me as a friend.

Ideally I thought I was that, but I continued to ignore my feelings. This is when I met my now partner. Going back to when we never texted, my close friend (the girl) started texting me more and we played video games again together. I kept finding myself wanting to text her.

Day before Yesterday morning one of my employees ""Jessie"" came in obviously upset about something, she'd been crying, seemed shaken up. One of the other workers asked what happened and Jessie told us she'd almost been in an accident and it could have been really bad. 

A side note, they've been doing construction on the highway in our area and recently built a new part of the highway and put in a big new stop light. They just changed the traffic pattern so that the old highway is now non-accessible. Eventually it's going to be a four lane highway running east and west but right now they only have the two east-boubd lanes open, the left side for west-bound, the right lane for east-bound.

Jessie explained that she'd been out of town for the week (early Thanksgiving) and the old highway had still been open. She found out at 7am on her day back that traffic had been re-routed and she was unaware there was a four way intersection. She said that the new way is unfamiliar, it was still a little dark, and the speed limit is 55. The new intersection is around a bend on a small incline. Jessie said the intersection suddenly appeared out of nowhere and she ran a red light and nearly t-boned another car. 

That's definitely scary, I can understand her being upset. But she didn't actually get in an accident, everyone is fine, she is not injured, she learned from her mistake. But she spent a good couple hours having a pout about it, dropping things, being jumpy. At one point it began to feel like attention-seeking so I told her she'd had her moment, she'd gotten to have emotions, but I needed her to get over it and do her job.

Needless to say she did not like that and spent the rest of her shift stomping around, being grumpy, rude to me, snappy with the guests and her coworkers. Eventually I cut her shift and sent her home because people were complaining. Our franchise owner called us later and said Jessie complained about me for being rude and unkind.

We have done the holidays the same way for those 5 years.
On thanksgiving we will go to my family’s first for the first part of the day, then the second day we will go to his family’s. That way we get to spend equal time and he gets to see his family and I see mine.
On Christmas Eve we visit mine, they never really do anything on Christmas Day haven’t in years so I figure Christmas Eve is better with them. And Christmas Day we are with his family because we open presents at his moms then go to grandmas and have lunch play games with the family visit have dinner play more games is a whole thing with them.
It’s managed to work out perfectly for us and no stress. Especially with our anniversary being the 23rd of December it just makes it easier for us to plan things this way.
Well this year it kind of took a turn.
For slight backstory, my mom passed away when I was little, and so I had my dad and my moms parents. My dad was in the military so all four of us ended up moving in together. At first it was good when I was young living with them but my grandma just got worse and worse, I was like a live-in slave it felt like. I mean definitely other people have had it way worse than me but it was really hard for me and it feels like she’s trying to make me into my mom reincarnated. Constantly guilts me with “your mom would be rolling in her grave right now” and such sayings as that. She is also a very stuck in her old ways type of person.
With that being said I do love her but I hate going over there a lot because she just makes it very mentally straining. 
Now for my boyfriend, his family is more like an “adopted family” and he loves them very much and so do I they helped heal us from our mental trauma and raised him since he was young and left his home and me since I moved in there at 18. They are a very loving family and we love to be there with them for everything so this is obviously the place we always want to go to.
Now my grandma has been going off on me for the past few weeks for splitting thanksgiving and says I need to choose one family and even at one point suggested we spend it apart he goes to his I go to mine, but we refuse to do that we want to spend the holidays together as well. It worked out fine this year we were able to spend quality time with both families and give everyone equal attention.
Well then today she decides to pull my boyfriend aside and have this huge talk and according to him at one point she was slandering me and saying this wasn’t how I was raised and he stood up for me and told her to stop slandering me. He then told me about the talk and then she tried telling me the absolute opposite of what happened like he wouldn’t tell me. 
Now here is where I really think I might be TA, I just found out a week ago she got diagnosed with cancer and while that makes me sad she tried guilting me with that and just a whole bunch of other things that I’m used to hearing.

Recently, I have started talking to someone new, now before any of you judge me and say this is too fast to move on mind you that a week after we broke up she confessed her feelings to a classmate of hers (and got rejected), she told me about it because I made it clear that I really have no problem with it.
My ex on the other hand, can get very jealous and I didn't want her to get hurt so I decided to not let her know, unfortunately she started suspecting it and asked me over and over until i told her, well, let's just say my assumption was correct and she started calling me a bunch of names out of anger and jealousy and saying that I have no idea how to treat women.

It was a lengthy process of slowly losing my feelings for her due to anger meltdowns and blaming me over basically anything, until I eventually understood that she is not the right one for me.

But now I'm left wondering, AITA for moving on too quick? And should I even stay in contact with her?

I have decided to enlighten the world as to why many people keep calling me an AH. I work as a hostess in a restaurant and for my lovely job, I help the bussers bus when needed. One day I walk into the restaurant greeting my fellow over wor- I mean co-workers. 

I place the exact number of cutlery and menus my wonderful boss decides to make my day better and tells me we have a table of 34 coming in 20 minutes. I have never been happier since the bigger the table the bigger the tip. Oh, I have never been so wrong.

I take my joyful ass and start placing their cutlery down in their designated section. 20 minutes go by and all hell has finally broken loose. In walks 30 little toe sucking nail-biting gremlin looking ankle biting devil spawn rug rat demons all fucking with the signs and posters and once those evil entities walked in I knew I was in world war 3 except it was me against 30 demons. 

I take the spawns to their section and they all sit in their seats after the four parents who came with yelled at them to sit. As I tell them about today's special I hear a gremlin scream, “ma’am!” I turn to look at the spawn of Satan holding a pack of creamers already set on their tables since we had thought there would be more adults accompanying these warthogs. 

Just like in the movies everything goes into slow motion as this little disgrace of a sperm squeezes the creamer popping it and making it swim faster than any sperm out there, dropping right onto me. It was only a little until I go to turn around and his little henchmen goblin fuckers are all holding creamers. At that moment I knew I would need to surrender cause oh great heavens of fucking hell 15 little demon-sucking bitches pop cream all over me while 10 others throw open sugar packets on me. The manager saw what had happened and came to my side only for her to get squirted with the creamers. As I turn to the parents in absolute shock I’m met with them laughing at me. As my manager tells them they would have to leave immediately they get defensive claiming it was just “all fun in games.” 

No Martha cream getting spilled all over you with sugar on top of that does not amuse me so take ur god-awful kids outta here. 

I told the manager if she does not ban these morons right on the spot, I would quit. We are already severely understaffed and she loves me like a daughter so she did.

They refused to leave therefore the cops were called and they were kicked out and banned from the restaurant. As a hostess, I had to help clean the atrocious mess those fuckers left behind.

Later on, some co-workers pulled me aside saying I overreacted and that in the service industry things will always get messy but banning kids from a family restaurant was going too far. 

So that got me thinking if I went too far and pulled out the AH card.

My sister held Thanksgiving at her place last night.  I am an atheist and she is a Christian.   She is aware of how I feel, because I've declined to attend church in the past.

She said she wanted everyone to say grace before the food was served.  She asked me to lead the prayer. I said that I thought that it would be better if she did it, because she was the hostess, and she looked very embarrassed.  I could have said that it is because I felt uncomfortable, but I didn't want to offend anyone who is religious. During the prayer, I sat there quietly, while everyone else joined hands.  Family went around the table saying what they were grateful for her.  I said I was grateful we could all get together as a family.  When it was her turn, sister listed many things she was grateful for and looked at me disapprovingly, as if I wasn't putting enough effort into praying.  She then asked everyone to sing a religious song.  I sat there quietly while they sang, then we all ate.

My sister didn't say anything, but she was cold to me the rest of the night and when we went to bed, someone had put a Bible on the pillow that I don't remember being there before.

I'm not going to lie.  I dont want to and I have no intrest to. And she keep trying and wont take the hint.

When I was pretty much an infant my dad had to take me into his custody due to my mother not being a fit mother . She was always out parting and doing drugs etc . She was even drinking and smoking while she was still carring me. My dad pretty much soon as I was born started the ""custody battle"" . It wasn't much of a battle sense she was really compliant anyways and gave me up with no fight. 

Durring this time not only did she not have 2 more kids but also never paid any child support. My dad was alone taking care of me and juggling a job AND college (he was young when they had me) so he was always struggling but he did what he had to do. She even had the audacity to call my dad many of times asking for bail money or random money and that's the only time she talked to him or tried to come see me. The whole coming to see me was maybe 4 times from the ages of 5-18yrs Old. 

Shes even had my brother and sister taken from her and put into foster care. I never found out why they ended up there but it was probably from the few warrants she had. I dunno. Growing up I always wanted to know why she never wanted really anything to do with me . And never came to a single birthday party , christmas or anything like that. Not a single one.   It hurt alot as I grew up . Not having a mother figure really. My grand mother ended up helping my father for a few years so he could get a head on a few things with how swamped with Bill's he got. .. 


After I hit about age 16 I just stopped caring and finally came to terms that my mother just didnt care about me. And probably never will. And tht my real mom was my grandmother. And I'd never change tht sense I loved the hell out of my granny.  About a year or so later she finally reached out and wanted to get together. My dad said it was completely up to me and we can do this if I want but I dont have to. Well I gave her a chance. Even two. But I just felt nothing.

She would keep messaging me saying hi and I love you and tagging me in daughter posts etc. But I would just ignore her. I feel bad I really do cuz it does look like shes trying. I just dont want to connect with her . She was never there growing up and shes pretty much a stranger to me at this point. My sister wants me to try but I just dont.

I have a job that is not on a set schedule, I often have to work weekends, nights etc. This year for thanksgiving I actually had the day off. My husband and I recently moved back home and I was stoked that we’d actually get to spend the holiday with his family. The original plans were to all have thanksgiving at my in laws. My husband’s sister’s husband for whatever reason, hates traditional thanksgiving food and pretty much derailed the rest of the family’s plans to celebrate on Thursday. I was told a week in advance that instead of having thanksgiving on Thursday that the family was going to have lunch on Friday. Unfortunately I work all day Friday so I told the family it was fine but I wouldn’t be attending. My mother in law felt bad and said we would just switch it back to actual thanksgiving. Then two days later I was told they would actually be having thanksgiving on Saturday now. I also work Saturday at 4 so while I thanked them for the invite I politely declined. I was told by my husbands family that there would be “no pressure” if I couldn’t make it. I was actually super relieved and while it sucked I couldn’t spend the time with them I was ok with it. A day later my husband tells me that his parents can’t wait for me to be at thanksgiving and even though I can only stay til around 3 they’re happy I’ll be there. I was so shocked and pretty annoyed at this point that I was expected to be there even though this was discussed at length. I explained the situation to my husband who at the time found it comical and said “We’ll think of an excuse to get out of it.” Flash forward to thanksgiving day and I bring up the plan to my husband who abruptly tells me he can’t get out of his family’s thanksgiving he also tells me to suck it up and just go before work. My issue is that I don’t want to deal with a bunch of family Im not close to and eat a bunch of food right before I have to go to my high stress job. My husband is now mad at me too. I ended up lying to my in laws and saying I have to work earlier than I actually have to.

Long story short:

I tried buying a car off of my friends. I put money into this car for repairs. $315 worth and was set to pay them $800 after my honeymoon for the cat itself. None of the work was ever put in other than the work I did. I was lied to about there being insurance and modern tags on the car. I was going to get new ones anyways. Chad, the fiancé of my former best friend of 12 years, is lying his ass off saying he told me to not take it even though he gave me the keys for the vehicle the day I drove off with it.

I ended up in a wreck with the vehicle, one that was suppose to have been fixed but hadn’t been. The brakes were faulty and in no condition to be driven. I thought they were just tight like cars I had previously had.

He is now lying about everything and making her deal with it all. They are demanding the full $800 by 12/1/22 for the vehicle but I don’t know if I should even have to considering the vehicle nearly got me killed. 

If I don’t pay it they are threatening to take me to court…

Some of these details include: 
He had three months to fix the car 

We bled the front brakes together but he neglected to tell me we needed to do the back too before my wreck. 

This was the day of my wedding rehearsal dinner 

We’ve made several offers to pay in installments which they either denied or failed to cash checks until they would’ve bounced as a result of our other expenses.

I’m happy to celebrate Jack's bday, albeit he has never done anything for mine (This year he blew off our mutual friend Lucy’s bday dinner for a Grindr hookup). 

This year, he asked me to plan a bday for him that would be “super bougie and good for taking pics and making everyone jealous” Not my thing, but whatever, it’s his bday and this is a typical Jack style request.

I sent him ideas and we made plans for during the day, he sent me places he wanted to go for dinner afterwards (Michelin star places, so not the price range I was comfortable footing the bill for). Lucy and I had been planning to take him to a nice restaurant we already knew he liked. Not a 5 star establishment but still a nice upscale place. When we told him the plan for dinner that day, he was annoyed that we hadn’t booked one of the places he had suggested but said he was cool with it. The entire bday ended up being an insta photo shoot for him to get pics to to make his ex-boyfriend “see him living his best life”. That evening, I ordered a car to the restaurant and he says Oh..we’re actually going here. I said Ya, I thought this was what we settled on this afternoon. I asked if he wanted to go somewhere else then and he said no let's just stay here (I was pretty annoyed at this point by petty comments he had been making about how the day wasn’t ‘bougie’ enough)

He spent the dinner on his phone going through photos from the day and asking us to help edit them and write captions. The group of us don’t get together that often anymore and I had hoped his bday was going to be us enjoying time together.

He wanted us to go to a bar after dinner and Lucy and I both said we were going to head home. I quit drinking several months ago, but he had been pushing alcohol on me all day and I wasn't interested in continuing to deal with that (I'm fine with other people drinking, I just don't want to). We were not totally abandoning him, another friend was there as well. He lost it on us and told us we could leave if we took him and his friend to a bar where a friend of ours was headed and “introduced them to her and got them settled”. I knew our friend wouldn’t be ok with that so he called other friends and they decided to meet up with them. He stood there saying nothing for so long that I wasn’t sure what to do so I said sooo you want me to order you guys a car? He said yes and waited while I got him a cab. His entitled attitude has put me in so many situations where I end up footing his bills, lending him money, or even managing his money for him (I know, I’m a weak bitch when friends ask me for favours). Neither Lucy nor I have spoken to him since his birthday although he’s messaged a few times.

Friends are saying it’s an asshole move to freeze out a friend with no explanation. I think having a conversation would just lead to unnecessary drama.
