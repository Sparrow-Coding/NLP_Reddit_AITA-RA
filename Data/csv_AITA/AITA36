So for context months ago my (20F) group of 7 friends decided to take a trip to Bali. We booked and organised things months ago. The relavent people are Liz, James, luke and Emily. Im also not that close with Luke and Emily but close with Liz and James Also important to note that Liz and I are the biggest drinkers and go the hardest where as the others don't drink that much.

Anyway so since booking everything I discovered that I no longer want to be friends with Emily as she made several sexually suggestive comments towards me to the point of harrassment, as well as making me generally uncomfortable. Now I become tense when I'm in the same room so I decided that I would not be hanging out with her during the trip as I can't relax when she's there. I paid a lot for this holiday and wanted it to be an enjoyable time.I told James and Liz and they agreed they wouldn't either but there were other people going that she could be with so I thought she'd be fine. Liz and I planned to drink most the time anyway, which the others probably won't want to do. I was supposed to be in a room with James and another friend. And Emily was supposed to be in a room with Luke and another friend. However, the problem is the other person in Emily's room had a family emergency shortly before we left and couldn't go. This friend acted like a bridge between Luke and Emily so it was probably very awkward since they were now alone in the room. Also the friend that was no longer coming was basically Emily's only friend. I could be the asshole here because I decided this didn't affect my decision because even though she now has no friends and was awkwardly forced to sleep in a room with just luke, I still opted not to hang out with her.

During the trip James began constantly trying to guilt trip is into hanging out with Luke by saying ""but he's alone with Emily"" knowing I'd sympathise with that. But if we wanted to invite Luke out, Emily would follow him around since she didnt really have any friends now. I'd tell him he can go hang with them but I won't, as liz was more than happy to go get fucked up together. He didn't want to go without us as he's more of an introvert where as Liz and I aren't. He would get mad call us stuff like selfish assholes and storm off. This sort of thing happened a few times. Everytime I told him you can hang out with Luke if you feel bad and Liz and I will go somewhere for a drink. Then he told Liz and I our lying to avoid Emily was ruining his trip. Liz and I were confused bc we'd had a great time and also felt that the constant guilt tripping was putting a damper on our trip. We didn't tell him this tho bc he's sensitive and we knew he'd get mad. And we just didn't want to start an argument so we just held our tongue. He called us assholes again and left.

Me and my family are not verry rich, so I can only afford to rent a small room, and most of my paycheck goes to just staying alive. My parents work ekstra hard to help me pay for my theraphy and overall they are good people. They like my partner, treat them like part of the family and when I came out as non binary they were supportive (useing my new name ect.).
My partner (Let's call them K) and I are together 3 years, planning a futhure together. The problem is theirs parents. They live all together in a big 4 store house. Since I started dating K their parents exprest only dislike of me, it got worse as the time past. If i did something awfull to their child I would understand their hate towards me but we are in a really healthy relationship, we share hobbys, support each other, make each other laugh and K is fully acceoting of me beeing non binary. They openly said that their problem with me is that I'm not ,,right,  for their child because they expected their partner to be a tall, hyper femme girl with a lot of money, from a rich family. Besides that they hate that we are long term partner as they would prefer for K to date around at least till 30.
When I visit K their parents are cold towards me, treat me like I'm not there or pass some snarky remarks about me. Ofc they also refer to me by my deadname. I'm an anxiouse person so going along with it takes a tool on my mental health. I can't even use a shower when I stay over cause the main bathroom is conected to their bedroom. They get angry when I stay for more than 1 night, order my partner to work on the house/run erends for them without giving them a heads up, because of that a lot of our plans gets canceled, when we are out they call my partner A LOT, overall K's and his parents relationship is rather unhealthy as they control every aspekt of his life, down to finances.
And so I try to push K to move out, I don't care if with me or alone or with someone else, just out of their house. K argues that if they move out they gonna get disovened (tbh I think they parents are just doing a power play as K is their only child)/they are not ready as they want to finnish theirs college. I agree that they should finnish college (its gonna take a year) first so they can have easier time moving out and getting a job. But after that if they dont try to move out I am concidering breaking up with them as I can't imagine dealing with this kind of family dynamic for rest of my life even if a break up would rip my heart out. I really love them.

We’re not wealthy or live in a bad area, but we lost my sister to cancer 10 years ago. Everyone says that’s why they’re overprotective. My curfew is 9pm. I constantly have to update them where I am and who I’m with. I always have to ask in advance if I can go outside (church, school, groceries), I have a car but I’m not allowed to drive. They didn’t allow me to get a driver’s license so they hired a driver for me. Everyone says I’m lucky to have parents who care so much. But I feel like they’re manipulative and possessive. Nov 30, I passed my nurse licensure exam. Dec 1 was my birthday. Dec 2, my friends all passed the exam too and decided to eat then hang out. We’re having fun (no booze, just 6 girls and 2 guys talking) and they suggest a sleepover to watch movies. My parents don’t like me staying out late, so 7pm I asked if I can sleep over. My mom sounded weak (she was fine earlier, we last spoke at 2pm) and she didn’t answer my question. All she said was “I’m sick” but when I asked what’s wrong and if she wanted me to take her to the ER, she hung up. 20 mins later she messages me calling me a disappointment because I chose my friends over her. I tried calling her over and over but she didn’t answer. When she finally did, I asked again if she needed anything and if she needed me to bring her to the ER. She yelled “No, since you chose your friends over me!” then hung up again. So I left and got home at 8:20 and my mom is just sitting down, still wet from the shower. My aunt and cousin were home. I asked again what’s wrong, she yelled, “You’re a nurse, you should know! Can’t you see?” I was confused because she’s not bleeding, is not having a stroke or heart attack. She’s pretty healthy for 60 with no hypertension, asthma, or diabetes. So I ask again and she says her body hurts. I asked if I can go buy her meds and she said she bought them already but hasn’t taken it yet. So I said please take your meds, rest, and put ice compress. Then she readies to go to sleep and I ask, may I leave now or do you need anything else? But she flips out saying that since I’m a nurse I should know automatically what she needs and that I chose her friends over her. Idk I lost it and just started yelling at her to let me live, I’ve done literally everything they wanted. I was the top of my class, student council president, graduated with latin honors and leadership and community service awards. I never went to bars or clubs, I even missed classes to go with my mom whenever she wanted to go somewhere. I said just want one night for fun. Then I packed my stuff and left for the sleepover. 

Now the family says I’m wrong and rude and should go back home to apologize. I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong (aside from yelling at her and going to the overnight) but everyone said to let it pass and apologize.

Hello Reddit. English is not my first language!

I (M25) have a friend (F24) who (if i put in the nicest way possible) doesn't do shit to work on her issues. I receive messages everyday about her daily drama - with her mom, her office, her health, the men she likes. And trust me when I say this, I have tried to listen to her. Sometimes she just wants to rant and doesn't want any input, so I just listen. Other times, she wants my opinion and I believe I have her given her reasonable advice. Now, I would have been okay with it if I saw her work on these issues but she doesn't - one of them being confessing to a man (she's liked him from when she was in HS ; he has a girlfriend now) that she likes him...because she thinks she owes her 13 y/o self that ??????? NOT WHEN HE IS ALREADY DATING aah? I have told her that it is not a good idea at all.

She has told me that she has MAJOR self-esteem issues, feels depressed more often than not and I have suggested that she see a therapist, especially when money is not a issue for her. She just hasn't and tbh her problems are not extra-ordinary and things that I and even some of you go through but just doesn't want to manage it and has been dumping it all on me and frankly I am tired.

I didn't want to deal w the daily negativity plus it also hurts me to see her struggle. Yesterday when we she sent me another essay-length rant, i just sent her my therapist's number. She has not replied and I have a strong feeling that she is upset with me.

When I asked if I could bring some of my family's traditional food, mother inlaw declined politely and said it's because the dish I planned to bring has nothing to do with christmas celebration. I thought that was somewhat rude and distespectful. I insisted since everyone is allowed to bring something but she tried to tell me what to bring instead like sweets or something but I don't bake. She said I could order from the bakery but I got into an argument with her and decided to not come since my food was excluded. My husband found out and tried to make justifications saying that the dish I wanted to bring was traditional for my culture but not his. He said his mom was just worried no one would eat it and all my time and effort go in vain. I told him my decision was final and that I expect him to stay with me for christmas but he refused and called me unreasonable for not only refusing to go over some dish....but also expecting him to not go as well since this is the only family time he gets with his family.

They bought a flat so they could live closer to town, and reduce up keep of the home in retirement.
They planned to put the house up for sale later, We got an OK from the bank provided we sold our appartment first. We signed the contract with my parents to take over the house the same day as we handed over the keys to our appartment.
My wife and I working full time, &amp; our son being full time in school, we could only move on weekends. We agreed upon time, place, and days for us to move our things in to the house.
We were met with nothing prepared. we pushed on to the sound of my mother repeatedly yelling «what do you need all this stuff for?»
we had their green light to start at the agreed upon time and place.
To get to the designated location, a room next to my nephews (m25) bedroom with a common door.
After the first weekend of we got called up and told that my nephew needed to sleep in, so in future we could only move things in the evenings. We explained that we did not have time for that, &amp; they had previously suggested the arrangement.
To mend fences we were invited for coffee, But only I went as my wife was cleaning out the rooms we had emptied and decorating them for viewing.
At coffee my parents informed me «we promised Chuck he could Stay as long as we stay.» 
I replied «OK? What about my wife, son, &amp; I?»
Mumbling was the reply
«That room he is staying in, we had planned for our son. Is he supposed to move back &amp; forth?»
They said that they would move Chuck to a different room before we needed to move. They called him, &amp; ditto. there was limited room with 5 people, and this unexpected freeloader would make things even tighter.
They claimed to understand. We got the place ready for viewing quickly. Not without several more days moving our things and being told «why can’t you just throw this out?» and «why do you need all this?» etc
One day Chuck &amp; Iwent Disc golfing, &amp; I took the opportunity to ask what plans he had for finding a place of his own. He replied with «the grandparents promised I could stay there, so f* off»
I left it at that, as I did not want to create a fight.
We got a buyer, But we had to be out in no more than 3 weeks. we informed everyone and got OK

We took ownership of the house, and asked my nephew to either pay rent or find a place to live as we could not afford a freeloader.

I asked about my Beanie Babies (knowing that they were also in the attic). My step-mother said that she didn't get them down from the attic but would in the near future and she would ship them to me. 6 months later, I asked again. She again said she would ship them. A few months later, I was talking to my Aunt and mentioned the Beanie Babies (because my Aunt also helped collect them). My aunt informed me that I would never be given my Beanie Babies back because my step-mother thinks that they are worth a lot of money. I didn't want them for money. I've done my research. They're most likely not worth anything. I wanted them to share with my children. My youngest loves stuffed animals and she would just die to see that many Beanie Babies. With that being said, my step-mother and Father did pay off my student loans a few years back.

I had gone out of my way to support her when she graduated uni and helped her get her first job, i lent her money when she needed it , have been always there for her through tough times, and even supported her to seek help mentally from a therapist when she wasnt doing okay due to family circumstances.

After all these years since the last few months she had started to cut me out from her life. There were multiple instances when we would make plans and she would arrive late or would cancel plans to hang out. 
When we would hang out it would be in a group setting with her other friends and she would barely talk to me.
I distanced myself away to take a break from the friendship as i felt it was toxic to me and she wasnt there when i really needed her. So i stopped being available to her all the time- thats when things changed and she started demanding why i was being cold and distant.


I let her know that i was upset with the way she was treating me and shunning me away by acting like i didnt matter and this friendship was basically a chore for her.
She admitted she was being distant on purpose but wanted to work through things- I said i needed time and during this period ( about 2 months) she kept consantantly trying to get in touch with me.

I finally decided to let go of my anger and try giving the frienship a go again considering our history. I messaged her but she basically said she wasnt interested anymore and has been ignoring me.

I live overseas and can’t attend the funeral. I’m trying not to think too much about him. I was told around 6pm today that he passed and told my fiancée around 7pm. I don’t want to talk about my grandfather cause it will just trigger me to cry. So I’ve just been pushing it to the back of my head. He was the most amazing person and he is in a better place now but I feel like shit today. 

Anyways my fiancée calls me to check if I’m fine. He says he thinks I’m coping better than he thought. After the call I was sending him pictures of my grandpa and reminiscing and he suddenly stops responding. I ask him why and he messages me ‘My mum is complaining of shortness of breath. We are seeing if we can find her a doctor. She has complaining about some symptoms for a week but tonight, she’s finding it difficult.’ I was upset that in the midst of talking about my grandpa he tells me this but I respond telling him to take her to the doctor right away and not to delay it. Then he messages me that she has appointment tomorrow at 12:30pm and ‘I’d be so lost without my mum
I hope god gives my mum a long life. Health is so precious.’ And says goodnight. I don’t respond.

I admit I was pissed. He had the entire week to take his mum to the hospital and be proactive but does nothing but won’t let me vent about my grandpa for a few hours before going on about his mum. I decide it’s best if I go to bed and talk to him tomorrow. 

Then he calls me to vent about his mum. I told him there is a simple solution, just take her to the hospital. I admit my tone wasn’t nice and told him it was so stupid he hasn’t done this already. For info his mum also got diagnosed with diabetes a few months ago but refuses to take the medication and has just been trying to change her diet. Like why is he whinging about it when there is a simple solution. Take her to the hospital. He ended the call after he said I was being rude and  I said I couldn’t talk about this today. 

AITA for just wanting one day to talk about my problem. I feel like screaming at him tbh. Throughout our entire relationship I feel like I’ve been there for him emotionally and physically. His grandpa died last year and I would have never reacted this way. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting cause my judgment is clouded. 

For further context I should add he has a very very close relationship with his mum. Sometimes I think it’s unusual. He ties her shoelaces and has an irrational fear she is going to die. I like my mother in law; it has been slightly difficult navigating wedding planning with her but for the most part she treats me really well. But sometimes I can’t help but get pissed cause I feel my fiancé will always choose her over me.

I know this sounds fucked up. But I need help from someone who won't judge for my looks. Aria broke up with her boyfriend, male (15), who I will call Tom, last Friday. Today, she said that she was already fan girling for two boys.

I told Tom this because they dated for 2 years and felt like he needed a piece of mind to move on. Aria tells everyone everything that's happening, and will leave details out. This is the place where all of the details are.

Turns out, he texted her confronting her even though I told him not to tell anyone. I told her that I didn't say anything but eventually she caught on and I confessed that I told him. She got mad and asked why? I told her that I told him because he deserved to know. I didn't mean to cause harm. I just thought that it would give him at piece of mind that you're moving on and he should too. This argument proceeds when she reply's that it obviously would've caused harm. I told her that she could hate me all she wanted because we haven't been communicating for the past few months.
She says to not go there and that I ditched her for my boyfriend, male (16), who I’ll call Harvey.

I say that she ditched me for another friend, female (15), who I’ll call Josie. She claims that as soon as I got with Harvey, I left her behind.

I say,

“How? How did I leave you? I was texting you almost every day. I tried to keep our “bestie” relationship even though I noticed that you were hanging out Josie more. But you kept pushing me away. When I was with Harvey I kept me friendship with you the same. I didn’t stop a call with you to call with him, I just called in the gc. Josie pushed me away too so I was done with it. You started pushing me away a few weeks after I broke up with Harvey.”

Harvey and I have gotten back together as we talked it out. We didn’t want to tell anyone though so it is a secret. 

Aria replies, 

""yeah cs i was done with having to watch everything i say just in case it would trigger you. I was practically walking on glass be if i said one wrong this u would ignore me.""

Aria sometimes would say stuff to insult my looks or so, and me, being a very insecure person, took it to heart.

I called my mum and she informed me her dad (my pop) had passed unexpectedly in the night aged 67. Obviously this was not the family member we were all bracing ourselves for. 

I felt numb. I was starting work in 2 hours and didn’t know what to do. I am autistic and don’t show my emotions much, but I do feel them a lot, I needed some time to process. 

I messaged my boss informing her that I would not be in that day and explained why.

Anyway, the next day, I was rostered on for a quick 3 hour shift. I thought it might be a good distraction. I was on my way to work when my boss called. She was surprised I was coming in but happy with it. So I show up to work and the second in charge person said he wasn’t expecting me to be there as I wasn’t there yesterday. I told him that my pop died. He said he was sorry to hear that and I said it wasn’t a good thing to wake up to. 
So about 5 minutes later, he came up to me and told me that not showing up to work puts a lot of work on everyone else. And that it’s happened a few times that I haven’t shown up (not true, I have called in sick twice in the 3 months I’ve been here. I have been rostered on outside my availabilities and some have been things I couldn’t work around, I’m also casual so don’t need to get approved leave etc) so I just continued working. 

He did all this in front of a new employee too. 
He later asked me to start at 6am the next day and I said no then he ranted about how people don’t want to work anymore etc. so I ended up saying yes to get him off my back.

I am also half Chinese and half Indian and speak Chinese fluently. So growing up in a very white area as a WOC was... an *experience*, to say the least.

My school is about 65% white. That may seem like pretty good diversity, but to put it in perspective, I had never had another Indian friend (let alone meet another Indian person that I wasn't related to) until eighth grade.

Anyways, getting to the point: Growing up as a WOC in a very white area made me stick out like a sore thumb. Elementary school was easy since no one cares about race when you're 7, but once I got to middle school, people started being weird around me because I was Asian, and they thought anything mean they said (even if it was a joke) would come off as racist. The only way I thought I could really fit in was if I could bring some levity about my race. So, I started to make a lot of jokes about my race.

Recently, my school rolled out a campaign against microaggressions, which I appreciate because I do get questions like ""So where are you really from?"" or ""Can you speak Indian?"" all the time. However, some of my white friends now get uncomfortable when I make jokes about my race. I've honestly cooled down on making those kinds of jokes since middle school, but I still make them pretty often. I don't really have any friends that are POC, and the ones I do have aren't Asian, so most of the time they don't even get my jokes.

I've started to feel more insecure recently because of this. Some of my white friends have even asked me to stop making jokes about my race around them, and most of them just laugh uncomfortably when I do make them. I don't ever want to make my friends feel uncomfortable, so I've stopped, but it makes me feel like I don't fit in anymore.

I don't think my white friends were ever being racist when they laughed at my jokes because that was *the point*, and I know they aren't racist.

But about a few months ago me and my dad went to the mall where we ran into this friend surprisingly. We had a chat and all was well, we parted ways and my dad asked me “she’s the one you’ve had sleepovers with right” and I was like yeah. But before I could finish my sentence he mutters “probably up to mischief in the bedroom”. This took me by surprise, so of course I went red and denied it. I was very embarrassed.

That was recent, it was like a little birthday thing. we didn’t get to sleep until 2am, our mattresses were deflated, it was funny though. I worked the next day and my dad goes through at the end of my shift and he asked about the sleepover. I mentioned both of my friends were there and we couldn’t get to sleep until like 2 because of the bed being all weird.

This 100% implied the same thing he said about her the first time. I don’t really get his deal. Does he trust me? Does he not? If he didn’t trust me he wouldn’t let me stay a whole weekend in a hotel with her, and he DEFINITELY wouldn’t let her sleep over as much as she does, especially with summer coming up. So, what I’ve devised was that I’m going to let this continue for as long as it can, until one day something does happen between a future partner. So when he asks about what may have happened I’ll just very bluntly say what happened. Just to embarrass HIM. I will embarrass him as much as he did the first few times. I don’t care wherever he asks me inevitably I will just outright say what happened. This may make me TA because it’s uncomfortable. Nobody wants to hear their child admit they had sex like that.

Here we go. I (29M) was engaged to my now ex (27F) back in November 2020. We broke up because I was very unstable, both mentally and physically. I would have outbursts of anger, then just waves of sadness followed by rage. My girlfriend thought it was dangerous for her to be associated with me. I felt the same way. I love her wholeheartedly and would never wish anything negative upon her, so the breakup was mutual and we kept in touch.

Fast forward to February 2021, this is around the time she met her new boyfriend (29M), as we were in a good spot, she kept me updated on her relationship. She described meeting him as a ""breath of fresh air"" and ""seeing the light at the end of the longest tunnel of her life"". I was happy for her. She said they instantly clicked, which was partly why they went on to get engaged in January 2022. I tried to be happy but deep down I still loved her. She's the love of my life. Now they scheduled the wedding for November 2022, on their 2nd anniversary. She invited me to the wedding and asked if I could DJ for the wedding because she knew I loved music. But I also think she felt awkward just having me as a guest.

So I arrive at the wedding. It was breathtaking. Prettier than whatever wedding I would've planned for us. She handed me a ""do and don't"" playlist, and I followed it. However, as it came to the end of the wedding, a wave of sadness rushed over me as I realized now that things would never be able to return to how they were. I played ""When I was your man"" by Bruno Mars. I thought of it as a way for me to say my final goodbye to her and our relationship. But as soon as she heard the song she didn't look happy. Her husband tried to get her to stay on the dance floor so she wouldn't make a scene but she just dashed out of the room and her husband followed her.

After that, her mom and husband came over to me and asked what the hell I was thinking and I explained why I played that song, technically she said I could play Bruno Mars so at the time I didn't think there was anything wrong with it, but they told me how my ex felt so bad because she thought that she caused this behavior and she should've just stayed with me because I was struggling even though her heart wasn't in it anymore and how I ruined the night because of how awkward it was after.

Just me, my school homework, the TV and my imagination. (sometimes with my sisters or parents too, but they were all busy)

Anyways, now I moved with my family to another country, learned its language and I am surrounded by more people than I was used to. At first, I was doing anything to get attention, cuz I wanted to be seen, I wanted to be the life of the party. But I have just made a fool out of myself. Being blinded by my own stupidity, I was running for the ones who treated me like shit, while ignoring the people I could have been friends with. Because of not understanding what I was doing wrong back then, I've gotten depressed, which made me seem as the attention-seeking betch. But with the help of my family, I've learned to be more considerate of the ones that deserve it, not concentrate on the mean ppl (I have heart problems and stress is bad for me) and to express myself in a way that resonates with what person I would actually want to be, not trying to seek attention as who I am not.

Because of my past, I am afraid to get commited to my platonic relationships (and probably romantic ones too). I'm afraid to go after the people who I would like to befriend. What if they're just playing? What if I'll hurt someone again? What if they dislike me and only befriend me out of pity?

I know that people would like it if I wasn't so cold, but it's also hard for me to trust new people...

at food time, my mom offered me a slice (knowing i wouldn't want it). i smiled and politely replied ""no thanks!"" and said i would have some fruit off the table instead. my mom rolled her eyes and gave my dad a knowing look before saying ""can't you even enjoy yourself for one day? would one bite throw you over the edge?""

after the party my parents said they wanted to talk to me so i asked what was up and my mom said ""you should have just taken the cake you made us look bad. do you think you're better than us for eating miserably?"" my dad is on her side and my aunt who has recovered from anorexia is also on her side and said it looked like i was fat shaming my family by not taking the plate (i am the only one who is not overweight in my household). my cousin is on my side though, she said my mom was being ridiculous and using me as an excuse for her to feel insecure.

My Fiancé of about 10 years cheated on me for about 9 months during the last year of our relationship, also mind you our wedding was also in 2ish weeks.

Small bit of backstory. She cheated on me because apparently I was too ""boring"" because i didn't like going to concerts, parties, and didn't like doing softcore drugs (I never stopped her from doing those kinds of things, I'm straight edge but I don't mind being around things unless its like heroin and other hardcore shit). Funny thing is though that our entire relationship was built off us being huge introverts in highschool and just wanting to play games together, but when she got her first job, she started to definitely change into this party goer type of person after meeting people who weren't just highschool friends.

So getting to the real problems. Over our 10 year relationship I didn't buy an insane amount of gifts for her, but the few i did were pretty big and was used extensively, I even bought an entire 2nd gaming and took her to pick out her own accessories for it, just so we can play games together whenever she came over (this was before she moved in with me). Now on the other hand she only ever bought me 1 thing, it was a Nintendo switch with BOTW, that's it. Now I don't really care for gifts much but I used this thing a shit ton, I 100% botw 2 times and bought some other games and 100% those.

So after we broke up and she was moving out, she wanted to take the pc and everything else I bought her, but she also wanted to take the switch that she bought me, she made it a huge fucking deal that she wanted to take this switch, mind you that her new bf had his own switch, i know this because she would use ours to play with him before I knew she was cheating on me with him. I was going to give her the pc at first because I really just didn't want to deal with anything at the time, but after that i told her sure take your switch, ill keep everything else. After this argument I told her to just leave, we can figure out how to split shit later.

Now fast forward a couple days, she comes over, and I find out she also invited her new bf to try to strongarm me into giving my shit to her, I agree to talk about stuff but consider me lucky bc I had a group of friends coming over extremely to watch the league of legends worlds finals at my house.

After that day I continued to get threats from her new bf and her to give her my shit. The cops even got involved eventually (I called them after multiple attempts to break into my house).",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4856364,public,top,self,AITA for taking back my gifts for an ex after she wanted to keep everything,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd4qaf/aita_for_taking_back_my_gifts_for_an_ex_after_she/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

He wasn’t kind like online and he was very controlling.
He also did some random stuff I won’t put in detail rn but it weirded me out a lot.
I’ve tried talking about it but he’d always say it’s the culture difference.
I’ve once vented on this application the things he did and everyone adviced me to break up.

He’d come to my home, hid until I went to work. Tried to pull me back to him, kiss me,…
It scared me a lot and after 8 times saying no we are done he asked me for a final decision, once again I said it’s done and it seemed like he understood. He asked me not to reply to him.
I have to say I have been really friendly in this break up and said he could still count on me just not as a couple, I said he’s a good guy we are just not a good match.
He went quiet for one week and then suddenly texted me saying we can put the Xmas tree up togheter and act normal again. I ignored him as I’m really exhausted by this whole situation. The love is just gone, I went trough to much and regret ever dating him.
The day after he threw a fit and said I’m ghosting him and played a dirty game on him, and that he sacrificed so much for me.

Geoff is late 30s (we are late 20s), pretty set in his views and not shy about arguing with people. Okay for book club, less fun in our chill dinner group. We broadly welcome him, but over the next few months we all get into several heated debates. I think Geoff enjoys the intellectual stimulation, but for me it borders on exhausting/upsetting. It’s not outright hostile but we def don’t click.

Then a couple weeks ago, one of our dinner group friends invited the other members to his birthday. Geoff doesn’t know many other people at the party, so we mostly keep him company/introduce him to people - eventually he gets talking to another of my good friends, Julie, and they seem to hit it off. The next day, Geoff texts me and asks for her number - I say I’ll check with her, and when she confirms I send it to him.

What I did not realise is that the number I have saved for Julie is her work number (we chat on insta), and that it now belongs to someone else at the company - by genuine coincidence, it’s someone Geoff previously had a TERRIBLE working relationship with (we live in a smallish town). He has the number saved already so doesn’t actually text it.

Should I have tripled checked Julie’s number with her before I sent it? Maybe, and I wouldn’t have intentionally given out a work number, but I only had one number saved for her so didn’t twig. The mixup is sheer crazy bad luck.

A few days later Geoff texts me saying the number is wrong and that I almost really embarrassed him. Upon realising what had happened I am horrified and send a very apologetic response. We text a bit but he doesn’t seem to accept my apology.

Later Clare tells me that Geoff is annoyed, both about the mixup and that I “had to” check with Julie before sending her number. Clare also adds that “you know Geoff is no psycho” and that she would have just given him Julie’s number when he asked. I explain that I would never give out someone’s personal information without asking. I’m left with the impression that Geoff/Clare think I am seriously at fault and expect me to make more reparations. They also ask me to give Julie Geoff’s number as he no longer wants to make the first move, which I did (very carefully! with a brief explanation of the mixup). Geoff is also now not responding to me on text re organising the next rounds of book/dinner club, which I’m worried (given his argumentative nature) are going to be really unpleasant.

So AITA for accidentally giving him the wrong number?

Out of the group, I stayed closest with two girls, let's call them Kate and Amy. Kate and I took several classes together all throughout college, so we saw each other every week and I considered her one of my best friends. Her ""thing"" has always been to take on lots of activities and have a very busy schedule. This meant our friendship was mostly based on me helping her out with assignments, and to study for exams or to pick up stuff we needed for classes. We never really just hung out without her doing something else (like rehearsing for something or getting stuff ready). I never minded or even though about it, until recently, because I understood. 

Our final year of college was right in the beginning of the pandemic, and it was a really hard time for me. The only time I heard from Kate personally was when she asked me if I'd be interested in reviewing each other's thesis, I declined and told her I was talking a break from school for mental health reasons, she said she understood and to text her if I changed my mind. We've texted a few times since and most of the times she's left me on read after a couple texts, or just got in touch to ask me for favours. This is when I started to get fed up. 

In the group text however, she's made a few attempts to get us all together. A few days ago she sent an invite to her birthday party, and no one replied. Personally, I needed to think about it because her house is two hours away and I'd need to find a ride. A few days later she sent another text saying it was very rude of us not to reply and that we should try to be better people. I went to our private conversation to talk to her personally and saw she had left me on read a month before (I had asked her if she was felling better after having covid), and decided to just ignore her. Later Amy asked about it and I told her I was annoyed about the double standard, but she said it wasn't the same thing because my text wasn't an invite and that I was being an AH.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4856343,public,top,self,AITA for not replying to my friend's party invite in a group text?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd4kzs/aita_for_not_replying_to_my_friends_party_invite/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

My dad passed away last Christmas eve. Long fight with cancer, painfully long time on hospice, he just didn't want to let go. Myself and my 2 brothers are all adults. Towards the end my dad could barely walk and only had use of one arm. I'm a petite female and my brothers are huge, very strong. While my dad was on hospice my younger brother really stepped up, took over a month of of work to be there to help lift, wash, change, our dad, etc. My works at a giant well known warehouse and had to work one day a week to stay employed and keep him health benefits. I BEGGED my older brother, through text because I was crying to much to talk, to be over that one day a week for a few hours to help mom and I because we couldn't lift him. He saw the text but never responded. My mom would text him regularly, he'd never respond.

A year later he's very absent. He got married a little over a year before our dad died and since then has almost no interest in his family. I'm not stupid, I know dynamics chance once your married and your spouse comes first. That's how it should be but his wife made zero effort to even get to know our extended family. She wants nothing to do with us and has shit talked our mom, other brother, and members of our family she never even bothered trying to get to know despite them making effort. They have all the time in the world for every little thing her family needs and never is a family gathering with her side.

All that being said, sorry I know I'm rambling but I'm fuming and hurt right now, he just told my mom he won't have time to even stop over for a few hours on Christmas this year (lives 15 minutes away from mom, 30 from in-laws) because they're spending the entire day with his in-laws. Any other year I wouldn't care too much, aside from being pissed it hurts my mom's feeling), but this is ine year since our dad died. We had a good childhood, we were one growing up, he was never unloved or mistreated, and honestly, got a bit of stereotypical first born special treatment. I know he doesn't resent our mom, he loves her, but he's shit at showing her and has repeatedly hurt her by ignoring her.

Basically, she didn't like her friend's bf from the start. I asked if her friend has been harassed in any way. She said no. So I told her that I see no problem in that and she had no right to say those things because it wasn't her relationship. I also told her she didn't even try to get to know the guy. I asked what made her mad/uncomfortable and she told me she felt like her friend was paying less attention to her when she's going through a rough patch and that no one was there for her (This hurt me a bit because I was there and answered her calls even if it was late at night. I even invited her over at my home if she needed a break from the family drama. But I didn't dwell on it because it wasn't about me anyway). She also told me that she snapped because of mental health issues and all the toxicity. 

I kept explaining to her that it wasn't her relationship so unless something bad is happening to her friend, she should stay out of it. This is where I may be the Ahole. When she showed me that the bf posted screenshots of her verbally abusing him, she told me she wasn't going to stoop down their level and she was going to ignore them. She was proud of handling it 'maturely'. I snapped and told her that I would've understood the bf for doing that when they have been the receiving end of harassment. I was already trying to control my temper when she couldn't see what she did wrong but I couldn't stand seeing her proud of what she did.

Earlier in the year my childhood best friend/ other half died tragically and unexpectedly in a car accident. It was the first time in my life id experienced a major loss of someone i loved deeply and still have yet to fully deal with it. For the first month after hearing about it i couldn't shower or eat or even get through a day without falling into hysterics, so when my mother reached out about going to the funeral service, the grave, etc i continued to ignore her, mostly due to needing time and space to grieve as this affected me more than almost anyone since my friend and i were always always together. 

At the funeral i requested no one (aka ppl who knew such as mom dad step dad grandmother) touch me and i had to excuse myself as i started having another full on hysterical breakdown to which my mother tried to grab me and i had to run to avoid a panic attack.

After a month or so i decided i was ready to visit my friends resting place and had my dad take me, i had asked my mother for the address my exact words being ""can i please have the address for -friends name-"" and she sent an address which i didn't think twice about, until i arrived. She had given my friends MOTHERS home which made me incredibly upset, i texted her and asked why she would assume i meant the house of my friends mother when i am not on good terms as that woman was abusive to my friend in her younger years esp. She replied with :

""NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS would i have assumed you wanted to go to the cemetery since every time 'I' invited you to go with us or go on picnics or to any of the wake or get togethers you said no! how dare you be nasty to me!"" which essentially lit my fuse and deeply upset my dad as i broke down into hysterics again since i just wanted to see my friend. fast forward i found the cemetery and gravesite, and stopped replying to my mother altogether, now many months later she spams that i am horrible for not replying to her or acknowledging her or anyone who she frankly sends to message me to see where she can get a bite.

My parents split when I was about 3 y/o. The divorce was due to my dad cheating with a co-worker he ended up marrying 2 years later. They've been married for almost 30 years now.

My mom rarely talks about our dad, and always talked very negatively about our step-mom, and our dad's mom. It has gotten to the point where she couldn't understand that we would feel about our dad passing away the same way she did when our grandfather died, and she wouldn't know how to interact with us, if our dad did die suddenly. 

My grandmother is in her 90's and she's very ill and has severe dementia. In my teens i was really close to my grandma, who always talked about our mom with respect. I'm really sad about not being able to visit her, and hearing my mom say all the terrible things about her (solely, cause she raised a cheater, aka, our dad). She just plain refuses to understand that talking about our dad and his side of the family hurts us. She doesn't understand why we don't hate him, and why do we care.

I've tried to talk about it with my mom, but now I just have to tell her I don't want to hear her toxicity about my family, and if she continues she can leave.

We made a list of foods. 
Appetizers, a main course of entrees including ham and mac and cheese and desserts.

We also included a holiday drink menu (including alcoholic beverages).

I compiled this into a little invitation sheet. At the bottom of the sheet is my address, a rsvp date, and “Venmo 7$ to …”

Middle the food.

At the top is “join us for a holiday feast” with a picture of me and the co host as cooks.

The groceries and drinks will be about 180$ and I thought that 7$ per person for twenty people or so would cover 140$ of the cost and that i’d just bite the 40$. I didn’t want to make any sort of a profit. Me and my co host just agreed we couldn’t afford to get all the food and drink on our own. We are full time college students.

Most of the responses to the invitations were excitement but I had a few friends try to lecture me on social norms saying

“there shouldn't be
an expectation for payment if it's
truly an invitation for a dinner. Also
if you are the one planning and
realize you can't afford to invite
20-25 people, then you should
consider a smaller gathering. An invitation shouldn’t be associated with a cost. It feels like we are paying to be invited”

I got pretty offended and said some choice words to the group. I was also upset because I was told these things in a group-chat with 3 other people.

I understand that at dinner parties with adults (out of college and stable incomes), its not usually the case you ask people to pitch in. But I feel like 7$ for an entire 3 course meal and drinks is dirt cheap. I didn’t want it to be a potluck thing and to have anyone worried about cooking anything.

While I was serving people, along with some employees of the local beach shops, the manager of big surf shop directly next to the park came over to see what I was up to. He asked what I was doing, and I explained that I had prepared free fresh food to aid those in the holiday season who were feaaling the pinch of this crazy inflation. I also related how I had to cook and serve with food rather than throw it out because all the food charity organizations only accepted canned goods.

The manager told all his employees to leave and then said he couldn't allow me to serve food. I asked him if the surf shop owned the park and picnic pavilion, to which he replied ""no, but this area is associated with the surf shop"". He also said I couldn't be serving food I myself had prepared, to which I showed him I also had some prepackaged sealed salads, cheeses, and snacking meats.

The manager then said he was planning his ""next course of action"" before walking off. I said to him as he was leaving ""thank you for stopping by"", but I really wanted to tell him to ""fuck off"".

So my question is, should I have issued a ""fuck off"" to this manager?

While I was serving people, along with some employees of the local beach shops, the manager of big surf shop directly next to the park came over to see what I was up to. He asked what I was doing, and I explained that I had prepared free fresh food to aid those in the holiday season who were feaaling the pinch of this crazy inflation. I also related how I had to cook and serve with food rather than throw it out because all the food charity organizations only accepted canned goods.

The manager told all his employees to leave and then said he couldn't allow me to serve food. I asked him if the surf shop owned the park and picnic pavilion, to which he replied ""no, but this area is associated with the surf shop"". He also said I couldn't be serving food I myself had prepared, to which I showed him I also had some prepackaged sealed salads, cheeses, and snacking meats.

The manager then said he was planning his ""next course of action"" before walking off. I said to him as he was leaving ""thank you for stopping by"", but I really wanted to tell him to ""fuck off"".

So my question is, should I have issued a ""fuck off"" to this manager?

I apologize if there are any spelling or grammatical mistakes in this text because English isn’t my first language.

I 16F am currently living with my step father and mother, my mother is planning to take me on a massive holiday for my graduation gift. We were talking about this during dinner and my step father cuts in and says “Oh that would be a nice family holiday”. I never liked my stepfather or his family to begin with so I hated this idea. His children M(15F), R(21M) and B(24M) has always disliked me from since we first met. We were planning to go to Japan for this graduation gift but japan has a lot of walking from place to place and there would be nothing my stepfathers kids would enjoy there as we are planning to go to a lot of anime and Pokémon things there in japan. (I’m saying this because none of my stepfathers kids enjoys walking or any sort of anime in general, and whenever we do something they don’t like they always complain about how everything is so boring) So I tried to say how it might be a bad idea seeing as it will be quite expensive for 6 people and seeing as 4 of those will only want to stay in a hotel room and do nothing, I explained it in the nicest way I could trying to get him to see that it would be a bad idea without me telling him I don’t want him or his kids there. So after 5 minutes of me trying to explain why I don’t think it’s a good idea for him and his kids to go he absolutely blew up at me and starting yelling at me and calling me a selfish brat and how my mother always does everything for me. (My mother always misses out on all of my school reward ceremonies because of his kids, and they’re also always down for the school holidays and any other holiday we have overseas.) His reasoning for him and his kids to come along with us was “it would be great family bonding, plus you always have your mother to yourself” (my mother works 6am-7pm most days so I  never see her if she’s home because she’s normally just cooking dinner and going off to bed just to repeat this almost everyday. And when she finally gets a day off my step father is always doing something with her for most of the day so once again I don’t have anytime to spend with her).

It’s my first apartment and it’s cheap, I moved in quickly as I wanted to get away from my parents as it wasn’t helping my mental health staying with them. 

The neighbours right next to me deal in a lot of sketchy things such as dealing drugs/stolen items this doesn’t brother me as it’s none of my business and as long as I’m left alone then they can do whatever they want. I have dealt with people like these all my life. 

Recently there has been a lot of arguments coming from the block with constant screaming, things smashing at all hours of the day, ripping security doors off the hinges, rubbish being thrown onto my little grass area in front of my door, my bin being knocked over and I saw my neighbour walking up and down with a cricket bat hitting a car in the car park etc. 

This made me think it’s time to move as I don’t want to get involved with drama like this or have my car damaged etc. and I know that calling the police will only make it worse so I reached out to the real estate agency (they are who I rent through) asking if they can help me find a rental in an area in my city that doesn’t have low-socioeconomic standards (apologies if this offends anyone) 

They said they would as I have no problem paying more in rent, but apparently this got the agency intrigued and they came for a surprise inspection and saw all the damage they have done to the inside and outside of the property and issued an eviction notice. My other neighbour mentioned this to me as I was coming back from work and was asking if I ratted on them as they wanted to thank whoever did it. 

I think I might be the asshole for the way I mentioned it to the agency as it got them intrigued because I can afford to pay more in rent but the rent rates for this area is sometimes all they can afford so I may have made them homeless.

This is your warning this story is going to sound like high school drama, if you don't want to read it feel free to scroll. 

So my friend and I have known each other for a few years. We met working together at Generic Seattle Coffee with a tip share system (important for later). Things happened and a new bar opened up that we both got hired for. When we were hired the owners told us all that they have never worked in the industry before and we're willing to accept help from those of us who have. They also told us we were going to start with a split tips system with an hourly rate above regular minimum for our state. Awesome, friend was against this from the get go but went along with it in hopes she could get it changed later. 

Opening week goes by pretty smooth all things considered. A few hiccups but nothing major. Day one of second week, owners are getting a divorce and one bails. Alright cool the staff was more concerned with getting paid than the drama there. Sure. New lady comes in to help get the bar set up to standards. Sounds wonderful except she's a micromanaging queen and upsetting my friend. I'm used to it so I ignore it, but friend pulls me aside to scream and cry about it outside for a smoke break. I get her calmed down and back inside to finish closing so I can talk to owner who stayed. Find out another employee was sitting around for over an hour at the bar nursing a beer on the clock. Make mental note to handle that with owner when I get a second to since I'm being put into a manager role soon and don't want to overstep bounds yet. 
 
Next morning, friend and I get into a decent sized fight over the fact she thinks she deserves all the tips and shouldn't have to share with the not busy shifts, the bar, or the bussers. She blames all of it on me and won't let me actually talk to her. I snap, I worked a 16 hour shift the night before and had 4 hours of sleep before trying to get back to the bar to talk to the owner and get things figured out. She complains that Steakhouse from The Star State pays their servers $15/hr+tips and that they get to keep all their tips. I yell at her fine then go work there then since you're so stressed about it. She starts being manipulative and spiteful saying things like oh well I guess I misjudged you. Sorry boss. I'm just a worker so I'll stop bothering you. I'll put in my two weeks then if it's necessary. 
 
So now I feel like a jerk for snapping at her since we're both tired and stressed and there's so much going on but everyone I've talked to says I was in the right and she's acting like a child. We've only been open just over a week and she's already threatened to walk out over one bad night and didn't give me the chance to try to fix it.

Up until the past couple of years, I have had 4 separate family christmases (each parent plus each step-parent family events) plus immediate family Christmas x 2. This has been a logistical nightmare meant that, for over a decade (ever since I started driving and had to plot things out instead of being a passive participant for the parent I was with that weekend), I’m disappointing someone every weekend of December because I have to choose one event over another.

Now that most of my grandparents have passed away and myself, my siblings and cousins have gotten older, we’ve stopped doing the big family Christmas for the most part and I only have to factor in my step-mom’s family, my dad and step-mom’s immediate family and my mom and step-dad’s immediate family. You would think that this would make things simpler but instead it has resulted in all family groups deciding to plan something for Christmas Day and I’ve ended up driving all across the state to make things work. For example, last Christmas I left my house at 4am to drive 3 hours for Christmas breakfast with one family, left there at 11 to drive 1.5 hours to lunch and then left there at 4pm to drive 2 hours for dinner. You may ask “but emmyjane03 why don’t you just decline an invitation?” and the answer is that every single time I’ve tried to do so it has resulted in someone being incredibly upset because I’ve “chosen” another family or family member over them. It’s exhausting.

Fast-forward to this year. I received precisely 2 family-related Christmas invitations: one for my step-moms family and one for my moms family and neither of them happened to be for Christmas Day. I took this to mean that I had no plans with either of my immediate families on Christmas Day and, honestly with a lot of relief, made plans to go to my best friends’ parent’s house.

This is where I think I might be TA. I never explicitly asked either of my parents what their plans were, because I’ve grown very used to having 2-4 conflicting invitations and just having to make it work. Having no invitations was such a relief that I just ran with it. 
Today my dad asked me what I was doing and when I told him my step-mom got very upset. From her perspective, I was making an assumption that they wouldn’t want to see me for Christmas and me saying that no one had told me anything was happening and making other plans was a cop out and showed I would rather spend time with besties family. From my perspective, I saw a stress-free option for the holidays and wasn’t about to add complication by inviting myself to an event that didn’t exist.

So, AITA?

My sister on the other hand was spoon fed by my parents and took advantage of it, she would provoke me all of our childhood years and then play the victim when our parents intervened and I was punished.

after I moved i really didn’t talk to my parents anymore literally only once a year they would go on about how my sister wasn’t doing anything and was still living with them and hanging with the wrong crowd but then would end their rant with “it’s still better than what you’re doing”…..I’m literally a pediatric nurse.

After the many many backhanded compliments I ultimately decided to stop answering because they were making me feel like shit. It wasn’t until I met my current fiancé also (24m) that I realized i am worth something and I’m not a shadow or a doormat people could walk on, his family is more of a family then mine ever were so I’m extremely grateful for them.

I’m doing great in life now, my partner and I are doing amazing and I’m 6 months pregnant with twins and money is great for me.

Yesterday I received a call from my mom asking if i could come over to talk, I was reluctant of course but I went in open minded knowing the meet up wasn’t going to be for mending our relationship.

After I got there my mother immediately cried seeing as I am 6 months pregnant, first it started with asking how couldn’t I tell them to “Fallon wouldn’t do anything like that to us, Kaia”.

Then my dad flat out asked if I could help them out financially even though throughout life I never had anything new almost everything was a hand me down, I wasn’t allowed to have a birthday party unless it somehow involved my sister, the money I made from my job had to be used for rent while my sister lived rent free.

So I was a bit taken aback since they had all the money in the world before I moved out to suddenly struggling, I pushed more for answers since it didn’t make sense and finally got the truth, my sister had been using the money for expensive things that she would use only for pictures and whatnot.

They said that I owed them and since I’m doing well in life I won’t need half of the money since I use it to go on trips sometimes or to literally buy my babies things, I told them to focus more on their golden child then to what I’m doing with my money and my mom cried again, I ended up going home because my dad started yelling at me.

Later my dad texted me and told me he expect me to pay them more than they originally asked for since i kept my pregnancy from them and for making my mom cry, my sister also texted me and told me I’m a terrible daughter who enjoys punishing our parents for the past.

Apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes. English is my first language but I suck at writing. 

I (27f) suffer from quite severe depression and anxiety which makes me very tired and withdrawn (I am in therapy but it's a slow process). As a result I've limited a lot of social contact with my family since a lot of it stems from how turbulent my childhood was. I don't blame anyone for anything, I just can't cope well being around them. When I'm with my friends and partner, or even at work around coworkers I feel absolutely fine which has led me to believe that my relationship with my family is the issue. 

Anyway, to the point, I'm the oldest of 3 children. I have one sister(24f) and one brother (21f) and they are very angry and resentful about how withdrawn from them I've become. I understand why they are angry since I have withdrawn, I just find it very difficult to be around them when they get so angry. Sometimes they wouldn't even greet me when I walked in the door. 

It all came to a head at thanksgiving when my sister lashed out at me, telling me I was acting all 'moody' (I didn't know I was, I was just quiet), how sick of me she was and how bad of a big sister I am. I apologised and said that I was struggling a bit but that I wasn't feeling moody, just anxious. 

She then said that I had no right to take my issues out on them and ""as a big sister you're supposed to be there for us."" and ""start acting like a big sister"" and ""stop being so selfish"". 

I told her to ""F\*\*\* off with the big sister crap. Just because I'm the oldest doesn't mean I'm responsible for you. I'm your sister, yes, but the fact that I'm older means nothing."" 

She was very upset by that and left our parents house. My brother said I was being a selfish b\*\*\*\*. My parents weren't around at the time but after my brother updated them they told me what I said wasn't right and that I am their big sister so I need to accept the role that comes with that. 

I can't help that I was born first and it certainly doesn't come with additional super powers. I'm just trying my best and I right now I can't live up to the idea of a big sister that they both seem to have. I don't have my sh\*\* together, far from it. 

Anyway, I just wanted to ask if I'm reacting to this all wrong.

Our cities are roughly 150+ miles apart, but I’ve been visiting him frequently. I’ve recently been looking for work and got a temporary job with an agency in his city, so I’ve been staying at his place these last couple weeks. I still feel like a guest when I’m staying at his place though, but lately he hasn’t been the best host to me.

Yesterday, he told me that I need to stop depending on him and he feels like the only adult in the relationship. I don’t know how to cook, and I do have to depend on him in that area. I was never taught and every time I try to experiment in the kitchen, it turns out wrong. I took offense to what he said to me, because I just feel you don’t tell your company to cook for themselves or try to guilt trip them when they’re hungry.

I wouldn’t have a problem with this if I knew he wasn’t just being lazy. Him and his roommate won’t do their dishes either until they’re running out of clean ones. That means there’s usually no cookware for me to use even if I did want to make myself something to eat. He always wants to sleep in until late-morning/noon, so I usually don’t get to eat anything until hours after I woke up.

He only works part-time, and comes home to smoke and play video games most of the day, so it’s not like he should be exhausted.

A couple side notes: I do buy my own groceries now, so lack of food or money isn’t the issue. I pull my weight around the house where I can.

 She was hospitalized for a few days, and when she came out she went to the university with a winter cap, she demanded that I shave, she accused me of what had happened to her, she even went to complain to the dean of the faculty. but they told him they had no control over what the students did outside of the university, much less in their personal lives. Screaming and kicking, she demanded that in addition to shaving me, I pay his medical bills, the treatment he now needed (for which it would cost him three semesters of college), and buy her a wig while her hair grew back.

 I told her she was crazy if she thought I owed her anything, that what had happened was solely her fault, that I never made her do that, and that maybe if she wasn't so busy with this ridiculous competition and living her own leve, nothing would have happened. But none of that was my problem 

In the end she didn't finish the semester, she had to leave the university and as far as I know, never came back. I received many messages from her friends blaming me and demanding that I help her, but they all stopped when I reported several of them to the university authorities and the police. My family and friends supported me by saying that I owed him nothing. 

 I saw her again four years ago in a store where she worked and she was no better, but I didn't talk to her, a friend who was with me and who has a mutual friend with her, told me that the injuries were so serious that now the little hair she has is very fragile and she can't let it grow long, and it's sad, because before she had it below her waist and it was very pretty I don't know what has become of her since then

Let's call her R ,  We both go to different colleges so we don't hang out often and it is exam season so we don't get much time to hangout . 
Now the thing is my exams are going on but R's aren't, so after much persuasion she convinced me to hang out with her after classes but i did tell her that I won't hangout for long and she agreed to it .
But after about 90 mins the sun was setting and i needed to go home but R won't budge . She tried to convince me again to stay longer but I refused .
I told her I need to go home and get some rest to study all night long but she was acting really immature and hardly came to terms with it on the condition that we'll walk to subway station (20 mins walk) and talk some more , to which i agreed . 
Now on the way to subway we met a blind person who asked for help ,
He wanted to get a taxi for subway , so here's the thing taxi prices for where I live are quite pricey and for such a short walk getting a taxi made my middle class self come out and blurt thoughtlesly ""we are going the same way if you want we can take you there"" 
He asked ""are you okay with that?"" 
I looked at R who was visibly annoyed and was giving me raging looks . But since I had already offered to help I didn't back out and helped him get there . It was I who held his hand all the way to the subway and safely got him inside of it .
 he thanked me and we parted ways ,
I looked around to see R who was walking just behind us  but she ignored me and walked away . 
She was very angry ( she is short tempered so this isn't new ) .
It took a lot of my apologies to get her to speak to me . Her argument was that i should've just get him a taxi and i ruined our time together, i apologized for not asking her before offering help but it was such a spot on incident that i didn't think much at the time .
She was angry with me through rest of the way and hardly talked 
Then we went home and i can't stop thinking how I was in the wrong
I get it , i should've asked her before helping but it was unintentional , i wanted to help them and i didn't think much of it since I did spend time with her .
It was not like i was meeting her for the last time so why was she so angry , i do think i was in the wrong but how .....

Some context before I start: 

1- In our culture raising your voice with someone older than you is very frowned upon. 

2- My grandmother raised me so I'm very protective of her. 

3- My grandmother and my father have a good relationship even though my parents are divorced. My father still visits her with me and even picks up some things she asks for once a week. He also helps around the house, fixes things for her etc. He also doesn't take any money from her, even for things that cost a lot, saying it's nothing compared to her raising me (I have a very absent mother) 

**Story:**

My grandmother (84) have Alzheimer's. This makes her forget lots of things, and get confused a lot. She is also living with a nurse now because my grandfather died and she can't stay alone. But at the time of this incidence she didn't have a nurse. 

I'm pretty much the only one who is patient with her but her daughters -my aunt (58) and my mom (52)- say it's because I don't have to deal with her as much as they do. I get my aunt's point of view in this as she is the one frequently visiting her and taking care of her finances etc but my mother lives in another country and all she does is pay half the amount of money they pay for the nurse. (Which is great but it isn't exactly dealing with someone) 

My grandmother and my aunt frequently fight when my grandmother forgets things or act confused. You can hear my aunt yelling at her any time she visits her and we decide to have a video call. 

One time I, my aunt, and her husband visited my grandmother together. We all live very close by. I don't know what set them off but grandma and aunt started yelling each other again and it came to point where my aunt called my grandmother ""r\*\*\*rded"" for forgetting things and getting confused. I couldn't take it so I raised my voice and told her ""You can't talk to her like that."" She got offended visibly but that stopped the fight. 

Couple minutes later my grandmother stated that she craved corn on the cob (we buy those fresh and boil them ourselves) so I told her ""Don't worry, dad is coming tomorrow, I'll have him pick some up from the farmer's market."" My aunt proceeded to deliver some speech about how my father shouldn't have anything to do with my grandmother as ""it's not his place"". I kept quiet. 

When I got back home I sent my aunt a lengthy text about how what she said about my father was incredibly ungrateful as he still cares for my grandmother even though he doesn't have to. She didn't respond. She then stopped talking to me. My mom says I was being very rude to my aunt calling her ungrateful and raising my voice. I also think some of my other relatives think the same way.

I also apologized to her for yelling a couple of days ago but she still didn't care.

I was opening up to her about my mental health and she said the classic ""You don't have anything to be depressed about"". After she said that I got really angry and had a go at her. 

I told her about all the times she touched my boobs, bum, and stomach, and how it made me really uncomfortable. She then got defensive and said ""well, I'm your mother. I own you; I can do what I want"" which hurt me. I’ve opened up to her about some of my trauma and she invalidated that too. Whenever I tell her some of my trauma, she says “others have been through worse. That’s nothing” which again, hurts. 

She constantly crosses my boundaries. It's gotten to the point now where I have to isolate myself from her because of other things she used to do to me as well. I don't like being around her. She makes me really uncomfortable.

After the argument, I shouted at her and just reminded her that just because she's an adult doesn't mean she has any right to touch me, disrespect me, invalidate my feelings and invalidate my trauma. I asked her if she's like it if I did the same and she said no. So why is it okay for her to do all of that and more to me, but it's wrong for me to do that to her?

My sister Bea doesn't like men and never has. I'm not sure entirely why. She loves the men in our family and can obviously work with men casually and professionally, but when it comes to personal relationships, absolutely not. Her male friends never lasted very long. 

The only personal relationship I've ever seen her have with a man that wasn't part of our family was with her late husband. They married right out of college and were married until he passed almost three years ago. She's never expressed interest in dating men since.  

My husband's brother, Rick, has always struggled with dating. He always liked Bea and didn't hide it. About a year after Bea's husband passed, he begged me and my husband for approval to try to go out with her. I didn't want him to because she's never expressed interest in dating anyone since and it would make things awkward either way, but my husband convinced me to give it a try because ""they were both lonely"" and it's ""just a question"", so I did. I did tell Bea, who obviously wasn't interested but said she would be fine turning him down gently if she didn't have to be alone for it. 

So we planned to have a dinner just the four of us at a local chinese buffet. As we thought, Rick spent all night trying to flirt with Bea. I'm not sure if it was the food or what, but she was starting to feel not right, but it seemed like it would be okay with some time and air. We finished dinner and walked over to a park. When he finally asked her out, she opened her mouth to respond and vomited. Not a little bit either. Like full stomach clearing out vomit. He tried to laugh it off, but she just said ""i'd...rather not"" before apologizing to us all profusely and leaving as quickly as possible. The night ended there.

Rick is now mad at us for letting him be ""humiliated like that"" and thinks that my sister should give him a chance at least. My husband is mad at me for not convincing my sister to do one date, and his mother thinks I specifically set up Rick to humiliate him and ""destroy the confidence he'd struggled so long to build up"". My sister says she didn't puke on purpose, but isn't willing to go out with him because she doesn't want to do a pity date. I don't think I did anything wrong. I told him it wouldn't work. I got my sister to come out and try and it all went wrong.

I’m 4 hours ahead of him.

He has a best friend (15f), let’s call her L, from near where I live who he spends a lot of time with online.

He has bad trust issues because of his past relationships which is fine, it just hurts a little when he thinks I could be capable of something like cheating. 

We usually call from about 9pm-2/3am my time because he spends his day talking with L. This is fine, it usually works for us.

But a few days ago he took a while to come online. It was around 11pm when I messaged him telling him to let me know when he’s free because I miss him. He just said “I will.” 

I knew he was busy with L because I could see the games they were playing together. 

I find it impossible to sleep without being on call with him as I’m so used to it now, plus my depression has just exacerbated my fear of loneliness.

He didn’t message me until about 2am, when he said he was finally free and that he’s sorry but L went to sleep way later than she usually does. I was upset but didn’t want him to feel bad so I said it was okay. 

Then he started showing me clips of him and L playing games and laughing together, which just feels so tone deaf? Why would you ever do that??

I gave him the benefit of the doubt and although I felt a little abandoned I fell asleep because I was exhausted from college. 

Then the next day he did the same thing. When he did eventually call me I just gave short answers and made it obvious I was upset, but then he started showing me clips again and I went silent.

He started asking if I was okay, I said yeah but my voice broke and I started crying so I left the call.

He didn’t message me or anything, I messaged him first apologising for leaving but I got upset. He asked if I wanted to talk about it on call but I said no because I hate crying in front of people. 

I messaged him everything, saying why I was upset and he said he was worried about me cheating again and that L was helping to distract him. 

I wouldn’t be so upset if it wasnt for the fact that he knew I had been feeling pretty shitty recently due to college stress and family life. I want to help and support him but I can’t do that if he doesn’t let me.

I’m fine with their friendship, even if I do find the age gap a bit weird. 

The weirdest thing though is that before we started dating he told me about his plans to move in with her when she turns 18. After we started dating I assumed he left those plans and was planning to move in with me at some point instead. But a few days before this we were talking about moving and I said I didn’t want to move from my country because im too dependent on my family. He said “oh, that could be a problem because you know I’m moving with L at some point right?” And idk, that just hurt.

There’s more to this story than just this, but I don’t want to go over the limit. If there’s any questions I’ll answer them.

I have been ill for about 2 years now. The doctors haven't completed their diagnosis but they think it might be IBD (inflammable bowel disease) and CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), or maybe even just dreadful IBS (irritate bowel syndrome) as test results don't really align with my symptoms. I may also have a form of arthritis. 

To summarise, I am almost always unwell. I typically have to go to the toilet 5-10 times a day for full painful bowel movements, sweat excessively, have trouble sleeping st night but am constantly fatigued, and have joint and muscle pain constantly that feels like I've ran a 10k (I used to be an amateur athlete so I'm aware of the sort of aching). For context, something like brushing away dirt makes me out of breath. It's really embarrassing for me especially as I've been quite fit my whole life.

All of this makes day to day really hard. I do about 80% of the cooking in the house, but I enjoy it and like making complicated recipes so it's not something I consider a chore. My partner definitely does more of the general cleaning: puts on laundry, tidies around. It does tire me out but not as much, I guess because it's usually less intense unless I'm baking. She would definitely consider it more of a chore and only cooks when she has random ideas or I'm especially unwell or busy.

A month or so ago she asked I put more work in and I have tried. I always clean the cat litter tray whenever it needs it and whilst we usually have a ""I cook she cleans it up"" policy, I've done our dishes myself a lot more. I'd say it's still a 30:70 split for me and her at most.

Last night she asked me if I could wash the dishes. I said that I was working on my dissertation as I had a deadline the next day and asked if she could do it. She seemed really off about it but said okay. In my head I was a bit upset since I had done all the cooking and washing up for the day. I don't like seeing it as getting even in that way but sometimes I don't see how I can't.

I asked her about it this morning and said I didn't like how transactional she was about it, and she got very upset and said she thinks I should be doing more. I definitely got angry and told her that I didn't want to hear her out if she isn't going to respect that I'm chronically ill and basic tasks are difficult, and that I also have tried to do more. She gave examples of stuff that didn't make much sense, like cleaning after the cat which I do much more than her now. Better examples would be laundry which she does 90% of the time, or vacuuming (which is probably the hardest thing for me to do, so I rarely do). Now we're not speaking.

AITA for not doing more chores? How can I do more, regardless?

I moved in late in august. About 3 weeks ago while deep cleaning the kitchen, the drip coffee machine, which no one has ever used, caught my attention and I decided to open the lid. To my dismay the filter was filled with a white, powdered mold substance. Shocked and disgusted by the cloudy substance which erupted from the top of the coffee machine, I tossed the filter in the sink and let hot water run over it, all while covering my air holes so I didn’t inhale any of it. I left the kitchen and came back to discover the substance was adhesive and wouldn’t let off the filter. I decided then and there that this was not my problem to deal with, and tossed it in the garbage. 
Fast forward to today. While getting ready for work, one of my roommates asked me in an agitated manner if I had any coffee beans he could use to make some coffee. Instead of answering his question I explained to him why I threw away the coffee filter and apologized. I then ground up some coffee and made him a cup using a small pour over device that I have. He seemed frustrated so I offered to buy him the part I threw away online. I then left to work. When I came back I started looking online for the filter part, and the lowest priced option is 23 dollars excluding shipping. I showed him the model and we confirmed it was it. I was kind of hoping he would have changed his mind, but he instead gave me the go ahead to buy it.

Someone, I’m not sure who since it was anonymous, said they liked me (in a crush way), to which I responded, “PU (Pop up/Chat) because no one’s liked me in ages.”

My friend, let’s call her Sophie, took this the completely wrong way and responded “Wtf”. Nothing after that. I asked what was wrong since I was very confused. I messaged another friend, “Katy” to ask Sophie what was wrong since it was obvious she was ignoring me. 

Sophie then went off on one on Katy’s phone about how “we’re (Sophie and Katy) always here for you and you say something like that?” 

She sent nasty voice messages about how I’d made her and Katy angry. 

I tried over and over to explain what I meant, that no one’s liked me in ages, which obviously means that no one’s had a crush on me, but she wasn’t having any of it. 

Sophie then went on about how I always leave group chats and expect people to just add me back, which is exactly what she does. Yes I may do it more frequently, but sometimes group chats are a bit much with all the messages flowing in, especially for me because I’ve been identified as being on the autistic spectrum, which she knows. She knows I get overwhelmed and need a break sometimes, and it was never a problem before.

After arguing backwards and forwards through voice messages and texts, I’d finally had enough. I just didn’t want to deal with it anymore, so I told her I didn’t feel like we could be friends anymore.

I don’t think she cared because I think she just wanted a drama, but I don’t know why she’d make me the victim of it after being friends for so long. She was a great friend, albeit a terrible influence, but she was kind and patient.

This is a bit of a longer post, but I would like to explain the situation as best as I can so I can get some honest advice from you.

I (F27) have a mother who a couple of years ago moved to another country for an early retirement.

After she divorced my dad, she met my stepfather who had a holiday house in that other country. They would often go on vacations there which turned into part time living there which turned into full time living there. So in the early years they would live 2 weeks here ans two weeks there, later on month/month and with covid they realized they can perfectly live there completely so now they just visit our home country once or twice a year.

All those years of flying back and forth (and even now if necessary), 9.9 times out of ten 10 I was the one picking them up from and dropping them of at the airport. I honestly didn't mind, I like driving and my schedule allowed it.

Since about a month and a half I have been home sick from work with a burnout. I've been doing a lot better, but can sometimes still feel very overwhelmed when I need to do certain things. Because I'm feeling a bit better better I decided to book a flight to visit my mother.

Flying is one of the things that causes me a lot of stress. I don't like situations where I don't have any control over how it will go and with flying there are so many things I don't have control over (luggage lost, delays, annoying passengers,...)

So even though I look forward to visiting my mom, the thought about flying there sometimes still overwhelmes me.

Now my mother asked me if I could take the bus to her house in stead of her picking me up because she doesn't like the parking situation at the airport. 
I have never before taken the bus there (usually my bf and I rent a car when we visit her, but financially that just doesn't make sense to do now), I don't even now which bus stop to get off at or where the bus stop at the airport is,... So this has been really really stressing me out.

So finally to my question: WIBTA if I told her she just has to pick me up since I brought her/picked her up nearly a 100 times before?

For a bit more information: the drive to the airport is about 45 minutes and she does have the time, she just doesn't want to come because she doesn't like parking there",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4856142,public,top,self,"WIBTA if I ""ordered"" my mother to pick me up at the airport",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd2gwo/wibta_if_i_ordered_my_mother_to_pick_me_up_at_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

When I asked him, he told me (out of my brother's earshot) that it had a prominent gay character in it and he didn't want to expose my brother to that kind of stuff cause he was just a minor. Despite this not being the first instance he talks negatively about gay people, I got really pissed off this time and told him straight to his that he can stop trying to ""protect"" my brother from that kind of stuff cause he already exposed him to a gay man for his entire life, cause I'm gay and so he failed miserably from not exposing my brother to that kind of stuff cause he sees me almost daily and already knows for over 2 years that I'm gay (and my dad was the only member of my close family that didn't know yet). 

Well, this kind of ruined the entire movie night and after it my dad called me on the phone to tell me how much I embarrassed him with my public outburst and that I made him out to be some kind of bigot to other people when he doesn't care about my ""lifestyle"", but he just didn't want his minor son to get exposed to it.

I was lifting heavy dumbbells and doing an incline benchpress. I was tired and done with my set and put down my dumbbells on the floor only to hear the cracking sound of my friend's phone screen which was sticking out from the side, underneath the bench, behind my field of vision. Note that I am looking straight. Me and my friend take turns on one bench to finish our exercise because our gym can get crowded and it's hard to find separate benches. I never saw him put his phone there in the first place because I was probably busy getting my own weights. He claims that he always puts his phone underneath the bench and that I should've known where his phone was kept. He never told me that his phone was kept underneath the bench and I am working out with him after a long time (3 months). If the phone had been kept properly underneath the bench this would've never happened, but I know he threw his phone under the bench and didn't care about where it was. I've always been scared of this happening to me so after I'm done with my set, my phone goes in my pocket or is in my hand.

Now his phone screen cracked and his front camera is gone. I don't think I'm at fault here because placing your phone on a crowded gym floor where heavy weights are being lifted all around you seems negligence to me on his part.
