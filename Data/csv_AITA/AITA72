Sorry!

One of my older sisters has 2 children, Niece(12F) and Nephew(11M).

My sister 'Rach' got called into work to cover someone &amp; Rach's usual sitter couldn't come. So I took my niblings, since I had the day off.

Niece, who has always been quiet, shy, reserved &amp; sensitive, got her first period recently, and Rach gave her The Talk &amp; taught her how to take care of herself during her period. Niece has been uncomfy with these changes but we're working on it. I remember that age, poor thing.

Nephew, who has always been loud, 'behavioral', high-energy &amp; filterless, has apparently been giving her some grief lately about aunt flo.

While I had them, Niece went to the bathroom with her little toiletry bag. Nephew wandered off a couple minutes later, saying something about snacks. Then a few more minutes later, I hear bickering. Sigh

I find out that as Niece had finished up in the bathroom, but not left yet, Nephew opened the door, saw her holding her bag, scoffed at her and called her gross. Said that having a period was gross. Niece cried about this.
I countered by telling Nephew that half the world has a period. He shouted back that half the world is gross, then!! 

I looked at Niece, and had a nice lil flashback (/j), and got kind of mad at him. He's learning better communication skills and listening skills in his behaviour program, so I decided to try having him feel empathy for his sister . I sent Niece to watch our show, and made Nephew sit and listen to me read a Healthline article on menstruation &amp; it's effect on women - nothing too gnarly folks, he IS 11 - and then reminded him that EVERYONE alive has someone with a 'gross period ' to thank for it. And told him that periods are not just natural, but a gift to us all. Then I asked him to please treat his sister how he'd wanna be treated &amp; apologize. He did that, and seemed genuine! And Niece cheered up after that.

Well, Rach blew her shit when she found out. All she'd keep saying (or shrieking) was that I was in the wrong for punishing her kid over something non life threatening, period, and ESPECIALLY over  something 'private and for women'. Her partner agrees, and my parents think I should've minded my own. I think I'm tired of hearing the talking Ovums bitch about their means of production!

I love him and we have a great time together, we're super compatible in most things, including being mentally ill lol (depression, anxiety, PTSD for me and OCD for him, although it's very mild). This is relevant info.

When we met, he was in another relationship. I had broken up mine a couple months prior, it was a very difficult decision but the best nonetheless (stayed friends until I figured out how much of a manchild he was).

He's super attractive, funny and interesting, and we hit it off right away, trading memes and laughing our asses off. I find out he's in a relationship and think to myself welp, guess I got a friend then. Things were very complicated with my ex still, so I guess it was for the best.

We became super close in a few weeks, and almost every day he would vent to me about his relationship.

It was pretty awful. They had nothing in common, she seemed completely disinterested in his company, bought tickets to a concert (alone) instead of going to a romantic getaway with him, would spend his money and take his things without a single notice, and many other things. Mostly, she was very jealous and would freak out when he was on his phone for too long, because he followed some girls on insta, and because he's hot and posted a lot, some others would reply to him, but actually the only person he would talk to regularly was me.

And we talked A LOT. Like until 5 am, on insta, Twitter, even Tumblr. Sometimes he would vent, others it would be me, and almost always we would share kinky pics, not of ourselves ofc, just talking about what we liked. In the beginning I thought it was harmless fun, just two friends chatting, but then it went more to the realms of like ""what if... I did this to you?"" We wouldn't talk about those messages in person, but they made me a little hopeful and uncomfortable at the same time. I wanted him very badly, but felt like a terrible person for it, and would constantly think of his poor gf.

Eventually they broke up, a bunch of arguments caused it, including her accusing him of emotionally cheating on her. He was in shambles and we talked through the night before work, and eventually confessed to each other. The next day, I went over to his house after work and we've been together ever since.

Fast forward to the present, I've been feeling a lot of relationship anxiety, which is not new for me. I'm very insecure and went through abuse in past relationships (hence the PTSD) and have the habit of self sabotaging. What scares me is to go through what his ex did: him finding someone better and emotionally cheating on me.

He has changed a lot (doesn't follow girls, removed a bunch of followers) and not because I asked, but because he knows my self esteem problems and says he doesn't miss it, that it adds nothing to his life. But I'm still afraid my karma is out to get me.

When I was pregnant, my friend, Michelle, my age, had given me a gorgeous necklace as a present for my pregnancy. She said I could do what I wanted with it. It came in a beautiful little box and ribbon and I had planned to keep it in the family. 

Recently, to celebrate my son (Matt)'s first birthday, my sister flew in from England to help with my baby. My sister is a jeweler as well, conveniently. She does live far and we often communicate only through text or call, and the COVID situation from 2021 made it even harder to see eachother. I never really discussed the necklace with my sister until then, as I always thought it was a cheaper present, until I put it on when we were going out for dinner. I'd left Matt with a babysitter and we were at the restaurant when my sister had asked where I got the necklace from.

I was happy she noticed but told her it was a gift, and my sister asked me to look at it. I didn't think much of it until she mentioned it seemed expensive, and after a bit of searching and checking around we found out it was actually worth a ton. I won't go into specifics, and no, not millions or tens of thousands of dollars, but enough for me to make enough for a bit to help support my family or keep it in the family as an expensive necklace. 

Michelle also found out, most likely from me messaging family and friends, and messaged me back asking for the necklace back. She apparently had been gifted the necklace as well from a relative but also thought it was cheap, and I replied back that I intended to keep it. Michelle started calling me selfish, saying it was hers first and she never knew the value. Now my husband and sister are saying Michelle shouldn't have given it away, but I know Michelle could use the money and I think it's true she never knew the value too, or she wouldn't have given it to me.

He had no real reason for not wanting one and in his own words said it was because he liked being driven around and he had mom, me, grandparents, and friends to drive him where he needed and if push came to shove he could use an Uber since he has a job. We live in the sticks and every other kid his age couldn't wait and we even offered to buy him a little used car, but whatever. My wife and I grew tired of driving him everywhere at the end of last semester and made him get a license. He still won't accept the 2010 Honda I offered to buy him, said he probably won't ever use it. Now he drives our car but we don't have to be with him.

He went out the other day and about 15 minutes later he calls me in tears because he'd been in an accident. Based on how upset he was I thought it was serious and managed to get enough info out of him that I could go and find him. I show up and it was barely a fender bender. The only damage was some very minor scratches and a dent. The lady he hit was more concerned for him than the damage. My son refused to get out of the car, just kept crying.

I got in with him and made sure he was okay and then I told him he needed to get out of the car and go speak to the lady he hit. He told me to do it for him. I told him that he hit the lady's car so he needed to take responsibility. He reluctantly got out, they exchanged info, police weren't even called at the lady's insistence. The lady even gave my son a hug and told him he just needed to be more careful, drive a little slower, and leave more space because she said he had been tailgating her. My son ended up breaking down again when she said that and refused to drive the other car home. Fortunately our neighbors were driving by and the wife offered to drive the car home so I could drive my son.

My son is now pissed at me because he said I disregarded his feelings and emotional state and made him feel even worse than he already did. He told me I was insensitive. I told him I was sorry I made him feel that way but at 17 years old you are old enough to take responsibility. I told him he caused the accident, no one else.

My Mother (47F) and sister didn't get along either, but it was much much worse than me and my sister.

So earlier today my mom was looking at my Asshat aunt's Facebook page through my phone since she is blocked on my mother's. I'm not a fan of this but there's nothing I can do. So, my mom was reading the comments on my one of my aunt's posts and noticed she could see my sister's comment. So, she went diving through to see what my sister was up too.

Now, like I said, me and my sister don't get along. We haven't for years now and honestly, I was glad to have her out of the house as she made my day to day much harder than it needed to be and it got to the point where sometimes, I kinda forget she exists. Which has been pretty good for my mental health. So, my mom is sitting there going ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!"" which startled the hell out of me and shows me my sister's page and what she's been up to. I would have been perfectly happy not to have that information. I'm glad that my sister is happy and all, but I would have also been glad if she sat there wallowing in her own sorrow since she made my life a literal hell scape.

So, she starts going on and on and on about how my sister was such a bad influence on me and my mental health and how she's like a black hole of emotion and what not. My mom is a very spiritual person, she can see and feel things that others can't so I have no idea exactly how much she can see from others. (I hope that makes sense) and this whole down putting session goes on for 2 HOURS. By the time it's finally over I'm tired and go to bed.

So, this is where the yelling comes in. We woke up and were going on with the day and she gets this stupid little meme thing on Facebook that essentially says ""Myth: You can't cut off your family, Truth: You can cut out anyone who is unhealthy in your life."" Which at first, I'm like okay yeah, I get that. Then she starts up about my sister again. And I hadn't had damn enough coffee to deal with her, so I screamed. I yelled, i said every damned thought that I had in my head because I was done. ""I do not have the mental space to listen to you go on for another 2 hours about sister just because you don't like her. I don't care what she does, I don't care if she gets pregnant, gets a tattoo, or goes to Mars for that matter. I'm done with this"" (I yelled a lot more; this is just what I can clearly remember) and afterwards I stormed off to cool down. And even afterwards I've been a bit cold when talking to her.

So, after being married for four years and having two children, my husband says he doesn’t want more kids… even though he said when we first met that he wanted at least three or four, and gushed about how much he valued a woman that could give him a big family. 

So my youngest is 2, about to turn 3. It’s the perfect time to start trying for a third child. Our first two are both girls, and i really really want to try for a boy. I’d love a little son that comes out the spitting image of my husband. 
I know that three kids sounds exhausting. But I think it would be amazing. My first two pregnancies, we both lived with our parents. The environment was toxic. I was working different jobs until the day I gave birth, both times. 
But we’ve finally achieved financial stability together. We finally have a house and a safe and cozy environment. Our daughters have flourished since we finally moved into our own place. Our marriage is the best it has ever been. Everything is perfect. 
So why is it so insane that I want another child? A pregnancy where I’ll finally be able to enjoy every moment of it. My daughters cooing over the new baby. Me finally getting the opportunity to stay home and raise my son without being out of my mind on depression meds or trying to pass him off to whoever will watch him for free so that I can pay bills….
A stress free pregnancy. A relaxed infancy. 
I’m the one who will be doing all of the physical raising anyways. I don’t understand why he doesn’t want another child…. 
Maybe the men on here can help me to understand my husbands point of view?? 
I don’t have the heart to bring this up to him again and upset him. But I also don’t know how to deal with this anguish any longer…. 

I came from a broken home. I hardly speak with most of my family. When I married him, I was brought into the coolest, most amazing family. He has several sisters and talks to his parents every day.

I usually stay there for about 4-5 hours every week and my partner knows how meaningful it is to me. I normally drive myself and never ask for this kind of favour, but needed some help this week. It’s only a 15-minute drive, so I hoped it would be fine. 

Long story short, she said no, and I was a bit bummed. Her reasoning was that she needed to cram study for a job interview the next day. She said that if she drove me she wouldn’t be able to focus because she would have to pick me up later and would think about that. She has struggled with focusing a lot to the point where she has never studied for interviews a part from one occasion where I had to push her and she finally studied and was glad she did. 

Since she chose to study so last minute for this interview, I had the feeling it wasn’t going to happen at all. I felt like her excuse for not being able to give me a lift was not genuine because I didn’t feel like she would study in the first place. So I was honest and told her that I felt she wouldn’t study. I personally didn’t think of this as an insult, if anything I hoped it would help the interview situation feel more urgent.

This all happened in the morning. She left silently and kind of passive aggressively to go work at a coworking space and when she came back, she walked into the bedroom where I was and said, “you’re right, so I cancelled the interview.” It was the first thing she said to me when she got home and I felt like she was trying to blame me, but if anything she proved me right. She told me I should apologize for what I said about thinking she wouldn’t study. But to be honest, I’m tired of sugarcoating things.

I had my backpack, a bag of groceries, and the bag with beers. My driver was helping me get out, but when I asked for a hand up he said he couldn't touch a woman he is not related to.

I had to switch hotels, so I took a cab from the first one to the next. It was a different driver, and he came into the hotel to help. The same thing happened! He said he could not take the bag that had beer in it. I said ok, I will come back for it.

My best friend in middle school through high school was hard of hearing in one ear and completely deaf in the other, so she mostly used ASL to communicate. I learned how to sign from her and I often use ASL to both communicate with other Deaf people but also because I feel I can better explain my thoughts through ASL.

My friend (27F) has a 17 month old son who has yet to speak. He points to things, understands when spoken to and even makes sounds but he does not say words. His doctor said he would consider early intervention for speech delay if he was not speaking by 18 months. Well, because I work from home and do not have a very demanding job, for the past 4 months or so I have been babysitting my friend’s son Mon-Thurs as she and her husband both work in-person 9-5s (kiddo stays with his grandma on Fridays.) Not thinking anything of it, I started teaching him some simple signs like “hungry” “more” “finish” “play” etc. and to my surprise, he has actually been picking up on it because apparently he was signing to his mom yesterday and she clocked it as ASL. She was furious about this, and she says I am an absolute asshole for teaching ASL to her son with a speech delay without even asking her, because now it will be even more difficult for him to ever learn how to speak and he will need speech therapy because of it. In a moment of frustration, I told her maybe she should be happy her son is actually communicating with her rather than focusing on HOW he is doing it since it isn’t harming anybody and suggested she learn ASL instead of complaining about how her son communicates. She told me I would no longer be watching her son.

I've had to isolate the bird and the kitten, but once in a while the parrot escapes the room and almost got clawed during those incidents and im extremely furious because I'm the one taking care, and I didn't want another kitten, and to top it I just lost my old kitten im not over that, and now put another living being in harms way, I've been telling him to actively find some who wants her and can adopt her, he gets pissed that I've been telling him this and came home wanting to leave the kitten in the street, I convinced him instead to go to a vet, she's back home with me for now, and my fiance is yelling at me saying im reminding him everyday that he fucked up and to stop I told him I'm the one taking care and dealing with the kitten even when it's supposed to be his responsibility, and he's just been telling me all I do is grill him and annoy him.

(I have always been a very hands on parent, very helpful around the house, do a lot of things with our kids). This is all while working full time in a senior role. What has suffered during this time was my ability to have any time for myself, to even take an hour to read a book or do anything I wanted to do. I was sleeping less hours than I should and was getting burnt out.

If the kids were around = looking after them.  
Kids not around = working.

Due to this, I started working from home more and had an arrangement that due to the nature of my role, I was able to take time off during the day as needed. This was offset by the fact I was able to work after hours to make up the time. I have kept really good records of this and they are very happy with how I have managed this.

My wife has recently started some medication and this has really helped her. Now that she is back to ""normal"", I have taken a step back and am trying to get a better balance. I am still doing a heap to help out but am now not always the one to take the kids to appointments or do the school drop off and pickups. I have done this to allow me to work more during the day, so I don't have to do as much of a night time, this would give me some time back for me and the things I like to do.

My wife has noticed this and it has caused a fight, where I have said that now as she is better, I need to get back to a more sustainable position, where I am not trying to do everything. Her POV is that I have done this for the last year, so now she is better, I will keep doing what I have done and she can now have more free time for herself.

Just because I have done this for a year, does not mean I can do it forever.

I have three niblings in total, [F5, F4 and M2.] I do a lot of babysiting as my parents say that it's my role as an aunt and that I need to practice for when I have kids, and that I have to help out family. However Ive never babysat all three kids without at least one of my parents helping me except with what happened in this story.

Both of my brothers wives are currently pregnant. A month ago on a weekend my brothers basically dumped all three of the kids on me at my parents' house with no notice, and said that they have to go to work and their wives (who are both SAHM's) do not feel well enough to look after the kids.

This really annoyed me because they literally gave me zero notice they just showed up when I was home alone and dropped the kids off on the porch. Plus they know that I feel more comfourtable babysitting at their houses because my parents house isn't childproofed, but didn't even offer me the option.

Anyway, I took the kids inside and tried my best too look after them. My older niece is autistic and she's a handful on her own, plus she was really upset that she was at another house.

To make a long story short, I got really overwhelmed as my older niece was having meltdown after meltdown and my 4 year old niece was throwing tantrums as well and being really defiant, plus I was trying to cook them dinner and I was trying to keep an eye on the stove.

I immediately called the hospital and they said my nephew needs to come in urgently. They gave me some first aid advice as well. I called my brother and explained what happened. He came back from work and took my nephew to the hospital while I stayed home with my nieces. He was really mad at me.

Luckily my nephew was okay, they sent him home the same day with some medicine.

My brother is super pissed at me and said that it's all my fault and that I should be ashamed of myself. My parents have grounded me and said that I'm irresponsible and need to smarten up.

I told my brother that it wouldn't have happened if he and my other brother hasn't dumped their kids on me at a non childproof house. I told him he only has himself to blame.

Fast-forward a few days and a Venmo request comes in from the tab-getter for my share of food/drink that day. (context: wasn't cheap for me, but split it among everyone there and it's probably &lt;10 bucks per). I was put off and immediately knee-jerk rejected it.

I feel like a huge asshole because I would never want to be ungrateful, even understanding I did it because I felt under-appreciated.

Annie married her first husband when she was 21. I was pretty young then and I remember him being kind and caring. But the way Annie talks about him even now, she seems to put some type of saint status on him (surely no guy is this perfect). He died of a sudden stroke not long after they married.

Annie then married 'John' (M42/43), he's extremely well off and a really nice guy overall, but they ended up divorcing a couple of years ago. Me and my boyfriend ended up being good friends with him. She just kept saying it 'isn't working out' or whatever, but we thought Annie just never tried and held onto her 'young love'. Nevertheless, their decision.

Me and my bf hosted a small Thanksgiving lunch this year mainly family and some friends. We decided to invite John, as again, we consider him our friend and I assumed everyone could be civil, you know. My niece was also at lunch and I thought she and John might want to catch up as well.

My assumption Annie could be civil was completely wrong and as soon as John showed up, she started asking me why he's here and why I would invite him. I replied she knows we're still friends with John and we invited him as a friend. 

John didn't stay for long, but Annie was pissed. Even my niece got involved saying we never should've invited John and went off at me. I eventually got tired and said it's my house, I can invite whoever I want and now Annie's turned my niece against John also. He's friends with both me and my boyfriend and we both decided to invite him, end of story.

We had the engagement party and it was the best night of my life. The next morning, my sister (who attended) told me that my parents officially “disown me” because I didn’t invite them to a monumental event. I am perplexed by this as they have showed nothing, but, disinterest and contempt.

Im a professional driver that has logged over 4 rounds of complete deliveries of human life and cargo through every lower 48, Canada, W.Europe + UK. With zero incidents. I can provide at least 50 names who will corroborate this.

I rented and used this vehicle to make a grocery run because my work van and over $5k worth of my career was stolen last month, and I needed to buy too much cat food and litter to walk. Due to both physical disability of the damage Covid left on my lung, and the cat supplies at 60+lbs.

I chose the late rental hour of 8pm - 12am to decrease probability incident occurring.

I'm setting the stage to support my character and the statistical probability of me being responsible for the damage to the vehicle.

With how the getaround app is designed, it require us to take photos post trip. Interestingly, it wontdurt save the photos on the users phone.

Therefore, it is on the legal burden of YOU to prove my innocence for the damage of this vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 33yr old, white male handyman, who is facing an eviction in 3 days. Due to not being able to work like I used to, for the obvious work van theft with most of my career, and the lack of savings due to everything is fucking expensive in Long Beach, California, and when you take a hit like I have, sometimes there's no coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

Id love to move in with my parents, but hey, my dad Od'd when I was 3 and when I was 23, my mom Od'd, he was 33 and she was 44. He also was a tradesman, but he broke his back and lived with a lot of pain, and my mom was giving a patient CPR, and she slipped a disc in her back when she was 30. She suffered a long time to make sure her youngest graduated high school before succumbing to the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a child of the opioid epidemic, what can you do?

&amp;#x200B;

Despite only using a half gallon of gas, I still put $25 in her tank - despite my financial situation.

Because, once again, she was just like me, my deceased parents, my ex and her parents.

Even though I know you won't refund my $400, I don't wish the false accuser ill will. I know how hard it is out here for all of us, and sometimes we hurt people to our benefit, because we don't have a lot of options.                                                                                                                                                                                  

It is a lot more suspicious that I happened to damage her vehicle on the very first rental. Just maybe I'm the one being victimized here, especially given my solid record using the app before with 0 marks on my in

I just hope you'll think twice about hurting someone like this again, and remember that we are all suffering the same. Lend a hand or put an extra $20 in someones tank. It can really make a difference, but don't harm someone in order to gain ""$400 + damages"".

We had a small, simple ceremony that lasted maybe 15 minutes. We hired a professional officiant who had the parents walk down the aisle before the bridal party. Since my dad was walking with me, my mom needed someone to walk with. I had 2 choices: my brother who is 11 years older than me and moved out to live with his dad when I was 5, or my cousin who is 4 years older and who I grew up with. I will say nowadays I see my brother more, maybe twice a year, compared to every other year with my cousin. Either way, I felt closer to my cousin, and always got the impression I annoyed my brother and that he resented me. 

Anyway, when my family arrived to my formal wedding, my brother was wearing jeans and my cousin was wearing dress pants and a dress shirt. My mother and I figured my brother probably didn't care who did the walking based on how he was dressed anyway and I had my cousin walk her. We were wrong. Apparently my brother and his wife left immediately after the ceremony and skipped the reception, btw ditching a relative who they agreed to give a ride home to. I found out during the reception that they weren't there and started crying a lot. The photographer thought they were happy tears so I got lot of photos of that (yay). I really didn't know it meant that much to him. I wasn't trying to hurt his feelings.

My brother and his wife have not since spoken to me and have started completely ignoring my mother as well even though she's tried to reach out multiple times and apologize. She called me the other day crying because to her, her kids are the most important parts of her life and she feels like shes losing her only son. She raised him single-handedly for 10 years and had always been there to help him. I actually had to guess at the reason they left and are ignoring me because they never even bothered to say it to me. I messaged to ask but was ignored.

Her lack of cleanliness has been an ongoing problem since we signed the lease. We have tried multiple different ways to communicate to her how we are dissatisfied with her uncooperativeness to keep our shared spaces clean. And every time we’ve tried to sit down and talk about this issue she would avoid it, something would always come up, or she would literally just freak out because she couldn’t take the confrontation. We successfully had somewhat of a talk about this ongoing situation with her a couple months ago, she promised she’d start cooperating with the chores but to no surprise the discussion had no effect at all. This last weekend, we had enough. We had guests coming over and had told her that we were going to have guests over days ahead, giving her ample time to clean the bathroom. She is responsible for cleaning the guest bathroom because she uses it we have our own bathroom in our room. She has seldom cleaned that bathroom since we moved in and it has been 8 months. I could count on one hand the amount of times she’s cleaned that bathroom. We have been the only people cleaning that bathroom on the regular. She leaves shit stains in the the toilet, pee stains on the seat, let’s the trash in the bathroom pile…she literally thought that the shower/tub cleaned itself because of the water coming out of the shower head. The bathroom has been so filthy to the point her significant other has commented on it. The bathroom situation got to a point where we stopped cleaning it to give her a message that she should have to clean her own shit not us. Before leaving for the weekend she left a mess in the kitchen, which she has done many times before. There was flour on the counter, dirty plates out, old food in the fridge, etc. My fiancé and I upset of the filth she had left for us to clean up once again sent her messages of how it is unfair that we have to always clean up after her.  Her response to our messages was that she was going to start cleaning the bathroom and fridge every Thursday, she also bought her own trash can for the kitchen which we didn’t ask of her. It doesn’t make sense to buy your own trash can if we already have a shared one in the kitchen that we take turns taking out and even then it is mostly my fiancé and I taking the trash out. Tonight we threw a small bag of trash that belonged to her into the trash can she bought for herself since we got the memo that the trash can she brought was just for her. A couple hours later she took the bag we had thrown into her trash can and threw it into ours and labeled her trash can. My fiancé told her the bag we threw in her trash was in fact hers. Once my partner told me what she did, I went off on her. She quickly caught an attitude and tried to shut me down telling me she has to go to sleep and that she had work in the morning.

My Mother (47F) and sister didn't get along either, but it was much much worse than me and my sister.

So earlier today my mom was looking at my Asshat aunt's Facebook page through my phone since she is blocked on my mother's. I'm not a fan of this but there's nothing I can do. So, my mom was reading the comments on my one of my aunt's posts and noticed she could see my sister's comment. So, she went diving through to see what my sister was up too.

Now, like I said, me and my sister don't get along. We haven't for years now and honestly, I was glad to have her out of the house as she made my day to day much harder than it needed to be and it got to the point where sometimes, I kinda forget she exists. Which has been pretty good for my mental health. So, my mom is sitting there going ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!"" which startled the hell out of me and shows me my sister's page and what she's been up to. I would have been perfectly happy not to have that information. I'm glad that my sister is happy and all, but I would have also been glad if she sat there wallowing in her own sorrow since she made my life a literal hell scape.

So, she starts going on and on and on about how my sister was such a bad influence on me and my mental health and how she's like a black hole of emotion and what not. My mom is a very spiritual person, she can see and feel things that others can't so I have no idea exactly how much she can see from others. (I hope that makes sense) and this whole down putting session goes on for 2 HOURS. By the time it's finally over I'm tired and go to bed.

So, this is where the yelling comes in. We woke up and were going on with the day and she gets this stupid little meme thing on Facebook that essentially says ""Myth: You can't cut off your family, Truth: You can cut out anyone who is unhealthy in your life."" Which at first, I'm like okay yeah, I get that. Then she starts up about my sister again. And I hadn't had damn enough coffee to deal with her, so I screamed. I yelled, i said every damned thought that I had in my head because I was done. ""I do not have the mental space to listen to you go on for another 2 hours about sister just because you don't like her. I don't care what she does, I don't care if she gets pregnant, gets a tattoo, or goes to Mars for that matter. I'm done with this"" (I yelled a lot more; this is just what I can clearly remember) and afterwards I stormed off to cool down. And even afterwards I've been a bit cold when talking to her.

I still love her, but like all siblings we argue.

The biggest argument we have is that we are in different stages in life. For a number of reasons that are irrelevant to this story, my husband and I decided to get married when we were  20. I proposed when I was 19 actually. Right before we got married were considering a baby but before we reached a final decision I got pregnant. It was more of a surprise but still, I was very young ( im 99% sure he was conceived on my 20th birthday. What do you think my birthday present was? LOL) She has said many times she wants to be a young mom too, and I tell her that the reason we started so early was because of every specific scenerios, and I wouldnt reccomend it unless you're really prepared and are financially able to. It starts almost all of our arguments.

I have since moved across the state and she asked if she can visit. I said ill ask my husband. He said of course and he offered to pay for the ticket. She also has friends here she plans on visiting.

One thing about my sister is she smokes marijuana. I dont mind it too much as long as im not around it. She's never respected my wishes and always smokes in front of me and when I ask her to not do that around me because it makes me uncomfortable she says she needs it.

I told her he said yes, but she cant bring any marijuana. My sister has a perscrioption for anxiety but she's said multiple times to me she doesnt even have anxiety she just likes the discount at the dispensary.

My husband and I have a sober home. No alcohol, and especially no marijuana. We are both 100% sober. Ive never smoked or drank alcohol in the first place, but his dad had a bad drinking problem so its a big deal to him that I respect.

My sister said thats ridiculous and she will bring her vaporizer. I said I dont want that in my house. Here's the thing, my sister is meeting friends here as well, and im sure they smoke as well. If she really needs it she can make arrangements with her friends. She said that it doest work like that.

She's only coming here for maybe 3 days. Can she not go 3 days without marijuana?

My son (22) who is a trans man and just started hormones about a year ago is unhappy that he's expected to wear a dress. We're going to a really nice restaurant and want to look our best. He had a suit picked out that he liked but I'm concerned about how the rest of the family will react when they see him like this.

Our extended family doesn't know about his transitioning. He thinks they know, I actually haven't told anyone because I don't know how to break it to them. My parents as well as my mother-in-law are extremely traditional and I don't want to rock the boat especially not now.

I don't really understand this trans thing myself but I have noticed that since he's been on testosterone my son seems a lot happier and calmer. He used to have really bad anxiety and a lot of that has gone away. I still have a lot of trouble thinking of him as a boy and this is very hard for me because I always wanted a daughter and now I don't have a daughter anymore. He has been unhappy being seen as a girl and referred himself as a boy from an early age. My husband and I really hoped that this was just a phase and that after he grew into himself during puberty he would learn to embrace being a woman. But it's been years and that hasn't happened which was why me and my husband decided to help him find a gender therapist after he came out to us about a year ago. As hard as this gender thing is for me to understand, since he seems so much calmer I want him to feel supported.

I worry I might not be doing that by making him wear a dress. He's at that stage where he doesn't look like a woman anymore but he also doesn't look like a grown man. If anything he looks kind of like a skinny teenage boy. He didn't yell at me, but he has seemed grumpy and withdrawn ever since I've brought it up. Almost like he's avoiding me.

They both offered to host a shower early on and I asked to wait until after at least the 20 week anatomy scan to decide because of everything we have been through. 

My sister's baby shower was 8 years ago. At that time I was actively addicted to using opiates. My mom actually planned her shower and I thought it was nice other than being small because she no longer lived in the area and her husband's family was far away. We had a big fight about my use the night before but made up for the shower and I ended up checking into long term treatment a month later and have been clean the 8 years since. 

I waited until early oct. to bring up having my shower.

This led to me getting really upset and in a fight with my sister.

She also called me self centered for asking after how shitty her shower was. So in order to keep the peace my mom said she would pay for the whole thing and my sister wanted to plan it.

The shower is next weekend. The invites got delayed and some people just received theirs while others still don't have theirs. A few of my friends and close family have been reaching out to my mom or sister asking about how they can help with shower and get no response.

Well she never did and MIL almost died and now needs care 24/7. However middle SIL takes care of her most of the time and sometimes the other sibling hav to step in. But the youngest SIL has always excuses and got caught when she lied about that. One day I went for a walk with the kids and middle SIL. It started to rain and I went to the car with the nephew and suddenly middle SIL’s phone rang. Nephew picked it up, it was the youngest SIL asking for her sister. He replied and suddenly she asked: “Where is the piece of s.” I gasped and mind you this kid turned pale in seconds. He changed the language and that was enough proof for me that she meant me. I mean I knew it but I couldn’t believe it. As she and I never talked much but always acted polite with each other. However I left the car the whole situation and walked all the way home while it rained. I told my bf but he was working and couldn’t do much. Called my bestie who was shocked and said it’s probably not the first and last time she talks like that about me. 
When my bf came home he said the whole family got my back. Stupid me decided to confront her the next day. I asked her what’s her problem and she literally said YOU are my problem. She said me and my bf had a fight while we visited them and the mother cried bc of us. I didn’t knew that and apologized. However she started saying I would treat her brother bad, which is a lie. He is spoiled and I said it’s not her relationship so not her business. We are grown and can solve things right? But she kept on saying no you’re a piece of s. I gave the phone to my bf and left the situation. 
His sisters never socialized and living off the welfare. They never worked and my bf warned me once and said “they can’t behave”. A few weeks later the middle SIL called and I told her about a wedding venue as she offered help. Suddenly she asked if the youngest SIL will be invited too. I laughed and asked why should I invite her? She said she is family and that I have to and if not, she won’t attempt the wedding. I said you’re choosing a side. The youngest insulted me, didn’t apologize and when she had the chance to clear things, she kept on insulting me. So no, not going to invite someone who clearly hates me and insults me.

The relationship that she and I have is, we are always 100% honest with each other and we've told each other a lot over the years how much we appreciate that the other doesn't bullshit when it comes to giving advice or opinions.

She's worked for her employer for 5 years now. She was an intern in college, once she graduated she got officially brought on. Over these 5 years, she's put on a lot of weight. She thought it was a medical problem like a thyroid issue or PCOS. Her doctor said it wasn't.

She and her co-workers tend to go out to lunch during the week, or get it delivered. It's not uncommon for them to hit happy hour or dinner after work, and then eat out together on the weekends.

She put all of these diet apps on her phone but, she doesn't use them longer than a few days then she decides dieting is too hard.

I was hanging out with her a few days ago and she was telling me that she's now reached a new heaviest weight. She was trying to pin her weight problem on her co-workers, saying its their fault because they invite her out. She asked me what I should do.

 I told her that she is the sole cause of her weight being what it is and that she doesn't need to go looking for scapegoats, that she needs to look in the mirror if she's looking for who to blame.

She didn't like that and said that only an AH would blame someone for a problem that is, "" out of their control"" as she put it.

When the tab came around, there were some jokes saying ""birthday boys got this right?"" with a counter of ""no he drinks for free!"" and the like, but one of them ultimately got the tab.

Fast-forward a few days and a Venmo request comes in from the tab-getter for my share of food/drink that day.

My 18 year old brother is getting married in a couple weeks to a 22 year old. I think the marriage is a terrible idea for several reasons, including the fact that their “relationship” started before he was 18 and while she was still married so I feel like this whole situation reeks of grooming and instability but who knows she could just be reaallyyyyy immature for her age or something and I’m just being super judgy. 

I know that this wedding will happen whether we want it to or not so I am trying to be civilly supportive so he doesn’t get isolated in a relationship to have it turn sour and not have anyone to turn to. I volunteered to go suit shopping with my brother and offered to help the fiance with decorations but she said her mom had it covered. 

My brother put us all (my brother, his fiancé, my sister, me and my husband) in a group chat to talk about the wedding plans. It is a very small wedding with about 12 people going. They decided to have a potluck. 

In the group chat, we had tentatively agreed on who would bring what when the fiancé added her mom to the group chat who then changed the plan and asked us to bring other stuff. My sister and I again each picked a dish to bring. The mom then asked us to bring two dishes each since the budget is tight and they want to make sure everyone gets food. 

The thing is, I really don’t want to. I feel like if they can’t afford to bring food to their own wedding then they can’t afford to get married. I feel like it’s frustrating that we’ve offered and everything we’ve thought of has been shot down.

I have known his boss for a long time. We've known each other longer than Marty was in the picture, but they work closely together.

I messaged his boss about a month ago with my Christmas present idea. It's industry related and I was hoping for price options as well as some cool custom pieces from his coworkers and friends. I just got back a ""I'll look into it and see what I can find"" kind of response.

Today Marty and I were talking on the phone while he was driving home from work and he excitedly told me about a present his boss and coworkers got him. So yep, minus the custom parts I was planning to get, they got him exactly what I messaged. I don't know if they had already been planning on it before I messaged, but if they had just told me ""hey, that's already in the works!"" I would have been like *oh shit, okay!*

But now I don't know if my idea for something really meaningful for someone I love was just stolen, or if they just didn't tell me. And either way I feel upset. I did tell him that's what I was doing and that I had messaged about it, but then I just got quiet and said I was gonna let him go off the phone.

But now my father tells me that im a dissapointment and that i cannot respond to anything my mother says to me, even if it is something bad, because i am the daughter and she Is the mother, and there Is a family hierarchy that i must respect, even if i am right, she Is my mother and i cant talk back at her...AITA for not wanting to apologize?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836145,public,top,self,AITA for cursing back at my mom?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7j2fl/aita_for_cursing_back_at_my_mom/,all_ads,6,,,

Warning, this is messy and a bit confusing perhaps.

I met two friends in an mmo online. We got along well and have been playing together for awhile now; I thought we were very close friends. We talk daily and do stuff together daily. I roleplay with one of them (yes, including smut stuff). But I started noticing that they lie a lot. The girl originally said she was in a poly relationship then she told me actually she's a guy irl and it's just a ""normal"" monogamous relationship but she has gender confusion and considers her male and female self as separate; I'm going to call this person A. Then the guy (I'll call him person B) told me he's actually not new to the game (they both pretended they were new, so I have been trying to help them a lot), and had been playing for quite some time. Then A tried to prove she was new by showing me a picture that accidentally revealed she was also lying (to show me she only has one character but it showed her sub time which was ... very long). 

At this point I called her out on it and she still tried to continue lying. Whatever, I guess. Eventually I just said I was tired of feeling constantly lied to and B told me the truth that they are dating irl and neither are new. This made me feel really awkward since B and I do smutty rps together and now I feel like I'm being disrespectful to A. There have been a few times A seemed jealous to me but she insisted she wasn't so I brushed it off. Now I'm second guessing that and I feel really bad and I'm just upset they kept this from me when I thought we were close friends.

I tried to figure out why they would and A said that B wanted to present as male online and not let anyone know. I said I mean, I understand that and he could have done - I think they could have been honest about their relationship and not being new without revealing that. But A said ""No, you made her feel bad by saying you felt like we lied to you and she likes you so she told you"" and that it shouldn't matter what the real life stuff is. So now I feel awful for even being upset or asking about this stuff. I just thought we were close friends - we talk about real life stuff happening a lot and on several occasions, B has said he was happy that I opened up to him about things. 

I just don't know what to make of this. I'm just moving on from it and pretending it didn't happen but now A doesn't want to talk to me at all, though B does.

I didn't hear from them until 2 days before. This isn't my first rodeo and, at least where I'm from, 2 days is not uncommonly close. The artists sent on the design and I was initially quite happy with it.


But after doing some digging on the usual sites (reddit, diviantart, etc) I came across the exact same design. Literally pixel for pixel, it was what they sent me. I also checked, it's not their post, and it actually dates back to before they started tattooing.


I don't know if they were planning to tailor the design on the day as I had already said that I was happy with it (not knowing it was someone else's when I said this). 


Anyway a few of my friends have told me that I'm am asshole for cancelling at the last minute and that they have lost a whole day of work as the piece would've taken hours. I was also told that you can't expect a completely unique design from a tattoo.

Ok backstory first, I'm a high school freshman who just got into a public high school for the first time and I've made the mistake of not socialising on the first few days and because of that I’ve developed a reputation for being a weirdo and loner

Our teacher assigned us to make a bracelet for a school project and we had to do it in class basically here comes the kid who I sent to the guidance’s office let's call him Gambo he went to the front row sit so he can sit with his friends and there were three spare chairs in the front row but the one he picked was next to me so he can chat with his friends in the back of that seat and me who was telling him not to sit in the seat because there were fragile art materials in that seat which belong to me and the other girl sitting after that seat

And when I told Gambo that he cannot sit in that seat because there were fragile materials and I needed it for the after-school project he and his friends just laughed at me and tell me to brush it off since it wasn’t mine but then I told him it wasn’t his either and he wasn’t even on the same row and his friend one of the school council members in our class told me to shut up and just let him so I shut up

So as 20 mins passed the teacher is gone I'm still glaring at him and told him to just move to other seats quietly he still laughed at me then he moved to get some beads for his bracelet in the back next to his friends and me as my hatred was booming he was on his way to the front row again and I also dropped my almost completed bracelet in the ground but this was also unexpected so I just blamed him and told him he could have just told me to move and faked a cry 

A lunch break passed and I was still crying but thinking inside is it worth it but still cried eventually our math teacher came and saw that I was crying and a few of my classmates that I don't even know vouched for me
And he was scolded and our math teacher asked for our class advisor who scolded him too

Our advisor told me to wash up and stop crying and go to the bathroom I did and as I was heading upstairs on the way to our classroom our other subject teacher was passing by and she was also the school counsellor. She saw my eyes red and wet then my hair which was red my expression too so she asked me what happened 

I told her someone made me cry but we “made up” she looked like she didn’t believe it and pitied me she told two student teachers who were with her to take me to the guidance’s office and I went there a few minutes passed them boom boom surprise that bastard is here 

I cried which looked convincing, didn’t give him chances to talk, accused him multiple times and we were both signing a paper that was gonna have his parents in by tomorrow

I feel like I’ve won and I'm not sorry about it all i don’t want ppl to bully me which has been happening for 3 months now and prob continue the same but still AITA",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4836118,public,top,self,AITA for staining a kid’s clean record and sending them to the guidance’s office?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7ix2d/aita_for_staining_a_kids_clean_record_and_sending/,all_ads,6,,,

My niece's birthday came around and I wasn't sure what to get her. My boyfriend (we were together for 7 months at this time) came up with the brilliant idea of getting her a Build-a-Bear with her favorite fandom's outfit. We get to Build-a-Bear and we find a cute little bear for her, but all of the outfits are out of stock. The worker informed me she could have it sent to our address, but it would arrive after my niece's birthday party. Then I had a great idea. We have her make the bear herself, let her pick out a second outfit, and take her to her restaurant of choice for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone was excited over the gift and other family members thought it was a good idea. My sister and I were going to set up a time for my niece to get her day of fun. Flash forward a month, and I heard nothing from my sister. Radio silence. I message her on FaceBook to see what days her child is free. I understand that they are very busy with sports, scouts and friends, so it is no big deal if they are just busy. But, I see her messaging other people and posting on FaceBook while my message goes ignored. I try to call, it is ignored. I try to text, it is ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until two months after we gave my niece the unstuffed bear that my sister messaged me back to set up a time. We had a lovely day with my niece. My boyfriend was prepared to allow my niece to buy whatever she wanted, but I put a little bit of a restriction so he didn't get smacked with a $500+ bill. For context, my boyfriend was more than willing to spend that much if it made her happy, but I didn't want him to spend that much on a kid that isn't related to him. The day totaled to about $250 since we made a bear for an out-of-state grandparent that she also got to pick out, name and give an outfit for.

&amp;#x200B;

For fairness, we were going to do the same thing with my nephew for his birthday. When his birthday we picked out a bear and an outfit for him that is the same fandom since he shares this interest with his sister and he requested this outfit. He is extremely excited for his day of fun where he will get a second outfit for his bear as well as making a bear for the same out-of-state grandparent. This was bought by me and I expect to spend close to $250 if my boyfriend doesn't insist on covering the bill while the store.

&amp;#x200B;

The same thing has happened. I've tried to ask my sister what days are free and I have gotten no responses back. It is even longer than it was when my boyfriend and I did this with my niece.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, I don't want to go through the effort of getting them any presents for Christmas. I will still send them money, but I dislike that I go through the effort to pick out presents and be ignored. Last Christmas, my nephew was pretending to be bored and disinterested in every gift he opened.
