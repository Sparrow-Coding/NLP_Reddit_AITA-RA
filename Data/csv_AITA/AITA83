I (f25) been baysitting for this guy (m37-38?) ""Nick"" for 4 months now. he's a widower, has 2 kids (7 &amp; 5). I can not express just how much the kids are attatched to me - ngl, it did feel a little too much, but I kept saying that they probably going through grief and stuff like and so I offered lots of free services like doing meal prep for the whole week since they won't eat any food exxcept what I cook, also handling their homework and hobbies and arranging their visits, sometimes even go with them and their dad.


This is the first Thanksgiving after meeting them. I asked Nick for a day off (obviously because holiday) but to my surprise, he said he'd like for me yo spend Thanksgiving with the kids because they for one, felt alone as this is their first Thanksgiving without their mom. And two, he said my presence would make them happier and more open to eating. I politely declined and told him I had plans to stay with family but he said it'd be for few hours and even offered me double. I still said no til the kids started pulling me refusing to let me go. Ngl, I felt stock. I started getting texts from family asking where I was. This idea occured to me after seeing their dad go to into the kitcjen to set table for thanksgiving dinner. I had the kids sit watch disney then grabbed my key and purse and sneaked out then got inyo my car and drove off. 

In about 10 minutes, Nick was calling me. Again and again then texted me but I turned my phone off. I got home to my family and we had dinner. I turned my phone on later to Nick's message saying that I was wrong to sneak out and now have caused the kids to have a breakdown and go to bed without dinner - he literally accused me of ruining Thanksgiving for them, hurting their feelings and abandoning them when I coukd've stayed for at least an hour. I felt horrible. My family were divided on this but my parents think I was cruel to do this to the poor kids and not suck it up for few hours. I don't know I felt uncomfortable with the idea of celebrating Thanksgiving with people I dob't know and aren't family or friends.

We’ve had our ups and downs, but overall we got along, and I feel like he is my safe place, my best friend. 

   My husband made a new friend through work (not a coworker). Her name is Emily (24 F). I wasn’t really keen on the friendship at first because it was some woman I didn’t know, and she and my husband were messaging a lot. He was always very open about her, so there wasn’t anything sneaky going on. I tried to get over my feelings because I didn’t want to be sexist. I met her a few times and I didn’t get any vibes like I had anything to be worried about. 

   The problems began because I just felt like he was investing so much time and energy into this friendship. He would go out of his way to help her with stuff, listen to all of her problems, etc. I felt like so many of our conversations were about Emily. My husband hoped they we would become “couple friends” with Emily and her husband. After hanging out with them a few times, I said I wasn’t really interested in becoming close friends with them (they’re not bad people, just not people I envisioned being good friends with). I wasn’t trying to shut things down at that point, I was just telling him because he wanted to know. 

   For at least 8 months we spent time with Emily, with or without her husband. During this time I would deal with my husband getting mad at Emily (he got mad if he felt like things were “one way”), or sad at Emily (he would feel left out if she did some things without him). I would spend time with her (like he wanted), and he would act cold toward me because maybe that day she did something with me and hadn’t responded to one of his texts. Sometimes there were nice moments, but not enough for me to want this long term.

   Sometimes my husband and Emily would make plans to do something (for all of us) and then ask me, but I felt like saying no would make me the bad guy. It felt like we were doing stuff once a week. If there was something I had mentioned doing as a family (we have a teen daughter), sometimes he’d be like, “What if Emily came?” 

   It just got to points where I felt like his friendship with her mattered more than me. We’d talk/fight about it. He’d apologize, say that I was the most important person to him, and then eventually things would go back to being Emily-focused. 

   I finally said I wanted things to be low contact: I felt like my whole life revolved around this person. My husband agreed. Then things just got more tense and my husband said he’d do no contact. Since then (which he never committed to no contact, just less), he has tried to reverse things, just wanting his friend(s) back. He says he just doesn’t see himself making any other friends soon. I said he could, but I wanted no part in it (which he took as a general no). Now he tells me how sad he is, and he wishes he could have done things differently to remain friends with them.

My dad moved out 9 months or so ago but recently moved back in with my mom to try to make things work.  They both share much blame in the breakdown of their marriage.  I’ve been pretty sad about it for two years now, back when they initially told me they were divorcing.  I’ve told them I can’t take the ups and downs and would rather not know the details of what the latest asshole thing the other did was.

This Thanksgiving, within 5 minutes of me, my husband, and daughter walking in the door, my mom picked a fight with my dad over something stupid about the TV, stomping, rolling her eyes, yelling and blaming him for a problem with the cable box.  I asked my mom (not in front of my daughter or husband) to please give it a break at Thanksgiving, that it was uncomfortable for all of us.  She told me that I can’t handle “even an ounce of conflict” and that I was “micromanaging her words and behavior.” I told her that it made me sad every time they fight now because of how tenuous their relationship is and I didn’t want to deal with that on Thanksgiving.  She SCREAMED at me for being intolerant and ungrateful of her hosting the holiday, in front of my 8 year old daughter and stormed off upstairs for 30 minutes. She’s right that I can’t handle conflict well.  My husband and I are not yellers and our home is pretty peaceful.

He always was worried about if my mom and I liked his gfs, especially when I was younger. He had a hard breakup with a girl I absolutely loved like a sister, but less than a year later he was dating left and right. He ended up dating a chick that was 7yrs older with 3 kids (the youngest being 11). The first time I met them all was when I was visiting my brother and he asked how I felt but I didn't want to make him feel bad so all I said was that it was different. After about 2 months of them together, it felt like his relationship would seem to just be a heart and headache for him. She couldn't go to her apartment bcz she got in a fight with her neighbor over a parking spot, she couldn't cook for her own kids really, and her only income was doing food delivery. Those aren't issues I had, but she was already throwing responsibilities at my brother like he was the dad of their family by living at his house, him paying for their stuff, and her having a drinking problem. To say the least she did not make the greatest impression.
My mom and I were worried about him jumping too fast bcz he has never been alone. My mom and him did not discuss things well and stopped talking completely, to be fair my mom was a little over the top about it all bcz she's so protective. However, I was trying to mediate between the 2 by trying to explain what mom really means while also expressing that I had some concern about him. Btw the chick decently nice to us, she just seemed all too comfortable with piling up all her baggage on my brother. I was happy for him I just wanted him to take a breath and figure out if she's actually the one. Nonetheless, trying to keep the peace and talk with him about it all did not work and he decided to kill me off too. 
I tried to tell him that I was just being honest like he had asked before since I had gotten to be around them all more and so he did not like what I had to say. He automatically cut me off without even really listening to what I had to say.

so ive (23F) had two best friends (B and K) since high school. B and I went to the same uni and K stayed in our hometown. B and K have known each other since elementary school but weren't super close until we all became a trio in high school. i made a lot of friends at uni and really only spent a handful of times with B while at uni. i feel that over the years our trio has become less close but we do all hangout together maybe 2-3 times per year and text every other week about random stuff. B and K def hangout more than i do with either of them but this has never bothered me because i dont really get jealous about friendships since i have so many. anyways!

B has been with the same guy for six years and they just got engaged! she asked me and K to be co-maids of honor. we both said yes but tbh i was expecting B to just ask K because they are closer friends (not to mention K is def more excited to take on the role than i am). im honored to have been asked to be a co-maid of honor but ive been traveling a lot since we graduated uni and now i  temporarily live abroad, so ive missed the engagement party and will miss a few more wedding related things. i'll be back in the states for the tentative bachelorette party (in 6months) and wedding (in 8 months) but i'm really dreading planning a bridal shower and bachelorette party and speech at the wedding. 

i like my friend a lot but taking on these tasks seems like too much planning and $ spending than im willing to do (im getting paid shit abroad so i dont even think i can afford to go to the destination bachelorette party). i know events are months out but i really dont want to be a co-maid of honor anymore.

I’ve lived with cats for a few years now and tend to do pretty well with them even though I am not necessarily an animal person. And the last cat I lived with was amazing and I was depressed so it seemed like a temporary joy. And I was very clear that I did not want to adopt an animal long term. Well we brought the cat home and after living with them, I decided it wasn’t the right fit and that after this cat, I wouldn’t like to foster anymore. Now the cat was adopted by someone close to her and long story short, the cats been here for several months and she has to take care of him until the person can bring him home. She’s assumed full responsibility for the cat but is not consistent with care so I often pick up the slack, especially since I’m home more often.

The cat now has worms and can open our kitchen doors, and goes on the countertops, which I do not play with. My roommates never had an animal before and has expressed that she does not fully understand animals and would have never known about the worms had I not picked up on his behaviors and symptoms. Every time I bring up that it’s time for him to go, she says things along the lines of, “idk why it bothers you so much when he (the cat) does his own thing”. Which is not accurate at all as he is extremely clingy, anxiously attached, scared of everything, and a menace at best. 

I can’t stand this cat and I feel the cat senses it and I see myself getting more and more anxious/depressed/angry in my own home. I stay in my room most of the day so I don’t have to deal with him. The cat brings her joy but we never had a discussion about keeping the cat here long term. She just told me one day that he was adopted but wasn’t clear about what that meant for him staying at our house. I am extremely frustrated with my roommate, who is very passive and dodges any conversations I try to have. I feel like I’d have to tie her down to actually have a convo about finally getting rid of the cat.

This was around the time I broke up with my (22f) gf, Tilda, and now I’m starting to regret that.
She is much more mature than Becca. She’d never try to trap me like this.
You see, me and Becca had a disagreement. She didn’t want to keep seeing me, even though I told her I love her. She said she loved me too but she didn’t think it’s be ethical. I guess I got a little mad, and said some mean things. It’s not like they were anything majorly bad. We didn’t speak after that.
The past few weeks I’ve been trying to fix things with Tilda. Before all of this, I was going to propose. She broke up with me cause she thought I was cheating on her, even though I wasn’t. I would never do that. I’m a nice guy, not some villain.
I think Becca found out and became jealous. She just showed up on my doorstep someday. She asked to use my bathroom. I thought it was weird since she had been ghosting me. I let her in though.
She spent some time in my bathroom and I started to worry. I walked in and saw a pregnancy test and it was positive.
She told me she hadn’t been seeing anyone else. I told her I could drive her to the clinic.
She then tells me “no”. She’s decided to keep it. My baby. I can’t be a dad. I’m way too young. I haven’t even lived yet. She insists on keeping it and I just can’t believe it.

In that time we've been to two family weddings together, and a wedding of one of his college friends, who I'm not close to but am friendly with.

Now I've been invited to the wedding of one of my old friends. He invited our whole friend group from when we were teenagers (we're all now 28/29), which consisted of 10 people split across two neighbouring schools. I feel lucky to be invited, seeing as he and I were in different schools and so weren't as close as some of the others in the group, although we got on well when we all met up. The wedding will be in the country his fiancée is from, a couple of hours' flight away, and it'll be a lovely chance to get the whole group back together. We haven't had a complete reunion since school. I'm really excited!

The problem is, our group's plus-ones aren't invited. This makes sense to me; I imagine numbers are limited. And my boyfriend has only met the groom once, at a party five years ago where he also met some of the others. It's not like the situation with his friend who got married, where he's been in and out of our apartment over the years and knows me. But my BF is insisting it's very rude to only invite one half of a couple. He says if the roles were reversed, he would never go to a wedding if they didn't invite me too.

I am an Indian and was born and brought up in the southern parts of India. My boyfriend however hails from North India. We met online and had an instant connection. We spoke to each other for nearly 9 months before I flew out to meet him. I stayed with him for 4 days and had a great time. After this, we got talking and he told me that he cannot commit unless he lives with me given his experience with his ex. So I agreed, did everything possible, and moved in with him on April 16th, 2022. 

Once we started living together, he would pick a fight every time I spoke about our relationship taking any direction. He will be moving to Canada 12 days from now and had previously encouraged me to apply for Canada as well. He put the idea in my mind and I even fought with my family for this. To the extent that I am not in talking terms with my family anymore. 

I moved to another city last month and we agreed for long distance. I have been very fragile mentally and the fall out with my family has taken too much of a toll on me. Rather than being there for me, he took advantage of my vulnerability and got me to open up about a few things. He had assured me that this would no way affect our relationship and I trusted him. I opened up about discussing the relationship with his best friend and shared every detail. He went on to put us all on a conference call and ripped me open on the call. His friend had been constantly advising me to break up and this time he asked my BF to break up. My BF sided with him and told that he would listen to anything his friend said because his loyalty to his friend came above his loyalty to me. However, he continued to talk to me and has been constantly accusing me of things.

On top of everything that is going on he is crushing me about what I shared with him. And when I share how it is taking a toll on me, he calls it a ""threat"". He sends screenshots to friends and asks them to help me when he is the one pushing me. He calls this helping me when he takes zero accountability for his actions. He has put me in a position where I can no longer face my friends. He even suggested a fresh start yesterday, but only if I was to delete 6 months of our living together and 9 months of talking before that. He even went on to tell me that this fresh start wouldnt be a dating situation. It would be like the first time we spoke to each other.

The university has someone come once a week to clean our flat, but the cleaning person is not responsible for taking out recycling/garbage. The university gave us a chores rota, so that everyone according to their room number has two chores to do a week (I’m in Room 1 so I’m assigned to take out the trash on Thursdays and wipe counters on Sundays). I definitely haven’t been perfect with my chores but I always at least take the trash out before the cleaning person comes on Monday. The big issue is the recycling - Ella is meant to take it out on Thursdays, and Sally is meant to take it out on Sundays. Neither of them do!! So far, I have been taking it out anyway because it gets overflowing and I don’t want the cleaning person to have to deal with it. But I decided three weeks ago (after coming home from a weekend trip to a completely overflowing bin, which I did take out) that I will no longer be taking it out since it isn’t my job.

Since I stopped taking it out, the recycling has fully overflowed. Hannah got told off last week by the cleaning lady for how messy the kitchen was, and she sent a text to our flat group chat asking everyone to actually do the tasks they are assigned. This… hasn’t happened. The cleaning person is coming tomorrow and the recycling is stacked a foot above the bin and there are bottles on the floor around it. I get along well with my flatmates generally and I don’t want to be annoying but I also really don’t want the cleaning person to have to deal with our mess again. WIBTA if I texted Ella and Sally asking them to take the recycling out?

My main hesitation here is that the recycling is quite heavy, and you have to lift it up fairly high to put it in the big bin outside. I’m worried that Ella and Sally may not be dealing with it because they might not be able to, and I don’t want to look like an ass by asking them to do something if they can’t actually do it. (Neither of them are physically disabled as far as I know but they’ve both had some health issues that might make it harder to do heavy lifting). I also thought about taking the recycling out and then texting to say that I’ve taken it out this time but could they please do it next time?

For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.

However we've run up against a conflict.

She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.

Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.

However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her ""no"" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.

She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return.

Note that I am the type who would allow him to have frequent rides with his friends (without me) no questions asked, as I know for a fact that he rides safe and no other agenda in mind. 

After that weekend, he told me via phonecall (I was in my hometown) that J became his back ride as he was asked by his friends to let her ride with him as he is the only one  ""available"". J is a lady rider but she didn't bring her motorcycle and travelled to the event via plane. They were about 20 who joined that event and half of those didn't bring their partners. I asked why him out of all of them, plus the fact that J and him are not even that close to begin with. His excuse was his friends relied on him as he is the most skilled driver especially with a back ride. I truly understand this. But what I didn't understand is why he didn't ask me if it's okay with me to let another woman ride with him. He could easily dismiss his friends' appeal if he told them that I am not comfortable with it. I really feel miserable with the thought that 1) I really wanted to go but since I'm not available, he easily replaced me just like that; 2) he didn't make a stand for me in front of his friends coz he didn't bother asking me if I was okay if someone else will ride with him; 3) I feel disrespected by him and his friends for not considering my feelings and with the fact I'm pregnant; 4) I'm pretty confident that he only told me because there was a photo in fb of him and J in the motorcycle together, and he was afraid that I'll see it. 

We have talked about it and he seem to understand my point. But I believe he didn't realize the impact it did on me. I haven't had a good night sleep in the past month and have been crying frequently with the thought of it. Sometimes he will comfort me, and sometimes he will get annoyed if he catch me crying.

I have a hard time fully letting go of this issue and he seems done with it as if nothing happened.

I am in charge of a fair few residents. I’d like to think I’m a pretty good mentor, as have said several residents of mine. I just like teaching newer doctors and making sure that they’re settled and happy in a profession where unhappiness and death rates are very high. 

I make it a habit to try and teach and show doctors the ropes of hospital practice, and I try and do this from a point of the same level, rather than teaching of a high horse. I find it a lot better to teach from the perspective of a friend, it makes them more open to my feedback and also gives them higher morale. It also makes it easier for when my interns and lower level residents rise up and become closer to my level, because the dynamic doesn’t change much. 

However, recently there has been a new doctor who has joined us. She is semi-decent, a fair bit behind where I’d like her to be but bad, except for one thing, there is a distinct difference in how she treats white patients, and black patients, and other POC patients. 

With white patients she is proficient, effective in communication and has good bedside manner. With brown Indian patients she typically doesn’t listen to a word they say. There are a bunch of other things she does with POC patients which I hate, but the worst is black patients. 

I haven’t been watching her interact with many black patients, mainly because we live and practise in an area where there aren’t many black people, so not many black patients to see. 

However, a couple days ago I supervised with her on a black patient, and she was a nightmare. She almost intentionally made the procedure hurt for him, and snapped at him when he complained that it was hurting, she said “yes, it’s going to hurt, that’s what happens when you get XYZ injury”. 

I spoke to her about this, and she was very arrogant about the whole thing but eventually revealed that the reason she is acting like this is because she views black patients as criminals and delinquents (her words) and “their injuries are their own fault”, and she hates that they take time and care away from patients who aren’t injuring themselves committing crimes, and therefore deserve our help.

I immediately reported her for this, and have now iced her out of all my services, with several of my colleagues doing the same, she’s there, but she’s a ghost. HR is still processing the report I filed, but I am making sure she is not going to see any patient. 

She has now also filed an HR report saying I’m harassing her because she’s a woman and I’m sexist. 

The parts where I’m worried about being in the wrong are the fact that she said she felt safe in telling me about why she treated that patient the way she did, and it is ruining her career, therefore I shouldn’t be acting like I’m their friend instead of their boss. Since I used info I gained from what she thought was a talk between friends. Also since I used my position of power to get other senior doctors to ice her out as well.

We were always upfront that when we returned from travelling, we would be looking to move back out into our own place. 

My aunt thought it would be nice for grandma, who normally lives alone, to get a kitten to keep her company. The idea was that if grandma didn’t like having the kitten around, someone else in the family would take him.

When we moved in, it was obvious to us that grandma really didn’t love having the kitten around. She constantly kicks him out of the house because she doesn’t like how much hair he sheds. She gets mad at him for jumping on the couch / other furniture. But the real sign for us is that she would constantly TELL us that when we move out, she wants us to take that cat with us. 

For months and months, all we were told was “I don’t want this cat anymore, you need to take him with you when you leave”. When we were about to go travelling, she even tried to convince us that the cat should go stay with my partner’s dad while we were away. Every indication we were given by my grandma is that she does not want this cat. 

In the meantime my partner and I have absolutely bonded with him. He sleeps in our bed every night, he waits at the house gate for us to get home whenever we leave (because the second we leave the house, my grandma kicks him out) and he’s also bonded with our own cat (they LOVE each other which was surprising but amazing). 

Now we ended up being approved for our own place to move into, about 2 weeks ago. We checked with my grandma again to say we’re happy to take her cat. She again, agreed we should take him. Then as the date of our move got closer, she started to change her tune and all of a sudden was saying she might miss the cat. We had already taken out pet insurance for him, been approved to bring him by our landlord and have also been paying for all of his food/litter the entire time. 

Now, 4 days before our move, my grandma has definitively said we can’t take him anymore and she wants to keep him. This is completely contradicting everything she’s said to us so far. She also REALLY doesn’t take care of this cat - she feeds him her own table scraps, doesn’t worm/flea treat him and let’s him outdoors where he could very easily get hit by a car. She’s also a very old ethnic woman and I am SURE that if he needed vet treatment, she a) probably wouldn’t notice and b) definitely wouldn’t want to pay for it. 

I feel like my grandma doesn’t actually want the cat but has just gotten used to my partner and I being around and is being kinda spiteful because we’re leaving (even though I normally visit her about once a week anyway).

So currently my (35) husband is annoyed with me, and I just want to hear the thoughts of the internet for this situation. 

My husband (39m) recently instructed to get an endoscopy. Since his family has a history of bowel cancer the doctors also decided to do a colonoscopy at the same time. Colonoscopy preparation (for those unaware) involves fasting for the day before (no solid foods) and drinking 4 liters of laxatives and spending the evening on the toilet evacuating your bowels. The procedure does have some very low risk, and he will be sedated. 

However he scheduled the colonoscopy for the same weekend (this weekend) that my brother (his BIL) was visiting from out of town. We had also previously made plans with some of our friends to hang out at our house, in particular because my brother would be in town. 

My husband is currently annoyed with me because I did not cancel the plans with our friends. He did specifically tell me he didn't really want our friends in the house. My husband said he didn't mind my brother being here, but did want some privacy for the preparation. 

So our friends came over last night and husband stayed in the bathroom all evening. He did also throw some of the laxatives up and in general was not having a good time. 

He's also annoyed that we ordered take out from his favourite place (Indian) while he couldn't eat solid foods, and that I baked chocolate chip cookies yesterday, which apparently made the whole house smell like cookies.

He has severe ADHD which causes him to hyperfocus on things and his main problem is he’s unable to let go of how he feels and ends up spiralling and making it worse for himself.

We do not use her autism as an excuse for any misbehaviours. Sure, they can be a ""reason"" - but she still has to (and does) accept the consequences of what happens if she looses it basically. I don't really have a great example - but I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, Maddy and her cousin Sarah (12F) are pretty close. Sarah lives a few hours away, but the girls facetime and chat regularly.

Until Sarah turned up in a velvet green dress. Maddy cannot tolerate velvet at all. It makes her gag and vomit. Obviously something we're working on in therapy (it's a few textures that she has a reaction to), but because it wasn't something...common in our lives, we'd never mentioned it to Sarah or my brother (her dad). 

Sarah grabbed the dress out when she arrived and said ""Daddy and I picked this out especially, I can't wait to wear it"" as Maddy excused herself to go to her room. I very gently told Sarah that it was a lovely dress, and I'd definitely love to take her out to lunch in it next time she was here; but that she couldn't wear that dress because it would make Maddy super sick. I told her she could pick anything from Maddy's closet OR we could jump in the car now and I could buy her something else. Sarah pouted for a minute, but then said ""Let me look in Maddy's closet first and I'll see if she's okay"". Maddy called out from her room ""Don't bring the dress near me please!"" and they were fine. Sarah found something, it fit, and they were happy. 

I took photos and shared one on facebook where my brother went crazy telling me that I had no right to do that, that he spent lots of money on the dress and I was raising an entitled bitch who needed to get ""over"" her weirdness, and that he didn't even think she was autistic because ""she makes eye contact and talks to me just fine"".

But I did ask him how he liked his experiences on MDMA etc. He then proceeded to say that some people are able to handle the high and come down experience “like champs and not cry when they break a bowl”. I asked him what he meant by that and he then says that I am unable to take these drugs because I am neurotic. This seemed odd considering I’d told him before about people close to me suffering from addiction to pills and that’s another reason why I have an aversion to them. To me this is just a rational choice, but it seemed like he was trying to insinuate that I am mentally lacking because I am not interested in taking drugs?

I am an Indian and was born and brought up in the southern parts of India. My boyfriend however hails from North India. We met online and had an instant connection. We spoke to each other for nearly 9 months before I flew out to meet him. I stayed with him for 4 days and had a great time. After this, we got talking and he told me that he cannot commit unless he lives with me given his experience with his ex. So I agreed, did everything possible, and moved to Delhi on April 16th, 2022. 

We went on a trip to the Himalayas and spent a few days there. We encountered an American team that was making a documentary and there was this guy S who was quite polite and friendly. The day we left, S hugged me and I hugged him back. My boyfriend did not like this and wasn’t talking to me after we came back. He accused me of cheating on him while all I had done was a hug and that too in front of him. This fight went on for over 20 days and I was constantly apologizing and begging him to forgive me. I later promised that I would not talk to S again. 

3 months later, we again went to the Himalayas. Originally my boyfriend was against the idea of me tagging along but then I wanted to because it was our last week together (I was moving back to the South as he was leaving for Canada in a month). We were aware that we’d encounter S again and even spoke about it. I was always completely honest with my boyfriend and he had complete access to my phone and stuff. 

While in the Himalayas, I was sitting by a river one evening. My boyfriend had gone for a walk with his friends without telling me. S was also sitting on a rock and on seeing me, he came over to talk. He started sharing some personal stuff about what he was going through and I could not walk away. The human in me wouldn’t let me. 

When I saw my boyfriend that night, I told him that I spoke to S. He seemed okay at that time. However, after we got back home also he didn’t bring it up. We had discussions about continuing our relationship and taking it long distance and he was eager. However, after I moved out, he started bringing up my talking to S. He accused me of walking over his emotions while I told him the subject of the conversation. He went on and on until I finally admitted I was wrong and apologized. He used this admission to tell me that he cannot be with someone who chooses others over him. 

It wasn’t a choice that I made. I love him a lot and I’ve gone to great lengths for him. He told me that all his friends asked him to break up with me and that I was wrong.

My wife and I (both 30) live about an hour and a half from London and we both work near where we live so we don’t need to commute that distance. I work 9-5 Monday to Friday whereas my wife is currently on maternity leave after having our daughter in February. My work generally is flexible with putting in holiday requests as long as the weeks are free and if more than two people aren’t off at the same time. I got all the weeks I wanted but I was able to get this week off. I wanted this week off as my wife turned 30 on November 22nd (Tuesday just past). My wife was aware of this and was kinda sad I would be working during the week but I promised her a nice surprise on her birthday and at the weekend.

I arranged a dinner at a nice restaurant on the day of her birthday and invited our parents and some close friends. I left our baby with a trusted neighbour and I offered to pay for everyone’s meal. My wife seemed excited but when we got there, she had a face like a slapped arse. She was pissy our reservation was at 7 due to my work and everyone else’s schedules. She was pissy some people couldn’t make it. She was pissy that we didn’t get a better table. She was pissed off the flowers I ordered special for her didn’t arrive first thing in the morning and instead at midday. She was pissy the necklace I bought for her that she requested specifically wasn’t ‘shiny enough.’ All she did the whole night was complain and said that I didn’t do enough for her and it really brought me down.

I had a weekend booked in London for us which she knew about as did the people at the people as it was brought up and people asked if she was excited. She snorted and said that the weekend was going to be a letdown as it didn’t fall on her actual birthday. My in laws had agreed to watch the baby and the plan was to stay at a really nice hotel, do some shopping, see some sights and see a musical. My wife had a rough pregnancy so I deliberately saved up to be able to afford this dinner and the weekend and to give her some spending money to buy some clothes and stuff as she deserved it.

She was so unappreciative of everything I tried to do and bitched even after her birthday that I decided to cancel the whole weekend and spend rime with my kid instead. I was able to cancel the hotel and I had to sell the musical tickets at a discounted rate online. When I told her, she was furious and said she has been stressed and that she needed time away from the baby. I told her tough luck and that she humiliated me and made me out to be a horrible husband who didn’t care. She has spent the weekend at her parents by herself whereas I’ve been with my daughter and I took her to the park.

It was awkward at first but I got used to it. The condo provided a laundry room, a store for snacks, and internet, which works 24/7 except for half a day every month, for reasons I can't remember. I was also part of the group chat of the condo, for announcements and random conversations between residents. Here is where I introduce the resident, ""Ken"". 

He was my senior, 3rd or 4th year in college, but we barely know each other. Ken, roughly once or twice a day, for four days a week, would tell staff that the ""internet is down/slower than normal"", ""the internet service is appealing"", ""this needs to be fixed ASAP"", ""I paid full price for these services, the internet being this way is outrageous"" and other messages of the same tone. I knew this, because Ken kept on voicing his complaints on the condo chat, which was allowed, but he dominated the chat to the point where it felt like only he was messaging in it (which really did look like it, barely anyone else spoke save for him and the condo staff announcing stuff and apologizing to Ken).

For the 7 months I was there, I never noticed this issue. The internet works almost all the time, save for the few moments per week where it randomly stops before it works again, and these issues only lasts a few minutes, even seconds. I'm excluding the times where its off for half a day every month since staff would at least announce a few days ahead, probably for maintenance or something.

So to me, Ken saying that the internet being so fucky all the time was infuriating, to the point that I had to say, in the public chat, that Ken should stop treating this place like a hotel and privately message the staff instead. The response was as follows. 

Not only did Ken berate me for thinking that this was a minor issue, at least one other guy who barely shows up in chat said that I was being rude and inconsiderate. In response I apologized profusely for what I said, and that I wasn't thinking right (which was correct, I could've discussed this privately with him). Even the hotel told me in pm that his actions were within the rules. In the end I wasn't kicked out or bullied, but it felt a bit more awkward than usual. Ken continued to complained after this.

TL;DR: a resident kept on raising concerns with staff that internet connection was shit.

I work for a school and they hired a bus company to get my teens from their dorm to the school. Now because of the distance, I also take the bus with them. They don’t live too far from me so I used to hop on the city bus and meet them at their dorm. On a good day the trip is 10 minutes but with the winter weather and constant construction on that specific bus route it can go up to a half hour with wait times and delays and such. 

Now this first bus company that my workplace hired had mad decent drivers. I injured my back recently and I asked them one day if they’d be willing to drop me off closer to my home. I’d be saving time and bus fare money, plus it’s a four minute drive. I’ve even timed it because I wanted to make sure it wasn't taking too long and putting them out.

The bus driver was happy to drive that four minutes because my teens are late every day so he told me by picking me up he gets to knock a few minutes off the wait time. 

To save money my workplace changed bus companies. I asked my boss if they’d be willing to add the extra four minute route to the trip and they told me I’d have to ask the driver myself. I showed him the route and mentioned that he doesn’t have to go very far and I would be willing to be dropped off an intersection further away from the usual place to shorten his trip further. He said no. I asked why and he said there’s too much construction on that end. The construction hits when you get to my students’ dorm and he wouldn't be headed there until all of us were already on the bus. He also has no routes after dropping us off and only needs to drive the bus back to where he works.

He also mentioned how he hates driving downtown. I wouldn’t be upset if he wasn’t so slow. The other drivers from the previous company were safe but efficient. They had always checked for accidents and traffic before starting their route and always knew how to detour so we’d make good time. This driver somehow always manages to just make me miss my bus so it makes more sense for me to just walk the 25 mins. However, I have to cut through a very shady part of town to get to where I live and I’ve been stopped multiple times by men at night on my way back home, something that was previously not an issue.

Since it’s frigid where I live I don’t really feel comfortable waiting for the bus either and the bus stop isn’t in a well-lit area. We’re also close to a park known for being a homeless congregation where lots of people on all kinds of drugs wander around screaming. So I walk. 

I mentioned this to my workplace and they said they can’t bring this up to the driver for fear that they’d be charged extra for that four minutes. But they happily ask me to work overtime without compensating me.

I got married to my first love Mike 29 when I was 19. He had a son Christian 13. We were married for 5 years and our dynamic wasn't your typical family. We knew from the start Mike will never be my son or even stepson. We were more like siblings rather than parent and kid and we were fine with that. 

5 years later Mike got into an accident and died. It was around the same time  Christian was headed back to his home country for college. It was devestating I was alone and I felt like I lost my entire family. 

At first Christian and I had regular contact but in the last year we've only greeted each other during birthdays and holidays and it was mostly generic messages. I do still send him monthly screenshots to his emails regarding transfers to his portion of the business but other than that the last time we've actually talked was a year and a half ago and even then we talked about business.

Anyway two years later since Mike's passing I met Juan and we've been together for a year. We're getting married this December. Yesterday I received a phone call from Christian very upset that he hasn't received an invite. I mentioned to him the wedding was for close family and friends which made him angry. He went on a rant how I never treated him as family (not true) never treated him as a son(kind of true) and pushed him out of my life the day his dad died (not true) he then disconnected the call and blocked me....

I didn't think he would come. I thought we drifted apart. We're friends in Facebook and I'm active on it so he knows what's going on in my life not once did he ask about Juan. It's an intimate wedding of 50 guests like I mentioned close family and friends plus I don't know how Juan would feel as well. He knows about Christian but he was never really apart of our lives so I couldn't just give Christian an invite on the call....

Additional info. Christian's mom took of a week after he was born. Mike's an only son and his parents died a year before his own passing so technically I am sorta his only family.

My sister (23F) also studies at college but in a medical subject, and she is applying for uni as well.

I wrote my personal statement for my uni application back in March, just to be prepared. She has only now started and her deadline is this week.

She asked for tips which I was happy to help with but when I asked her to conduct a tiny bit of research in order to have more to write about, she said it was too hard and asked me to do it. I refused to do the research but ended up writing almost the entire statement anyway, because she struggles with grammar and sentence structure etc.

My parents reviewed both of our statements (both written by me) and said that her statement was better. This upset me a bit but I used it as motivation to write a new and improved version for myself.

The next incident was when my sister asked me to help her study for her math class, which I was glad to. The problem was that anytime I told her I had an hour to study with her, she said she was too tired or didn't want to right now.

It is now 2 days until her exam and she hasn't even covered 1/2 the material. I also have exams coming up and don't really have the time to baby her if she isn't committed. She said she only wanted to study for one hour but realistically it would have taken 3 hours at least. I told her that I refused to help her if she didn't want to commit and that she could work by herself since clearly she thinks she'll be able to finish the class in 2 days.

My parents got mad that I stopped tutoring her because now my dad has to help instead.

Am: where are you 
M: 2 streets down working on bikes 
Am: get home now 
M: no I'll be home in 30 min I told dad I have an hour 
Am: do you want me to call the police and say there's drugs and see whst kind of raid they do

We’ve been together for close to two years now, and he still lives at home with her and his little brother (15M). His parents are divorced, so his mom has been in the dating scene for about 9 years now. 

Yesterday, I arrived at their house and was met with bf and brother in the hallway. They were talking about how their mom was in the basement (a family room that we all hang out in), drunk with a guy who she’s known for two days. I won’t go into more detail about that part, but we knew they were hooking up in that room. My bf and his brother decide that they’d go knock on the door and bf says, “Hey mom, gf is here do you want to say hi?” All she says back is “excuse me?!” in a very annoyed tone.

Bf and brother decide after about ten minutes to keep knocking and insisting that their mom comes out. She get’s VERY irritated, which makes the boys angry as well. His brother said some really uncalled for things, which only made it worse. It got very heated very quickly and her “friend” ends up leaving after her apologizing for her sons’ rudeness. 

Keep in mind, I was in my bf’s room the whole time and not at all interjecting myself in the situation because it’s not my place. After the guy leaves and they all come upstairs and go in the living room, she immediately starts yelling at both of them. Then, she yells very loudly, “I don’t try to go in your room when you’re fucking your whore, do I?” Then follows with “I want your fucking whore out of my fucking house!” She knew I was still there. So, I grabbed my bag and slammed the door on the way out. My boyfriend was extremely upset with what she said, and texted me apologizing profusely. 

Today, I called him and we talked on the phone for about an hour and he kept apologizing for what she said about me knowing I was there and could hear her. I told him that I never want to see her again. A little later he texted me and said that his mom wants to call me and apologize, I said absolutely not. He said she really feels bad but I still said no. He was more than understanding about it and told me that I have every right not to forgive her, he’s just always been a peacemaker. 

So, AITA for not wanting to accept her apology, now or anytime in the future? I don’t know if I’m being too overdramatic about holding a grudge, or if i want to sever my relationship with her over one thing she said.

Story:
I have leased a spot at my neighbor stable since, starting 3 years ago.
After 6 months in the service that was included disappeared but I still paid the same price. 
From just taking care of my horse, I had to start taking care of for their 16 horses. I also trained their foals/youngsters. 

When I then brought up that all I’m doing was not something we primarily agreed on, they said that I was paying such a low price. They wanted some relief on the horse care and that this is now how it is.. We had nothing in writing, I asked for that when I started but she didn’t want to sign anything (first red flag).

Over the years I noticed they don’t follow our country’s laws of horse care and how to handle horses. They are horse breeder of Icelandic horses and draft horses. 

2.5 years ago they happened to cut off a cable in the stable which caused the lamp in the tack room to die. 
I have mentioned several times during these 2.5 years that I wish they would fix the lamp, as it is troublesome to always have to have a headlamp when I go in there to find my stuff or stumble in the dark😅

3 months ago, they said that my rent would be doubled, due to the fact that they have so many expenses. 
I then said that I might rather move my horse if they do that. 
They got scared of loosing me and all my help and we had a talk. The rent was raised but the cost was slightly reduced in return for me taking an extra feeding/pack day.

We were already looking for a new house so I decided to stay since I might move anyway in the short future. 

We also agreed for them to fix the lamp and that they would help me with cleaning out the big shelter a couple of times a week.

Now we have an written agreement on this, since I  asked, they were unhappy but obliged. 

After now 3 months and paying the increased price and doing my part and more, the lamp is still not fixed, I was the only one cleaning the stall etc. 

Since nothing is helping them to do their part of the agreement, I then asked nicely what I should deduct on the price until they fix the lamp. 

Their response = calling me and angrily tell me to move my horse in 1 month. Cause apparently now all I do is fight about the rent. 😅

In these 3 years I have never been late with a single payment, never missed a feeding day and did way more than I needed to. 
If I've gone away on vacation, I've fixed that someone else will take my shifts. 

why are horse people like this? 😅 my social anxiety is slowly eating at my brain, am I the asshole to ask for a small deduct on the price cause of the lamp?

What sort of irked me is that because of this ""A"" has been passive aggressive towards some people with children or expecting. My husband was already skeptic about us going but we haven't seen our family for quite some time so we both decided to give it a chance. So we went to dinner and chaos was already starting. She was having a major breakdown and everyone was trying to calm her down. I tried to calm her down and even now I don't think I used the right choice of words.""I hope you can get better and move on from this hardship."" She blew a whole gasket and started screaming. Saying I don't understand about wanting to be a parent and a disgrace, there was more but I will not say it. And then ended it by called me an ""it"". I am nonbinary and my pronouns go by they/them.She kept screaming about how God punish her for something she didn't do but I get to walk around all happy. My husband was about to throw hands, but I said I deserved it because I was being insensitive and should have known better, trying to de-escalate and left the car and started to cry. My husband first reassured when he came to the car. He was still pissed on what ""A"" did and he told I should have brought up about my miscarriage. (I lost them at a few weeks recently) I told him that majority of our family doesn't know about it and bringing it up now will seem like I'm trying to upstage or make her look like a bad person. We went home right after; it was about an hour after I got multiple phone calls from other members asking if I was alright and then one from A saying how could I do this to her and I ruin her life. I was utterly confused until she said that she was informed by someone that knew and now the whole family found out and pretty much shunned her. It got so bad that the people offering help backed out. She told me I should've corrected her and now I ruined everything. I tried so hard to explain that I didn't mean it but she just didn't listen and scream more obscenities. Now here's why I might be the asshole: I got so angry, I told her to shut the fuck up and that its not my fault she had fucked up body and is the reason her husband left her. I ended up going as far as I was even happy that he did because it just shows that not only she was a horrible wife and couldn't do one thing right, but she also couldn't even take the heat when she dug her own grave and what makes her think that was going to be a good mother. And she was only sorry because she couldn't get what she wanted and was a sorry excuse of a human being and relative. She went silent and I hung up right after not hearing from her since.

I (22F), a university student, live with my parents in the apartment they own. This is normal in my country. Since I was a child, I have had eczema, a skin condition which makes me scratch myself, breaking the skin and causing scarring. When I entered my 20s, my condition got rapidly worse and now I have really ugly marks all over my legs, torso and arms.

I am highly irresponsible in dealing with it. For the most part, I basically let my eczema be until it flares up and disturbs me enough for me to do something about it. This frustrates my parents. Firstly, I get blood over my bedsheets, which I share with my mother as we sleep in the same bed, and I'm not the person who does the laundry. Secondly, my mother worries about me getting a blood infection. Thirdly, they dislike how the scars look visually – which is what I hear about the most. They object whenever I want to wear anything that isn't long pants out, because they say that people will see my scars and be disgusted. My mother says that employers will think I have a contagious disease and not want to hire me. When I pass by them at home wearing shorts, I will sometimes get comments from them about how bad the scars are. 

I think their response thus far is reasonable. But because I seemed unmoved, my mother told me that I will never get a boyfriend if with skin like that, and that my ex-boyfriend's skin must have crawled when he touched me. One time she appended it to ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" which was the only time she ever took the initiative to acknowledge my bisexuality. She also used to have the habit of occasionally taking pictures of my legs and sending the pictures back to me, but she upped the ante when she laminated the picture of my scarred legs and put the picture on my desk. 

Anyway, even though I feel I'm rightly hurt by my mother's comments, I also feel like I'm not fully appreciating what she has done to help with my eczema. She has spent a lot of money on various creams and treatments. When I told her that I hate moisturiser because it's oily and gross, she bought me a quick-drying one which I do use sometimes. While I did not ask her to get any of them (besides steroid cream which I do use), I did acquiescence. I think I should do better, since she's trying to help. She has done other things that I can elaborate on in comments. 

I did try to negotiate with her regarding the situation. I told her that I understood that I should take better care of myself but that her comments hurt me, to which she replied by saying that I gave her no alternative since nothing worked on me. Then I got her to agree to stop the comments if I did what she wanted and religiously applied cream. This worked until I got lazy and stopped, at which point the comments slowly returned. I'm frustrated that she never seems to admit fault for anything, but I also think this is ESH and that I'm in the wrong too.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829516,public,top,self,AITA for not appreciating my mother's approach to dealing with my skin condition?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5x8gb/aita_for_not_appreciating_my_mothers_approach_to/,all_ads,6,

Some background first: 
Me (21f) and my boyfriend (23m) of 5 months are quite avid ravers. Our drug of choice tends to be ketamine. Ketamine in larger quantities has this weird thing where it sort of makes you dissociate. It makes it fun but also rather unpredictable.

The Story:
Last night we were at a rave and as usual we were taking ketamine. Well at some point during the night we met some girl (20sf) and we got on quite well with her. I’m not sure how it started (though I’m pretty sure she initiated it) but the 3 of us ended up grinding together. This slowly progressed and eventually we did a couple of 3 way kisses. I was definitely dissociating at this point and so was my boyfriend (I think). The 3 of us sort of act like a throuple for a little while but at some point I turn around and she is full on making out with my boyfriend. 

Something happens in my brain when I see this and I basically snap straight out of my dissociation and just start screaming at her to get off him, screaming at him for cheating on me etc. Me and my boyfriend are fully monogamous and nothing like this has ever happened. My boyfriend is still disassociating pretty hard and has no idea what is going on and is just repeats “what? what?” confused over and over again. The girl tells me to stop being weird and go calm down. I storm off to the bar to get some water to sober me out for a bit and spend the next 15 minutes basically watching her make out boyfriend and dance with him. 

After a while he obviously slips back into consciousness and starts looking for me. When I find him I tell him I want to go home. We go back to our hotel and pretty much pass out right away. I just woke up and he’s still asleep but I’m still so mad at him and feel cheated on.

They don't show up (or on time) don't do what they said they would because of the reasons listed above. I feel bad for reporting them,  but they were bad teammates and we have a responsibilitie towards the company we do this project for. Aita for reporting them when they are mentally struggling?

We are 4 people who go to uni (last year) to become art teachers. I'll divide in myself 1, chloe 2, Peter 3, Chanel 4.

The project is all about visiting and contributing a product to a place in or out of school that offers a learning art experience. 3 has had good experiences with an organisation near by who offer small 1,5 hour workshops to children and teens. We visited the place (which is also a animal petting zoo) with 1,3 and 4. 

We were all excited and the company was too. We made a plan together to organise 3 small workshops which include: action painting, making Christmas decorations with the kids and giving a graffiti workshop to the teens. Done deal. We just had to make them a poster and a news article to hand out to the parents, a small inventory of stuff they could buy and just a plan of action.  Who goes where and when etc.  

The second meeting it was just me and 3 together. The week after 2 just wasn't there mentally, didn't rlly respond and was busy with another project of hers. 4 was all over the place because she stopped taking her meds for her adhd. I have adhd too, but take my meds in order to get stuff done.

I made a task list on the board and let everyone vote for what they want to and can do.  They (2,4) took the inventory list and plan of action while me and 3 did the posters,  news articles and communication with the organisation.

Next meeting the inventory wasn't done,  
2 was nowhere to be found when we had an appointment. 

I texted her and she responded an hour later that she was asleep, had pain in her neck and we could do this without her.  

1 and 3 had to redo the inventory and skip the photo. Also apologise to the company for not having things done when asked. 

When I asked 2 about it the next day when she was at school.  She told us we can't rely on her guiding 1 event she is listed on (Christmas decorations) because she might not have the energy for it. 

I went to our teacher and asked if the assignment we chose was too much and he said no.  I told him my concerns about 2 and 4. That i understand their situation with energy and anxiety/adhd, but that it's impossible to work with in this setting of responsibilities of the events. He went to our mentor and we had a talk too.

Now 2 and 4 are mad at me for not understanding their situation and making them (maybe) fail this project.  I tried explaining but now they and a few other friends are telling me I'm a bad friend and selfish.

We had all come to an agreement to make a business witch I will call “bb” it has zero resemblance to our name btw. Background info we had two mandatory meetings to make sure that everyone was interested in the buisness as a commitment only one person who we had kicked out showed up. One of the other girls had messaged us to ask if we can add another day because she was busy both days so we made another day for her she didn’t show up to that meeting either ( we did have some small distractions but still discussed things) we had a time tree where everyone had filled out their work days and when they’re be busy we tried to accommodate them and make time as personal lives and mental health is important the group chat would have a constant activity from 5 people me and four other people who we had all grown close to. The others wouldn’t be active for weeks we would call and they would have the option to join if they were busy or not. No one ever joined but us five most of them work and have told us our hours. We had come to a collective decision to kick inactive people out because the business had not started with meetings and all. We had done that today and sent them a kind message stating why they were being kicked out ( we had voted for president and vice president fairly) and then had put them to the side and told them nicely while trying to keep our friendship. One of the girls was completely understanding about the situation until one of the other girls had replied with a rude and snarky response. Then she had started getting more argumentive and rude. One of the other girls was rightly upset and understanding and still was able to be nice about the situation she had then left our other group chat about a podcast which others are aloud to stay and go and still make profit as they please we are still discussing the whole time situation one of the girls had then said it was our fault for not making a mandatory meeting ( which we did and made accommodations for her) aswell as not telling her to join.

I currently live in a house with 5 others, making it 6 roommates total; at least this was the planned amount we had. 5 of us are pre-existing friends, and the last 1 is someone we found through a roommate service who we really like and get along with really well. One of the 5 roommates that we’re all friends with had a boyfriend during Spring semester who left her out of nowhere, and was abusive (verbally/emotionally NOT physically that I know of). He vanished for 3-4 months and we later learned after 2 days of leaving our friend he was already sleeping with other girls.   
Flash forward to August of this Fall (‘22), less than a week into moving into our new house, he immediately is staying over and trying to get back with her. Now, it’s almost December and he’s been here every single day and night. He hasn’t paid for rent, and he does not speak to any of us besides his girlfriend. He is 26, she is 21. He has dropped out of his classes for many years and has failed to continue them. His girlfriend, my roommate, dropped some of her classes because of him and how he holds her back. He keeps her in bed, gives her rides to work/campus, gaslights her, etc. 

Before Fall Break this year, we had a snowstorm and he kicked her out of his car 4 blocks away from our house and made her walk home - she was not in any snow clothes.   
Tonight, we were out at the bar having a good time having a drink and playing pool. My roommate asked her boyfriend to come in and hang out with us - he refused and threatened to leave saying “you want me to leave?” when she was saying no that wasn’t what she wanted at all. She left for maybe \~10 minutes before coming back and wiping tears explaining what had happened and how she said that her boyfriend was saying how her roommates (us) don’t like him/hate him. Which, admittedly, a portion of that is true. I don’t mind hanging out with him but after everything he’s done to my friend, his girlfriend, I do not feel comfortable with him being around my space and in the house, and the majority of the other roommates feel the same.   
We had a house meeting and addressed this and he said he could go to his parents place - but this was a lie. He has poor relationships with his parents and has been ignoring them for months despite their pleas - he even refused to go to their house for Thanksgiving.   
I’m tired of paying rent for a 26 year old. I’m tired of letting an emotional abuser live in my house. He has told his 21 year old girlfriend that he’s too uncomfortable to talk directly to us about things. I don’t understand how if he’s “too uncomfortable” to be around us, why is he STILL here after MONTHS. I’m over it.

My mom and cousin threw us a very nice shower. 

MIL lives about 15 minutes away, my mom lives maybe 25 or so give or take with traffic. 

MIL takes and does all of our laundry, offers to pay rent if bf even so much as says ""I'm waiting for my DD today,"" buys us any necessities for us our our cats, gives me (disabled and can't drive,) rides to work when I was working 2 jobs, never accepting gas money or once complaining, etc. 

My mom, she will sometimes take our laundry, grab us a few items if we need it, and gives us gas money or just an extra $25-$40 for whatever we may need since bf just started a second job after months of searching. 

We have 3 cats together. Bf has 2, and I have one whom I've had as an ESA given to me since I was about 16 or so. In our old apartment, last Xmas, MIL bought us 2 beanbags. A small one for me as it's perfect size, and a MASSIVE one. 

Well, bfs cats were accidentally locked in the wrong room and peed on the bag at least a few different times.


mom comes over to bring over everything from MILs in her car in ONE trip. My mom has a terrible track for time and getting distracted, but I don't ever hold it against her or make her feel guilty. 

So instead of my mom getting here at maybe 1 or so like originally, she arrives, finally, after going to get gas, going to MILs, having me order chinese she can pick up for us, and coming back to our house, she finally arrives just before 5pm. I told her about how ny heartburn kept me up all night long, and I didn't sleep till 6 an despite tums and my Bigelow tea. She scolded me, and admitted she didn't go to bed until 3. I got a good 4.5 hours instead of only 2.


Mom finally gets home, we eat our Chinese, listen to Christmas music just relaxing. All of a sudden she tells me she thinks she's going to spend the night if it's okay with us, because it's very dark out (it was,) amd she didn't get much sleep (also fair.) I was a tad annoyed, I don't  like things sprung on me, but told her I don't care at all. She's made herself right at home,
and is, as I type this, still working hard on the baby's room, which I appreciate. 

Now, MIL spent a LOT of money on bfs beanbag. When we moved into our new place, the bag did not hardly have a smell at all after me ferociously scrubbing it with baking soda. Our biggest concern was the ammonia in baby's room. Mom said she was going to bring a shampoo and carpet cleaner, and oxi clean. Well she didn't. 

She vacuumed at about 1:30 am, she tells us to toss the bean bag, I said numerous times that the smell is putrid, and she really should have brought the carpet cleaner or shampoo. 

I tell her how I'd rather try to save it, as it was an extremely expensive gift from MIL and not even a full year old. She says no, and says to put it outside. I recommend taking it to the dumpster 35 sec away.

Ok so. My dad is disabled, and he has the parking placard to prove it. He has a chronic illness, and on top of that, a broken ankle. He’s in a cast and on crutches atm. 

We decided to go out to dinner tonight, we got the handicapped parking, and I’m trying to help him inside. He was the passenger of the vehicle, but that is within use of the placard. He exited the vehicle and was going in with me. 

A lady then, from her car window (pulling in), asked us to move. I thought maybe I parked wonky (I’m still mastering this whole driving thing) or something. I offered to move a bit, and asked what she needed. She said she was a DoorDash deliverer, and she wanted the space because of her hip pain. 

She didn’t have any disabled plates or placard. It was also the only available spot in the lot, although there was a delivery driver spot that would open up soon. We considered moving, but decided to wait. She didn’t have the legal ability to use the spot. I kindly explained this to her, and we went our separate ways without any arguments. 

But anyways, now I feel guilty. AITA? 

Also, please direct any hate towards me, and not my dad. He’s the best dude there is, and probably would have made me move if it weren’t for the ankle.

He's a good boyfriend and if he goes somewhere he'll bring me little knick knacks that made him think of me or candy and stuff like that, which I really appreciate and love. And he is very thoughtful with gifts and in general. But like I said, he's cheap. If he buys me an expensive gift he has to make a remark about how much money he dropped which makes me feel bad and kind of like I am in debt to him. On one of our first dates, I paid for our slurpees which really really really bugged me. We had to get plan b once and he didn't split it with me. He once complained about having to buy his own dinner on his birthday with his ex but I had to buy my own birthday lunch bc he came late since he was studying and then later made a remark about how he was down $16 from that lunch. He will always share whatever food he has at his place but has only ever bought my food 1-2 times which was like chipotle and a sandwich which we ended up splitting bc he was hungry and didn't get one for himself. Oh, and he made me breakfast and dinner once which was very sweet. But I have bought his food wayyyyy more than that and I have made food for him wayyyy more than that. We have a sort of unspoken rule at this point where we just split everything and its helpful except when my mom offers to buy him food. My mom is so so generous and always tells me to take her money and buy food for us. I am really grateful that my mom does this but I wish she would stop bc it is never reciprocated. It seems like my family and myself have bought him so many meals but when I go to his place we always have to share a plate of food that he ends up eating most of. And it's not like my family has more money, in fact it's the opposite. Yesterday after buying dinner for us, I did a little experiment. We went to the grocery store bc I needed ketchup and left my wallet in the car on purpose. When we got in the store I was like ""oops! I forgot my wallet do u have any money on u?"" and he said yea but u can just pay with ur phone. That pissed me off so I pretended I didn't hear it and when we got to the register I asked again and he told me to just use my phone.

My parents were married and mom cheated or had an affair and my brother was the result. My dad didn't want to raise my brother or stay married to mom, which I get, but when my brother's bio father left the country to flee all child support stuff, my mom and her family decided my dad was a POS for not loving my brother for being my brother. Mom over the years has filled my brother with the idea my dad should be his dad too since we're related and she's always tried to encourage me to include him in my time with my dad, and has encouraged him to tell me how he feels left out.

It's always been awkward. My dad and I talk about it. He has spoken to mom, he has taken her to court over the issues and he has asked me if I want him to adopt my brother as his own. I always said he didn't have to. I just hate the pressure. 

My brother and I don't have a great relationship because of everything. I have included him a couple of times if my dad was offering to take me and friends someplace. But my brother tries to bond with my dad and then gets upset when my dad doesn't treat him the same as me. Last time he got mad because dad treated him the same as my friends and corrected him when he said they were family.

So my dad took me and some friends to a cool arcade in another city. I didn't invite my brother this time. I didn't even mention it. But I guess dad had to because he was taking me so far and my mom was pissed when I got to her house. My brother was upset and told me he's being left behind/left out. I told him it's not that but he needs to understand that he makes things awkward when he chases after my dad. He told me dad should be there for him too and he's just a kid without a dad and how can I not be mad at my dad for excluding him.

My mom and her family told me I should be ashamed of myself for excluding my brother. I argued back that it always ends badly when he's there and I'm done letting him think he can use that time to get close to dad because clearly dad doesn't want to raise him. I was called a shitty brother.

Last month i was already deep into my depression. i remember one day he called me and asked me if i had weed with me so that he could smoke with someone else. i understand that other people have lives on their own, but honestly speaking i would not ask my friend for weed and go smoke with someone else if i knew he’s having a rough time. i felt used. i confronted him about it and he said sorry, he said he cares deeply about me and all that but idk man, its hard to trust someone when they do something like this and when u have a history of getting fucked over. for me words dont mean dick if theres no action. but at the same time i know he has been busy with stuffs like college n such, on the other hand what hurt me the most is that he never makes time for me n i see him hanging out with other friends and i feel like during times like these i just get petty and act like a child for no reason. 

fast forward to yesterday, i woke up thinking about the whole situation and i felt betrayed man. and as silly as it sounds i had a mental breakdown about an ashtray that fell, i was already feeling like shit and the fallen ashtray was just the icing on the cake, i got real angry and suddenly broke down and cried. 
hours later he texted me and asked me if im alright, then i said im dissapointed in him for basically not being there for me. i just feel bad because he did explain that he’s busy with a lot of shit but at the same time going out with his other friends doesnt seem to be a problem and i feel like i ruined a perfectly good friendship because of my childish thinking.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4829498,public,top,self,AITA for telling a close friend how i feel right after he asks if im alright?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5ww2b/aita_for_telling_a_close_friend_how_i_feel_right/,all_ads,6,

I (23F) am in between places right now. they raised my rent, I got rear ended and had to buy a new car and I just did not want to sign a new lease because I’m job hunting for a new job currently so I might be moving soon. I found a room in a house to rent for just 2 months which I think was enough of a timeline for me to get settled. Long story short I couldn’t move in to the room for a week so my friend, N, (23 M) let me stay with him and his mom. (I don’t have any family who lives nearby and my relationship with them is complicated to say the least) N has a spare room and I was very upfront about it only being for a week and showed them the contract I already signed because I didn’t want to be a freeloader on my very generous friend. They had some family in town including N’s uncle. Everyone else left and just his uncle stayed for a couple more days. He was very kind and was playing games with us. About 2 days in he suggested a $5 pot, we each pick a game and whoever wins the most games get the pot. Backstory with me is I grew up playing a LOT of games. My mom and her sisters are KILLER at nertz (peanuts) , speed solitaire, spades, hearts you name it. My dad and his family would play clue master detective, blood rage, Cthulhu wars, risk, and more recently Twilight imperium. (Which if you know anything about those games they can be very long and intense) I’ve learned to keep up and am pretty good at all of them myself. And in addition to this we are all extremely competitive to a fault and is something I struggle with even in past relationships. But I agreed. N’s family plays board games too and I’ve played TI with him a couple times so I was excited about it. N’s uncle picked the 1st game, (I won) N’s mom picked the 2nd game and N picked the 3rd. I didn’t win those but I was picking the last game. I picked nertz. I knew I was really good and had a chance to win it all and they had played before so I thought it would be fine. It was a slaughter. I felt pretty good. We had one round left and I was about to win by a ton and then N’s uncle got up and got mad at how uneven it was and they picked board games that we were all new-ish at and that it was pointless and went to smoke. I felt really bad and suddenly felt like I has just cheated them out of this money when they had been so nice to let me in their home. N and his mom tried to brush it off and cheer me up and we still played the round. I held back a ton and was slower and delayed the game a couple more rounds while they each won one. Even going slower I still ended up winning. I felt so bad and didn’t even want the money and tried to give it to all 3 of them and they adamantly refused. N’s uncle didn’t really talk to me the rest of the night and I feel embarrassed.

These are her first cats she's ever had. I (X23) have had cats my entire life. I've mentioned to her that there are certain things she should do in order to make sure they are happy and healthy. 
The main thing is their litter boxes. When I moved in, I bought her two new litter boxes because the old ones had no cover so litter would track into the common space. I view her as a friend so I didn't mind. I also told her that the cats will be a lot happier if the boxes are cleaned more regularly.
The issue is that nothing changed. She never cleans the boxes...l say boxes, but last week she threw one of them out because ""it's really gross and [she] doesn't want to clean it"". (Obviously this irritated me because I spent my own money to buy that for them). So now these two cats share one litter box, which at this point hasn't been cleaned in over two weeks. There have been occasions that she has complained that the cats have pissed in her closet on her clothes.. mentioned it's probably because their litter was dirty. She said that was probably true, but she didn't make any changes.
In addition to this, she also doesn't want to put in any effort to change their feeding behaviors. One is incredibly underweight and one is incredibly overweight. I suggested feeding them separately on a schedule, and that l'd be willing to do it for one of the cats if she does it for the other. The cat I offered to do this for has developed an incredibly strong bond with me. 
Because I adore these animals and am legitimately concerned for their health, I encouraged her to schedule a vet visit. I even offered to pay the one cat's deposit because money was tight for her and I adore the one like crazy. She accepted, and the appointment was scheduled. When the day arrived, she called the vet and lied about having COVID so they'd hold the deposit because she had to work (She didn't request the day off). This happened probably 2.5-3 months ago and they still have not been to the vet. 
Also, she never plays with the cats, despite one of them being an incredibly high energy cat... They'd also probably never have their nails trimmed if it weren't for me because she doesn't know how to do it and has shown 0 interest in learning.
We have another roommate (M25) who has achnowledged that this isn't all in my head and that she really doesn't seem to care about them and that her love for them really only seems to be at her convenience... I should also mention the past month she hasn't been around at all because she's been spending all of her time with her new boyfriend.
WIBTAH if I confronted her about not taking good enough care of them? These cats aren't mine, but that's doesn't stop me from loving them to bits.

My Dad left my Mum when I was 9. It was traumatic and did mess me up so I know I don't always get things right. My Dad met his wife when I was 14. They married when I was 19 and went on to have two kids. The youngest one is 13 and a couple of months younger than my own son. I'm the oldest of the orginal four so he had six kids in total. 

Dad was attacked walking home a few years ago and suffered a brain injury. He was deemed fit and well enough to have his driving licence reinstated and his firearms returned. So 95% the full ticket. No huge personality change just traumatic.

Last year he went fishing on his own and had a heart attack on the beach. He passed away. We were all devestated.

Six months after my Dad passed away she started dating someone she met online. She didn't tell me but did tell her two children and her friends and family. She finally told me a couple of weeks before the first year anniversary of losing Dad. I kept my cool initially but in the end I completely lost it. The timing was awful.

I lost it because:

1) She wanted her two young children to meet the person she had started seeing within eight months of them losing their Dad. Our Dad. I get she may have wanted company and companionship but I don't understand why she would want to involve the kids so quickly. Not only that but bring them into their family home. The youngest one didn't want to meet him so why was that even considered? She's a 13 year old Daddy's girl.

2) From experience, trauma takes time to process. Eight months is not a lot of time. Not saying its impossible but am saying not likely. 

3) She didn't tell me.

4) This is the big one - she started slagging my Dad off to her friends, family AND her own children. 

She made out like she had to walk on eggshells around my Dad and wasn't allowed to go out. She runs her own business and was always out with friends. Her version of truth didnt match with my experience of reality or the check ins, tags and pics on social media. She tried to feed me the narrative she had created but I called bullshit. She didn't like it. 

I suspect painting my Dad in such a bad light made it easier for her to move on so quickly. She cares A LOT about what other people think. She told her eldest child about the arguments they had and the ""bad"" things my Dad. My Dad isnt here to defend himself and slagging him off to his own children is like taking a giant toxic shit on his memory and for what gain? The kids still love him unconditionally and it changes nothing. They are kids not therapists. She said she was just being ""honest"" with them. I said she was selfish a and was trying to make herself feel less of a Cunt at the cost of their memory of Dad. Again, didn't go down well.

I have had anger issues in the past and I've worked hard to resolve them. I'm disappointed in myself for holding it together for so long and then basically going nuclear.
