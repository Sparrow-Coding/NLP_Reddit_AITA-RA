Then it went on for so long something inside me just snaps so I went out and look at them and told them to stop it or I'll call the police, my stepfather and some of my neighbors also shouted at them and told them that they will call a police. They eventually stopped but I know they'll be back and do it again. I told the other kids to not even try using it because it's actually illegal and their parents might get charged for it.

During the pandemic, her debt accumulated and she borrowed money from a loan shark. Since she didn't have the money to pay the monthly bill, the interest grew 10x the original amount. I lend her $10,000 to pay off her debt. A year later, she had another debt to pay and I lend her another $10,000. I told her she can pay within 3 years so it won't be too hard for her.

There was no effort from her to pay off her debt. She always makes excuses for not paying.  Later I found out that she cheated on her husband and left her kids to be with her lover. Her dad, who is already retired, is now the one paying off all of her debts.

Her husband filed a criminal case against her for adultery. I gave all the support (money) her husband needs so he can divorce her and he can take care of the kids. I have no ulterior motive. I just want her to experience the consequences of her actions.

My mom texted me late last night and said to me, 

""Please make family dinner on Sunday. I will be decorating.""

I replied, ""I will not be making dinner. You guys never eat it. But I can pick something up. What would (sister) like for dinner?""

After Thanksgiving this year, I decided I would no longer cook for my family. My mom has a lot of food allergies, including celiac disease, and both my sisters are gluten intolerant. On top of that, my dad has been doing the keto diet and has been seeing great success in losing weight. I'm happy for him! However, any time I cook a meal, I try to make it nutritionally dense so it is filling and tastes good. I use high fiber, high protein ingredients a lot like cauliflower, black beans, quinoa, and brown rice. You get the picture. 

They are all picky Eaters.

I made taco soup last week and told my other sibling, who was babysitting for us, that she is welcome to have some, and it's gluten-free. She turned her nose up at it and instead ate the last of the gluten-free corn dogs I had in my fridge (specifically for them).

On Thanksgiving, my dad asked me to make 2 trays of green bean casserole, corn bread, and 3 pies for our big family get-together. They went relatively untouched, and we had to eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for days because I made more than we really needed at my dad's behest. 

Because of this, and many other events where they refuse to eat my cooking, I'm not going to do it. I have wasted time, money, and energy. I feel rejected every time they turn up their noses at the food I spend time making for them. Even when it's something I know they will eat. My sister (the birthday girl) really loves Chipotle. I made homemade burrito bowls with pinto beans and white rice and marinated chicken sometime ago. She said she wasn't hungry and then went out and bought Chipotle that same night, despite my effort.

# AITAA for taking my niece to court over a coat?

📷

I(28F) have a niece (16F). She is my only sister's only child.

2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.

My MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).

I didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.

Last week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.

While I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said ""I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts"". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).

The next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money).

We did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.

People in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.

So AITA?

I (25f) and my fiancé (27m) are due to get married in about 4 months. We have a 6 month old boy together and we’re happy with life. 

My wedding dress I had custom made and sent to my sister’s house so my fiancé couldn’t see it. It arrived at the end of October. She suggested having a tea party, inviting our mother, step mother, our auntie and my mother in law so I could try it on and have a little tea party. This has been planned out since the dress arrived. My fiancé was going to take care of our son for that day so I didn’t have to worry about him or his needs and just have a nice day.

Come 2 weeks ago where my fiancés friends invite him out for drinks. The date for it is literally the day before the tea party and they’re going to do a pub crawl from 2pm onwards. My fiancé has a very low alcohol tolerance and I’ve pleaded with him to not go overboard so he could still take care of our son on Sunday. 

His response now is ‘we’ll see’ and ‘well there’s no harm in having him there’ followed by ‘I don’t get to see my friends much I shouldn’t have to monitor what I’m doing’

I’m extremely annoyed to say the least as I wanted 1 day where I didn’t have to worry about our son and I don’t want him left with a father that’s in no fit state to take care of him or play with him. 

I’m being told I’m being unreasonable from my friend and I should just take our son with me.

One of the people we do know, and who was instrumental in me getting hired at my new job is an old college friend of mine(who my wife had never met before moving here). 


My wife has decided to change career and try her hand at real estate. My friend had mentioned in past conversations that he and his family wanted a bigger place but the market was too high at the moment and they want a particular house in a particular suburb, so they are fine staying put for the moment. 


My wife, having worked at a firm for all of 2 days asks me to ask him if she could make enquiries for them and basically be their realtor. She repeatedly said to me, no pressure if you feel weird about asking(I did) and it’s fine if they say no etc etc 


I don’t really like mixing friends with business, but I asked him anyway and he basically said he already has a realtor that he’s used in the past and that through this realtor he has first dibs on the next property in this suburb that comes up(he says they are super rare).


When I told my wife this, she later started saying pretty unkind things like “well my boss told me not to waste my time on idiots who are just time wasting and don’t really want to sell anyway”.
However she also took aim at me saying that I should be more supportive of her new career and try to help convince my friend to let her sell his house. 


I got the feeling he was being polite to me when he said no the first time, and he is actually not wanting someone with 3 days experience selling his $1.1 million dollar home, and as he’s one of the only people I know in this city(plus a colleague), I don’t feel it’s a good idea to put any more pressure on this. 


For this reason my wife says I’m not being supportive and therefore an asshole.

I and my fiance moved back in with my parents about 7 months ago , the previous arrangement we had fell apart and we needed somewhere to go *important note* they offered to let us stay with them if I helped my dad finish the basement,  the deal was struck and as soon as the basement was finished,  we moved in. 
Now secondary note* at the time of moving in my fiance was pregnant,  so maybe my parents felt obligated to offer * 
Everything went fine for a while , my daughter was born in July and everything was great. 

Now after about 4 months of living with them I cannot stand how they(my parents ) treat me and my fiance.  They act like we are teenagers and like we don't know how anything works or that we can't pick up our messes without having been told. My mother is especially notorious for being picky about how things are cleaned down to how the dishes are loaded(okay fine , it's her kitchen but still.)

The most recent issue and why I've come here is about two weeks ago my father and I got into a heated argument about how my business isn't worth anything and that it's just a paid hobby , now my relationship with my parents has been iffy at best and before you say ""at least you have parents that help you with a place to stay "" don't jump to conclusions because this ""help"" has come with strings attached. 

The biggest issue is that they refuse to help watch the little one , while simultaneously they will drop whatever they are doing to go help my younger sister , who lives an hour away with her kids , with no explanation or reasoning other than ""she needed help"" to clarify no , I am not mad or upset with my sister.  
They also expect us to cook and clean , now yes we live here and are apart of the household but how can we do that with no help babysitting?  

My worry is that the way that are treating me and my partner is that it is driving a wedge between us (parents and I) that will result in a massive shit show fight that will end in cutting contact and moving out. Now we plan to move sometime in the next 6-8 months but my question is . Do I bluntly tell them that their actions aren't helpful nor are they helping us get our shit together,  or do I ignore it and go slowly insane right up until we move ?

So, Freshman year of high school (I’m on my second year of college now), I was bullied very severely by a group of girls in one of my classes and some of the things they’ve said/done I have yet to fully recover from. They humiliated me several times in front of the class, stole and subsequently damaged a sentimental necklace from my passed grandmother, followed me to school events I participated in (dance recitals, plays, etc.) to mock me, and all around, made my life a living hell. I still struggle with anxiety and depression to this day and had to go to residential treatment to recover from the trauma because at height of my depression, I didn’t sleep, eat, or bathe. I had once been a very bright student, but of course, my grades suffered as well.

The bullying itself was pretty mild (aside from damaging my personal property), but full disclaimer, I am on the autism spectrum, so I am prone to take things very seriously and this instance was one such thing. I had always felt isolated/left out of things and this wasn’t my first brush with a close-minded bully, but this was certainly the most intense bout.

Before I went into residential therapy, I deleted all my social media and only recently started them back up again with virtually no one from my high school in my follows. I don’t know how, but the ringleader bully (and the cruelest) found me.

She said that she had been trying to reach out for years, but because I blocked her on everything, she couldn’t find me. She apologized for her cruelty and said she thought about how she hurt me everyday.

I told her to fuck off, but in a fairly intense way. I wrote her a lengthy paragraph telling her where to stick her apology and at one point said something along the lines of “every time you feel any iota of joy, I hope you see my face and remember that you don’t deserve it.” I told her I wouldn’t be one her checkpoints on whatever “self discovery” journey she was likely on and whatever redemption she was seeking for past wrongs, she wouldn’t get from me. 

She didn’t respond lol.

My dear, fellow butthole enthusiasts, I need your cherished, butthole wisdom.

A friend and I, both 30s F. Let’s call her Sandy. We’ve known each other for about 4-5 yrs. For 80% of our friendship, we mutually supported each other. I really valued her as a close friend because we could be honest with each other on hard topics.

It was mostly a good friendship. The thing about Sandy, though, is that if you go “hey, Sandy? That thing you did, it was maybe a little mean” Sandy’d go “oh, I’m sorry” and barely talk for 1-3 days.

It doesn’t matter how small or big it is, if she thinks you're mad at her, she has the same level of reaction. A year ago I also found out she specifically, very specifically, cannot handle conflict between two people she cares deeply about. Sandy 100% shuts down and lashes out at everyone.

Well, the way she acted made other friends not wanna approach her with issues, so I offered to do it since it was stuff impacting all of us. But I’d wait, to upset her as little as possible. Over this past year, shit got tense between us and I ended up snapping at her over nothing.

I knew I was wrong and I apologized, and we finally had a big talk. I realized I’d turned into the aggressor by being the only one to approach her and also always made it a big deal, and she realized that she was being emotionally manipulative by having the same reaction every time and forcing me to wait until it was A Big Deal. I admitted that it hurt when she’d stop speaking to me. We apologized, agreed to work on approaching stuff in the moment, rather than bottling it and letting it grow, and I'd let others approach her if they had issues.

I was like, so happy. Look at adults being adults! And then! She stopped talking to me!

Like, we’d speak in group convos, but in DMs? Stonewalled. After 2 weeks, I stopped reaching out. I could’ve asked what was up, but I’d said I wouldn’t be “the aggressor” anymore, so I didn't.

Months, guys. It’s been months. 3 nights ago she initiated a private convo but stonewalled me again. I finally broke, apologized for whatever I've done to hurt her, and asked if she didn't want to speak privately with me anymore or what. She said she did, but she wanted to have another big talk with me, but hadn't asked for one since she didn't want to add to my list of stresses. She never, ever told me this, nor did she check in with me. I was fuming. She asked if I wanted to have The Talk then and I said no and that the problem wasn't that we hadn't had The Talk yet, it was that she never told me she wanted to have one. I've had nothing but silence to interpret and I've already mourned our lost friendship, and said I needed space.

I’ve realized our friendship became VERY one-sided in the past year, and I'm tired of trying to be open and honest with someone who pulls this shit. I'm content with only socializing with her in group settings.

I (19F), my cousin A (17F) and my other cousin But (20F) *A is the one mentioned in the title) 

So one day I was at B's house. We were talking about everything and anything from her school to my school to lessons to our fav movies (we wanted to watch one together) and etc until we got to the topic of beauty. She told me about how she feels insecure about herself and how she has a low self-esteem because my cousin A once told her in an argument how B's nose was big and that if she ever got a nose like her she wouldn't dare go out. That her nose is as big as her (A's) body and stuff. She also didn't end it there and continued to belittle her about how poor her dad must be since she quitted learning English and didn't continue anymore (the economy in my country is terrible, I live in *Iran* after all. And they are a family of 5 members so ofc they wouldn't be living a luxurious life but her dad tries the best to support the family). Given how much of a spoiled brat A was in the past, I knew she was telling the truth. Also she isn't the type to exaggerate or lie to try to make others look horrible. Then B went on about telling me how A had talked behind her (mother's side) cousins' backs such as telling one cousin that her other cousin has multiple boyfriends and how she is a.. Bi*ch while that wasn't true and.. You can guess what the rest are. So given these information, I decided I'm going to cut contact with A even tho she didn't do anything bad to me or didn't have any arguments with me. So weeks pass and there's a family gathering where me, my cousin B and her mom and my dad and granny and my other 2 aunts are present. My aunts were talking about how rude A's mom is that she didn't hell with my grandpa's funeral and then B mentions how her daughter (A) is rude as well and told them about everything she told me when I was at their home. My dad hears this as well and given how he knows my behavior, after the gathering ended he pulls me aside and tells me not to cut contact with my cousin A because it's none of my business and that she didn't do any bad to me.

I am also a major clean freak and sometimes will refuse to even touch something if i know somebody else has touched it before me. 
My family is the opposite. Touchy feely. Super social. You get it. And they make this apparent every time they visit.
For example, an aunt of mine said ""give me a kiss!"" when she was visiting just a few weeks ago. I said ""Please, no."" She said ""Okay, then I'll come and give you a kiss."" She climbed on my bed (i was laying down) and gave me a kiss. I did not say anything but felt a little irked.
Then the following week my cousin (f16) showed up and insisted i go on a short car drive with her and my uncle since she had just gotten her license. I politely declined- it was well past midnight and i wanted to sleep. She proceeded to bring every other family member who was visiting (about 10) into my bedroom to climb onto my bed and shout at me to go. I kept saying ""Leave me alone, get away, stop it,"" but they didnt until an uncle showed up and said it was time to go. I was so overwhelmed by that time that I cried for two hours and sanitized my whole bed over and over.

Days later two other relatives (18 and 17 each) show up. They wanted to bring me to a family gathering. Now my mom had mentioned this gathering the night before and asked whether I would like to go or stay at home with my grandma. I said stay at home with grandma, and i thought that was the end of that. 
But no. I was being dragged out of my bed at 5 am, not showered or dressed or anything, by relatives I barely know. I cried and shouted. They scratched and spat at me. They took my things and played with them even when I tried to take them back. They laughed at me. They grabbed me roughly. They took my blanket and threw it. And when they left they said ""You think you win, but we dont like you anymore.""
Hours later when my mom returned and saw me crying and rocking myself she said they just wanted me to go because they loved me. I think maybe she is right but that didn't make me less sad and scared. And I am very upset with them.

We met at a workplace and became close friends. A year later, she found a new workplace buddy and started gravitating to the other group a lot more. She would ignore me to go out with this group. I got annoyed with her and we fought about it. Things settled and I got over my resentment of her. 
Some years later, we quit the workplace and I went through a horrible time. I was breaking up with my boyfriend of the time and would reach out to her when I was upset. We no longer worked together. So when the replies were few and scarce, I was hurt but I assumed that she needed space. She started contacting me again when she fell out with our previous group. I let her back in because I missed my bestie. The only time she apologises for what she did is when we're out drinking and I end up consoling her. I have never told her how I feel about it. 
The situation now is somewhat similar. We're at a new workplace together but in different buildings. We formed a new friend group. However, all of them simultaneously forgot to call me out for lunch one day and it affected my mental health badly. I stepped away for some space. Even before this, I would text and call and get minimal responses from her. She talks to everyone else in the group because they work in the same space (her words) but has been ignoring me. 
I feel like an asshole because I got angry and went after her for leaving me out and barely apologising for it. I sent her a long paragraph stating why I was upset and her reply was one line. When I ranted some more, she accused me of leaving her alone when she was going through a hard time with our old group. She said that she is having a hard time mentally and I was attacking her.

Kicked out and disowned by family (due to being gay and non-binary), my sibling Alex (26 Enby) and their partner Neo (27m) took me in without a second of hesitation. They made a 12+ hour drive to get me out of a terrible and abusive situation- all thanks to my brother in law.

They gave me a place to stay, despite not being able to afford me and even helped me get most of my things back from family. Both of them, especially Neo have been the best siblings I could ever hope for. That's not the problem.

To me, the word 'love' carries so much weight. I can easily say that I care a great deal for Neo, and I am more than thankful for how kind he has been. The issue is that I don't feel comfortable or safe around him- and it's not due to anything he did! He respects my boundaries and even gave me a space of my own despite living in a one bedroom.

I don't know why I'm so skittish around him, but I can tell he's noticed. He tends to try to leave me and my sibling alone as often as possible, and he keeps to himself. While this would be okay if I thought it was both of us that were uncomfortable, almost any time I try to start a conversation he seems excited and talks to me until it inevitably peters out because I got awkward and uncomfortable.

On the one hand, I think that I have a right to be skittish around new people since I've been through everything. I follow the house rules, I'm never rude, and any time I'm asked to do something I do it without complaint or hesitation.

On the other, I think I might be the asshole because my brother in law did nothing wrong and has been so generous and kind, and I can't even say the words that I say to my sibling every time I leave the room. I say those words so loosely around people I'm comfortable with, and he can tell that I'm not comfortable with him. I know it hurts his feelings.

We've been together for almost three years. The first two years we were together in LA. She moved into my apartment after her mom kicked her out of the family home at 18 for some crazy stuff, long story short she is not a great parent. A year ago, her bother (who is mildly on the autism spectrum) also needed to leave the family home, so she moved out and into another apartment to take care of him. At this point I decided to move back to my family's home in Atlanta, because I couldn't afford to pay for two apartments in LA. They are not financially well off an needed me.

Since I've been gone, we've been planning on her coming to live here after she finishes her associates degree. She wants to start a baking business and this house has a great kitchen she can use, as well as my complete financial and emotional support. She is however terrified of leaving her home town, friends, and family.

Unfortunately, her brother has been having difficulty finding anyplace else to stay, and she feels like leaving to live with me will be abandoning him. I've offered to keep paying his rent there, or find him an apartment in ATL so they can be close. He has a part time job and a high school diploma, so he's not completely helpless on his own. Also it should be noted that he and the rest of her family don't want anything to do with me at all because of our 9 year age gap.

Yesterday she called everything off and is now mad at me for trying to convince her otherwise. I honestly believe that coming here would be extremely beneficial to her life. Her family is a mess despite how much she loves them, and they have nothing to spare to help her. I have no idea how she's going to afford her apartment without me. I love her very much, and I'm worried for her and her brother.

Been friends with another mum whose a few years younger than me for 4 years, met on the school run. DC are in the same class. 

I've done a lot for this friend over the years, given her money, paid for nappies for her dc when she's asked me to pick them up from the shops and she never paid me back, given her all sorts to help her and she's never returned the favour, I even leant her something then a week later she sold and kept the money for claiming she didn't know it was mine! She's stopped talking to me before for months and then randomly decided to start talking to me blaming me for it saying she wasn't sure if I wanted anything to do with her even though I messaged her twice asking if she wanted to meet up! Done birthday drinks at mine for her and baked her a cake on my birthday she didn't even say so much as a happy birthday yet messaged me throughout the day with her drama. She’s smoked loads of my weed and never so much as gave me a joint back. (This is when I clicked on her using behaviour and stopped inviting her to mine but I was still friendly when I saw her.) 

Anyway I tried to keep the peace as our dc are friends and she works at dc school so thought it'd be awkward if I told her truthfully how I felt that I felt let down and hurt by her using me. 

Today I've woken up to a message asking why I've made a new Facebook account and not added her and then she's deleted me off another platform. 
I don't use my personal Facebook it's been deactivated purely for the drama it brings and my second Facebook account is purely for entering competitions and certain groups I have nobody I know on it, the only way you can tell it's me is the fact I have my real name on the account as I'm entering competitions and can’t use a fake name. It’s very obvious when you look at the profile it’s a dud account though. 🙉

Now this has really pissed me off, not only do I feel like she's stalking me a bit online but why delete me after everything I've done for her! Am I being the asd hole to completely ignore her from now on even when I see her out and about? It was only yesterday morning I saw her and stopped and spoke to her and she was fine with me. 
I hate socialising, I keep myself to myself i have autism and it’s something that does not come easy to me I only really have two other friends one is my partners friend (who hates this lady and says she’s no good for me and has offered to introduce me to other people but I find it a bit overwhelming) and another friend who doesn’t live local so I rarely see her. So to loose this friendship has really upset me, especially when I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong.

The grocery store was open (and would be for the next few hours) and multiple male employees were walking in and out of the store periodically to collect carts/trash etc. He didn't appear immediately in danger (not bleeding, no physical injury). I'm not doubting that something was wrong, just providing more info as to what I saw for this post.

I told the man that I'm sorry but that they could call him an ambulance in the store if he needed it.

I (f24) have been best friends with ‘Andrew’ (m24) since kindergarten. Its always been me and him against the world, we’ve had other friends throughout our lives and been part of different circles but we’ve always been each other’s number one. 

Things got tricky when we joined the dating pool, some of my boyfriends would often times get jealous of the bond we shared. Obviously to us, it was always purely platonic but in our small town, a male and female friendship as close as ours was unconventional.

Andrew started dating Jess in April 2019 and they are due to get married in January. I am extremely happy for them and I’m looking forward to having little babies to spoil. However, I recently found out through a mutual friend that Jess does not like me. Jess was telling my friend that she has always felt insecure about me and Andrew’s friendship and thinks I have feelings for him. It was my first time hearing about this, she has always been nice and sweet when we’ve met up so this came out of the blue for me. Our mutual friend advised me to not attend the wedding as to not ruin Jess’ special day.

So my wife’s brother is getting married the day before New Years Eve in Reynosa. 

My wife’s family is from Mexico and BIL fiancé is from Mexico. So they are perfectly comfortable with the area and traveling around it. I am not. 

Maybe if we didn’t have kids and it weren’t so close to holiday season madness I’d be a little more adventurous. I’ve read travel advisories from various different countries and they all basically say the same thing; DO NOT TRAVEL HERE. 

Now my wife is upset because I had already been annoyed that the wedding was in the middle of the holiday season so driving through the border would be a nightmare and I’d have to figure out a way to work remotely from Mexico. So she thinks I’m using the safety concern as an excuse. But after reading everything, I just don’t feel comfortable taking the kids or ourselves down there. 

Her argument is that everywhere is unsafe.

We don’t share a ton of personal information, but I’m a pretty relaxed boss and our team is like a family so occasionally I’ll hear the “my weekend was so fun” or “My thanksgiving was weird because” type stories. 

I’ve recently noticed my employee seems to be on the phone a lot with her boyfriend while she’s working (or texting him a lot). She does a good job though and it hasn’t seemed to interfere with anything so I’ve let it be. The other day before we left for thanksgiving break, I wasn’t supposed to be at work but I stopped by anyways. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and I guess he heard me in the background talking. I could only her her side of the conversation but it seemed like he was questioning her and she was answering “yeah that’s (my name)” “yeah she was going to be off but her plans changed.” “Idk why” and finally she was like hey I have to go I’ll call you when I head home. 
It seemed kinda weird and I was made a joke like “is it okay with him here? He’s right I should go home!” she laughed and was like “he’s just nosy and curious” and I put it out of my mind after that. 

Until today, she was in my office with him on speaker phone trying to print something before leaving for a dentist appointment. He was asking a million questions about “what times your appointment? Did they send you a confirmation? Why didn’t they send you an appt confirmation? Why’d they send it to your mom and not you?” And she was just explaining that her mom made the appt for her and her mom told her when and where. 
And then he said something that stopped me cold - “well if you don’t have a text or email confirmation from the dentist, how do I know thats true?” 

I could feel her embarrassment and she just responded that she’d send him a picture of her at the dentist.

I can’t stop thinking about it now… when I was 18 I had a boyfriend who was very very jealous and would do the same thing, making me prove myself constantly and I’d appease him until it finally escalated into violence. When he said that it was like a huge red flag hitting me in the face, and I can’t stop thinking that maybe if all those years ago I had had someone I could talk to, maybe things would have been different. 

SO, WIBTA if I say something to her about it?

**About her (F19).** She has never been to a concert and really wants to go. She wants to ""live while we're young"" and doesn't want to go when she's old. Her favorite band tours a lot. The last concert they had here was in 2019. She also wants to buy a new iPad for her upcoming studies. Which costs x2 the minimum wage here. Plus, she does not work a job and is relying on allowance/pocket money. Also, she doesn't have anyone to go to concerts with. I would go, but hear me out.

**Some backstory.** My gf wanted to go to a concert earlier this year, which I agreed to because she really wants to and if she's happy, it's worth it. Unfortunately, the tickets were sold out within 10 minutes of public sale, and we didn't get to buy. Bummer.

**Upcoming concert.** There is another concert coming up and she wants to go. The official tickets are already sold out. BUT, through a mutual acquaintance we were introduced to a reseller. The reseller seems desperate to get rid of their tickets. Regret? Probably.

**The reseller.** The ticket they bought is refundable. Which makes me suspicious. Why wouldn't they just refund it instead of reselling? Also, the ticket is under their name which I am most concerned about, in case we get into trouble, etc. So, we'll just be paying the reseller for a copy of their ticket to go to the concert. Probably fine, but I'm skeptical about being checked for ID blablabla

**Current issue.** We will be moving to the city very soon and I expect there to be expenses in terms of rent, general necessities, furnishings, groceries, utilities etc. PLUS, she is going to enter university, which is why we are moving. Which means even more expenses for her (including her iPad). So right now, I am not exactly keen on buying shady ass tickets which costs us about a whole month's rent, and she is bumming. I suggested that there is always a next time. Now she's sad. :c

My(22m) gf(22f) have been busy lately for like the last 2 weeks. She’s moving cities so, she wanted to say her goodbyes. And in the last 2 weeks she kept late responding, I did give her some space, but I felt 3-4 hours response time is too much. We didn’t facetime at all. 

So she called me yesterday since, she was free and already moved out She asked what I’m doing, and told her that studying for my midterm, and she asked if she should hang up.

•here’s where I might be an asshole•I told her no and I guess I have to make time for her since she didn’t care. She got upset, and said that she is a vulnerable position, and needs support instead of arguments. I know I should have been more supportive, but at the same time I felt I didn’t care about she felt, because I was hurt and angry.

She hang up, and I didn’t bother to call back because I felt like I wasn’t important in her life, and she only calls me when she has free time. I get that she is having hard time, and I tried to be supportive as much as possible, but I can’t help to feel like I’m a second tier to her, since she didn’t even have a time for me in 2 weeks.

She thinks that I should apologize, and I don’t I should.

It was around 10:30 PM. I stopped by the grocery store near me that is open late to pick up a couple of things I needed before I headed home. On my way out, a homeless man sitting by the door of the store stopped me. He asked me if I could call him an ambulance. Something felt weird about it. The grocery store was open (and would be for the next few hours) and multiple male employees were walking in and out of the store periodically to collect carts/trash etc. He didn't appear immediately in danger (not bleeding, no physical injury). I'm not doubting that something was wrong, just providing more info as to what I saw for this post.

I told the man that I'm sorry but that they could call him an ambulance in the store if he needed it. For context, I also work at a grocery store and there have been several occasions when we have called an ambulance for someone (homeless people included), so I knew it could be done. The man didn't reply and I walked quickly to my car.

I felt horrible driving home, like I'd lost my humanity or something. How could I not call an ambulance for someone, especially someone that may have no resources? But then, he WAS sitting right outside the store and, as I wrote earlier, there were people about (mostly men). The area I'm in isn't always the safest and as a woman I've been conditioned my whole life to walk directly to your car without stopping when you're alone and it's dark outside. I don't know.

She has not been officially told by me that she can stay there and she took very little with her when she left. I'm happy for her to continue living there but have not told her this yet.

Because I would like to decorate her old room I've moved all of her stuff out and started boxing it up. She's a prolific writer so there are boxes and boxes of notepads alone. I've also begun stripping the walls of wallpaper. She is very touchy about having her things touched and has a tendency to overreact over it. She's always been this way. So I chose not to tell her anything.

She dropped by briefly to ask me something and discovered that I'd started moving her our and had boxed her things up. She totally flew off the handle and started accusing me of violating her privacy. She was particularly touchy about the notebooks and kept accusing me of reading them. She kept saying it was a betrayal of trust and she didn't understand why I was still 'going through her stuff even as an adult'.

She got extremely upset over the whole thing and asked where she would live now, because she hadn't been told she could stay at the other property past Dec of this year.

It was a totally disproportionate reaction and she left in floods of tears taking her notebooks with her.

It was originally the three of us, and the project is split into six parts:

\-One member was doing introduction + question a

\-I was doing discussion + question b

\-One member was doing conclusion + question c.

In the middle of our semester, we had to bring in a fourth member. I was not present in class that day, and the member who was doing conclusion + question c messaged us saying that they decided to let the fourth member join his part of doing the conclusion + question c. I told him that if he was going to help him with his part, he should help out mine and the other partners part as well as I felt that it was not fair.

At the end, we decided that the fourth member were to help support all parts and to do the reference list. None of them wanted to do it, so I ended up giving my part to the new member, while I did the supporting + reference list.

A few days ago, the same member who was doing conclusion + question c messaged the group, pointing me out specifically asking if I can do the conclusion instead because he is swamped with his work from his other classes. I mentioned that I also have my own workload from my classes and my own commitments (I work full-time). The other members then messaged me privately telling me to help him out because the member is very stressed out. I then told the entire group that I was not happy with what was going on and that it's not fair to me. He never even gave me a sincere explanation, I just felt like he threw his task at me, and stopped responding to me since.

I feel bad because that member is clearly stressing out. But I feel like he's doing the bare minimum (first by trying to get the new member to join his part, now giving me one of his tasks). I was very rude and blunt with them, and now I feel like they all think I'm a jerk. I also don't know if it's because they assume that I split the tasks in a way that's not fair, but I really do feel like I've been putting a lot of work in our paper.

M: ‘that stuff is really minor, why do you care?’
Me: ‘Because despite what it is you insulted, you still were talking about me and insulting me!’

He has a different friend called T who I dislike but I never say anything. T obviously took M’s side and defended him by saying ‘he literally said you eat your food weirdly why are you making such a big deal out of it?’ And he prefaced this by taking one of my crackers (I have 8, the perfect amount to make the amount of sandwiches I eat) and stuffing it in his maw. I got really pissed off about it but they were just laughing at me about it. I stopped talking for a while, but then the subject of how M was kind all the time and how I joke about his height a lot (he is noticeably short). Once again, they all agreed. Now, the last time I ever did that was over three weeks ago because it was a few days before Halloween. M got stressed because he couldn’t find his outfit and I told him to not have a short temper about it. He literally laughed at it.

When I asked him to give an example he failed to remember the last time I insulted him and blamed it on him being tired. Once again, everyone at the table agreed with him. To prove that he is wrong, I brought up an event that happened less than 2 hours before we sat for lunch. We were walking down the corridor and somebody tried to get past him. They said ‘I’m late, hurry up!’
M decided to slam them into the wall with his shoulder and after they insulted him and tried to leave, he did it again and hung his head whilst jogging away.

Fucking obviously, he denied it and said they were insulting him before he first slammed here as if that would even warrant assault. It was a lie of his anyway, so it didn’t matter, except every fucking person believed him again and said that ‘he was justified’.
I left after that and hope to never return.

Okay I know that title is very weird, but I need to get this off my chest. I have a group of friends whom of which I met online four years ago. Since then my mental and physical health has rapidly declined since I had no motivation to do anything.It got so bad that I even considered doing something harmful in order to cut off friendship with them. One day a new friend was added to the group chat we had created, me and her got very close. For the first time in years I had felt comfortable enough to express my opinions about these “friends” who have been mentally draining me for 4 years. There was an excessive amount of drama in the group chat, and everyone complained and excessive amount everyday. I felt responsible for taking care of them. It got so bad i couldn’t even help my friends anymore because no matter in what way I helped nothing seemed to change. My friends kept on faking stuff as well like disorders. I wasn’t allowed to say anything. I felt as if I had spoke up everyone would hate me. So I stayed silent for years. Until this friend came along, and I started expressing how miserable everyone made me feel everyday. And she agreed with me! Until today. I found out she had been faking, and she told me things like “You’re horrible for saying that about this person” or “I’m sick of pretending to be your friend.” It really hurt me, and that’s when I decided I had had enough. I finally left and I cut connections with everyone. It still hurts that I lost around 20 friends in the span of an hour, but I’m glad I was able to finally cut their level of toxicity, but what she said is still stuck with me and I can’t get it out of my head.

It was originally the three of us, and the project is split into six parts:

\-One member was doing introduction + question a

\-I was doing discussion + question b

\-One member was doing conclusion + question c.

In the middle of our semester, we had to bring in a fourth member. I was not present in class that day, and the member who was doing conclusion + question c messaged us saying that they decided to let the fourth member join his part of doing the conclusion + question c. I told him that if he was going to help him with his part, he should help out mine and the other partners part as well as I felt that it was not fair.

At the end, we decided that the fourth member were to help support all parts and to do the reference list. None of them wanted to do it, so I ended up giving my part to the new member, while I did the supporting + reference list.

A few days ago, the same member who was doing conclusion + question c messaged the group, pointing me out specifically asking if I can do the conclusion instead because he is swamped with his work from his other classes. I mentioned that I also have my own workload from my classes and my own commitments (I work full-time). The other members then messaged me privately telling me to help him out because the member is very stressed out. I then told the entire group that I was not happy with what was going on and that it's not fair to me. He never even gave me a sincere explanation, I just felt like he threw his task at me, and stopped responding to me since.

I feel bad because that member is clearly stressing out. But I feel like he's doing the bare minimum (first by trying to get the new member to join his part, now giving me one of his tasks). I was very rude and blunt with them, and now I feel like they all think I'm a jerk.

About a month ago I started connecting with someone I had only bumped into before now but known of. Lets call her Gina (F20). When I’ve bumped in, we hadn’t really talked in the past, but this semester, it kind of grew from a point of initially just passing by, to an acquaintanceship, to by now a genuine sort of friendship. I’ve been dealing with a ton of social anxiety lately, and to put it honestly, they’re one of my only friends who I feel like genuinely has been listening to me when we talk. 

This semester’s ongoing theme for me has been that I have been feeling increasingly tossed to the side by a lot of my college friends that I’ve been close to since Freshman year. People are often too busy to hang out, I have been feeling more socially isolated than past semesters. And the places I wanted to take on more responsibility in, I’ve felt ignored and unappreciated. The new friendship I’ve made with Gina is genuinely one of the only friendships I’ve made that’s progressed forwards this semester and I feel validated. But this all comes with a bit of a problem. Gina had been toxic to two of my other friends. 

Both times Gina had been roomates with these friends and the dynamic had not worked out. The first time with my friend that I’m going to call Petal (21F). And the second time with a friend of mine that I’m gonna call Laurie (21F). In both cases Petal and Laurie had confided in me that they were friends with Gina before getting pushed out of a friend group they had both been part of. Petal in late 2021, and Laurie this semester. From the stories I’ve solely heard from Laurie, Gina had been the main force in creating what wound up being a toxic roommate situation of that friendgroup. 

I want to also just bring up other things within how this has all played out. Gina has been respectful with me about my friendships with Laurie and Petal. She hasn’t brought up any issues with the fact that I regularly do talk to both of them

The other things that have been going through my mind within the whole situation. I have at least two other friends who are also good friends with Gina and have endorsed her as a friend. They operate seperately from Gina’s main friend group.

I've made it clear to my friends that for me I will keep all peoples secrets just amomg themsef and me, I dont talk bad about any of my friends behind their backs and I ultimately consider friendships with people independent from other peoples thoughts and experiences(sans a certain moral line of course). Plus people tend to act differently in an individual friendship to a friend group. 

So I need to ask reddit if in this case AITA?

TLDR: I’ve become friends this semester with someone who has hurt two of my other friends.

When she first moved in she was given a very strict clean up policy since I can not stand filth. 

Jane did everything I asked for but the dusting under or on surfaces we rarely used. I didn’t have a problem with it at all until I started to notice spiderwebs around the house. I cleaned them up but they keep coming back.  Jane went out and found bug spray and they stopped appearing everywhere. 

I decided that since she had constantly shown respect for my rules I would treat both of use to a concert of a band we both enjoyed. 

Jane paid for everything except the tickets, that would include gas, food, t-shirts (40 bucks a pop), and alcohol. 

We had a great time enjoyed ourselves completely. Jane needed to go to the bathroom so I saved our seats while she went. Some guy introduced himself to me and we hit it off. I ended up leaving early to hang out with him, taking the car with full intention to come back and pick up Jane since we were a couple hours away. I sent a message to her before I left to see if she wanted to join me but she didn’t respond so I took it as a “no”.

Well it ended up being four hours after the concert ended so when I turned back on my phone it came all of Janes messages. She thought I left her and decided to take a bus home. 

When I go home all of her things were gone and there was a note that said, 

“I can’t believe you would leave me all alone after I paid for basically everything. With your unbelievable house rules I have stuck with you not matter what until this. You are on your own now friend. Fuck you, fucking asshole. -Jane”

For some context, my father cares more about his public image than he does about his family. He would yell at me if I made his life inconvenient in anyway. He's always been able to (and did so obsessively) track my location up until recently, and he is only unable to do so now because I refused to give him my passwords and he lost access. He only did not harass me more because I was ill with Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating my boyfriend (20M) for 2 years now. He is incredible, and his parents are equally so. I want to leave and start a new life with him. My boyfriend is Mexican, and both my parents are racist. When my mother found out, It was so bad that I was having a panic attack and had to call my boyfriend after I locked myself in my room. Several days in a row, she would come home and scream at my father while banging things around the house.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend never met my parents and we would hang out at my house until before my parents came home. We left some evidence behind once, and my dad took his turn to go crazy. It scared me. He searched every corner and dust in the room with his BB gun screaming how he is going to call the cops on my boyfriend if he found him. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this happened near the beginning of our relationship. They are still not comfortable with him, but we avoid bringing him up for the sake of the household's peace.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about moving out for a while, and there are some decent deals available right now. I had mentioned this to my dad several times before, but he always said that if I moved out, it would make my mother unhappy. It would make my dad unhappy. We simply couldn't “afford” it. 

My parents' combined income is $200,000+. My father admits that he saved money for my college when I was a baby. They were prepared to look for apartments and pay for rent if I decided to attend university after graduating from high school. My first 2 years of schooling were nearly free BECAUSE of community college and its program.

 

He was fed up with me tonight. For the first time, he began slut shaming me. ""He says he loves you and cares about you. He told you he goes to university, but I'm sure he's lying to you (side note: my dad didn't believe my boyfriend went to university because he believes Mexicans can't get in.... My boyfriend and I literally have a class together). He will sleep with you and promise to stay with you, and you are mistaken. You are naive. You want to move out because of that boy, huh?”

&amp;#x200B;

I began crying, and in response, I began telling him he was insane. I was hurt. I asked him what kind of daughter and person he raised that he believes I would party, waste my life, or be unable to choose the right people to be in my life.

We lost my mom after an extremely sudden battle with cancer about six months ago, Everyone in the family is dealing with it in different ways, but last week my oldest sister (Amy, 40) texted me that she's worried about our middle sister (Katie, 35). Apparently she's started drinking, can barely make it into work, and can't see a therapist because there's a month-long wait for it. Amy lives in a different state so there's not much she can do, but I really don't want to deal with Katie's problems.

My issue is, I have a lot of anger towards Katie relating to our mom. She's always been a flake and a pretty spoiled brat sometimes, but it got unbearable after mom's diagnosis. She was really busy with a new job when we found out, which isn't her fault, but for the first five out of the six weeks we had, she only managed to visit twice. Meanwhile I quit my job to live with my parents and stay with my mom 24/7. I'd spend 12-15 hours a day at the hospital making sure to be there for every meeting, test, and update; at home I was the one feeding her, cleaning her, handling appointments, monitoring her oxygen and dispensing her meds, etc. Even when Katie did manage to visit, I still couldn't get a break because she wasn't comfortable taking care of her on her own. I'm the one who had a front row seat to watch mom die, and while I'm grateful for the time with her, I'm annoyed that Katie never had that responsibility. (For the record, our dad was working overtime every week to help balance out me staying home with Mom.)

We agreed to have mom's memorial in her home town. My dad and I did 95% of the work and paid about 75% of the cost. Amy, who again lives out of state, did what she could and Katie did literally nothing to help. She was going to make some photo collages and a playlist but never managed to get around to them. The most significant contribution she made was suggesting we have custom-made funeral invitations printed and sent out to the family. (Note: we'd already created and had the memorial programs printed by that point, after she'd provided no input on them.) Literally all she had to do was show up for mom. Thanks to an issue with her card, she couldn't check into her hotel and thus had a meltdown and skipped the memorial entirely. She's apologized for this several times, but it's really the kind of thing that ""I'm sorry"" doesn't fix.

I know Katie's struggling, but to be honest I think she kind of deserves it. She's handling her grief much worse than the rest of us, and I'm sure part of that is because she failed to do even the bare minimum for our mom. My mental health in general already wasn't spectacular before all this, and I'd rather put the energy towards my own shit and taking care of our dad.

I thought it was time he needs to know. For the protection of his daughters. My wife was hesitant. I convinced her to talk to one of the people she admires most and is a good voice of reason. FIL's step mother and father. They say it is up to us what we do. They would prefer if we just talked it out with FIL instead. They are disappointed in him. Eventually decide to tell her brother. My wife calls he brother and asks him to listen. He asks for some time and we wait.

He calls back and starts to ask why we are trying to defame their father and that his father told him after HS that he did things for his sister for her own good and that they weren't right but he had to because their mother wouldn't. He started to make her cry. He said that he knows we have been talking to everyone and saying thing that aren't true. I text him and tell him he has some nerve making her cry when we were only looking out for his daughter’s safety. And that whoever he is getting his information form is wrong and lying because we only talked to FIL parents and not to anyone else he mentioned. (Guess who has been talking to him.)

He later apologizes to her and they make up but he never admits that their dad did anything wrong and never responded to my message. I haven't spoken to him since. FIL finds out and instead of talking to us goes to everyone including his parent and spins and twists what people think we are doing and makes everyone think we are trying to split the family. His parents even call to say we shouldn't have done it and that we need to apologize to FIL and help fix the family.

APOLOGIZE!! To HIM!!!! After everything he put my wife through growing up and us during our marriage he has never once apologized or admitted he was wrong. Once he even had the audacity to say ""You're welcome"" when I told him how much progress she has made in her self-worth and all that she had accomplished since leaving home. 

As I write this, things have calmed down but Christmas is coming and I need to know if I should ignore things if FIL says or does anything. I know he will only twist what we say. I have told my wife I he does anything else to us I am not letting him see our kids again. I don't care if it cause her fathers side of the family trouble.

First, I have never had a great relationship with my FIL. After several bad relationships in HS to College my wife's father made her her to go to a local Christian College her father went to years ago. Long story short we started working together. I asked her out and she said no because of her father. I waited and we became best friends and eventually decided to just have a quiet relationship. We came out as dating later and FIL blew up (a whole other story). I got a job offer and she decided to leave with me and her parents told everyone I kidnapped her. 2 months later we were married things were good at home.

We are now 7 years married and 3 kids later we have a semi-stable relationship with her parents. I love my MIL, she is a lot like me. After years of back and forth we have discovered that her father is a overcontrolling narcissist with a mother complex because his mother died when he was 8 and my wife looks just like her. Did I mention he is a military chaplain?

The trouble comes shortly after we got married. My wife starts to decompress about her life and family and starts to tell me a lot about her childhood she just never told anyone about. I started seeing the red flags I just supported her and encouraged her to continue to tell me what ever she wanted and I would never judge her. She told me how her father would manipulate her friendships, tell her to not be like her mother, tell her how she should be, get jealous of her friends spending time with her and pull her away from them just to talk. It got more obsessive. He would lay on her bed to talk to her. When she got bras as a preteen, he took her because her mother wasn't comfortable doing it. In HS he would often offer her a warm towel after a shower and walk in to put it on her shoulders. When she was sick, he would tell her to get undressed and lay in the tub and he would rub her back. When she admitted to having sex with a hidden boyfriend, he made her go around all her siblings and tell them and apologize to them (she has 4 brothers). And after she came back from being away at college (short before I met her) he offered to give her a massage. She was 22 and he told her to get undressed into her just her bottoms and lay flat down and he messaged her.

You might be thinking why she didn't say no. Well growing up she was never allowed to say no. He would make her feel bad for saying no or convince her he knows best. She was scared to say no. When she didn't want to break up with her college boyfriend, he threatened to pack a bag and leave their house and said it would be all her fault.

She now knows everything he did was wrong and if we had ever reported it he would have been kicked out of the military. We have moved past a lot of it and we keep boundaries with our children to keep them safe. But my wife has brothers who were emotionally neglected as you can guess why.

They couldn't life where L was so they moved in with my Nan. S got dumped with my Nan a lot bc L kept leaving to go places all the time. Both of my cousins lived there free of charge (fair for S bc she had no job or income).

We found out that L got back with her ex-gf that caused her a lot of issues and that they were planning to get a house in a bad area. Our family was fine with it (we're very close) as long as S got a good life. Later on S birthday, she was supposed to spend the weekend with her sister. L didn't show up until late in the afternoon - she was supposed to be there in the morning, because she was with her gf. The weekend didn't go well and for a while after that she wasn't treating my Nan as a grandmother and wasn't showing her any respect.

It's been back and forth with my cousins' family for a few years and we've had problems with L before. We found out they were moving when this whole fight/lack of respect thing happened with my Nan and pop, so I got rid of them off my socials. My Nan said she was done with them because of what they said to her and that we (my parents and I (17m)) can decide what to do from there. S texted me asking why I removed her from my platforms and when I didn't respond, she knew why and went off at me. 

They don't really talk to my Nan much anymore but they're coming for Christmas. My Nan is pressuring us to buy them things for Christmas because they're ""family"". My parents and I don't want to because of how they blew up at my Nan and I and basically disowned themselves. I know my Nan will have a go at us if we don't buy them anything so AITA?

She had a huge binge eating disorder and was fat for most of my childhood while I was thin and she hated me for it. She would attack my bigger thighs/butt all the time which looking back at now it was only because she was insecure of her looks. 

Eventually she lost weight through herbalife and she went on extreme diets. Sometimes eating one meal a day which consisted of an egg, avocado and water. She got really thin yet I was still thinner and she made it a competition. She would say things like “I look better than you and I’m 17 years older” “ Everyone compliments me and not you” “People think i’m the daughter” “People think we’re sisters” “They say i’m hotter”. She would wear revealing clothes around me and dress me down so my body was hidden in baggy clothes. She would make really mean comments about other body parts of mine that I was insecure about. I was only 13, at the time. 

All of this played a huge role in me hating anything that had to do with fitness, fashion, eating habits etc. i turned to food for comfort and eventually gained a lot of weight. i am currently about 40lbs overweight. over the years my mom has also gained weight and now she’s really insecure again so she wants to get a mommy makeover. 

i’ve been working really hard at the gym and have lost about 10lbs so far. i feel really dedicated and motivated to lose the weight and get in the best shape ever but hearing that my mom wants a mommy makeover is making me really angry and insecure.

don’t get me wrong, i want my mom to feel happy and i’m not against plastic surgery but it’s really just my mom’s narcissistic and egotistic attitude that i’m really concerned about. she ruined my teen years with this and now she’s on her way to ruining my twenties. i could never imagine wanting to compete with my own daughter.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4846046,public,top,self,AITA for telling my mom not to get a tummy tuck because I’m fat?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaf34o/aita_for_telling_my_mom_not_to_get_a_tummy_tuck/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

He proceeds to tell me that he’s doing terribly and that he has no money because he’s in tons of credit card debt (from buying figurines and trading cards). 

Backstory: He graduated from college in 2021 and never wanted to work a corporate job because he wanted to pursue his dreams as an artist living in LA. I told him when he graduated that he could always look for an office job and pursue art on the side (since LA is expensive) until it sustained him enough to quit his office job. He refused to do that and instead wanted to work in restaurants so that he’d have a flexible schedule to do art, which is perfectly fine. He would always talk shit about people working in corporate though because they were “too boring,” “too basic” and not unique enough or bold enough to follow their dreams. While he lived in LA, my parents helped him a lot with parking tickets he would get, rent deposit, and also while he was in college, paid for all his college tuition and apartment rent. 

Now, he recently moved back to our home town to live with my parents because he couldn’t sustain himself in LA (since they stopped paying for him after her graduated) &amp; my parents let him live at home rent free. He wanted to get a corporate job because of how much CC debt he dug himself into but wasn’t actually making the effort to apply himself. My parents told me he would constantly complain to them saying that they didn’t help him find a job and didn’t help to refer him to any jobs. 

Ultimately, my dad was the one who referred him into a job and he starts soon. During our text conversation today, he tells me how he “already knows working in a corporate job will suck ass” and tbh I got pretty enraged because he just doesn’t get how lucky he is. How lucky to be able to have a parent to refer him into a job, how lucky he was to land a job after one interview with a company, how lucky he is to have a job with the state of the economy we’re in right now in general. 

He told me that people shouldn’t have to work in corporate forever and should pursue their dreams instead. I told him that he was in a very privileged and entitled mindset and that a lot of people don’t get to pursue what they want because life gets in the way and responsibilities take precedence. 

Now that he has a stable income, my parent also recently asked him to start paying a little bit to them in rent and grocery money ($500/mo max) and he spent a whole night arguing with them about why he shouldn’t and cannot do so. Said that they were terrible parents that neglected him during childhood and that they owe him. 

There’s a lot more context I can share, but I’ll end here.

We would have already hosted thanksgiving once and she wanted to bring her sister and her sister’s family plus her mother and MIL.

Also note: my brother and SIL did not bother coming to help set up, call to see if they could help, or bring anything at all.
The best part was after the dinner I was cleaning up and SIL started making racist comments, I know I should have been calm but I may have snapped. I started arguing loudly then cursing and stormed out letting my other family members help out for once.

Overall she will eat and try a wide variety of foods but on any given day she will only be willing to eat one thing and what it is only she can answer. She has struggled with an eating disorder since a very young age, but she manages it pretty well as an adult and has gotten very good about ensuring she eats enough even if it's a chore for her.

However, this often results in her just not deciding what she wants until she's extremely hungry and ornery. Because she likes us to eat together I often end up waiting for her to decide as well and also end up hangry with her. Only she can decide what she's willing to eat and ends up making it because she's particular about the preparation. I offer to cook instead constantly but she always refuses.

Sometimes she's not up for cooking so I offer to cook something she chooses or I make suggestions for takeout. This almost always results in her just *finally* picking something to cook and then cooking it herself and refusing my offer to do it, or it results in me making 20 takeout suggestions that she rejects before *finally* choosing the place to order from herself.

The issue arises when I try to get ahead of the ""hangry party"". I have never and would never expect her to be ""the cook"" in our marriage. As dinner gets closer I've taken to very politely asking her ""Do you know what you want for dinner?"" Sometimes she just hadn't thought about it yet and my question prompts her to think about it *before* the hangry party begins, which is wonderful. Other times she'll just say ""I don't know yet"" and the routine proceeds as usual.

Well I guess this habit annoys the hell out of her. She asked me why I say that when I know ""she's gonna be the one to cook dinner."" She said I should just ask her ""what are you making for dinner?"" because I know she'll be the one making it. It caught me by surprise because I actually deliberately do *not* say ""what are you making"" precisely because I never want to imply that she is ""the cook"" or in any way obligated to make dinner, which I expressed to her. ""Do you know what you want for dinner?"" is just me literally asking if she knows what she wants or not, and if not then I'd start making suggestions for takeout or that I'm more than happy to pick something to cook and cook it.

I asked if there is some kind of issue that is prompting this. ""Do you resent making dinner so much? Do you need me to step up and cook more?"" She emphatically said ""**no**"" and that she has no problem making dinner so often, only that I should phrase things better. I told her I will respect her request but that it really feels like there is more here than she's saying. She said ""Honestly I'd just rather not be asked at all."" I admit here I was annoyed and said ""So shut the fuck up about dinner is basically what you're saying?"" She sheepishly said ""Yeah, basically.""
