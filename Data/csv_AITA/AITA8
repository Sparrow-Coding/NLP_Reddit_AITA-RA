Our mother has quite a few issues (heart problems, immunological diseases, hormonal, need surgery, etc etc), and since both of us work, we split her healthcare payments.
My sister is a mother of two, has a steady income earning (very) good money and splits her family’s bills with her husband, who is a co-founder of a company and makes… a lot.
I had a steady income job (OK-ish money) and no children, so my mother was obviously a priority for me.
I’ve noticed my sister complaining about financial issues for a while now, but never understood, since she makes about 3x more than I did and is not a big spender (like, at all. No shopping sprees, no fancy restaurants, no trips). I understand that having two children is expensive, but I never understood how she and her husband would have trouble.
My sister did have debt before the kids, and we even celebrated together when she was able to pay it all off with her new job.
We tell each other everything. Even the part where my sisters husband controls her finances (he demanded her card passwords, and a detailed list of everything she spends each month- yeah, I also think it’s toxic, but my sister is not welcoming of my opinions on the matter).
I was fired from my job, and I just found out my moms medical expenses increased in about 20%.
I told my sister this, and she said she won’t be able to pay it, and asked me to handle it, one way or another.
I don’t have a job, but will happily use any savings I have to take care of mom, even if it means me paying more - but it just seems unfair that I have to handle this on my own, even at the risk of my own independence.
She doesn’t want to talk to other healthcare plans, and put her foot down saying she won’t pay for my moms bills.
She won’t open up about how she has financial issues, simply claiming that children are expensive (and I do not doubt that at all! My nephews are everything to me and I always want the best for them). But I also know my sister alone makes more than enough to take care of them at their level of lifestyle, even without her husbands help.
I know my sister is in this weird, controlling relationship, but she is an adult woman and is quick in not wanting to help out our mother who is very sick. My mother is also a priority. She is also family.

He would spend little time with me before having me go find my grandma or him leaving to hang out with his buddies. TBH I never left like I belonged there as I got older. Loved my grandma, and aunts but never became close with him. And when we did spend time he would say go out with me and I'll get you something.

I am in another moral conundrum and would like y'alls opinion if I would be the AH if I acted on this situation. I am going to use fake names, as recent posts make it hard to follow with just letters... TLDR at the end.

Background: I (35M) have separated from my ex (31F), who I will call Amy, last April. The divorce is still pending. Papers have been signed/filed with the courts, it's just taking some time for the judge to issue the ruling. The reason for the split was due to Amy cheating on me with her affair partner Chris (45M). One of the only reasons I am still in contact with Amy is because we have a kid together, Aurora (12F). When I found out what was happening, Amy left our house and moved in with Chris.

Situation: Several times throughout our separation, Amy reached back out to me to text me she has missed me at or even shown up to my house in the night. Each of these attempts were met with the same results. I do not see Amy as my wife anymore, and that she needed to leave me alone unless it was about our daughter, Aurora. I even set a hard boundary of not texting me past 7 PM now unless it's an emergency.

Issue: I want to tell Chris about the times Amy has been contacting me about missing me or showing up at my house. However, Aurora stays with Amy most of the time, and I do not want Aurora's life thrown into more turmoil. If Aurora wasn't in the picture, I would be like Frank Sinatra and start spreading the news. Not only do I want Aurora to be in as much of a stable environment as possible, but I am the only one paying for the divorce. I retained the lawyer, I filed, and I am the one footing the entire bill. So far, it's cost me over $7K, but I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Possible solutions: First is to say nothing to anyone. While I am not a fan of this solution, I will bite my tongue for the betterment of Aurora. Second is to say something now. This can cause a rift between Amy and Chris. Causing them to separate, causing more turmoil for Aurora. Also, without the divorce being finalized by the judge, I wouldn't put it past Amy to try and renegotiate the terms of the divorce (i.e. making me pay more in Alimony or something like that. Amy is a very spiteful person like that). Third option is to wait until the judge signs the order and the ink dries, and everyone starts to live the new life.

Context: Amy is looking to purchase a house with Chris soon, so that could cause some major instability for Aurora if Amy suddenly becomes a true single parent on a single income household. Amy makes enough on her own wages to adequately take care of Aurora on her own. I know this because it must be shared with the lawyers for child support calculations.

I initially didn't want to do a bachelorette party or if I did I wasn't planning on going all out for it.  I will like to add that it's not uncommon for my high school friends and I to travel to see each other for yearly trips and milestones. The first night was very mellow but It was a great bonding experience for us all. My high school friends surprised the rest of the group with goodie bags and it was all very thoughtful. The second day we had dinner reservations. Dinner was great but I saw two of my high school friends were being cliquey with each other. I didn't think much of it because they probably felt more comfortable that way since everyone was so new to them. These two (Kate and Rob) have known each other since elementary. After a drag show we went dancing. I know at one point some of them did shots but I did not partake. I wanted to keep a good buzz but I didn't want to get wasted. One of my friends end up getting hammered. It's around 1am and at this point I am taking care of her. We are on the side walk and I'm giving her water. I texted Kate, who was in the club, that Tia was not doing well and we needed to get her food. We find a pizza place and everyone goes inside to get pizza except Tia and I. She says she's going to be sick so she goes to the nearest trash can and lets out her dinner and booze as I am holding her hair back. My sister and Amy come outside and instantly ordered an Uber to get Tia and us home and everything closes in 30 mins anyways. The Uber comes, I sincerely apologize to the Uber for the state of my friend, and hand him an extra $40 cash tip. I see that Kate and Rob are not in the Uber and Amy informs me that they said they weren't coming. That's when my sister informs me that when she rushed in to tell them the situation, and they said ""We don't really care, we want to stay out."" That didn't sit well with me and the whole Uber ride back I'm fuming. We get Tia into bed and I wait for Kate and Rob to get back while Amy is keeping me company. They walk in, and I asked them ""why they would say such a thing?"" I told them that I thought it was insensitive and rude. I informed them we didn't leave because we wanted to but because we needed to. They said they ""didn't know she was sick"" and then they got really mad at me with Kate telling me that she planned my bachelorette party, went all out, did all of this for me, spent her money, and now I'm attacking her. I started to cry because it blew up into something it shouldn't have. Rob felt really bad and started to console me but Kate was just furious with me. I apologized if they felt I attacked them but I still was hurt that they didn't care about my friend. My sister insists that they knew what state Tia was in and swears that they said ""We don't really care...""

My husband, ""Roger,"" comes from a big family. His Grandparents on both sides of his family are still alive, so he still gets together on Christmas with his extended family. I only get together with my parents and sister. Therefore, my husband has three Christmas parties to go to (two with extended family, and one with his parents and siblings), and I have one. My sister, ""Karen"" has a party with her in laws on Christmas Day.

The conflict comes with my family. My sister, Karen, made a rule that we will ALWAYS have our Christmas party on Christmas Eve, and has determined that we just need to make it work. My perspective is that we can just choose a different day each year so don’t have to miss any parties.

The last two years, we did end up skipping Christmas with Roger’s paternal grandparents in order to go to her party on Christmas Eve. This year, one of his cousins is coming home from Germany, and his grandfather has been having health problems (most likely the onset of dementia) and will be moving into a home for the next year, so he wanted to go. I texted my family that we had parties the Saturday before Christmas and Christmas Eve, and asked if we could move the party (Roger's parents always choose a date last in order to accommodate all the schedules for him and his 4 sisters). I told Karen that any other date worked, and asked when she wanted to do it:

Karen responded, December 24. Like every year

Me: We have a party that day and want to celebrate with Roger's grandfather. He's getting dementia and will be moving to a home soon, so we want to spend time with him when we can.

Karen: Ok. No worries. We've done it the same for 10 years so if you change it that's on you.

Me: Ok, just let us know when you want to do Christmas. These are the two days we have booked.

Karen: Ok. Same date as always.

Roger: but if you are stuck on that day and that day only, then you are the ones telling us that we can't come. Is that what you want? My family has people coming from Germany and out of state, and we can't move all of those schedules.

Karen: well we've done it the same every year so it's been a fight every year so that's the day we do it every year instead of changing it around schedules every year. We aren't changing from tradition. We have two families to deal with too. These are traditions we have in place and we will do. its' too bad if my son has no one to do them with.

Me: Just something to think about, it doesn't have to be a fight. We can work together and compromise so that it works for all of us.

Karen: That is something to think about!!!!!

Karen's husband: I like turtles.

This morning when I spoke with my parents, they (who do not have any other Christmas parties to plan around) said that they are planning to get together on the 24th, and if I don't care about them, that's too bad. They said that it was outrageous that we were planning around my husband's extended family and couldn't even work with my immediate family.

In the community, we’d talk about anything from video games, sports, and our own personal lives. The community was large and required a lot of volunteer work to keep it running. There were online events, draft leagues etc being hosted regularly, and the quickest ways to get recognized was to volunteer your own time hosting those activities. I would volunteer and offer my time whenever I got the chance.

It became a vicious cycle. Shortly after I was known for hosting, my volunteer work was no longer appreciated, but something people began to expect of me. I did it because I couldn’t risk losing my only outlet. I devoted so much time to that community to the detriment of my offline life. I had disagreements with how I wanted to run things and that lead to arguments with others. I’m not the most likable person, but the responses I got from the disagreements ranged from petty to dehumanizing. Still, I kept investing time. I felt as though if I kept going, things would get better. The community was constantly moving around different online platforms until it eventually settled on a forum that I created, maintained, and oversaw in the last 5 years. I was promoted up the hierarchy until eventually I was at the top. At that point, I thought I finally got what I wanted: recognition and sanctity in a community that I loved being in, but what happened was things became more hostile. Some disagreed with the way I did things, but I made sure to hear people out and adjust the way things are run. I always tried to listen to criticism and dedicated so much time out of my life to make others happy. However, I would constantly be demeaned and attacked and occasionally I would respond in kind. 

The arguments escalated and got to the point where others up the hierarchy wanted to oust me. When asked why, they refused to give a straight answer. They just wanted me gone. At that point, it dawned on me that I was being used the entire time. For a while, I cut off contact and kept the website running. Eventually, I decided to delete the forum. The forum was mine. I created it, I maintained it, I did most of the work to keep it running. I knew I’d be taking something away from the community when I deleted it, but was this a community that ever gave a shit about me in the first place? I’m not gonna pretend everything was all bad, I really did enjoy a lot of the time I spent in that community, but I was held to a much higher standard than everyone else was. I always had to be the bigger person and I always had to walk on eggshells to avoid pissing anyone off. None of it felt fair. I was fed up with constantly being exploited, so I took the last thing that I built with me. If those same people who wanted to oust me want to take the reigns so badly, then they can do it on their own fucking website.

We did not know this person prior - they responded to an ad that my other housemates put up because we needed to fill a room. 

Shortly after moving in, it became apparent that this person has a severe alcohol and drug problem. They have stolen a significant amount of alcohol from the rest of us (it took a while to notice because we don't drink frequently but have a lot of premium alcohol which has been collected over the years). The new roomie has not admitted to stealing but was confronted about it and told to buy their own. They seem to be sticking to this after maybe the 3rd time they were confronted (the most recent time was in person as they were caught stealing in the kitchen) but haven't paid back any money for the alcohol or replaced it. As for the drugs, it's mainly ketamine, which I am not *morally* opposed to but it has caused issues when the new roomie ends up incapable of walking down the stairs, getting home from a night out, and so forth. This person will frequently be drunk/under the influence of drugs in the middle of the day, or hungover and violently throwing up in the bathroom. This affects us as some of us here work from home or like to have guests and it's awkward to hear the sounds of someone throwing their guts up every day or falling around the house. It's also embarrassing that they leave empty bottles of vodka in the bathroom, etc. I have been wanting to discuss this with the new roomie but they have been visibly drunk or with friends every time I've seen them recently. Another person I live with tried to open up a friendly/supportive conversation about it but the new roomie mostly denied having any issues at all and spent the next week retreating to their room. 

Now, here's where I'm not sure if IATA. While my other housemates (and myself) would be happier with this person gone, a specific warning has never been given, meaning we haven't made it clear that eviction was ever on the cards. At this point, it's obvious their general behaviour isn't going to radically change but the main issue (stealing) has been resolved for the moment. Legally they are only entitled to 7 days' notice (I would be okay giving up to a month) and there's enough evidence to prove they have been difficult to live with. However, the housing market is extremely challenging at the moment and there's a chance they wouldn't find somewhere to live at all. I feel like kicking them out would be kind of blindsiding them as I suspect they're deep in denial about how much of an issue it is. It's also frustrating that the more we confront them, the more they try to hide their problem (which I am aware is a common trait for addicts). 

In case anyone is wondering, they have paid rent and bills on time every month.

We lived with them for over a year because my bf had already promised his brother they would move together before we had agreed to move in together. They moved his cousin in about 6 months into our lease because he needed a place to stay. I was fine with this but only wanted it to be temporary. Throughout the time we lived with his brother, he would barge into our room, wake us up when we were sleeping, and constantly pick fights with my bf. I was miserable living with him and told my bf I wanted us to move out by ourselves and I would move out on my own if he decided to stay living with his brother. My bf agreed and we decided to tell him and his cousin. His brother did not like this and told us “you’re not moving without me”. I discussed this with him personally and after I told him we would be moving to our own place, he said “that’s what you think”. It got to the point where every time we spoke we fought and I hated it. Our lease ends this December but his brother ended up bringing bed bugs into the apartment. This was my last straw. My bf and I paid for the treatment, and decided to get out asap. So this last week we told him we would be moving and that he needed to get the wifi and electric in his name by this Monday since I currently pay for it. He lost it and went and told his whole family my bf and I are shady and stealing from the family business to pay for rent. His sister took his side and told me I was on a “high horse” for telling him not to bring the family into it. My bf’s parents &amp; cousin were also upset at us for “causing” all of this. My bf was distressed and so was I. The day after moving I went back to the apartment to clean up and my bf called me and I opened up to him about how upset I was that his brother had acted this way. I didn’t know he was in the apartment at the time because he’s usually at work and he was standing outside the door listening to me say this. He then proceeded to start yelling at me through the door and we got into it, bad. 
I truly didn’t think I was in the wrong, but from the way his family is acting now I’m not so sure. I want a good relationship with them but am hurt at how something as simple as moving has turned into so much conflict.

My wife (43f) and I (43f) are hosting Thanksgiving at our house this year. My wife’s family is coming over on Thursday, I’m an only child and my parents currently live abroad, so we won’t see them until they come for Christmas. My wife’s family consists of her brother (45f), her sister (50f), her parents (78m and 80f) and our nieces and nephews (3 boys, 3 girls, ages 11-14). My wife and I also have our own kids, 15f and 13m.

About a month ago, we went on vacation. The town we ended up staying in is where my wife went to college. The campus has a market that runs once a week and is open to the public. My wife wanted to check the market out. The market was nice and all of us ended up getting various different things. One of the booths there was a fundraiser for a local LGBT organization, it was a nice little booth and we saw that our son and daughter were looking at the booth, so we went to go see them. My son was showing me how one of the items at the booth was a bracelet that said something about supporting trans athletes. Our son had bought a few because he wanted to wear one to support his friend, Jaxon.

Jaxon goes to the same middle school as our son, they went to different elementary schools in the district but met in middle school. Our son is on the baseball team at school, Jaxon loves sports, like my son, including baseball, but he doesn’t play for his school or an outside team due to his dyspraxia (which affects hand-eye coordination) and his sensory issues (which can also come from dyspraxia), despite this, he is still friends with my son and all his other friends, talking about sports (especially baseball) all the time. Jaxon also plays sports with them at our local sports center or the gym. The boys love Jaxon and in their own words he’s “just another bro”.

My son has been wearing the bracelet to school, he bought his friends some, but we live in quite a conservative area, so only a few took them, the others have more conservative parents.

In our family, we dress somewhat formally on thanksgiving, nothing super elegant, just a nice button down shirt or a nice sweater and nice pants. My son was showing us what he wanted to wear on Thanksgiving, we both said his outfit was nice, but when my wife saw he had his bracelet on, she asked him not to wear it because it might “start something” with her siblings and parents. My wife comes from a very conservative, Evangelical family. He said “if someone has an issue with Jaxon, then they have an issue with me to” and said he wouldn’t not wear it. He then asked me what I thought and I said I’d discuss it with her. After that, we went in the bedroom and talked about it, we didn’t end up coming to an agreement, and I told him he could wear it, because I don’t want him feeling like he can’t stand up for Jaxon and that his friend is lesser. My wife is very upset at me because she does not want to hurt her relationship with her family.

My mom and Joan both have 2 kids. Im the youngest of 4 between them and the only one who lives in the same state (5 hours away). I am the only one who visits yearly, though I visit multiple times through out the year.

A few weeks ago, I was driving through for work and said I could stop for dinner and stay one night. My mom and dad get along well even though they are divorced. So my mom invited my dad over so we could all have dinner together since I was around for 1 night.

My dad makes pizzas for dinner and put them in the oven. Joan is on her computer in her office.  hasn't said much to either of us since we got there. I pull up the SNF game on my laptop while im waiting. The table was made, we just needed to wait for the food. Everyone else was doing their own thing as the food cooked.

Within a few minutes Joan is walking around and sees me watching football. She says ""Turn that off, we are eating dinner"". I reply that the food is still cooking and we aren't eating dinner right now. She starts complaining about it so I just ignore her like usual and mute the game. Joan comes in the room again;""we can have dinner or football but not both"". I tell her I will turn it off when the food is close to done. She keeps going so I close my laptop.

So I'm sitting there in silence, waiting for dinner. Joan keeps coming in and out and complaining about me watching football even though it is off. I tell her she can stop complaining cause the game is off. She kept going and I was just ignoring her. Then she said ""Respect your elders"". I sat there and ignored her but she kept going. ""I'm 65, I have way more life experience than you"". I reply ""age isn't an indicator of life exeperience"". She says ""I have a PHD, you only have a masters"" (who cares? I know people with GEDs that are more successful than PhDs). I said ""my masters is in ag science which is way more important than your literature PHD, which doesn't really matter. Who gives a shit about literature?"" ""I actually add value to society"". (I do value literature and all education, I was just sick of being attacked, so I defended myself). By this time my Mom was telling Joan to let it go and walk away and that was the end of it. Joan ended up getting in her car and leaving for the night after a tense and awkward dinner.

Now my mom tells me their relationship may be ending after 8 years and I feel at bed. This isn't the first time Joan has attacked me or criticized me. I generally shrug it off cause that is who Joan is at the core and I just want to see my parents. My brother can't be in the same room with Joan cause it always ends in a yelling match. My mom has never once be rude to or criticized Joan's children, keep in mind.

Here's  some background story I'm a M(22y.o) from a 3rd world country, after  graduating high school  i got a diploma landed a job in my country  because my family was in a very hard financial situation, growing up  sometimes my dad couldn't afford the rent and i remember i used to have  nightmares about us getting kicked out to the streets as a kid, now i'm  providing for my parents and 2 younger siblings because my dad decided  to stop working when i got a job, at the beginning i had some hard time  accepting that because i wanted to help him but i got the whole package  instead, now i'm responsible for 4 people but i'm okay with it now and i  believe my family is more than worth it.

i  also have a cousin who's around my age and he's one of my best friends,  this year he went to Germany to continue his studies, i'm really happy  for him because i know this was his dream and he worked hard for it and i  wish him all the best,

anyway  since my cousin went to Germany my Aunt started telling my mother that  our relatives are wondering why i didn't go to Germany and finish my  studies as well? (p.s my Aunt is well aware of our situation), also i  think it's worth mentioning that my cousin's family is rich, so they  aren't dependent on him.

My mom told me what she heard from my aunt, and i said ""well, i'm not interested in going abroad""

and  that was it, Today my aunt visited us, and she said, multiple family  members (who i don't even know who they are) are wondering why i didn't  go abroad to finish my studies? i was a bit mad at the time and this  made me snap, so i said: ""(well, if i go, who's going to pay the rent?  who's going to buy the food for my family?"" , this ended the discussion  but i felt like shit after that, i don't want my family to think they  are holding me from chasing my dreams because i don't really care about  anything else other than taking care of them, but i felt like i used  them as an excuse, and it's not that i'm a failure, i graduated the  first of my class and landed a good job in less than 3 months after my  graduation, i'm very grateful for what i have, it's just that i didn't  like to be compared with someone who has a totally different  circumstances and dreams than mine.

We haven't done them in 4 years and my kids are getting older and before they are adults I would like a nice picture of all of us together. My extended family has also been asking for some too.

My oldest (16) will not for any reason wear a dress, Not for homecoming or prom or anything. She wore a suit and tie for those.  I just let her be herself. So for pictures we agreed that she could wear her dress pants and one of her brother dress shirts and ties. She looked really nice.

My son (15)  wore dress pants and a dress shirt and tie. (he doesn't care, he just wears whatever I toss at him) 

My youngest (13) was going to wear a dress but  managed to get it filthy when she spilled something on herself right before we left, so she ended up in dress pants another one of her brothers dress shirt with a tie.  Which she liked more anyway.

So all the kids ended up basically matching minus the color of their shirts (Black, White and Grey)

I wore a dress, and my fiancé wore a dress shirt and pants. 

These pictures came out very good and the kids all looked good in them (and weren't making goofy faces).  I showed them to my family and my mom got mad and asked me why I don't make my girls ""look like girls"" Why I didn't force them to wear a dress as they already look like boys because they have short hair. On and on and on. 

So I gave my brother, dad, and Auntie who wanted one a picture but refused to give one too mom, since she didn't like it anyway.

I told her that no adults feel passionate about their jobs and that if she wants, she can get an MBA to switch to another field within business.

She then told me that she wanted to do medicine instead. To be clear, Lucy was premed when starting college but it kinda made her miserable. She wasn't efficient at studying for her organic chemistry classes and would grind for hours to get mediocre results (B's). Her GPA in STEM classes was 3.56, and she hasn't taken many of the required STEM classes either.

She excelled in economics, however, earning higher grades than even me - I tutored micro and macro. She only earned A's and A- in those classes.

I basically gave her the same lecture as I did when she was in undergrad, where my health economics class taught me that being a doctor isn't financially worth it and how doctors deal with lots of bullshit from insurance and people telling them how to practice.

I added that if she was not good at science then, why would she be good now, and to just get an MBA if she doesn't like her job and she got upset with me.

Kate tells me that she doesnt really see it going anywhere but says that she thinks she should either commit or stop jerking him around. This seems unwise to me, but I know him and I think he's an alright dude, so no problems there ultimately. My relationship with kate naturally goes on the backburner out of respect for karl; we still saw each other obviously in groups and such, we just spent considerably less time alone together.

Yada yada idrk the details of their relationship but eventually karl reveals that he doesnt ever want to get married. Their relationship starts to spiral -- kate's a christian, karl's not a christian and doesn't plan to become one; kate wants to get married (but doesn't see herself marrying karl, allegedly ?) karl doesn't want to get married. At some point both of them told me that they felt like the other cared less abt the relationship than they did.

Anyway while theyre apart, karl starts talking to someone new. Kate and karl eventually reconcile but dont get back together. Karl lies abt seeing anyone else and they proceed to start fucking again. Kate finds out that he lied abt continuing to see the other girl and confronts him abt it. Despite this, karl continues to see the other girl until she leaves for college (approx. 1 month).

2 months later (beginning of this month), kate finds out that karl lied to her and went behind her back with this other girl. She was a wreck for a while, but he continued to text her even when she told him to stop talking to her, bought her gifts, started talking abt how he sees them together and that he can see himself getting married. I guess this wore her down after a while, especially since theyre neighbors so he's very accessible.

A few days ago she told me that theyre probably going to get back together. I was honest and told her that I wouldnt be spending time with them. In my eyes, the only reason they're getting back together is bc he didnt respect the boundaries she put in place when she found out he lied to her for months abt going behind her back. He seems kind of emotionally manipulative to me, so I see it as a total waste of her time since there were valid reasons for their initial split. Him saying that he now sees himself getting married seems like desperation rather than genuine change. I told kate as much, but she thinks I'm being dramatic and should suck it up and still spend time with them.

I should mention that me not spending time with them would effectively end our friendship for as long as theyre together. That's not really my intent, but since kate and I aren't going to be spending one on one time together while she has a boyfriend, it's just going to be an unhappy outcome.

They refuse to kennel their dogs &amp; they could not find anyone to watch them during that time. I agreed to let the dogs come.

Right off the bat, Dick was a menace. He barked at every noise. I wasn’t a fan of that, but it wasn’t the worst part. No person in our house could hug, touch, or get too close or Dick would bark &amp; try to bite them. I understand that some dogs are more aggressive, but the hard part for me is my parents refuse to discipline Dick when this happened. They actually blamed us for showing affection/touching in front of Dick.

The last straw was when my parents ran errands for several hours &amp; I had to watch Tom &amp; Dick. Dick only barked once when they were gone. I did not lay a finger on that dog, I yelled at him. That’s all it took. After I yelled at him, he was perfect &amp; polite. The moment my parents came home, he went back to his old ways. I told my parents this and explained that he’s very trainable, but they were very offended and hurt that I yelled at their dog.

As a girl I thought ""would I like if someone told everyone that I send them n\*des""? I didn't care that much tho because this is an anonymous place so it's not like the girl will get bullied for it or anything. The thing that pissed me off was that almost all of the comments on the post were stuff like ""pic or didn't happen"" and ""send them to us"" and OJ was joking about sending them as well, so I said: ""Do you realize sending someone's n\*des forward is a crime? This is fu\*\*ed up how many people are asking to see it."" Someone replied ""Do you realize jokes exits?"" which I replied with ""Oh yeah I forgot that this is an okay thing to joke about when it has happened to many people."" 

I did realize they were joking and that OJ had no intentions of sending those n\*des forward and I didn't think those people were seriously asking for them. I just asked if they understand what they are actually asking, even jokingly, OJ to do. Basically after that everyone started saying that I shouldn't be on Reddit because I'm too sensitive and I don't understand humor. Some people said actually mean and/or inappropriate things to me just because I don't want people to joke about such a thing. Spreading n\*des in the internet is an actual issue and many people's lives have been ruined for such a thing. Some have even k\*\*\*ed themselves. Even if I was being too sensitive at first I don't think they should respond like that. I have experienced s.a, but even if I hadn't experienced anything like that I would still think you shouldn't joke about that because some people still have gone trough that.

Someone asked me over dm to clarify my point to them which was really nice, to be heard without instantly like 130 people hating me over whatever I try to say. I explained that I understood it was a joke but I didn't think it should be joked about etc and why, and they told me to post this here. I couldn't explain myself in the comments of the post because they wouldn't have listened to me and would've just kept on down-voting and not reading my comments through.

He hit all of his developmental mile stones as a baby with no health issues. He does very well at school. He lacks in social interactions, we will take him to the park and so many children come up to him wanting to play and he just turns away and does his own thing. This is fine but I also notice he has a lot of anxiety wanting to play with other kids at the same time. He has had behavioral issues since he was 3, which have gotten significantly better as he has gotten older, but he will just go into a tantrum over something very small. His most recent one was he asked he if I would keep up with his calendar for him. I told him we could do it together and his father and I would help him keep up with it. He lost it full on tantrum on the ground yelling. He used to go to therapy for his anger outburst (which his father also has and is medicated for) I am working to find him another therapist as his old one is booked up. We try really hard to do gentle parenting as we both had abusive homes growing up, but we are not consistent with punishment. We sent him to his room a few weeks ago and he came back out a few minutes later laughing saying he urinated in his pants ""because you sent me to my room and i couldn't leave to go to the bathroom"" it wasn't just a little urine either, his floor was soaked through his pants. I love my son but I feel we would be doing a disservice to him if he is dealing with autism and we are not addressing his needs accordingly. My mom works at the health department and told me there is a person there who does screenings. I booked an appointment and when I told my s.o and he was very upset. I am the person who handles all of his doctor appointments and it just didn't occur to me that this would be any different? Weve been both dealing with his behavioral problems for the past 4 years and I thought we were on the same page, although I had never mentioned autism screening before. It actually caused a huge fight. He basically called me a bad mother for thinking there is something wrong with my child rather than self evaluating myself first. He is concerned about labeling theory and having the autism label on him for the rest of his life. My s.o told me I should get myself tested instead and I am not opposed to the idea. I the 90s they didn't really screen kids at my school for these things, it would explain my social anxiety and inability to connect emotionally to people. My s.o is looking at this as a bad thing, like autism is a dirty word but I don't see it that way at all. The appointment is in an hour and I called to cancel it because of the huge fight we had and second guessing myself thinking maybe I am just a bad mother and should be ashamed for even thinking something could be different about my son.  My mom called me earlier saying she thinks he needs to be screened.

amyone who had ever gotten to know the both of us, knows that we are very different from one another. 

during the summer, our relationship gradually became more enstranged, which is normal, but we would casually chat over basic topics whenever we would text. one day, she had showed me a picture of something she had bought.

i had had my eyes set on buying this specific article of clothing, a red and black corset, for a very long time, for almost four months. luckily for me, i caught it on sale in my size so i bought it. figured it wasn't a big deal, since it i had also seen it on sites such as aliexpress and amazon, so it wasn't like it was anything unique or custom made. 

i also figured that since we were on okay terms, i could show her how the corset fit me (which i had previously told her i had wanted to buy for a long time, so she knew i was going to get it anyway) and she blasted me for ""copying"" her. ever since, she hasn't spoken a word to me and i honestly think the falling out was very childish and immature.

No big deal, but we had plans to go to a recent concert. I didn’t know if it was a standing concert or not(which I guess is important if there are specified seats). 

I was going to go with her, her cousin, and three mutual friends.

I had already given her $90 for my ticket.

She blocked me when we had the falling out, and when I asked her about it in passersby, she just said she’d get me my refund by the end of the day and then left.

I was very annoyed. Since it’s my ticket, she can’t return something I own. If she doesn’t want to sit next to me, she can return her own ticket.

Later on, when we sort of made up, she said it was her invitation, and that it’s like inviting someone to your reserved table at a restaurant, and that she can certainly disinvite me.

I strongly disagreed. It’s not her venue. It’s not like it’s a party at her house and I’ve chipped in to help, and then she’s disinviting me to her home and reimbursing my costs. That’s different, because she has absolute control over her own house and other venues. 

Idk. She’s Vietnamese, and I don’t like stepping too far into realms I don’t know about, and a lot of her morality is just recycled from family-related trauma and filial piety, which I empathize with, but I hate dealing with moral rigidity. She’s pretty bossy in general, which steps on my toes a lot, so I just deprive her of info to not have to deal with imposition a lot.

To give you some background: my parents separated when I was 1yo because my father was physically and mentally abusive to my mother so my mom left during a fight only with the clothes she had on.
After she sued him for not allowing her to see/take the children, she won the lawsuit and received full custody of us (me- 1yo &amp; my sister S. 6yo).
While the lawsuit was ongoing we stayed with him so he was able to convince S that mom has abandoned us and doesn't love us and so on and she didn't want to come with me and mom. My mom was thinking that if she forces her to come live with us, S will be traumatized and hoped that in time she will be able to convince S to stay with us.
After 2-3 years my father left the country and left S with his parents (he also lived with them).
My mother always made everything she could so S would spend every holiday with us and bought us presents for Christmas and clothes and everything we need for school and so on, even if she really struggled financially.
My father only paid child support for me ( insignificant amount - I could only pay transport to/from school for 1week) and only from when I was around 10yo till 18yo and everytime he called me(4-5 times a year) would say that mom is living on his back and what a bad person she is. On top of it, he always degraded me - I am stupid, a bad person, I didn't accomplished or do anything good in my life (when I was 12yo), even if I was always a good student. Needless to say that every phone call ended with me in tears.
I am 30yo now. All my life he was like this. And my sister acted similar so we were not close. And when she grew up she became distant with my mother also.
When S gave birth, she needed help and because she was rude with everyone around her nobody wanted to help her so she turned to mom for help. My mom quit her job &amp; retired early and moved to another city to help her. After 2 years of treating my mom bad, they had some argument and S and her husband kicked out my mom so I had to go there and take my mom to my place with all her things. It was a real shit show and it was really hurtful for me, not to mention for my mother.
Going back to my father relationship: I realized that I have some trauma because of him (fear of abandonment, anxiety, too emotional sometimes, things like that) but I always thought that well, he s my father, I have to accept him as he is. That until the second time he wished me happy birthday (by text) NOT on my birthday. So I told him how many times he hurt me, asked him how he can sleep at night and told him that is better if we won t talk anymore to which he responded by calling me names, uneducated, stupid and so on. Fast forward 1 year, he sends me some self help e-books about how to live life and I blocked him.

He hit all of his developmental mile stones as a baby with no health issues. He does very well at school. He lacks in social interactions, we will take him to the park and so many children come up to him wanting to play and he just turns away and does his own thing. This is fine but I also notice he has a lot of anxiety wanting to play with other kids at the same time. He has had behavioral issues since he was 3, which have gotten significantly better as he has gotten older, but he will just go into a tantrum over something very small. His most recent one was he asked he if I would keep up with his calendar for him. I told him we could do it together and his father and I would help him keep up with it. He lost it full on tantrum on the ground yelling. He used to go to therapy for his anger outburst (which his father also has and is medicated for) I am working to find him another therapist as his old one is booked up. We try really hard to do gentle parenting as we both had abusive homes growing up, but we are not consistent with punishment. We sent him to his room a few weeks ago and he came back out a few minutes later laughing saying he urinated in his pants ""because you sent me to my room and i couldn't leave to go to the bathroom"" it wasn't just a little urine either, his floor was soaked through his pants.  I love my son but I feel we would be doing a disservice to him if he is dealing with autism and we are not addressing his needs accordingly.  My mom works at the health department and told me there is a person there who does screenings. I booked an appointment and when I told my s.o and he was very upset. It actually caused a huge fight. He basically called me a bad mother for thinking there is something wrong with my child rather than self evaluating myself first. He is concerned about labeling theory and having the autism label on him for the rest of his life. My s.o told me I should get myself tested instead and I am not opposed to the idea. I the 90s they didn't really screen kids at my school for these things, it would explain my social anxiety and inability to connect emotionally to people. My s.o is looking at this as a bad thing, like autism is a dirty word but I don't see it that way at all.

When we got home after my birthday dinner, my friends asked if I wanted to play party games together on Discord to celebrate my birthday. I agreed since it sounded like fun, and it surprised me that my new friends wanted to celebrate my birthday.

My girlfriend joined in the call first and started drawing while we were playing games. She doesn't like playing the games that I usually play, so she sat out most of the time and joined in when we did drawing/guessing games. However, I could tell that she was getting frustrated because she couldn't guess the drawings and told me that the drawings sucked.

I was having a really good time, and I felt like my birthday couldn't have been more perfect. But I had to get off since I had work the next day starting at 8am and it was already 3am. My girlfriend typically wants us to shower together, and we've had arguments spark from me showering first, so I asked her if she wanted to join me in the shower, and she told me to go shower first. So I ended up doing so.

When I got out of the shower, her face was covered in tears. So I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that she had been feeling lonely and she didn't have fun during the Discord celebration.  She also told me that she wished that I had spent the rest of the night with her since we were with family for most of the day. I understood since I felt like we hadn't really spent a lot of time together since I got my new job. But I asked her to be more direct going forward and told her to tell me what she wanted and needed. 

She got really upset whenever I told her to be more direct, and she told me that she didn't want to always tell her partner her needs. I told her that I wasn't a mind reader and I didn't want to always be on my toes around her, so I would appreciate it if she was direct and not be passive aggressive when telling me one thing when she really wanted the other (like telling me to go shower first).

I recently got her to go to therapy, and I asked her to talk to her therapist about this interaction, and she didn't take that too well. And we argued about this until 5am, when I decided to just go to sleep after she told me to go to sleep and that she wanted to sleep in the other room. This morning I woke up to a long text about her sleeping alone, how I don't sympathize with her, and how she was gonna block me. 

I notice huge signs of codependency in our relationship, and that's why I've been consciously taking showers, eating, and sleeping, and trying not to feel bad about doing those things without her.

My tech expertise starts when the PC is on and has a VSCode window open, not when it's in pieces or not working. 

My cousin wanted to transition to PC gaming, but this guy is a dunce with computers like me. He bought all his parts for well over 1000$ and when it was time to build the computer, he asked me to do it saying that he was afraid that he would mess something up and offered to pay me 50 bucks to get it done. I told him that I didn't know shit and he was like, 'didn't you learn anything in uni, I'm sure you got this bro'. At that point I thought I gave him a fair enough warning and took the money and got started. I looked up a brief tutorial on youtube and got to work, and before long I managed to put everything together smoothly enough. The computer booted and I test ran some video games on it before giving it back to him.

About 3 months later this guy comes to me and asks me why his PC stopped working and gave it to me. I didn't have the first clue as to why, so I asked my friend who actually knows how to build PC's what was wrong and when he took a look at it, he laughed out loud and said it was a miracle it lasted 3 months. He said that I had committed every sin under the sun in PC building and that I basically gave him a ticking firebomb. He half jokingly said that if I had any morals, I would tell my cousin my fuck up and repay him the money for the damaged parts.

I feel bad because this guy lost around 800 dollars worth of parts and he believed in me.

For those curious as to my mistakes according to my friend:

The RAM sticks were put right next to each other and they were different brands.

The cable management was bad and he described it as a rat's nest.

The case itself was bad for airflow and there was a lot of dust.

The CPU wasn't mounted properly and the thermal paste layer that came on the cooler wasn't making proper contact. The CPU was basically running naked for 3 months.

A couple of CPU pins were bent, and I put my bare hands on them.

There were no top fans, no side fans. He never gave them to me.

As you can imagine, now that we are together I've met pretty much all of his friends and all of his family that are in the country. 

However, sometimes when my BF tells me his friends (all a bit older than us as they're friends he's met through work so in their early to mid 30s) I decline. This is not me intentionally being a bitch, this is because I don't like the way his bosses niece acts towards my BF.

Let me be clear, I'm not jealous of her. She's a bit younger (18 almost I think) so I don't think this little girl is going to ""take my man"" so to say. However, that, in my opinion, doesn't excuse the way she acts around him.

She's always trying to touch and hug him and be alone with him. She's also taken loads of pictures of him, not WITH him, OF him. (Not at his request). So the reason I don't go is so that I don't see this behaviour and so it doesn't make me feel upset or uncomfortable.

I've brought this up to my BF and he at first said it wasn't as sinister as I was making it sound. Later he agreed to set some boundaries which appear to just be him making sure he isn't alone with her and not speaking to her directly. I appreciate the effort but its HER thats making me uncomfortable, not him.

Half an hour later, the new pairings are released and I am with someone else but not the person I was promised at the beginning. I then told her “I want to retire”, she then says “No you can't.. I have to adjust the pairs again”, then I reply “Then adjust it like you adjusted our agreement. Good luck being a facilitator head, next time don’t make promises you can’t keep”.  

At this point, I backed out of principle rather than not being set up. I felt like the trust has eroded and the working and even personal relationship can no longer continue.

S asked me out about 6 months ago, and I politely declined, and told him I just wanted to be friends. He was ok with this and we remained friends and now live together (along with other friends). 

Recently, I confessed to N that I had feelings for him and he said he felt the same but never made a move he because of S. N and I hung out romantically for about a week before N went and talked to S about if he was cool with him dating me. We had agreed that N would talk to S about it, but I didn’t feel it was necessary for me to talk to him, since it was a “bro” thing between them. 

When N told S we had been seeing each other and wanted to date officially, S was extremely pissed and hurt that we had started seeing each other before telling him first. I can understand why he’s mad at N, because there is a history of S liking girls and them rejecting him and then being into N. 

I also think N should have went to S before we started seeing each other, but he gets very anxious about conflict and I know he didn’t  have malicious intentions about it, but I do think he handled it poorly. 

But my problem is S is also mad at me and giving me the silent treatment because he said I should have talked to him first and I was “sneaky” and a snake for dating N behind his back. 

I’m confused by this because I never felt like it was my obligation to check with him before seeing N. The only reason I didn’t talk to him about it sooner was because N said he wanted to be the one to approach him about it, so I didn’t say anything so he would have the chance to bring it up first. 

Is it wrong for me to have not gone to S before I started seeing N? Again, I understand why he’s upset with N, because of “bro code” (his words not mine”, but I feel badly for not checking his comfort level first. 

S also said he can’t be friends with N and I anymore if we date because he wouldn’t be able to “separate our relationship from what we did to him”.

J threw a birthday party at the start of the pandemic.  Four months in, not a lot of info back then, lots of fear. My husband is a cancer survivor (stage 4, spread to lungs)  We go to the party anyway. Js sister was there, we refused to hug. We left shortly bc the place was filling up. 

I after asked days later how the party was. Radio silence. I keep trying. Eventually she tells me I was “over the top rude” to her sister &amp; I needed to apologize. I took it seriously, messaged the sister to apologize.  I let J know I was sorry for offending her sister and told her I apologized. I said we should sort this out bc I don’t want animosity between us. She agreed and I went to her house to talk. 

I told her she has been dogging me for months. Holding me to standards she doesn’t hold others to, instructing me on my actions &amp; words, talking mean stuff to me to others, overall acting like I’m the biggest jerk around. 

She eviscerates me. Says all this stuff she’s been harboring. “You are a cunt. I always have to apologize to people over you. Why do you think your cousins never call you to hang out? Your aunt is such a bitch. Your mother is crazy. I don’t understand what happened in the house you grew up in.” etc  It was really sad. I’d never seen someone attack like she did. She left no stone unturned. 

I said,if you really think these things about me, I had no idea. If I’m such a bad person, thanks for being honest. She ended our time by telling me she didn’t want to be friends anymore. I told her I loved her anyway. Sobbed in the car. Blocked her number.

I used to be very cheerful and light hearted but now i m completely opposite. 
Now she also started body shaming me and started comparing me to others evary time we spoke.I always used to fight back but somewhere constantly hearing that made me insecure and i started hating myself.

My depression affected my studies which led to bad result in my high school , i didn't held any rank and she went bonkers with constant taunts.I stopped eating with them as while eating the portion was always an issue.Whenever there is an argument my brother and father also do not talk to me as they fear her and i do not get food. I have to cook it my self and don't even have access to enough items. And nobody cares weather i eat or not.
I was done with life but i stopped for my brother whom i love the most.
My father is a very simple and innocent man but he never defens me as he is bound to be on my mother's side because she always plays the victim and emotionally blackmails everyone. If sometime he doesn't scold me coz i am 100% right that time than she gives him a silet treatment and doesn't do any work and doesn't eat. She also doesn't leaves a chance to brainwash him against me.He does that for the peace of house but it does hurts.
I somehow overcame my depression and Now i am a university student i didn't moved out for studies because my hometown has a Global University and i luckily got in that and i didn't wanted to waste my father's money just to get away and study at a normal clg which is of less profit.
I am a mathematics major and my mother wanted me to change my major to CS and do what many people were doing to which i denied as i was not confident about it which again triggered her to that i do not listen to her.
She thinks that if i m in my room , i am wasting my time and in order to do something i need to get out of my room and attend university even when there are no classes. I am an introvert and do not have friends except few and they have moved to other cities according to their major and she can't accept this either. She thinks that i am the only one who doesn't like people in this whole world and it is unacceptable.

I am so done and thanks to her my depression and anxiety are back and i can't sleep at night.

My mom is homeless and on drugs in mine and I need distance from that. When I left her, I lived in a tent, and eventually saved money working on a farm and moved out of state. Mom has been trying to get money from me, but she's incapable of spending it wisely. 

My g-pa remarried back in the 70s, and doesn’t want much to do with his bio-g-kids (me, big sis, and twin cousins). He hasn't rang in a year. They moved an hr+ away to be close to step-gma's kids and grandkids. This doesn't phase me.

My aunt AJ, a widow, tried to help me when I got here, bc none of the other fam reached out, and she needed help with my cousins. AJ and I had a good setup: I helped her kids like a live-in nanny (cooking, cleaning, laundry, homework) so that she could go to work, and wouldn't lose the home my uncle bought before he died. 

To cut this part of the story short, in Jan. of this yr, she came home from work and kicked me out at 1 am, out of the blue, stating that she, ""couldn't teach me to care about other people."" She's apologized, but I don't trust her anymore. 

My dad isnt around, so I didn't really have any other family I could ask to help me out of my pickle.

After 8 months of sleeping on busses and working odd jobs, I am in a better place, thanks to a family friend (L) that dated my mom in high school, and his 87 y.o. mother who he takes care of, as she has lots of health problems. I feel much better w/ ppl who rlly care for me, than I do with my biofam. L is like a dad to me. 

L invited me to all of his family holiday dinners when I moved in, and I accepted. 

I was also invited to a Thxgiving dinner at my g-pa's stepdaughter's house. It's gonna be big, and include a lot of my biological relatives. AJ first invited me in late October. AJ kept pressuring me for an answer, and made it clear she won't take anything other than ""yes"" from me. My mom won't be there (duh) but the mental illness that affects my family is omnipresent. 

I don't want to go, and after being asked yet again, I said that. I did say it in a rude way, something like, ""why would I turn down the family that actually loves me for you people?""

My aunt was p.o.'d, but I can't pretend that our family is normal, when it's clearly not. I'd rather spend Thxgiving with ppl that care about me. As a kid, I was alone for the holidays. My fam mailed Xmas pics with the fam sans me. For 14 yrs. And for the first time since being a kid, I'd rather be completely alone than with relatives. 

I tried explaining myself afterwards when I saw I'd hurt her, but she wasn't hearing it. I tried to explain why, but she called me selfish, insensitive, and said I lacked empathy.

Maybe I do, but I'd much rather be a sociopath with a good holiday season, than an empath with another shitty one. L even said I didn't have to go to his dinner if it was gonna cause an issue, but that's the only one I wanna go to.

We have an international vacation date quickly approaching so a lot to get get done.

Yesterday I noticed a huge rip in the butt of my jeans (the best spot lol) and while my gf was heading out last night to Target for errands, I asked gf if she could pick me up jeans since I was working late. She said, *""No problem""* and I gave her my size.

She then paused before leaving to asked if I wanted those in slim-fit. I told her, *""No thanks. Slim-fit is too tight around my thighs and butt.""* She said, *""Slim-fit is just a style, not a fit.""* I responded, *""I don't think so. I've had them before and they don't fit me at the weight Im at right now.""* She argued, *""Slim-fit just tapers off and gets narrow down the pants.""* I retorted, *""Exactly, it gets narrow, which changes the size, which changes the fit. Just get me regular jeans please.""* We went back and forth a little longer and she finally said *""Okay""* and left.

I am *very* insecure about the weight Im at right now and communicate that. As a dude, it's one thing to be short and overweight, it's another to be short, overweight, and slightly-pear shaped. Finding jeans is absolute hell. So when gf got home bring not just a pair of slim-fit, but skinny-fit as well, I was very upset.

I said, *""thank you very much""*, gave her a hug, and went back to work. *""Well aren't you going to try them on?""*, she asked. I told her not right now. Truthfully I didn't want her to see me pathetically attempt to wear them. And for some reason she just persisted. Maybe to prove me wrong? I caved and sure enough, in front of her, struggled like a fat loser to get the jeans around my thighs and butt. I forced them up and - the waist was no problem, exactly as I asked - but the jeans were uncomfortably tight around my thighs and rear. And it was obvious to the point that **now** she had nothing to say other than, ""Well it's all Target had.""

Expressed in my attitude and voice was just genuine ungratefulness. Not only did she specifically get me something I asked her not to, and bug me to put these unflattering jeans on, now I have to waste my time returning them.

We previously made about the same salary, but he recently got a promotion where he'll be making almost 30k more than me. I assumed that since our incomes and budgets are different, we would pay different rents instead of splitting it 50/50.

I didn't plan for the conversation, so when I mentioned it, I said something along the lines of assuming we should pay different rents since we make different amounts and have different budgets. From his reaction, he took the comment as me making the financial decision for him. He had never heard of splitting rents by different income and was strongly against the idea of anything other than 50/50. 

CONTEXT: We are not married and have not lived together before. I currently live with roommates and he lives alone. I have a stressful relationship with money, having grown up in a house where money was tight and am currently paying off my student loans. He grew up in an affluent household and hasn't had a stressful relationship with money. Although this isn't a reason for why we should split by income, it informs me of how our reactions to this idea were quite different. 

I am willing to spend equal amounts on rent if we find a place within my budget (e.g. if I can spend up to 1200, I would be fine splitting a place that was 2400 total). But, I have looked and rent is quite expensive and out-of-my-budget for us to split equally. He also has amenities he wants (like a washer/dryer in unit) that drive up the price of rent, where I would be OK without this amenity. I feel like I have to make argument points that explain why rent-splitting by income is fair.  Simply, we don't make the same amount of money. He recently got the promotion and it hasn't set in yet, so maybe it felt like I was taking advantage of the promotion. That wasn't my intention, and we have plenty of months before moving in where he will be making his new salary. If I was in the position where he was laid off, or I began to make more money, I would pay more to help us make ends meet. 

Rent is the biggest spend item for me, and I'm not even asking to split bills or groceries based on our income. If we split based on income and our budgets, we would have more flexibility in places we can live in. I'm not sure how I said it that evoked such a strong reaction but I can't help to feel like this idea is equitable and a reasonable ask.

My mom could never cook. She was also very overbearing when it came to the holidays, birthdays etc. Everything had to be done the way she wanted them done. Always on her timeline. Even rushing my kids birthday parties when they were growing up because ""she wanted to get home.""

For the past nearly 20 years, I have done all of the cooking for Thanksgiving and Xmas. My mom always insisted on thanksgiving dinner being served EARLY... as in she wanted to be ready to eat by noon. Which meant I had to be up at 4 am to get everything prepped and start cooking.  For Christmas, she insisted on a Christmas breakfast, rather than dinner. Again, meaning I had to get up 4 am to start cooking and by the time everything was cooked and cleaned up (I always have to do all of the cleanup, too) I couldnt have had a Christmas dinner if I wanted one. I always had to do a separate Christmas party at an earlier or later date. Ive never been able to go out and enjoy the night before Thanksgiving or Christmas eve, even after my kids were grown. 

My mom passed away earlier this year after a brief illness. My dad passed away a little under 5 years ago so this will be the first holidays without both of my parents. I decided that I would like to, for the first time in 20 years, do the holidays on my terms. 

So I changed the timeline for thanksgiving. We are going to eat at 4 pm so I dont have to spend all of wednesday night prepping sides and dont have to get up at 4 am so maybe, for once, my partner and I can go to the ""Blackout Wednesday"" celebrations that all the local dives put on every year(Food, music, games... we dont drink to that excess).  And for Christmas, Im doing a proper Christmas dinner so I can actually do the Christmas eve volunteering that I do every year and not have to leave early and can enjoy a leisurely Christmas morning. 

My kids are fully on board with this. The rest of my family, not so much. Aunts, cousins, extended family are throwing a fit. They expected me to continue with ""tradition"" and now say that I am disrupting their other plans because they usually go visit other friends and family in the evenings. My aunt pleaded with me to change everything back to the morning because her grown daughters late baby daddies family always hosts in the evening. My cousins are complaining that they have to wait all day to eat and ""wont I think of the kids?"" My argument is that everyone, including me, has built their holiday schedule and 20 year ""tradition"" around the unreasonable demands of an overbearing woman who is no longer here to dictate the when and where. I got called a selfish AH and some of my family is threatening not to come. I do want my family there but I think after 20 years, I should be able to call the shots for once, especially when I foot the bill and do all the cooking.

He kept saying “it’s just a nosebleed, it’s just a nosebleed”. I said that maybe he gets them all the time, but it’s a really scary experience for me and I would have appreciated if he checked up on me. He blew up saying I was disturbing his sleep over nothing and started swearing and yelling at me saying he’s never good enough and I nag him all the time and I’m always escalating the situation. “ITS JUST A F’N nosebleed”. I can’t take it when people blow up/yell and I told him to calm down and talk to me respectfully. He wouldn’t until I yelled back telling him “STOP.” He says anyone would act like he would in this situation and that he can’t take it anymore. I said I just want someone who expresses genuine concern for me and didn’t just brush me off because they wanted to go back to sleep. He said a lot of mean things and I just kept saying “you are not a good or nice person.” I was just shocked he acted so angrily and was still blaming me for nagging him/always “having a problem with him. Maybe I should have just went back to sleep and ignored it/talked to him in the morning, but I didn’t like the way he treated me with anger and would follow up with this very shallow apology/then get angry again. I asked him to leave and he apologised before he left, but later on the phone told me “he can’t continue being treated this way” and that I “really need to change”.
