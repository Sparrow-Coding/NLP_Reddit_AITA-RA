The friend would always offer for me to borrow it, to the point of insisting.  Earlier this year I decided to borrow it for a short 4 day trip and quickly found it was a piece of junk.  Upon pickup the van had a handful of issues including doors not seated/locking properly, hinges broken off the doors, electronics not working, water heater not working, etc.

We set off on the 700 mile trip and during that time the drivers side door handle broke and would no longer open the door.  During a rain storm the windshield wiper arm completely broke off the mechanism, requiring a complete replacement of the wiper assembly.

**Initial Repairs**: Upon returning home, I replaced the drivers side door handle assembly with a new one and notified the owner of the wiper issues and that I could not fix it.

**Issue**: The van owner sent me hand written letter over 7 months later which included the invoice for the vans repairs totaling 800$. The owner is asking for me to compensate them for the repairs of the wiper assembly AND the drivers side door handle which I already replaced.

She seems to have issues with people coming into the family as evidenced by how cold she is with her stepmother/ half sisters. She is a very rigid thinker so once she decides you aren't family, there is nothing you can do. She also seems to struggle with change and nuance, so this has not been an easy transition at all. 

One huge issue is MIL thinking we are entitled for wanting her to treat me well. MIL claims she feels suffocated. Some examples are her never talking to me when we are in a group, excluding me from family pictures, not communicating to me about plans, trying to get her son alone, and refusing to show any consideration for my feelings or needs. She again claims we are entitled and that she would never ask us to do anything for her, so why should she be expected to be kind and welcoming to me.

She has said countless times that I'm not family, nothing to her, etc. Well last Thanksgiving we agreed to spend the holiday with MIL. We went to her husband's moms house and I was floored. Guess who had pictures of MIL on her mantle and greeted MIL just as enthusiastically as her son?

Then we sat down for dinner and I found out she had made MIL an  entire separate meal just because MIL doesn't like Thanksgiving food. She made her an entire lasagna with butternut squash, mushrooms, spinach, alfredo, and it looked amazing. To be fair MIL did say you didn't have to do this. Then it was time for dessert. MIL doesn't even dislike pie. She is just meh about it, so her MIL gave her a personalized slice of cake from a bakery. MIL even let her kiss her goodbye (this woman doesn't even let her own parents kiss her)

I was shocked and hurt. I confronted MIL and MIL again called me entitled. She said she didn't ask for any of those things and her MIL chose to do that. I said that isn't the point and it still makes MILs cold treatment of me even worse. I snapped and said we would never spend another holiday with MIL again and would only be going between my parents and FIL. My husband was hurt but said he fully understood. I was called an asshole and entitled by multiple other family members.

MIL's MIL (who I really don't know well) sent me a message about how I am being unfair. She said she doesn't treat MIL like that because she is her DIL, she just wants to. She said she is only civil with her son in law, and despised SFIL's first wife. She said I seem like a ""typical gen z"" with a lot of boundaries and I can't have it both ways. She said if MIL had boundaries she wouldn't bother being that close to her, and MIL could suck it up and eat turkey. 

Now I feel conflicted because today my husband mentioned how it would be our year to do Christmas with his mom, and he would have loved that, but now holidays have to be about petty fighting and he hates them now.

She had just had my grandson and she and her husband couldn't afford a down payment + mortage or anything like that. 

Our agreement is for her to pay me monthly over 15 years and there would be no fees for that. Part of our agreement is that the house will be in her name when she pays me in full and I will be able to use the guest room 2x a year (2-3 days) even if they are not home at that time. They agreed, because nowhere would they accept this deal without extremely high fees, plus the house was nice. All of this in a contract protecting both parties. 

It's always the same dates, my  aunt and mother's birthday and another annual event in the city that I love. 

The home has 4be/2ba. 

When visiting, I try not to disturb and not cause a mess, but it's not worth staying in a hotel, because it's expensive (tourist region) 

It's been five years and my daughter had my other two grandchildren (4M and 2F). 

I was recently talking to my daughter and I remembered that I would be staying at her house for 2 days for the city event. 

She seemed quiet and started saying that the boys wanted their own rooms and ended up giving the guest room to the oldest (6M), so there was no room for me and she thinks it's unfair to have to ask him to sleep on the mattress with his own ro. So I had the option of sleeping on the mattress or paying for the hotel. 

I asked if the bed was still the same as in the guest room. She said yes and when I asked if she would pay for my hotel she said no.

 Btw, I have a Lot of pain back and would end me sleeping on the mattress (she knows that).

 I was disappointed and said I thought it was disrespectful for her to even mention these options to me when we have our agreement.

 She started saying that it was her house and she could decide who would sleep where because of that. 

This bothered me and I reminded her that the house is still technically mine until she pays me the full amount and that our agreement was that I could use the guest room 2x a year and that my grandson is young, does not have back pain that would not get worse if he sleeps on the maitress.

She got angry saying that the reality is different now and she has 3 children, so I should understand her side that my request is not fair, considering that at the time she didn't have so many children and the reality is different now.

In my family, I (21F) has been asked frequently to help out with grammar and proofreading family member’s texts or assignments and I was happy to help. 
 However, recently one of my older sisters (28F) has accused me of rubbing my lack of knowledge on the topic of her course in face. To give some background on my sister, she’s married with 3 kids. She was unable to finish university because of her first pregnancy at 19. I was so happy for her when she decided she was gonna go back to school. Although I love my sister, I can’t deny that she is quite short tempered and can be very malicious when angered. Once when I was about 15, she called me a ‘selfish c*unt’ and disowned me because I admitted that I didn’t want to be sleeping over at her house and babysitting her children every single time I had a holiday. So admittedly having a conversation with her can feel like walking on eggshells. 

I had been proofreading and editing her assignments but things started getting weird when she essentially asked me to do one of her assignments for her (which included reading big pdfs related to sociology and social care work). I had explained to her that I couldn’t possibly do her assignment for her, especially by myself and she stopped talking to me for about 2 days before she came back to tell me that I had upset her. We made up and moved on.

Then she had gotten feedback on a presentation I had helped edit from her lecturer. The lecturer had criticised her for not really relating what she was talking about to her overall course and subject. My sister started asking for advice and as usual, I offered some tips on better sentence structure and probably cutting out some stuff since her lecturer said it was too ‘wordy’. She then asked about what to actually write down and I explained to her that I didn’t really know what exactly she could write since I knew nothing about her course. She began sending one word responses (which definitely meant she wasn’t happy) but didn’t say anything. It wasn’t until midnight that she sent me a text chastising me for ‘rubbing’ the fact that I didn’t know anything about her course into her face and then remarked that she only needed help. She ended the conversation claiming that she would just do her work herself and that I didn’t need to help her anymore.

This pissed me off because I would never do that. I had stayed up late helping her edit her 20 page assignments while trying to do my own uni work and cope with my mental health issues. I had even lent her money whenever she wanted to buy clothes from Boohoo or extra plane tickets. I sent her a massive text detailing my annoyance at her comment and the fact that she thought so little of me. She hasn’t responded at all and it’s been more than 2 weeks at this point.

We’ve been doing great so far in maintaining our sobriety. We knew the holidays were gonna be rough this year as alcohol has always been featured prominently in our celebrations. 

As we were making plans for the Thanksgiving with my family this year I knew from the start this was going to be an issue. They know that I quit drinking but treat it more like a joke, like I am being dramatic when I mention that I am recovering alcoholic. My mom even asked me to pick up the wine and beer as part of my shopping stating that just because I buy it doesn’t mean I have to drink it. 

After a discussion with my guy and my kids, 21 and 17, we decided to just do small Thanksgiving with the four of us as opposed to going to the huge family thanksgiving that the rest of my family put on. At first my family seemed supportive but we quickly learned that wasn’t the case.

My sisters blame my guy, saying things like he’s alienating me from my family and that is the reason we are not going. My mom has taken it a step further and accused me of keeping her from her grandchildren. I am a fairly private person and felt humiliated to find out they have been going on about my personal struggles with alcoholism to mutual friends and acquaintances. It even got back to my boss (small town) who pulled me aside to tell me my work offers free alcohol counseling. 

Now that the day has arrived I am feeling extremely guilty. My kids assure me that they prefer doing a smaller dinner with just us there but the rest of my family has completely froze me out.

I said that’s fine let’s go on the trip but I’m allowed to express my opinion. She said she had to get off the phone before she said something she would regret and hung up leaving my brother and me on the phone.  My brother said nothing so I said I was getting off the phone so he could call my sister and they could talk about what a bitch I am. Something I know they do because my sister has admitted to it.  Anytime I have an opinion that is different than theirs, I’m a bitch. 

My mom knows none of this as this was to be a surprise for her birthday.

A side note, I know my family thinks I’m devastated that I don’t have a daughter and my sister thinks I’m just being jealous because I don’t have a daughter.  I’m not.  My husband and I went through 7 rounds of IVF - 2 failed, 2 ended in miscarriages and 3 successful pregnancies. I feel so blessed to have my boys and that they are all healthy.  After going through what we went through to get pregnant, I couldn’t have cared less the gender of our kids.

She then asked me to hang a dart board for her, then to install her ring doorbell. Immediately when I woke up this morning she asked me to let the dog out and feed him (I did). Right after, I sat down to read my book and she then asks me to run downstairs to get a couple things.

Me and my girlfriend 31M 30F have been living together for 3 years now and we have recently been fighting a lot about chores. 

For context I will openly admit that she does more than me but I work 11 hours a day 5 days a week and an additional 2 shifts of 6-8 hours on both weekend days. 

She works 3x4 hour shifts per week. 

I have offered compromises of her working more and me losing my 2 weekend shifts (these are overtime shifts but without them we can’t afford to live) so I can contribute solely on those days but this was refused.

I do appreciate everything she does but on the end of a weekday working period I am absolutely exhausted by the time I have gotten home and had dinner that I just can’t function properly (important to note I wake up anywhere over night from 3-5 times) 

My girlfriend does the majority of the household chores during the day and does dinner generally ready for me up on my return from work.

Fridays I make sure her dinner is ready for her as she works late and it I always ready on the table for the second she walks through the door. 

I do appreciate everything she does and I feel like I have offered a compromise to the current situation we are in which would actually work better for me because I absolutely hate working 7 days a week (I am a contractor so I don’t even get paid holidays if I don’t work I just don’t get paid) 

I want to try and get to grips with this as soon as possible because it has led to plenty of fights and I don’t want it to get any worse I just don’t know what to do.

I, then 21F, had been best friends with M, 22F, for 8y. M’s very kind but not one to stand her ground or take sides. In the past this has made me upset, as we used to share a friend group. I got left out progressively and M never let me know why. I was still friends with most of the ppl on the group and hung out individually, but got left out when there was parties. I’ve asked multiple times where the issue lies but M says she wants to be out of it.

2y ago M threw a bday party at a boat for 25 ppl. My brother, then M20 (P) was the captain as a coincidence, his summer job.

P lived alone at my dad’s (D) house. D spends most of the year hours away so P was left to live at the house. After my parents divorced, the house had gone shit: D doesn’t take care of it (alcoholic). Personally the house felt like a sad remain of our happy family life. I was embarresed to visit it with friends as either P or D was drunk and it looked like hell. 
P threw a lot of parties &amp; these gatherings involved drugs. P also had friends staying at the house against D’s rules. The neighbours kept calling D warning they’ll call the cops &amp; threathened to beat P with a bat etc. Multiple times I’d been called to go to the house to shut down parties to prevent involving cops.

M knew about this issue. We had a good time at M’s party but I left before going to clubs and went home. A few hours later I checked my phone and saw M had called once and texted if I’m home, and a friend who doesn’t know M or P had texted me asking if she can join to the party thrown at my parents. 

I was livid and drove to the house. They played music so loud the house was literally shaking. 40-50 guests. Some were from the boat, some didn’t know M at all (like my friend).

It turned out P had offered to host a party and the group had agreed. M had thought this was a bad idea but felt pressured. She tried to call me (multiple times she says) but I didn’t answer to the 1 phone call that got through. She didn’t call my bf who she knew i was with. P and the other people in the group aren’t good friends.

When the guests saw me it was clear they didn’t expect I was coming nor wanted me there. M told me she knew I’d be mad. Soon guests started to leave in groups. 1 friend came up to me apologized; she didn’t know how bad the shape of the house was.

After M left I started to cry about how it felt awful no one made sure I’m OK with this, how there was a sense of hiding this, how they leave me out claiming they want to party with ”inner circle”, but suddenly invite ppl to my house. I told them NOT to tell M I’m sad as it’s still her bday, I don’t want to ruin it. 

Later M said she’s sorry and knew I’d get mad, but had no control over this. I claim that since it was her bday everyone would’ve listened if she would’ve said no.

We were off and on until our senior year where we finally broke up for good. 

Since this breakup, my mom and ex have developed a friendship. My mom says that she was more so trying to help her, since my ex didn’t exactly have the best home life with her parents. Initially I believed my mom and never thought much of this friend ship other than thinking it weird that my mom was still friends with my ex girlfriend. It’s been years since this has been going on, and I’ve butted heads with my mom over multiple times. More recently, my parents have divorced, and now my mom has befriended and stated to spend a lot of time with the mom of my ex girlfriend. As a result, my mom now spends a lot more time with said ex as well. She even spent a week with them in Vegas the week before my birthday without even telling me. I only found out after my roommate asked me about pictures she was tagged in on facebook. 

Last night my mom and I were butting heads about this friendship again. I was telling her that her friendship with my ex specifically, not so much her mom, doesn’t sit right with me. See continued having this conversation we’ll into the morning and my mom finally ended by saying “I’m tired, I guess I’m just going to have to tell *insert ex’s moms named here* that we can’t be friends anymore.” And left it at that. 

I love my mom, and I wouldn’t ever ask her to sacrifice her happiness, but I’m loosing my mind seeing my mom hang out with her, even after we broke up so long ago.

The older 3 live with me. The younger 2 live with their dad. I first met my boyfriend (34 M, I'll call him Raymond) several years ago when we both lived in Georgia. We were roommates at the time. The relationship I was in at the time was abusive, and I had to move out of state to get help. Since moving, I have a couple more bad relationships, where the guys just used me or abused me.   


I get my life together: got a decent job, built up savings, bought a starter home. I reach out to Raymond and show him I can provide him stability. I wanted this man specifically because I saw him to be nice and hardworking, and it was easy for others to take advantage of him. I felt if I could show him a good relationship and throw my all into making him happy, he would want to do the same for me and we could have something good. At this point, he is working at a store 2 of his friends own. He worked long hours and told me he brought home around $1,300 - $1,500 a month. I show him job postings for entry level jobs that pay considerably more than what he was making, and he started to get interested.  


Before letting him move up here, I made it clear that I wanted him to contribute financially. I average out all household bills (mortgage, electricity, gas, water, and internet) for the last 6 months and it came out to roughly $1,160. I asked him to pay half of this to me every month ($580) and he agreed. When he finally made it here, he was very disappointed in what I had to offer him. He previously rented a room for $500 from one of the co-owners of the store he worked at, and lived in a high-end neighborhood with shopping within walking distance. I live in a low income neighborhood where you have to drive 15 minutes or more to get to any decent shops. I apologize, and assure him this is just a starter home, and he can work together and buy something nicer later.  


Now Raymond is making comments that the $580 I'm asking for is unfair because there are 5 people (including my 3 children) living in the house, so he should only pay 1/5 of household bills, unless I give him 50% ownership in my home. If I don't, he'll be paying me thousands of dollars for a house he'll never own. I remind him that anywhere he rents, he'll pay thousands for a place he'll never own, and his response is that he would at least have the whole place to himself, where with me, he only has access to the bedroom because the living room is dedicated to my home office and space for my youngest 2 when I have them on weekends.   


Right now, he isn't paying anything for rent. I gave him the freedom to explore different careers without needing to worry about paying and he's built up some student debt doing so. Right now he's just doing gig type jobs while exploring what he wants to do for a career. I told him to focus on getting something stable, and paying down his existing debt, but I still insist on him paying me $580 once he finds something.

Both of them were friends before being roomates, with one of them being the daughter of the landlord. About 3 months ago, they bought a speaker together, which they use everyday, normally like 5-7 hours a day. It wouldn't bother me if they used it at moderate levels, or if they used it in their room, or if they just used it sometimes, but they use it loud on the living room, which is in front of my room, and the walls are thin af.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever it's past 11PM (I have to wake up at 6AM) I have to go to the living room and ask them to turn it down so I can sleep. They always just lower it a little and if I tell them to lower it a little bit more, because it is still to loud, I get a weird look and then they lower it a little bit more. I even bought a pair of earplugs to avoid bothering them but even with that I still hear their music and them singing along with it, and pots and pans if they decided to cook late at night too, which is often.

&amp;#x200B;

But the other day, I was triyng to watch a video while eating (the living room and the kitchen are integrated together) and they put their speaker on. So I asked, hey, can I turn this down? I have my phone at maximum volume and can't hear anything. ""Yeah, sure."". So I lower it down, just enough so I can hear what's on my phone, but still enough to make the table shake a little, and one girl says: hey, but now it's too low! So I tell them that otherwise I can't hear my phone, so she goes, yeah, but don't you have headphones or something you can use? To which I tell I do, but I'm not going to use them just to watch a video while eating, to which I get an angry look. The days after this happened, they have been louder, and the daughter of the landlord doesn't greet me anymore when they see me or ignores me when talking to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of hearing their music every single day, I want to be able to use the living room too but I can't even watch something with the level of noise they make. I have even tried to put music myself (twice) thinking that hey, if I have music at moderate levels in my laptop here, they wouldn't put their speaker on right here, right? But they just go right there and put their speaker on, super loud, right there, drowning my music. The first time I got kind of embarrased (I'm shy as hell) and leaved to my room, the second I just stayed right there, after like 30min they went to their room with their speaker.

Wasn't my room so I didn't feel it was my responsibility to come back to work after I had already come home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday (Wednesday), a receptionist called us down at the start of our shift saying that a room wants an extra sheet on their bed. We did not assume this was essential and to be done straight away since she did not indicate as such, so we decided to do it whenever we got to that room (we go through the hotel in a specific pattern). My coworker was quite sick so we had been given permission from a supervisor for her and I to work together for the night. We were also told that a specific room needs a romantic turn down (swans made of towels and rose petals) at 8pm. Anyways, we did the rooms together, finished my rooms and started coworkers rooms. We were right outside the room that wanted the sheet (it was about 7.55) and I was about to do it until reception called my coworker down. Apparently the room that didn't get serviced the night before complained because they wanted service again (even though we do service from 6-9pm, so they were going to get it anyways)

&amp;#x200B;

Coworker ran down to the room, apologized profusely and they were fine. She did the room, then reception rang her again saying the other room (the one that wanted a sheet) were seething that they weren't serviced. At this point, I had ran to go get the swans done. Third coworker was not looking at the group chat- she never does. Room gets serviced, we go and finish the rest of the rooms. Receptionist came to us after and talked to us about what happened, we explained and she understood that there was a miscommunication in the hotel - that if a room wants service straight away, our managers need to tell us.

Anyways, I woke up today to the accommodation manager calling us out in the work groupchat. She posted pictures of the complaints, also name dropping us (which unfortunately managers tend to do this at my workplace and yes, it's really embarrassing since she could've asked us privately) I wanted to quit anyways since I was not given less work hours when I asked (and I NEED to focus on college) but now adding that to the newfound dread I have coming in tonight, I don't know what to do.

Can I post this here if I censor? It's kind of important.... TW: discussion of m\*rder.

We were on the topic of f\*micide. I had just brought it up in relation to a tweet I saw, then stated that most female h\*micides are due to their partner &amp; the red flags one might experience, and the first thing he said was, ""Well, some women are crazy, and you have to wonder what they did to push someone to that point. They \[the man\] could have been a normal person but then were pushed to it.""

I said that's a fucked up thing to say. He got defensive and said it isn't right, but there are factors that can play into it, then something about how movie villains have a character arc and people who push him to what he does, and I said we were talking about real people not movies. He kept saying he was just adding to the conversation and I kept saying it disturbed me how that was the first place his mind went to. Whenever I said it was a fucked up thing to say, he immediately fired back with ""no it's not."" I said they can happen, sure, but it's not the first place my mind goes to when I think about this.

He left and said ""fuck you"" to me, that I was being an asshole to him and my reaction was not reasonable. To be clear, I was chopping vegetables and didn't even look at him when he said half the things he did, I did not raise my voice, I just kept stating I thought it was disturbing.

A few minutes later, he came back over to me with an article that said something like it was investigating the aggressions that lead to f\*micide. I wasn't given the outcome of the study. I reiterated that I never said there aren't situations in which women are abusive to men, I just was disturbed he said that first. He said if someone is being t\*rtured for years, it could push another human to the brink. I have consumed far too much true crime for my own good, so I brought up Gypsy Blanchard. I am well-aware that there are nuances to crimes. Based on most cases I've seen of f\*micide, though, it is almost always evil, like the case of Chris Watts.

He asked if I'd react the same if the genders were reversed and I said absolutely, bringing up the case of Jodi Arias. M\*rdering another person in general is never okay, we don't need to sympathize with them in most cases.

To be clear, he said he was never saying it was okay, just ""adding to the conversation"" and his mind goes to ""dark places first."" He feels he can't talk to me about anything because I get ""pissy."" I don't believe that's true, but in this case, yeah, I thought what he said was not cool. It was giving ""she was asking for it because of what she was wearing,"" which he staunchly denied as well.

**TLDR: boyfriend quickly brought up how some women can push men to m\*rder them in the context of f\*micide and what leads to it, I said it was fucked up his mind went there first, and he said my reaction was unreasonable, even though I didn't raise my voice.

Thanksgiving is supposed to be our holiday with my husband's family. MIL does not like this and wants Christmas. As a result she usually treats us kind of shitty on Thanksgiving to begin with, but last year was a mess. 

Note I always offer to help with the cooking or bring a dish, and she always turns me down. so last year we arrived, she did her typical routine of ignoring us, and then she served all the traditional sides, this dry ass turkey, and she sat down with some meatballs that were just for her.

Everyone asked why she was eating meatballs and she said it is her house. Her husband whined because he wanted some, but she said they were leftovers and there wasn't enough for him. She said turkey is stupid anyway.

No one liked the turkey so SFIL decided to grill some steak. He also made a turkey burger for his mom, but said that he wasn't cooking for anyone else because he isn't our ""slave"", so at this point MIL, SFIL, and his mom have different food, and me, my kids, my husband, SFIL's stepfather, and MIL's parents have this shit turkey.

I felt humiliated and said I was leaving. MIL just rolled her eyes. I got some grief from MIL's parents about how Thanksgiving isn't about the food, but I snapped at them that my kids weren't going to be treated like shit. We left and went to a buffet. It wasn't great and the whole day was a let down.

I set a boundary that I would never spend another Thanksgiving with her. She made us feel like second class citizens and she clearly can't cook turkey.

In comes my Step daughter (9yo) singing and acting daft like she does, when I turned to her and said ‘right you, do one in the other room’ (this was said as a joke and I smiled at her when I said it). Her reply was ‘what I thought you liked my singing’ then off she went into the other room. 

As I went to carry on talking to my partner I realised she’d got the the hump a bit so I asked what was wrong? She said I could of spoken to her daughter better, to which I replied I was joking with her. My partner then said she knew that but thought her daughter had taken me seriously. 

Knowing I was joking I got mad and said it was a joke and stormed off. However me and my partner hadn’t spoken for a couple of days because of this. 

Just to be sure I decided to ask my step daughter if she’d taken what I said seriously, at first she didn’t even remember the situation. I reminded her about it and she said no she knew I was joking and she knows when I’m being grumpy or serious. 

Me and my partner then had an argument about it and I told her I don’t know what the issue is I was joking, I knew i was, my partner knew I was and my step daughter knew. 

Now she’s saying well I shouldn’t of stormed off and should of spoken to her about it and that I need to take responsibility for it. But I feel I had every right to storm off as I’d not done anything wrong in the first place and didn’t agree with her telling me id spoken to her daughter in the wrong way over a joke.

We went on for a few arguments and I said that even if I meant it, wouldn't it be a fair request to make from my side most especially as a joke? we dismissed it and I thought it was the end.

Just an hour ago, this story was brought up again. I thought she would just let the whole thing go, but now she's saying that it was not a good answer.

He was not functional at all and he never had a job. My mother worked 2 jobs in order to care for my brother and I. He would steal money from her and leave for days to do drugs. When I was 3, my mom finally took me and my brother and the three of us went to live with my grandparents who helped raise us so my mom could work. My mother put herself through nursing school by working multiple jobs so she could give my brother and I a better life. I can honestly say that I don’t harbor any resentment towards my father. My mother never talked bad about my dad and if I asked why he never came to visit us or went years without calling, she just simply told me that he was sick and was at a place getting better. Once I got older, I learned this ‘place’ was prison. My dad never paid child support, he never sent us birthday cards and would only call if he wasn’t in jail. Things were hard for my mother but I never knew just how hard she had it until I got older. 

I am 32 years old and my dad is STILL doing the same old shit. He has diabetes now and neglected to care for himself properly and unfortunately he had to have his leg amputated because of this. My grandmother passed away and left him a lot of money so he was able to go to a rehabilitation place where he now lives.

My parents are divorced now but this year for thanksgiving they are both coming to our house to see my five kids whose ages range from 1-12. My mother visits multiple times a week but my dad hasn’t seen them in over a year. Last time I had him at my house for a few days, he drank the whole entire time, he barely showered so he smelled gross, and he smokes constantly so he always smelled like smoke. He got so drunk he pissed on the front seat of my car AND on my fucking couch where my children sit! I was so pissed but I did not say anything because I do feel bad for him to see him in such a bad state. We threw the couch away and bought another one. My mother just texted me and said my dad is trying to make her stop for beer on the way over and I said hell no! Am I wrong for this? Obviously he is a grown adult and can drink if he wants to but I do not want him pissing on my couch again. My husband and I do not drink because I struggled with addiction many years ago. My dad was the one who actually introduced me to the drug I became addicted to. I’ve been clean for a long time and I never have cravings so that’s not even the reason I don’t want him drinking.

I grew up studying in Japan, and I’ve seen the kind of sexist messages and inappropriate drawings those books can contain.

My daughter got very upset with me and has now stopped drawing in general. I asked her why she’s stopped drawing, and she told me she just doesn’t feel like it anymore. I offered to get her back with her private art tutor and reminded her how beautiful her art is, but she just shrugged me off and said shes not interested and wants to learn to draw manga. I reminded her how dangerous those books can be and am only trying to protect her from that material. She got very quiet and went to her room.

While they will be making some food, the whole family is bringing side dishes, appetizers, desserts, drinks, etc…. They had never hosted an holiday gathering before and were excited to have everyone over. Everything is going smoothly. 

Fast forward to Tuesday at 8:30pm. My brother sends myself, sister and brother a text indicating that their house is not healthy. Their daughter has the flu, their son was ‘starting to take a turn’ and he and his wife have been coughing.  He then asks if they can postpone Thanksgiving dinner to Friday or Saturday to give them a chance to recover. He said that they would still like to host so if keeping it on Thursday is that important to everyone they will make it work. Then he says that he will see how the kiddos at in the morning, but “it isn’t looking good”.  

My siblings and I have jammed packed weekends ourselves  (visiting other family (in-laws), friends, getting Christmas trees, decorating, etc).  So we start texting him back questions immediately (how sick are you guys?, which day were you thinking of postponing?) to figure out how we can re-arrange our schedules to make it work and to come up with alternate plans for our families on Thanksgiving day if they decide to postpone. He completely ghosted us.

The Wednesday morning I send another text asking how everyone is feeling and are you postponing?  I got nothing. I sent another text letting him know that it is OK if they want to cancel, the main thing is that they get healthy and we keeps our kids healthy. Still nothing.

So my sister and I collaborate and decide get an alternate plan started.  We find a pre-cooked turkey (which could be frozen if need be) and buy food to make on Thanksgiving so we don’t have to eat hot dogs because we waited too long for a response from my  brother.  We went into action because we knew that as the day went on it would be harder to find a turkey.  We fully expected to cook for our families on Thanksgiving Day and repeat the same dinner at my brother’s the next day or two if necessary.

We finally get a text about 3 hours later indicating that they spent a lot of effort and money into hosting and they are still having it. If we are worried about getting sick, don’t come. (Still no indication of they decided to postpone).  

Then he picked up a phone and told me and my sister how dare we go behind his back and plan our own thing. He called us both offensive, rude and selfish.  We both told him that we were still planned to come over if postponed and bringing what we were suppose to bring. But we wanted to ensure that our own families had a Thanksgiving dinner on Thanksgiving Day.  We were totally prepared to eat the same dinner 2 days in a row.  Didn’t matter - we were still offensive and selfish people.

During that time, I had a female homeroom teacher who I did not like. In the first lesson when we were doing introductions, she asked all the boys if they had girlfriends and the girls vice versa. I found that weird already.

The incident that I remeber vividly years later came a few months after that. I had torn off one of the buttons from my school blazer, so I went to ask that teacher for a new button. She gave it to me and told me to sew it on myself. I thought ""Sure, it's important to be self sufficient."" But then she added ""So you'll make a good housewife some day."" I was too stunned to react. I thought I misunderstood her, as I still wasn't 100% fluent in the language. When I returned to Germany, I kept wishing I had opposed her in that moment. Here's an educator, with tangible influence over the next generation, and she feels no shame in supporting such archaic stereotypes.

Next week, I'm going to visit my old high school from that time. My Judo teacher, whom I stayed in contact with, also notified my former homeroom teacher that I was coming (without me asking). So I'll be seeing that teacher again next week and I'm not sure what to do about that.

So, WIBTA for bringing up this statement from years ago that bugs me to this day? I would hope that she would see my point of view and not repeat that behaviour. But I'm just some girl she hardly knows, and she's an older lady, probably set in her ways. I might just be doing this to selfishly get it off my own chest.

In Japan, students are expected to show respect to their teachers. I would not want this to impact the relationship I have with my Judo teacher.

The talent show hosts are Quackity, IShowSpeed and Logan Paul!

I auditioned before the actual event in front of some discord admins alongside one of my friends out of the three i want along with me to get into the actual video and not get cut, to see if our “talent” was funny enough or impressive to be there to meet with the hosts on the actual date.

Long story short both of us got in and accepted with our acts relying on our friend group being there.

We made plans to when the day would come and we even met up to see what we were going to do as a skit when on the stage. They all seemed on board with no issues.

A couple of weeks past and they announced that the offical date of the talent show was going to be this weekend.

I asked them if they’re available around those times and two of my friends saying no. One of the catches being ones got work in the morning which is way too late for the show and the other seemingly not wanting to come at all.  

This is my main dilemma.

You see, I only wanted to invite those 3 of my friends cause they’re the closest ones and I’ve known two of them the longest, so I wanted them to get the opportunity to meet the judges cause I know that they would love to.

One of them is ditching this once in a lifetime opportunity for a minimum wage retail job and the other one just is avoiding it cause he cant be assed.  

I know, I know, it sounds like i’m victim blaming them, but you gotta understand. It’s IShowSpeed, Logan Paul and Quackity, three major youtubers that we’ll never meet again.

My whole idea for our act revolves around them being there and their absence would just ruin any chance making it into the actual video. 

I felt angry cause, i’ve been watching Quackity (main host) for a long time and them fucking up my chances to be on one of his videos really hurts, and i’d never get that chance again since it’s the finale. I could never forgive them.

Hence why I thought to myself, am I being selfish for asking too much from my friends? I want them to experience this opportunity with me at any costs and all they respond back is with a backhand slap. I get that they may not have time but this is such a major event that me and my friends won’t be able to experience again, so i don’t want them doing anything that they’ll regret. 

I want the best for my friends and want them to have a good time but they just don’t seem to be as dedicated and i’m trying to convince them to meet the hosts as they’ll never be able to again.

TL:DR: Friends don’t wanna help me meet Quackity, IShowSpeed and Logan Paul due to them not wanting to free up time and essentially ruining my chances into getting into the actual Youtube video.

Sorry for the long read, I tried to add as much context as I could. 

I’ve been with my now-husband for a total of 8 years and we have a 3.5 month old child. He has 2 older brothers. Unfortunately, the one he was closest with, the oldest, passed away several years ago. The death shattered his family apart. My late brother-in-law’s wife and her kids rarely come around unless it’s a big family event. My remaining brother-in-law took his time coming back around again. He is married with 3 kids and if it weren’t for his kids,
I don’t think he would want to come around either. In every conversation with my in-laws, my late BIL is brought up and the mood turns somber. It isn’t always that pleasant to be around. 

My remaining BIL is married to a woman that is a lying, manipulative narcissist. She was nice to me at first, but I had been warned by my husband and in-laws to be careful around her, without any more explanation. As the years passed, I noticed my SIL would treat my MIL and FIL (in their 60’s) as if they were on-call baby sitters for her 3 kids. There was no flexibility around holiday get togethers because her family had a schedule. If we didn’t follow her schedule, or suggested a date shuffle, she would hold my nieces and nephew hostage by saying things like: “if you don’t have it this day, you won’t see the kids this Christmas. I’m not moving my availability”.  When my other SIL and I try to suggest a rotation so we get a chance to see our families, she tells us that it would be our fault that our families couldn’t accommodate a change instead. 

This is the same woman that wore a white dress to my wedding and put her kids in the same matching white dresses, swore at my mother on my wedding day, refused to treat me as part of the family until my husband and I were married (I was responsible for buying her children gifts for birthdays and Christmas but she wouldn’t read my name out on the cards, only my husbands). And to top it off will always try to one-up me. I have a much closer relationship with my inlaws than she does. 

Without listing off more than the above, this woman has belittled me, brought me to tears without apology, tormented me, made comments about me being a “half breed” because I am only half Italian, not full (like her). My MIL and FIL won’t say anything because of their fear my BIL wont come around. My husband always jumps to my defence when he is witness to her actions. 

My husband would like to choose my BIL as godfather to our child. However, it is customary that when you choose a married person, their spouse is automatically the other godparent. My in laws feel strongly about this and do not want me to “cause any problems” over picking godparents.

On the final night of the birthday vacation everyone’s giving me their gifts and one guest (and his wife) reported they got me nothing. I told him that’s rude to come to a party and bring nothing. I told him I would have been happy with a card or even a handmade gift but they said they had nothing because “they didn’t know we were doing gifts.” I was annoyed but tabled the conversation as to not have an argument over dinner. 

Later in the night that couple came back to tell me that they don’t think gifts are important, that it’s not part of how they were raised (we’re from the same culture and socioeconomic background btw), and that they didn’t know everyone else was getting me a gift. 

I had enough and yelled at them and told them that’s a lie (I knew for a fact all the guests have been in group chats discussing gifts because they didn’t want to all get me the same thing).

!!I (12f) go to a predominantly white school. I have thick 4b/4c hair and often wear it out while also trying new styles but often ones that leave my hair out. 

Unfortunately for me and other black students it’s not uncommon for others to come up and touch our hair without permission. For example (one that has happened to me), I was getting on the bus and this one girl stood up out of her seat and stated, “WOW your hair is so curly!” And just kept playing with it. No permission. Nothing. I walked away after stating, “please don’t touch my hair, or please ask first.” Usually that is what it takes or 2 times and people respect the answer. 

Nevertheless, there is always one person who just cannot listen. I have told this person in numerous occasions that I DO NOT want her touching my hair. Let’s call her Amelia. Amelia has tried to:put my hair in a bun after being told no, tried to braid after being told no, and trying to stretch out my curls and pulling my hair, “just to see how long it truly it is.” 

I have set very clear boundaries telling her no repeatedly. Told a teacher, who did absolutely nothing. So the last straw was when she came up to me at my friends locker and tried to grab my hair. I got annoyed and said, “what is your obsession with my hair?” While swatting away her hand. I couldn’t take it. I asked my black friends who go to and don’t go to the school their thoughts on the subject. They all agreed that she shouldn’t have kept touching my hair and what she got was fair. 

(Also I have recently gotten a new protective style to hopefully grow out my hair since I put a lot of heat and stress on my hair without oiling. And the first thing Amelia did was come and touch the braids. I walked away. However I let 2 people, who did ask and are close friends if they could and I said sure. That was the only me of that.)

My 17 year old is a great nice kid. However, I suspect he has been smoking vape pen weed for almost 4-5 years, at least 3 though. The real potent stuff. He is an only child, and we use to live in a rough neighborhood, and he fell in with a rough group of kids who’s parents where into drugs. I think he really cling to not so good kids, and COVID really didn’t help with the isolation. He has failed most classes since around 7th grade. Only my interventions saved him. He has no learning disability. His teachers said he is great, but simply doesn’t complete his work.

Anyway, I put him in an outpatient rehab where he was tested weekly in June. He was clean for a few weeks, but has failed every test for the past 3 months, and is pRetty adamant it’s no big deal ‘because he has it under control’.

The outpatient said he’s either out, or has to go to rehab.

I guess my conflict is that rehab for weed seems extreme. But the kid won’t stop, and he also smokes alone most of the time. Which REALLY makes me worry.

I was so drunk it took me all day to recover so late yesterday evening I texted the other two and said how sorry I was for the misunderstanding and I will gladly pay for their Uber rides home.

The people involved in this story are me (20F) and my boyfriend, who we will call B (24M). We have been dating for around a year now.

B has always, for as long as I have known him and before we met, been insecure about his teeth. They aren't bad, they are just crooked. In particular, his two front teeth are different lengths. It makes him so insecure that when he laughs he will put his hand over his mouth and will never smile with his teeth. He has spoken multiple times about getting his longer front tooth filed down to be level with his other teeth but has never made any enquiries about an appointment or done any research about it otherwise.

I thought that I would book, and pay for, a dental appointment for an early Christmas present. I'll still get him something physical to open on Christmas. but I wanted to get an appointment soon for him.

I want to be clear, I DO NOT DISLIKE HIS TEETH. In fact, I actually find the crookedness and different lengths pretty cute. I did not get the appointment for my satisfaction. I did it to help his insecurities.

I told B last night that he will need to book a couple hours off work for the next week and when he asked why, I told him. I wasn't worried about ruining the surprise because I had another gift lined up for Christmas day anyway.

B looked a bit puzzled, which I understood because this was a very random gift, but after a minute his eyes lit up and he was delighted! He thanked me for taking the initiative to do this for him because he did not have the confidence to and I was so happy that he was happy too.

When our friends found out about this though, I got BLASTED. I was told but mutual friends of ours that I should have helped B learn to love his teeth, and by doing this for him I have only proved to him that his teeth were a problem that needed to be fixed, not a 'perfect imperfection'. A few friends have sided with me but most are in agreement that what I did for B was inherently mean, and shallow. I was even told by one of our friends that I was ""obviously taking advantage of his insecurities to change his appearance so I would find him more desirable""...

Did I do something wrong here? I would never, ever purposely make B feel worse. I love him. I truly believed this would make him happier as he has always been so insecure about it. I did try to teach him to love his teeth, but he was never happy with them. Are my friends right? Was it actually really mean of me?

They also live in a cheap area, so their money tends to go even further than it would elsewhere. Wife and BIL (23M) went to elite private schools, had 3 tropical holidays a year, luxury cars bought for them at 18, etc. It may be relevant later that I’m from a working class background. 

My wife and I live in a major city, whereas BIL lives rurally about 15 minutes from his parents. BIL is a small business owner; I gather he’s decent at what he does, but he has been heavily bankrolled and supported by my FIL, who is ‘retired’ but works 4-5 days a week with BIL (for no compensation - FIL gives BIL his nominal share in the company outright).

I’ve recently started a side business which is doing quite well; I’ve got enough extra cash to treat my wife and I, and also look at some investment opportunities. 

This came up at a dinner with my wife’s family recently, and BIL suggested buying property to rent out. I had looked into this already, but ruled it out. Partly because the financial upside (in our part of the world/current economic climate) didn’t look to be great for the effort involved, and partly because I’m not morally comfortable with the idea of being a landlord. I’m not extreme in this view, and think there is probably a place for private landlords, but it’s something I’d avoid putting upon myself when I have better alternatives available. 

I explained all of this, and BIL essentially blew up; I had no idea, but apparently his whole end goal is to make enough money to buy enough rental properties to make that his full time occupation. I said again that this was good for him if he could make it work, no skin off my nose, but he kept on his rant about how I was a “privileged elite” (city living/university degree) and an “idiot” for not properly taking care of his sister. 

I explained that we’re more than comfortable as we are, and that my wife is both perfectly capable of looking after herself, and also makes all of these decisions jointly with me. 

At some point I must have hit a nerve, because he kept on with his tirade and started down the tract of ‘knowing the value of money’ and how my wife and I were “morons” for not going into property. 

Admittedly I snapped at that, and this is where I might be TA. I told him that he has no idea of the value of money, that he’s the product of immense privilege, has never paid his own bills, and only has a business because of daddy’s input and bankrolling. 

At this point my MIL and FIL called time on dinner and suggested that we leave. We’ve never butted heads like that as a family before, so I think it came as a shock to everyone. 

My wife gets my point and is glad I stood up for her autonomy, but wishes I’d tried harder to keep the peace.

OK, so basically recently, my daughter has gotten a liking to drifting, sewing embroidery and arts and crafts. 

I don’t really mind this I fully support it , I think it’s fun I don’t think it looks bad. She’s only 14 and I really just think that this is her finding her style or freedom of expression, I think it’s just her having fun and easily making her happy. Plus, she constantly wants to go shopping for cheap clothes to turn them into different ones, and gone as far as to buy a sweatshirt and turn that into a Nike sweatshirt.
 (Before I get dragged I have no issue buying her nicer clothes nor does she have to do this to get nice clothes this is something she enjoys and im fine not being materialistic and forcing her to wear something pricy for no reason)

Anyways me and her mom have a split schedule and when she was with her she took her shopping, she got two jeans and two shirts she specifically wanted to make those little flowers on, I will try to put a picture. 

So she did and now the top back of the pant has flowers on it, she took the shirt and did one of those contraptions where they iron a picture on or whatever, to the shirts. In my opinion these were far from ruined she just added some stuff on it to make it more her liking and I don’t see an issue in that. 

Apparently she showed her mother over the phone and she was pissed that she did this and asked her why she was ruining her clothes that she bought for her and treating them like shit. She then called me asking me why I allowed her to do this when she spent her hard earned money on these clothes. 

I said I didn’t see an issue they are very much wearable they just have designs on the back, and she’s being very rude to her and she shouldn’t have said that infront of her and if she had an issue she should’ve come to me. 

She said that I was just doing this to fuck with her because the clothes she bought aren’t for playing around they are expensive clothes and she will talk to her daughter however she wanted. 

I said that she needed to stop acting like these were for some special occasions and she just ruined them, they are from Marshall’s and I would gladly give her the money back if it’s that serious but she won’t talk to our daughter like that because she’s mad she did something she enjoys. 

She said that it wasn’t about the money but the fact that I’m allowing her to ruin her clothes, and she looks inmature walking around like that but I just kept saying that this is not ruining her clothes, she likes it and I’m sorry that her appearance is better then her happiness. 

She said that I was being deliberately obtuse as to why she was mad, but I don’t get it, the clothes are very well wearable, she’s very proud of them, she wants to wear them, I told her I will give her the money back so what’s the issue?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4820885,public,top,self,AITA for letting my kid ruin the clothes her mom bought her,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3jutc/aita_for_letting_my_kid_ruin_the_clothes_her_mom/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Im pregnant and due, in fact i’m already past my due date by 4 days as of today. We have been very open and vocal to both sides of the family about what our plans are and what date I will be induced if our baby does not want to show up naturally. 

My MIL just spam called my husbands cell starting at 4am our time. He has his phone on do not disturb constantly and the only notifications that come through are from me incase something happens. He has told everyone about doing this as he is a very nervous first time dad and wanted to make sure he didnt miss anything important. Well, since he didn’t answer she then spam called my cell. I woke up in a panic assuming something has happened to someone back home (my husbands grandmother is currently sick, not terminally but shes elderly so everyones cautious). When I answered the phone to be greeted with “has my grandbaby arrived yet?!” I was a little annoyed and hung up on her immediately. I rolled over and told my husband what the brief call was and he called her ridiculous. She started spam texting me saying she knew I was awake since I answered the phone and that she just wanted to be updated. I told her we would update her when there was something to update her with as nothing has happened and were both trying to sleep. I asked her to stop spamming our phones and give us some space as we navigate these next 3 days and we will be updating everyone as we go through it. She read the message and then texted my husbands phone saying I was being rude to her and that she deserves to know about her grandchild and that he needs to talk to me. He didnt respond and he showed me the message. 

Just quick info: I spoke to her yesterday saying we have an appointment today at 10am our time to check up on everything and make final plans with our dr for inducing labor.

Were both confused how it ended up like this and why shes so upset when we arent keeping anything from her, we just don’t have any updates and sure as hell don’t want to be woken up by people requesting information we don’t have.

I 26(F) live at home with my parents and my sister 23(F). My sister is the laziest person I have ever met. She claims carers benefit for ""looking after"" our mother but she does nothing. I'm the one that takes my mum to hospital and doctors appointments, I'm the one who takes them shopping and picks them up when they fall (literally) all while working a full time job.

The only chore my sister is meant to do is the dishes after dinner and half the time she doesn't even do that. I keep telling her to try and find a job but it's always the same excuse of that she has anxiety and can't work. As far as I can tell she does not have anxiety and her problem is that she has been coddled by our parents for the whole of her life and she doesnt like being told what to do. She only showers roughly once a month and she hasn't brushed her teeth in god knows how long. She has a major attitude problem and I'm at my wits end with her.

The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking on her behavior after the second time in a week.

We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidemtly"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid.

my parents and siblings told me that on my b day they would pick me up and take me to a nice restaurant to celebrate i was excited

A and I where like best friends and I knew her boyfriend D since I was 5. D and I never had anything sexual when A and D where dating at all as I was a lesbian.

So basically A turned everyone against me and D was the only person I had. D and A broke up and I started to catch feeling for him.

I found out that D liked me to. D and I started dating and we are going a month strong💪💪💪. A found out and is now pissed of even more.

A day ago she came up to me and started yelling at me for getting with her ex. I just tilde her that they broke up and I did not force him to get with me and I did not force you two to break up and I also told her that if she wants to continue to be a whiny brat then she can leave.

When D found out he also took me out for dinner &lt;3

I have a very small apartment and limited storage space so I can’t hang onto this stuff.

So this year, I told everyone I would like either money (I’m saving up to get myself braces), gift cards (so I can by myself what I need like new Brita filters lol), or something sentimental like a photo album with nice memories. 

But when I told my friends and family this, some got offended and said it was rude for me to dictate what I want for the holidays… like I just want them to give me money and that I would reject their other gifts for me. And that it takes the fun and surprise out of gift giving.

I get their points but I also don’t want them wasting money and giving me a bunch of stuff I don’t like or won’t use and contribute to the already big consumer waste problem. And it’s a burden on me cause I have to figure out what to do with this stuff.

It was the opening shift (6am to 3pm) and I showed up at 5:50am since I live quite a distance from that work, I made sure to always leave early to ensure I arrive on time. The other opening worker was another supervisor but he wouldn't show up until basically 6am, or 5:59 am. The facility also boarded people's dogs for however long they needed and our first task was to let the dogs out into the outside yard connected to their room. We only had two rooms used that night, one room had probably 16 dogs and the other had 12 or so, each in their own crates, while some folks pay extra for their dog to be in one of those 10fx5f sized ""crates"" with the tarp roof.

I arriving first, went to the room with 16 and as I opened the door, a huge boom of diarrhea smell hit me like a wrecking ball. One of the bigger dogs completely blew up her space, she was in the 10fx5f little room crates so thankfully she didn't have to lay in it all night. She just slept in the corner but the other corner was a HUGE mess of diarrhea and liquid; the puddle was probably 4 feet wide and the smell, holy moly was that awful. 

After seeing that, I shut the door and went to the other room to see that those dogs were okay. I let them out of their living spaces, let them outside to use the bathroom, and then let them back in their living spaces to feed them their breakfast. As I was working, the other supervisor arrived so he was forced to start his day in the diarrhea room. I finished my tasks and met up with him, he explained what he came to and I acted surprised saying ""Really?! Dang thats awful."" I did though, help him feed his dogs room their breakfast, I just didn't have to clean up that huge mess, he did.

My fiance m24, and I f25 are in the process of wedding planning (wedding will be next year). We had money saved up but turns out it wasn't enough. My sister f302, offered to help out financially which was really nice and kind of her.


Days ago we were discussing the menu and my suster sent me some meal accomodations for her husband (he has a chronic condition and is on a diet). She wanted two options in total for him at the wedding. My fiance and his mom thought this was not okay because they have many guests and not much room for more food options. I talked to my sister about it and she dropped one dish option. There was still an issue because my fiance's family wanted to add one option (about 8 people want this option to be put on menu. His uncle, aunts and their kids) and made it the condition on which they attend the wedding. We had no room nor money to add more food options. My fiance's mom visited days ago and said that I was being unfair by adding one dish option for one person (BIL) and diregarding the dish option that 8 people want. I explained why I was making an exception for my BIL but my fiance and his mom claimed that BIL is a guest and is not immediate family like uncles, aunts, cousins. That's firstly. Secondely, my fiance said it's our wedding and the choice should ultimately be ours to make. He offered that work a compromise for my BIL like serving him same options everybody else is having and remove/adjust his plate.


My sister said it wouldn't work because he has a specific diet. My fiance told her it wouldn't do much harm since it's just for once but my sister got upset and told me she could not believe I had no consideration for BIL's health. I kind of felt upset and replied that she was trying to control my wedding just because she paid towards it. She looked shocked then told us both to leave her home.


Our parents got in the middle. My dad said my fiance's mom and ralatives are the assholes and are getting too comfortable. And my mother told me that my sister is shocked and hurt I implied she was trying to control the wedding now she's conemplating pulling her contribution out.

Recently we got a project for marketing and I've been assigned 3 more partners.

Later that day, i told the girls that it was awful that their ""bickering sister"" was calling me so fucking early. Yes i did say that. Needless to say, i did apologize for insulting their sister but at the same time i only have slept for one hour in total.

Then they kept pestering me for that insult, giving me and our other project mate HELL. Not only ANYTHING i did was now wrong or ""didn't conform to the standards"" but also they did NOTHING aside of several photos of the product we need to make the project about.

I didn't know anyone there when I moved. Soon after, I met this girl we'll call C, and we quickly became best friends, so much so that it was common that we'd hang out multiple times a week and text all the time.

After 5 months, C started to show interest in sleeping with me. I was against it, since didn't want it to affect our friendship. C convinced me that if we started sleeping together, we would still be able to remain best friends, as this was her priority as well as mine. I still said no.

I was seeing another girl we'll call L. L and I weren't serious, but after I kissed L in front of C, C asked me not to kiss L in front of her. I agreed and stopped to protect her feelings.

As C and I got closer physically (I slept in her bed after she was crying to comfort her), we eventually had sex. Once we had sex, we decided to be exclusive, which meant I stopped seeing L. She wasn't seeing anyone at the time.

After 2 weeks, she met a guy we'll call T. Once she met T, she decided that we should be fwb and not be exclusive anymore (which was what we intended to do eventually). I wasn't comfortable with her seeing T and asked her to postpone her date, which I felt was fair since she asked me to stop seeing L, but she went out with him anyways.

Her and I had discussed rules regarding using condoms and no oral sex with others while we were fwb. When she had sex with T for the first time she broke both of these rules and told me after.

I was heartbroken, and as part of comforting me, she suggested we go back to being exclusive for 2 weeks to allow me more time to feel ok with this. I agreed.

2 days later, she told me she wouldn't follow this agreement as she thought I was controlling her. I told her she didn't have to follow the agreement, but I would be devastated if she broke it, as it would be breaking another promise to me. She had sex with T soon after, within those 2 weeks.

She then asked for space from me, and I didn't speak to her for 2 weeks while I was away visiting home.

When I arrived back, I asked for a lift from the airport which she had previously promised me, but she made up some excuses, and afterwards told me she didn't feel comfortable being alone with me anymore now that she was with T.

The next time I saw her at a party we chatted and acted like best friends again. She mentioned how she missed me.

After this, I reached out and asked her what she was doing next weekend, and she blew me off. I asked her something was wrong, and she said she didn't think she'd ever be comfortable with us being friends.

I feel hurt as this was what I was scared of in the beginning and now it's happened. We've had no contact for about a month now. This includes social activities we did together, but she hasn't come to anything since we last spoke. I'm concerned I might've made her too uncomfortable to attend.
