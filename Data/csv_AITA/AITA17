Back in the day when they were first getting married, my dad agreed to do Christmas dinner with my mothers family (he assumed this wasn't set in stone for life). My family is the only one that lives away from their hometown (all my relatives live in the same city/close city). We only visit every other year because it is expensive for us to visit every single year.

Story: This Christmas we are going to go down and do dinner on the 25th with my mothers parents, siblings, my cousins, etc. I have nothing against my mothers side of the family, and I love them all very much. My grandparents are old on both sides, and me and my sister both asked if for one time only could we have dinner with our other parents. We stated not this Christmas but the next one, we would just like to do this once before they pass. My mother seems to believe we are all horrible for suggesting this, and that it isn't acceptable to break an agreement she made with my father. She ruined our limited family time with me and my sister all because of this simple question.

Should we really be held to an agreement that never took into account me and my sisters opinions.

Enchilada asked me if his friend Horchata (24) can join. Enchilada had a precarious living situation, and our lease (for a new place) wouldn't start for another month. Horchata lived out of town and was jobless / flunked out of school.

So I helped Horchata move to our town, and he stayed with me for weeks. Moreover, I worked my connections, got Horchata an interview, drove him there, and that is a job he is now doing.

Ever since we moved in together, there have been problems and problems:

1. Horchata would throw parties / cook and not clean up for days
2. Horchata would not do his chores
3. Horchata would do drugs in our backyard, and hid drugs under MY BICYCLE HELMET! (I don't bike much in the cold)

Enchilada and I, however, almost never had problems.

I had gotten together with Enchilada and communicated with Horchata that his behavior is not acceptable, and he'd say he'd comply, before simply reverting to his old ways. To his credit though, he moved drugs out of my helmet. (but we can still sometimes get really strong smell of weed)

I had once lost my temper and yelled at Horchata (cleanliness), to which Enchilada had intervened, and said I shouldn't be yelling. I was wrong so I apologized.

**Since then, Horchata sometimes does not flush the toilet after using it. Sometimes I would go in after him, be disgusted, and send a picture to the text group, before flushing it myself.**

***After this happened three times, I deliberately did not flush after peeing!***

We recently had another house meeting where I brought up the point of Horchata not doing his chores. I proposed a chore sheet where we marked once we got our chores done, that way, there would not be any ambiguity.

Horchata said he always cleans after himself, to which I replied if he did clean after himself it shouldn't be a problem to check the chore board. He said he is not 'reporting to me' (the chore board would be for EVERYONE)

Then, the issue of flushing toilets was brought up, to which Horchata pointed out that I failed to flush once as well. I confessed why I didn’t flush, having finally lost it after asking them multiple times.

Horchata flew off the handle and called me words like savage (I'm a dark-skinned, Horchata and Enchilada are asian) . During his verbal barrage, I was quiet, but when I tried to speak up, Enchilada interjected saying 'WE' shouldn't yell at each other.

Where I might be the asshole: I lost it on Enchilada and told him that he and Horchata were clearly taking advantage of me. What hurt was the partial behavior of Enchilada, where he was completely silent when I was getting yelled, but only spoke when I tried to talk back. **After I told Enchilada and Horchata are clearly is taking advantage of me, Enchilada started crying**. I felt bad so I hugged him and apologized, after which Enchilada and Horchata went up to play video games, I went on a run to cool off.

I explained this to her and told her that I’m already going through depression due to this issue and other problems as well, I seriously can’t hear them nag at me and point out flaws in him that I already know for an hour again.

In that class the teacher was supposed to teach us how to manage our time better and advocate for ourselves with other teachers. That class sucked. Sucked bad. Most of the class was the teacher, whom I shall call Mrs. Morb, slinging playground insults at her students. One conversation went as follows:

Mrs. Morb: Timmy(not real name) you should take a speech therapy class in high school for your speech impediment\*

Timmy: Won’t I lose an elective if I do that?

Mrs. Morb: Would you rather lose an elective or have everyone make fun of you?

\*minor speech impediment that tbh I never noticed because he would about 35% Of the time pronounce th’s like d’s

She was also my assigned counselor that I was sent to because of my Special Ed thing. Oftentimes after class she would ask me to meet her in her office because we had to talk and during that time she would expect me to tell her my problems and such. I was obviously not comfortable telling her my problems because I was afraid she’d demean me and I flat out didn’t like her. After this had gone on for a couple months I eventually refused to go to her office to talk (which would just maybe her staring at me and me looking at my shoes uncomfortably) and I used a hyperbole to describe how long she keeps me in her office:

Me: You keep me in there for like an hour, I don’t want to do this anymore

Mrs. Morb: I do not keep you in there for an hour do we need to call your parents and get your reality checked?

I just want to mention I was 12 years old at the time and an authority figure basically called me an idiot.

A couple days ago I complained about her to my friend because we were talking about bad teachers and they said they had her too. She would always say “I will not share anything you say in this room unless you intend to harm someone or yourself” which turned out to be bull because my friend said Mrs. Morb outed her being queer to her mom when they weren’t ready to discuss that yet. Isn’t breaking the non disclosure agreement a crime? Or is that only in professional therapy?

For background, my sister (26F) and I (27F) grew up very poor, so as an adult I have been saving my money very diligently, so I got a decent nest egg to eventually (hopefully) try to buy a house one day. I very rarely buy things for myself, rarely eat out, don’t buy things I consider unnecessary… basically I’m very frugal. 

My sister and I have been making around the same amount of money up until recently. She is not as careful about spending as I am, which I have no problem with. It’s her life, if she wants to spend her money, good on her. But she moved into a pretty pricey apartment about 5 months ago, which concerned me a bit. She racked up some credit card debt while buying furniture/etc for her new apartment. She asked if she could borrow $2k in order to close her CC debt so that she wouldn’t accrue interest. I was hesitant, but she promised me up and down that she would pay me back. Needless to say, she has only paid back around 1/4th of the amount she owes me and I basically had to ask her for each payment. She would get annoyed anytime I brought it up and would just say “I’m not going anywhere, I’m obviously gonna pay you”.

Anyway, she quit her job 3 weeks ago because she was having major issues with her manager and was extremely unhappy. So I pretty much kissed my $2k goodbye knowing that I’m probably never getting it back. If she didn’t pay me when she had a job, she certainly won’t be while she’s unemployed. And I don’t expect her to, but I told myself if she ever asks to borrow money again, I’m going to say no. 

So we come to last week. She called me saying how she’s so broke and she doesn’t know how she’s gonna make rent. Side note, has enough in her savings to cover rent and bills for at least 2 months. She then asked me to borrow $1k. Now that I think about it, she didn’t even ask if she could borrow. I think she wanted me to just give it to her. She knows how much I have saved so I think in her mind because I have enough money to give her $1k and not be too impacted, I should have no problem doing it.  

I told her no, just as I had promised myself. She said bye and hung up on me and she hasn’t talked to me since. We usually talk every single day. I feel like I’m starting to think I made an asshole move by saying no. I’m in a stable financial position and she is in need right now.

He seemed pretty forward from the start of our friendship commenting on my physical appearance and trying to hit on me. I rejected his advances as I didn't like him in that way, and only saw him as a friend.
He came out and told me he thinks about a future with me, when I rejected his advances again he got upset, then I tried to make him feel better by reminding him that he wants kids and I don't, so even if I did like him back neither of us would be happy.
I thought that was that as we continued to be friends, and he seemed ok with that, knowing that I didn't feel that way and didn't share his desire of marriage and kids.


But the other day we were on the phone and he started asking about why I don't want kids, now I had already told him a few times before (as he asked a lot) that I have medical conditions that prevent me from having kids, then he hung up on me.
The next day he told me he no longer wanted to talk to me or be my friend because I didn't share the same goals as him.
I got upset because I told him it now felt like he never actually wanted to be my friend, he just was pretending to be my friend hoping I would change my mind and like him back and fulfill his desire of getting married and having kids (even though I made it clear I didn't like him, and I was unable to have kids, nor did I even want them)
He got angry at me for that and very defensive, saying I was inconsiderate and things like 'I have given up on my dreams (of having kids, which FYI was never my dream)
Looking back it feels like he was just disregarding my feelings, pretending to be my friend while believing I would change my mind for him, and when he knew I wouldn't do what he wanted he no longer wanted me in his life.

I tried to understand from his point of view, but however I look at it I just feel like he was using me, hoping I would fulfill his desires, and when he finally accepted that wasn't going to happen he threw me out.

I get migraines a lot, almost every day. Most of the time I can handle them, but nothing I do seems to stop them. Advil and Aleve helps but not all that much. I've tried cyproheptadine and it sort of worked at first, but not so much anymore. Usually bright lights and stress causes them, and can make them even worse.

So yesterday my mom wanted me to go to my cities tree lighting with her and the rest of my family, I had already started to get a migraine so I said maybe. As it neared time to go I looked for an Advil or an Aleve in the cabinet(where they usually are) and on the counter, and didn't find it. So I went up to my room and turned off the lights(which helps), and laid down. Ten minutes later my mom drags me downstairs saying its time to go.

I try to tell her that my migraine got worse, and that I couldn't go. I tried to explain that the tree lighting(Bright lights) and lots of people(stressful, and made worse by social anxiety) would only make it worse, but she kept interrupting me saying ""you either stay, or go."" and I chose to stay. As they were leaving I found the Aleve and took it, then went back upstairs to wait for it to take effect.

I sat for 30-40 minutes in silence until it took effect. And then tried to use my phone to listen to music or an audiobook. When the app tried to load I found out that my mom had turned off my internet access on all my devices(Her new favorite thing to do whenever I do something she doesn't like). So I spent the next 15 minutes convincing her to at least turn my phones internet access back on so In could listen to something.

Then around 10 the migraine began to clear, and by 11:30 it was gone so I tried texting and calling my mom to turn my internet access back on, figuring I could at least squeeze in a little practice(I'm on an eSports team.)but she didn't answer.

The next day(today) I woke up at around 10 ish(I always sleep longer after a bad migraine), and find my mom in the kitchen. I ask if she can turn my internet back on, and I get yelled at about how ""It seems as though I always get migraines when I'm asked to do something"" and how ""I need to take responsibility for my actions.""

I try and tell her that I cant control when I get them and that Aleve isn't magic and I cant just turn it off, and I don't know what I would be taking responsibility for. She huffed at me that I should google the meaning of ""taking responsibility"" then. The we have a half hour debate/fight on why I should take responsibility and what it means. and by debate I mean mostly her telling me that I'm stupid for not knowing and yelling at me for ruining her night and telling me that its my fault for not going. Eventually I guess I said the right thing because she left and after making me clean my room she(grudgingly) turned my internet access back on, and gave me a whole lecture about how its my responsibility to take care of my migraines and to make sure I do it in time to do what she asks.

Well that shit stops now. I went downstairs in a good mood, my brother getting ready to leave for school (I'm in online class) and he went at the dining room which has one of the doors we use to exit the house.

And I was with my mom, messing around because me and my mom are very close. Then my dad went downstairs telling my brother to start the car so they can leave already. My mom ran so they can leave. After I also stood up and webt with them to wish them goodbyes and shit. 

But when I looked at the dining table, my phone was nowhere to be found, I tried looking under it, under that placemats, under everything. And I was thinking that it was my brother who did this. So I went outside to ask for my brother for my phone and I was not having it. He told me it was under the table and I was not searching for it thoroughly. I went back and I hear my mom calling me, upon entering the house, I heard my mom saying that my brother ""accidentally"" put his phone in his bag. 

I took my phone and I told my mom that I will beat my brother when he comes back from school. After locking the doors, I went inside his room, really angry, and I just trashed everything.

This cat, buddy, i got her two years ago after fostering it myself and have done over $3000 of free dental work on the cat and other vet care because of how sick it was I was his cat foster &amp; vet tech. Buddy is now estimated at 8-11 years old and coughs when we smoke weed around him, and has a history of chronic respiratory disease and asthma. 

Personally, I’ve heard the lungs myself and see the fits and told her multiple times that i do not want to do it around him anymore. Ultimately she insisted it was fine, and we she kept smoking. I stopped smoking close to him and if I was around him I would make an effort to avoid him due to his illness. I try to smoke in my room or when he is not near me to avoid doing it but every once and a while he will still find a way in when i’m not look. Cut to 3 months later and after a whole day of her awkwardly asking me out of nowhere (after months of her smoking in front of buddy), “should I put buddy in the room?” before smoking and each time I strongly agreed and she would do it. At the end of the night after the last sesh she asked “why do you still smoke in front of him if you didn’t want us too in the first place.” I expressed that “Buddy is not my responsibility. If you are smoking around him and continue to do so, there is nothing more I can do. I’m not his owner and he is your cat.” 

And for the for background she smokes a lot more than me around him. I’ve personally have never seen one of these smoking fits other than when she shows me videos or smokes in front of him a lot. About another hour goes by and she texts me a paragraph and to make a long-story short we get into a fight. She says “Knowing that something can hurt an animal is stupid to begin with…I’ve asked if you could not do it but you didn’t want to in the past. I respected that (as a housemate &amp; friend) but don’t be a dick about ur response. It wasn’t cool wit me and hope that when I’m not here that u don’t smoke around him anymore plz and thank you.” and i replied telling her that it isn’t my responsibility as a vet tech. Once i clock out it’s not my responsibility off the clock to make sure everyone is treating their pets right. I see it every day at work and see the patients die, sure, many aren’t intentional but the environment you put your pets in matters. I may be more desensitized and I did make it appoint to move or get away from Buddy so the smoke doesn’t directly hit him in the face or make him distressed. 

I guess my view is im wondering why would I change my behavior of smoking in the same place if you (someone who smokes three-four times what i do) goes with her boyfriend and does it all the time without opening any windows or door hotboxing buddy?

He is upset because I want to go back sooner than expected and I told him I would be leaving on January and more than that he is upset because he also prefers me to stay forever, he keeps saying he (my dad) is the person that loves me the most and I should just stay here and be free in the states but I feel way better at Colombia .

I love my dad deeply but it is sad to me that I feel he doesn't support my relationship with one of the persons I love the most.

But I also think I might be saddening my dad because he wants to at least spend Christmas with me and I am planning to go back sooner.

For context, I was having trouble with a bf, we had been in a big riff and him cheating but we were still in a stage of working things through. My friends knew about it and I was quite open at the time about being upset, but it has been months since the initial rift and they knew he was around. 

My cousin met my bf during her trip, I hadn’t mentioned anything at all, we were happy according to her. When on the night out, my cousins asked my friends what they thought about him and they sat and shared the drama and what he’s done to me and how much they dislike him. 

She let me know after the night what they told her. I know they are friends but I got extremely upset with them. It felt like these friends were always there for the drama and didn’t actually gaf, i has found out previously about them telling my business to others. I had those feelings for months but this was the breaking point. 

I emphasized that they should not be telling my business to anyone that asks, especially my family or anyone. My cousin was the last person to not know anything and felt like another blow in the face as she looked at me and him differently the rest of the trip. 

I stated how horrible that was to do, they were firm that I should have stated directly for them not to talk about it and they have every right to express their opinions and shouldn’t be expected to lie. I didn’t really talk to them much when happy in my relationship, they welcomed me in when I was having a bad time. 

 I called them out for the lack of respect or thought they gave about me in that situation, and how they knew it was private and how much it affected me. I haven’t talked to them since, almost 7 months.

Fast forward to last week when I asked if I could use his phone for tiktok since he was using mine for something. He said ofc and handed me his phone. His FYP wasn’t even the slightest bit funny to me so I went to his following because I know we follow similar content creators. In the 5 minutes alone I was on there, I saw so many half naked women. It broke my heart instantly because it was still the same women who didn’t look like me and to see I came across 10 different women just by scrolling. I told him again how hurt I was and it turns out he even followed more women since our incident from last year. He was even following women who didn’t have BBLs or their titties/ass out. He was just following them because they were attractive in the face because the content they would post (makeup, day in the life, etc) isn’t the usual content I would expect him to consume from a woman.

We normally have 4 total thanksgiving/christmases; all on separate days, scheduled with each group of people. 
We normally have our 2 good friends come over for the holidays for our “friendsgiving”, but one passed away several months ago. Because we have been trying to be there for our late friends dad, we have had him come over for dinner every weekend since (about 6 months now). The only thing is… I really don’t like him. I’m always kind, but he has rubbed me wrong numerous times and has a VERY bold personality. We just don’t mesh well. 

We set up all our thanksgiving plans (my family thanksgiving day, his mom/stepdad Saturday 11/26, his dad/stepmom the next weekend, and Friendsgiving not scheduled yet because our other friend went out of town)

His mom and stepdad go above and beyond for us, have always been incredibly supportive, and I value them a lot. We’ve had dinner with them and our late friends dad before, and I could sense the energy change when he got there. I know they felt like they couldn’t be themselves and got quiet (I feel the same way tbh)

Here’s where things get funky. When making plans, my in laws and I decided Saturday worked best for our schedules, but that’s the day our late friends dad normally comes for dinner. I posed that maybe we could do something with him Friday instead, so we could have more quality time with his folks. 

My fiancé got very defensive and made it seem like I was trying to exclude his late friends dad; and how holidays were going to be super hard for him and he had no weekend plans.

Let's call me OP (25), and my roommates E (23) and H (24). E and OP have been really good friends for about 4 years. E and H have been friends for about 7 years.

Last summer E and and I decided to live together. E asked me, if his friend H can join. E had a precarious living situation, and our lease (for a new place) wouldn't start for another month. H lived out of town and was jobless / flunked out of school.

So I helped H move to our town, and H stayed with me for weeks. Moreover, I worked my connections, got H an interview, drove him there, and that is a job he is now doing.

Ever since we moved in together, there have been problems and problems:

1. H would throw parties and not clean up for days
2. H would cook and not clean up after himself
3. H would not do his chores
4. H would do drugs in our backyard, and hid his drugs under MY BICYCLE HELMET! (I don't bike much in the cold)

E and I, however, almost never had problems.

I had gotten together with E and communicated with H that his behavior is not acceptable, and he'd say he'd comply, before simply reverting to his old ways. To his credit though, he moved drugs out of my helmet. (but we can still sometimes get really strong smell of weed)

I had once lost my temper and yelled at him (cleanliness), to which E had intervened, and said I shouldn't be yelling. I was wrong so I apologized.

**Since then, H has developed this habit of not flushing the toilet after using it. Sometimes I would go in after him, be disgusted, and send a picture to the text group, before flushing it myself.**

***After this happened three times, I deliberately did not flush after peeing!***

We recently had another house meeting where I brought up the point of H not doing his chores. I thought it would be nice to have a chore sheet where we marked once we got our chores done, that way, there would not be any ambiguity.

H was pissed saying he always cleans after himself, to which I replied if he did clean after himself it shouldn't be a problem to check the chore board. H said he is not 'reporting to me' (the chore board would be for EVERYONE)

Then, the issue of flushing toilets was brought up, to which H pointed out that I failed to flush once as well. I confessed why I didn’t flush, having finally lost it after asking them multiple times.

H flew off the handle and called me words like savage (I'm a dark-skinned, H and E are asian) . During his verbal barrage, I was quiet, but when I tried to speak up, E interjected saying 'WE' shouldn't yell at each other.

Where I might be the asshole: I lost it on E, and told him that he and H were clearly taking advantage of me. What hurt was the partial behavior of E, where he was completely silent when I was getting yelled, but only spoke when I tried to talk back. **After I told E and H are clearly is taking advantage of me, E started crying**.

I have a male mastiff-mix for context. I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.

So anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. 

Halfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. 

Another boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. 

Less than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. 

I tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. 

B's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.

Let's call me OP (25), and my roommates E (23) and H (24).

 E and OP have been really good friends for about 4 years. E and H have been friends for about 7 years.

Last summer E and and I decided to live together. E asked me, if his friend H can join. E had a precarious living situation, and our lease (for a new place) wouldn't start for another month. H lived out of town and was jobless / flunked out of school.

So I helped H move to our town, and H stayed with me for weeks. Moreover, I worked my connections, got H an interview, drove him there, and that is a job he is now doing.

Ever since we moved in together, there have been problems and problems:

1. H would throw parties and not clean up for days

2. H would cook and not clean up after himself

3. H would not do his chores

4. H would do drugs in our backyard, and hid his drugs under MY BICYCLE HELMET! (I don't bike much in the cold)

E and I, however,  almost never had problems.

I had gotten together with E and communicated with H that his behavior is not acceptable, and he'd say he'd comply, before simply reverting to his old ways. To his credit though, he moved drugs out of my helmet. (but we can still sometimes get really strong smell of weed)

I had once lost my temper and yelled at him (cleanliness), to which E had intervened, and said I shouldn't be yelling. I was wrong so I apologized.

**Since then, H has developed this habit of not flushing the toilet after using it. Sometimes I would go in after him, be disgusted, and send a picture to the text group, before flushing it myself.** 

***After this happened three times, I deliberately did not flush after peeing!***

We recently had another house meeting where I brought up the point of H not doing his chores. I thought it would be nice to have a chore sheet where we marked once we got our chores done, that way, there would not be any ambiguity.

H was pissed saying he always cleans after himself, to which I replied if he did clean after himself it shouldn't be a problem to check the chore board. H said he is not 'reporting to me' (the chore board would be for EVERYONE)

Then, the issue of flushing toilets was brought up, to which H pointed out that I failed to flush once as well. I confessed why I didn’t flush, having finally lost it after asking them multiple times.

H flew off the handle and called me words like savage (I'm a brown dude, H and E are asian) . During his verbal barrage, I was quiet, but when I tried to speak up, E interjected saying 'WE' shouldn't yell at each other.

Where I might be the asshole: I lost it on E, and told him that he and H were clearly taking advantage of me. What hurt was the partial behavior of E, where he was completely silent when I was getting yelled, but only spoke when I tried to talk back. **After I told E and H are clearly is taking advantage of me, E started crying**. I felt bad so I hugged him and apologized, after which E and H went up to play video games, I went on a run to cool off.

My sister (F32) attended the wedding, and there was no bad blood or arguments whatsoever. She got slightly drunk, but nothing too disruptive. She has been with her fiance (M48) for 8 months, and I am not entirely supportive, but I held my silence during the ceremony and was entirely respectful of the situation. Another detail - she had decided it was to be an alcohol-free wedding, and I didn't complain to her face, but after my father and I both brought it up, we decided we would sneakily pack a few cans of beer for just us to share. My sister was a wild drinker and party animal for ages, and it was a huge part of her 'fun' personality, but since she met Steve she had stopped drinking altogether and become much more shut off. Anyways, after the ceremony had ended, I went to the reception and began drinking a few beers, nothing too much. My sister immediately came over to me, ditching her new husband and confronted me, in front of our family, his family and all the guests there. 

She screamed that I was disrespectful of the rules she had set and that I had never been supportive of her relationship. I was slightly intoxicated by this point, and all the words I had been holding in slipped out. I told her that I never told her I didn't support her, but now she mentioned it, I wanted to make my opinions clear, and I hated Steve because months ago she would have laughed at the idea of an alcohol-free wedding, and she was so much brighter back then. I told her that Steve was an awful match for her and that I couldn't stay and watch this continue. She was sobbing by this point and told me to leave then, and I immediately did so. That night and the next morning I had tons of messages from family, some supporting me and some saying I was terrible for ruining my sister's wedding to support my alcoholism. I wouldn't have said anything otherwise but her outburst prompted mine and I'm not sure if I regret my decision or not.

For context, I was in a long term  relationship with my ex boyfriend which was funnily cut off due to a similar situation. One of my closest male friends at the time began to hit on me, despite him knowing I was happily in a relationship. 

For a bit of background context, he came out as bisexual around a month earlier. I originally thought it was purely to burn of steam so I didn’t take it to heart nor as flirting. Time progressed and it got to a point where it was clearly flirting and I was trying to be polite since I know they are quite insecure, but it was seriously messing with my head.

I later told my boyfriend at the time about it and we discussed how we both felt about it. I later had a convo with said male friend and the conversation went well, he said he would try not to and I thought that was the end of it. 

Now the relationship is over between me and my ex, I keep thinking about how I seemed like such a douche. But I don’t know if he’s the douche or if I am. 

Since to me it looked as if he was either wanting me to cheat or trying to bait me out, which I was not okay with. But I also think it’s asshole-like to attempt to bait someone out like that, especially since they were in a happy relationship.

We were obligated to be there for several reasons including the fact my husband records the video livestream up in the balcony. I usually sit with my 12yo and 2yo on the ground floor of the sanctuary now because 2yo turned off the livestream one time during church, lol, oops. Toward the beginning of the second service today, he started screaming, so I took him out and brought him back in when he was happy. At one point he said he wanted to go up and see Daddy. I wanted to avoid it because he likes to run around up there and I don't want it to be annoying for people downstairs - also the livestream computer thing. So I was trying to keep him busy, but then he got super antsy, so I walked around with him in the back of the sanctuary. Well, then he started walking upstairs, so I figured he might just want to see his dad/stretch his legs. He walked around nicely up there for awhile, but then, when this one guy was talking for quite a while, my toddler started running back and forth in the balcony, and then he started laughing for no reason, lol. No idea why. I was hoping it wasn't disrupting anyone downstairs and quietly asked him to be quiet while that man was talking. But he was literally just being a child, so I didn't take him out. He's one of the few children at our church and people tell me all the time how great it is to hear children at church. 

Eventually we went back downstairs and FINALLY the service ended. After the service, this lady who has always been nice to me, and was sitting in the same pew as us with her elderly father, said to me, ""Maybe I shouldn't say anything, but when you were up in the balcony he was really loud and disruptive."" Thankfully I was able to keep myself from crying or being snotty, and I said, ""I'm sorry he was disruptive. I was hoping it wouldn't be. It's hard to know whether to take him out when he's like that because if I did every time it might be hard for him to get used to church. Some people say they like to hear kids in church, and other people don't like to, so I can't make everyone happy."" I should also note that she had said before the afternoon service started that she had wanted a nap but didn't have time for one because it was her dad's birthday, so they had a busy afternoon. Plus, maybe her patience had worn thin with the long service as well. I also wondered if she was actually commenting on behalf of her father who is a very kind man, but was maybe irritated.

After that though, multiple people expressed how happy they were that he was there.

But what happened just last night was kinda same as what's written in the title. So let me start by saying I am a male (22) and she is 21. I am a fresh grad and she is still studying in the college. This happened when we were actually on the second day of dating and I can already read the comments telling me I am obsessive or dumb or sick and all (Well I simply hope that some people will care to tell me if I am the a-hole or not). We met on a pretty dumb chat site and we started chatting, she invited me to the skype (I tried so hard to figure if she acc was a fraud or smth, I know) and we chatted more sending each other casual pics, you know, the ""so, what do you look like?"" deal. Soon after she started calling me love and not having dated for a while I went with the flow calling her the same classic things like ""darling"" or ""dear"". Then she called me and we chatted for hours the next day and I made plans with a male friend for that evening/night. At the evening of the second day of our dating, I am chilling in my friend's place and chatting with my gf my friend tells me he can postopone the drinking and the bro time seeing me so happy, smiling so dumb and mindless on the phone like that, which makes me feel guilty (yep, I am one of those people who always tries to make every single damn person happy) and this leads me to just tell him I can talk to her later. Which is you know, something any decent human being would have expected from their gf. Then I think of another way to both chat with my gf in between and also spend some bro time with my friend who also paid for half of the drink and a 5 years long friend. The Idea is: I will simply ask to go to the bathroom from time to time (and it won't make him sus since I have type 1 diabetes) and type her there. Though it sounded like a fine idea at that time I was shocked to see her having blocked me on skype with last things she told me being and I quote ""That doesn't make sense, it's so stupid!""

I’ll go first.. (LONG POST)

So my ex boyfriend and I were dating for almost a year, seeing each other every chance we could. Then my work schedule changed and so did his, We were seeing each other 3 days a week and not the usual 5 days. He then got a 2nd job, I helped him with his interview and all and he got it. He was working a day time job and a night shift job, he had a few hours of sleep a day. But he made it work, so when we started seeing each other 1 -2 days a week it was all good I told him I understand and no worries we will make it work. Then about 6 months later I wanted to surprise him with breakfast early in the morning so I go to his place early with food. He had an empty bottle of wine 🍷 in his room, I asked him if he dank it all on his own and he said yes, you got me into wine so I liked this one. I didn’t think much of it because I thought he has two jobs and he doesn’t have time to do anything like that. A month or so later we made plans to meet up for tacos. I got to the place and he called me saying he was there…turns out we were at two different locations so I told him no worries I’ll go there it’s not far and he got mad saying forget it. He called a bit later saying no worries he was home maybe some other time. Everything in my mind was telling me to go there but I said no I am upset and won’t make things better so I went home. A few weeks later my coworker told me I know who is messing with your man. We met up and she let me read all the text on her phone and all. He had been lying for months and the girl found me through a picture he posted of me on his Facebook and showed it to my coworker and she recognized who I was. Turns out the bottle of wine 🍷 was shared with her, and the night we were going to meet for tacos 🌮 and he left home, he texted her to go over and spend time with him. To make matters worst he was living with his cousin because his apartment was being fixed. I asked the girl he was with if she gets along with his cousins family because when I went over we all got along so well and wanted to know if they were in all this too. She said “No, I sneak in through his bedroom window at night.” I confronted him and he just denied 🙅🏻‍♂️ it all and I just got up walked away and moved on with my life. This was the hardest relationship I ever had to get over. 

Now two years later this man shows up at my doorstep telling me he wants me back &amp; he made a big! He showed up with a large amount of money saying I’ll let you hold this for me &amp; if I cheat or lie you can keep it all! I agree!

He called me the first night and asked if I needed anything. At first I said no and then said I needed help with dinner, but his work schedule didn’t allow him to help with that in a reasonable time so he didn’t do anything. The next night he called to just talk about himself and didn’t even ask how I was doing. The third day, when I was still sick, he again didn’t ask how I was doing and instead asked if I would go over to his place to meet some of his friends.

At first, I politely declined the invitation and told him I was still feeling sick but that he could hang out with them without me. He understood my decline but didn’t think to apologize for failing to check in on how I was doing or for making the request. So then I told him I felt unsupported that week and that the invitation to meet his friends had created extra stress. I explained that the stress was because I was sick and because I’d have to travel to his place to meet them. I said I would be up for seeing him more often if he came to my place on occasion, especially when I’m sick (I’d been traveling to his place exclusively for over a month at that point). I also said I had been excited for our initial plan of him cooking dinner for me later that week, especially since he hadn’t cooked for me yet, but meeting new people spontaneously is stressful for an introvert who’s sick. 

That’s when things took a turn. He got mad at me for explaining my reasons. He placed the blame for feeling unsupported on me not asking him for specific things. I explained that I have trouble asking for help, and even knowing what I need when I’m sick, but he just kept being defensive. He also claimed that I used being sick as a jumping off point to talk about other topics that I had been intentionally withholding from him. I explained that I had only recent thought about the location issue and that, as an introvert, it’s hard for me to bring things up unless I’ve fully thought it through. He still proceeded to accuse me of basically setting him up for failure.

I told him I was frustrated that he was acting defensively versus showing empathy. I said it’s important because, for me, a sign of someone’s character is how they treat someone who’s sick. That set him off on an hour-long rampage of yelling about how I’m abusive because I made a character attack. I fairly quickly said that he was right, that I should not have broadened the issue from a specific instance to his entire character. Then he got mad at me for saying he was right but not saying “I’m sorry” and yelled a specific apology that he wanted me to repeat back to him. He never apologized for the concerns I shared or for calling me abusive. He spiraled even further later that night, saying a bunch of horrendous things about my character and skills.

Lillian has wanted to be a doctor since she was in 5th grade. She used to slack off hard in school, get detentions regularly, and do poorly academically until we told her that if she wanted to be a doctor, she'd have to learn professional behavior and get good grades. I honestly think that is what turned her around.

She got into a top public university and was premed when she initially started college at 17.

However, she suffered from mental health problems in college, even withdrew for a semester or two, and did not do so well in organic chemistry.

Ultimately, Lily graduated a semester later than intended with a degree in economics, cum laude.

She got a great internship AND job right after. I felt that was life telling her she was meant to be a businesswoman, not a doctor.

My wife ""Bianca"" is an accountant, but her mom ""Danielle"" was an anesthesiologist and it was stressful as hell. Dani never had time for her kids and was always stressed about work. Similarly, my brother in law ""Tom"" did medical school abroad because he did not grow up in the US.

Tom's a smart dude, but had to pass board exams and failed a few times. Tom and his wife ""Kelly"" lived in a VHCOL city with 2 kids, and they were surviving on his wife's income. Kelly would call my wife sobbing because they were so stressed about being new parents on so little money and because she didn't know if Tom would ever pass.

I reminded Lillian that medicine wasn't for the faint of heart. I told her that the most intelligent and resilient relatives in our family were cracking under pressure; so how could she withstand it when she cracked in college?

However, today, despite our warnings, Lillian called us and showed us this ""presentation"" about how she was trying to apply to medical school in 2029.

We were aghast. For one, she already earns great money, so why pivot? It makes no sense to attend medical school financially.

Moreover, we are worried that Lillian will not survive medical school - that she will be left with 6 figures of debt with no medical degree or not match into residency. Her science grades are not the strongest. She earned a B- in Orgo 1 in undergrad and some B+'s in math and statistics. Her STEM GPA is a 3.5-3.6.

We are getting old and are both close to 60 at this point. We want to know that we can retire in peace and that she's on her way to a better place instead of taking on risky ventures like med school.

My SIL AND BIL"" Zach"" and ""Olivia"" have 2 kids, one of which also took risk by founding startups. It was stressful for Zach and Olivia, who had to pay Nadine's expensive NY rent and worry about Nadine ever getting a real job.

I'm not as soft as them; I'm putting a stop to this right away.

My Dad passed unexpectedly in late August and while going through his phone I found messages between my him and my brother that just made me sad. I ended up reaching out to my brother because I felt he should know about his Dad and to introduce myself (I never knew how to contact him before). He was understandably very sad and had lots of questions so we began communicating. His last conversation with my Dad ended with him saying something along the lines of ""if you really love me you will bring me to America"" and I saw where my Dad was looking into the process and he left us both contact information for an attorney.

We work at the same place, and I own a car, so I'm our usual ride to and from work (as well as anywhere else we go.) We have a fairly new mutual friend group formed from work, and they want to stay out late and hang out most nights. This usually consists of getting dinner someplace, smoking weed, listening to music, literally just chilling. The only problem is we tend to stay up late and it can push 3, 4am sometimes, even with a day shift in the morning. I personally am alright with this, as actually having friends who want to hang out with me just as much as I do with them is absolutely thrilling. I've had very very little social interaction outside of my family since graduating highschool. 

My sister, however, really dislikes staying up late. She gets really uncomfortable and anxious and tends to beg me to go home around 12 or 1 (for reference we finish closing up the store around 11:30.) We talked about it and I tried to compromise, offering to drop her off or such. She told me that being separated from me at night would just make her even more anxious and worried, so she'd rather just hang out at night and not bring it up. She keeps telling me she's being forced to stay up late and doesn't get to do anything she wants because she'd rather be with me, but I'm not budging on my decision to be out late in the first place. I am so sick of constantly being around her. I love her so much, but I feel like the fact that she has such extreme levels of anxiety over me staying out late is just making me anxious and uncomfortable as well. On top of how my parents see me, I feel like I'm stuffed into a box. 

I was going to drive over to the store after closing to hang out with my newfound friends yet again in a couple of hours, and she originally did not want to come. However, earlier she changed her mind, and instantly starting saying how she didn't want to stay up super late. This means I'd have to go as well, because she gets upset when I don't. 

I don't know. AITA for wanting to spend more time with my friends?

Wooh ! I’m a student with a really stressful schedule : my work place is three hours away from my school. And the day after my bday I have important exams. 

Yesterday was my cousin (M)s 15bday and every year we celebrate together with family since we’re only 8 days apart. We’ve been doing it at my uncle (J)s place for the past 5 years. This year my grandparents chose the date cause it was the only one they were free for. They’re staying at our place for night. They decided to celebrate my bday on the exact day since it’s a Sunday. 

My mom send a message in the family group chat inviting them over to which my uncle answered “It’s better at our place.” 

From there my mom agreed and offered to bring stuff and J didn’t answer. Them hosting means that I won’t be able to chose anything on the menu or even cook (which I love doing). My aunt always denies everything we make when she’s hosting. She really cares about doing everything to M’s taste (I’m fine with it, he’s younger so I decided not to care since it makes him and her happy). 

Now I don’t usually get mad but I got pissed seeing this. I told my family at lunch I found my uncle’s answer really inconsiderate and dismissive and that we should be able to host my bday since it’s on the exact day and that I was tired of always celebrating it at Js. My parents promised to convince them next year since this time was « settled ». 

I told my family : “no worries then. I just won’t be coming. Like he said, it’ll better at his place right ? Just without me.”

My mom told me that I’ve come to the age where I can make my own decisions although she would appreciate that I reconsider in favor of J’s plans.

Now here are j’s reasons according to my mom : 
- he has 4 kids and the lil one 5F has a friend’s bday party to attend to on the same day. 
- My grandparents picked the date and he had to do with it.

Im considering going over to a friend for the weekend. My dad said it was fine but my mom was clearly upset. I just feel sad that my uncle feels free the deny my mom’s invitation like that after complaining to her about my grandparents for almost an hour and without asking if we were fine with it. 

I don’t expect my birthday to be the most important thing for my family but I would have liked to host it since it was on the exact day. I would’ve liked to be able to cook… 

I’ll go with whatever. I’m just sad that it had to be settled before I could say a thing.

last night while i was cooking dinner she was talking to me and mentioned that a friend bought her another ""toy"" and at this point i was really annoyed and flipped out on her telling her that she is so pathetic to make her friends get her personal things that she wants instead of buying it her self with her own money.

So AITA for calling her pathetic?

I have never been close with any of them but still made the effort to see them as often as I could, but as I got older and life got in the way it got harder to see them. When I was younger I didn’t have much of a relationship with my dad and then when I was 17 (now 27), my mum and dad got divorced due to the fact my dad was just a lousy husband. 

It’s not been until adulthood that I’ve realised why my mum left him but he, and the rest of that side of the family, are pretty narcissistic. 

All they ever talk about is themselves, I’m never asked how I am/how my partner is, how’s work, life etc it’s always about them, what they are up to, who has died recently (anyone else’s grandparents like this?!).

As I’ve gotten older, settled down with my partner and had our son it feels like it’s been more noticeable to me and I’m fed up. When I was pregnant there was no effort to ask how I am, or to come and see me it was always ‘when are YOU coming to see US’ or I’d get ‘I’ve not seen ____ in a while’ and almost guilt tripped into visiting. When asked what gifts to buy my new baby I advised exactly what I wanted and needed and the opposite was bought. 

My dad has been with his new partner for about 7 years and I’m not overly bothered about that relationship, she is lovely and harmless. However my dad is constantly bringing up her daughter and speaking about her and her achievements. I constantly got compared to her whilst pregnant, she has 2 kids (she is 24) and it was always ___ has this you should get it, ____ did this when she was pregnant you should do that. She is also married, I’m not bothered about marriage. She bought her house and is now on her 3rd house (due to the fact her husband family gave her the deposit), I rent and have been in the same property for 6 years and I love it, I can’t afford to buy! My dad and his side of the family have told me multiple times how much of a waste of money renting is and how you’re just paying someone else’s mortgage (even though he is now a landlord so clearly doesn’t mind it happening when he is involved?)

I appreciate this is mainly about my dad but the same behaviours are across the whole of his side of the family. It just genuinely upsets me and I get annoyed being compared to my dads gf daughter. I get no enjoyment in seeing them but still make the effort to avoid the guilt trip.

My girlfriend(32) and I(35) have been together for about four years now. Me and my wife decided to have a baby after months of me begging, and just a few weeks ago she gave birth to my first baby girl. I love my baby, but recently my wife has been a big problem. I work long hours, and i'm the bread winner in the relationship so my wife stays home with the baby, recently i noticed that my wife still hasn't put off most of the pregnancy weight after weeks of giving birth, a few days ago i mentioned to my wife that she's looking a little chubby and squeezed her belly. She looked at me a little annoyed and told me it's because she spends all her time taking care of the baby and the house, I let it go them but the flabby belling kept bothering me, and would touch me while we slept I hate it! So  yesterday i brought it up again and said a responsible woman would lose weight after getting pregnant so they could be attractive. She blew up at me and said, she can't because she's busy, and if i took the time to help her out instead of coming home and complaining she could! she also said she is fine with how she looks and she'll work out when **she's** ready! I was annoyed and said i don't want to make love with such a flabby person and she should have thought about that before getting pregnant. She screamed at me that I was the one who wanted the baby and forced it on her! I said i never forced her and only asked to have a baby and she agreed to it, and her body is her problem and i shouldn't be blamed for it. Well she got pissed called me an asshole took my daughter and left for her mothers. Apparently she told hers and my parents, because now i'm getting yelled at by my mom and dad. I tried explaining myself but they said what i did was horrible and i need to apologize, I said no and I don't have to apologize and she should apologize to me for overreacting!

My oldest sister has always been reckless with money, has no goals in life, I know she has past trauma but I honestly just don’t care.

Since I was 14, I have been working, giving all my money to my mum to support the household as she’s physically unable to work and my oldest sister loses every job she gets, she always seems to lose her job after a month or so because she turns up late all the time or just doesn’t go in. My mum and her are always arguing as she comes home drunk (my mum is a Muslim and doesn’t drink) and she leaves alcohol bottles all over the place, near my mums praying spaces etc. She’s always yelling about how hard her life is and she’s a victim and she’s always helping us and we take advantage of her kindness(she’s taken my mum to maybe 10 hospital appointments in the last 20 years). She cries that she’s depressed and we are stressing her out when we try to question her behaviour and get her help. 

I’ve had to be the breadwinner and worked throughout school and worked full time whilst studying a full time degree as well, without me, she wouldn’t even have a roof over her head, I have been paying for all the bills since I was a child. She’s never thanked me, she’s never shown any gratitude that I’ve had to deal with every single financial issue in this house. I am now in a position where I can afford to move out into my own place and I’m leaving next month. We currently live in government supported housing and I’ve arranged for my mum to move into a one bedroom flat and I’ve told my sister she has one month to move out as mum’s new place is only a one bedroom and the local council won’t let her live there as it’ll be overcrowded. I have refused to tell her the new address and told her if she moves in with mum, I will report her for overcrowding the flat. 

Since then she’s been telling all of our extended family that I’m making her homeless, kicking her out in the street, that I’m the asshole.

Wooh ! I’m a student with a really stressful schedule : my work place is three hours away from my school. And the day after my bday I have important exams. 

Yesterday was my cousin (M)s 15bday and every year we celebrate together with family since we’re only 8 days apart. We’ve been doing it at my uncle (J)s place for the past 5 years. This year my grandparents chose the date cause it was the only one they were free for. They’re staying at our place for night. They decided to celebrate my bday on the exact day since it’s a Sunday. 

My mom send a message in the family group chat inviting them over to which my uncle answered “It’s better at our place.” 

From there my mom agreed and offered to bring stuff and J didn’t answer. Them hosting means that I won’t be able to chose anything on the menu or even cook (which I love). My aunt always denies everything we make when she’s hosting. She really cares about doing everything to M’s taste (which I’m fine with, he’s younger so I decided not to care if that makes them happy) and making sure everyone knows SHE did it.  

Now I don’t usually get mad but I got pissed seeing this. I told my family at lunch I found my uncle’s answer really inconsiderate and dismissive and that I should be able to host my bday since it’s on the exact day and that I was tired of always celebrating it at Js. My parents agreed, promised to convince them next year since this time was « settled ». 

I told my family : “no worries then. I just won’t be coming. Like he said, it’s better at his place right ?”

My mom told me that I’ve come to the age where I can make my own decisions but that she would still appreciate me coming. 

Now here are j’s reasons according to my mom : 
- he has 4 kids and the lil one 4F has a friend bday party to attend to (not mine). 
- My grandparents chose the date and he had to do with it.

Considering going over to a friend for the weekend, I know it’s petty. I just feel sad that my uncle feels free the deny my mom’s invitation like that after complaining to her for an hour about my grandparents picking the date and without asking if she, we, were fine with it. 

I don’t expect my birthday to be the most important thing for my family but I would have liked to host it since it was on the exact day. I would’ve liked to be able to cook. 

I’ll go with whatever. I’m just sad that it had to be settled before I could say a thing.

He passed away suddenly six years ago, while I was in another country studying abroad for the first time in my life. His death was obviously extremely devastating to our small family and has taken me years to learn to live with. In the years since, my mother has since found the new love of her life and I have grown to support them, even with multiple hiccups along the road. She and her new husband were in an LDR for three years across the pandemic while I have been in college. He and his children moved into my family home about a month ago while I was still on my college campus. But here’s the kicker: I have yet to meet him or his three children IRL and will do so for the first time ever during Thanksgiving break. She also previously pranked me about a year into their relationship, and told me that they were engaged to be married, without my ever meeting him or seeing his face. I broke down in tears before she revealed that her story was a “prank” to see how I would react to their marriage one day. With this history in mind, their relationship has definitely been an awkward fact of life and was not the most well-introduced. 

On a separate note, she and her new husband chose to have a small court wedding yesterday, coincidentally the same day my paternal grandfather was laid to rest in our home country. It’s obviously a quite difficult time for me, especially as I couldn’t attend either event and because the simultaneity of these ceremonies is haunting. I spoke with my mother about setting some boundaries before I visit home tomorrow, to ensure that this week doesn’t come with any tension and that I am given time to acclimate to the new household structure. During this conversation, I also asked specifically about my father’s clothing which she told me she had partially given away to her new husband, without my knowledge. (I found this out only because she sent a photo of him wearing my father’s clothing which disturbed me deeply as I haven’t seen anyone wear my dad’s clothing in years, apart from the few select pieces she has allowed me to keep over the years.) I asked if she could give me my father’s clothing to keep as I have nothing tangible of his left, besides being his living and breathing daughter (she kept his favorite tech and pretty much everything of his, besides one jacket of his that I took when he first died and another that I found and asked to keep). She told me that I needed to understand that I could have SOME of his clothing, not all, that she was his wife before I was ever born, and that this decision was FINAL. I just want to know if I am overshooting/being entitled or if someone sees the validity in my stance: as my father’s sole daughter, his clothing is the last tangible thing of his I might ever claim and her new husband shouldn’t get dibs on ANY of it.

Although the university I go to isn't that far from my place (45 mins approx without rush hour traffic) I still thought it would be important to kinda gain this experience.
For some background info, I have OCD and BPD because of which the past few years have been very cruel on me. I knew I wasn't ready for this major change but still pushed myself as a means of overcoming my fears.

My parents are generally supportive but they don't really think mental health is a very important factor so a lot of times I've been dismissed by them. While applying for the hostel, right before my dad paid the fees he had specifically told me that this is an expensive payment and asked if I was totally sure.
Ofc I nodded and he went ahead with it. Now, about 2 months in, I'm having the worst experience ever in hostel.
I feel lonely, disconnected and have started having nightmares about my hostel room, not to mention the almost daily breakdowns.
I've been home since the past 2 weeks and even though I'm not in the best position mentally, it is FAR better than the situation in hostel.
I want to withdraw and come back home because I don't mind traveling the distance daily now (initially I had a misunderstanding and thought it would take about 2 hrs to travel which would really exhaust me)

The biggest problem however is the fee policy. The university clearly states that if you withdraw after having stayed for 2 months or more, they will not refund the fees.
The fees were really expensive and the thought of all that money going to waste is killing me with guilt but at the same time, I'm finally being able to cope with academics and take them seriously after a long time and don't want to jeopardize my mental health on purpose again.
I've spoken about feeling low whenever I go there with my parents but haven't talked to them about leaving yet. Knowing my parents, I'm sure this conversation will cause a lot of drama and honestly I'm just in a frail state rn and can't take fights.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4810661,public,top,self,WIBTA if I withdraw from hostel after my parents specifically warned me about this potential situation?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0lu8p/wibta_if_i_withdraw_from_hostel_after_my_parents/,all_ads,6,,,,

We would stay one week and have thanksgiving there. He told me my girlfriend (27f) could come but she would have have to pay for herself. She could neither afford or get off work for it. This was pretty saddening as I would really like her to go and spend thanksgiving with her. She feels like I should just stay home for the holiday instead of going on a fancy vacation since she can’t come. 

I’ve been working pretty hard getting my repair shop started for the past couple years. I also finally got to a place where I have enough trained employees that I can leave for a week if need be. This would be my first real vacation in a while. I thought about it and talked it over with my dad and he said he could compromise and switch the days we go. My mom, sister and sisters daughter would go thanksgiving week, and then we would leave the day after thanksgiving. This compromise was not good enough for her and she still thinks it’s rude of me to go without her. 

Now I could see if it was something I also had to for myself, or if I was just going on vacation by myself then this would be weird. I hoped that since it was a family vacation that she’d be cooler with it but she is just not. I hope I’m not being a bad boyfriend. She’s been giving me the silent treatment lately.

When i was 17 I lost a pregnancy, it really fucked me up, my good friend at the time lost hers a month after so it was honestly chaos and I didn't have a whole lot of support. I turned to drugs to cope and ended up almost in cardiac arrest one night, my best friend almost watched me die. That was the night I told my mother I'd not only been pregnant but lost it, I never told her before that because I was 17 and I knew, I just knew I'd get kicked out. When my friend lost hers my mother made sure to bring her to our house and comfort her through it. Meanwhile I was looking for somewhere else to live....I moved out less than 2 months after losing it (I want to note I wasn't ""kicked out"" but when your . Right before I moved out my sibling and I got into a fight, admittedly I called their father a junkie because they called me one (I smoked weed, their father is a known needle user, so is mine though so jokes on me ig) they just looked me dead in the eyes and said and I qoute,because it's always stuck with me ""I hope you get pregnant again, but I hope this one dies in your arms"", it almost turned physical after that on their part so I packed a bag and that was the first time I ever ran away from home,  I have since apologized for the comment i made because I know that comment was out of line but no apology or acknowledgement from them on that so far.

Fast forward to this year, it's the beginning of March and i was living with said sibling (they moved in with me a few months prior) and period was late so off I go to take a test,positive. Immediately ran into said siblings room freaking to show her, To cut that long story short though, unfortunately that one ended in miscarriage to and right here I want to note that I have medical documentation/kept the tests for both of these. 

The other day I got a call and it was my mother,she mentioned my sibling had unfortunately just lost a pregnancy and that she was having to be extra nice to them right now because they're struggling and I just....I'm hurt. I'm angry. And I'm struggling to find the sympathy for my sibling, I hate that they know this pain now but I also hate that they're receiving love and support and I got verbal abuse and told at 17 ""if you get pregnant before you move out again you'll be on the fuckn streets""  for years my mother has called me a whore a slut and a liar. She held my dead babies test and lil knitted booties infront of me and screamed for about 15 minutes about how i was a liar and to just admit it. I have offered to show her the paperwork,she refused. She even went as far to accuse me of stealing a test and the clothes off my old friend who has a kiddo.

She's the daughter of my sister, Ellie (f30).

Ellie's always been your 'health nut' type of person, and for the last 3 months she's been sticking to a 'all natural carnivore' diet. She only eats unseasoned meat, eggs or butter and anything else is unacceptable. More power to her because honestly I could never do something like that.

For my niece's birthday party, Ellie did a barbecue in their backyard. She made it very clear on the invites that all the food will be meat-based and even seemed to brag about it.

I've been a vegetarian since I was 12, and I've been a vegan for 2 years. I'm also kind of a picky eater, which I know can be annoying, it's why I never eat out.

I messaged Ellie and told her I'll bring my own food to the party. Ellie got super offended and said that bringing your own food to a party is rude and told me I can go without food for a few hours. At this point, I'm pretty sure Ellie is just trying to be annoying because she knows I'm vegan. I told her if she's so dead-set on me not bringing my own food to eat then I just won't go.

Ellie told me I'm being petty and to just suck it up, and that it's my niece's party and she doesn't need me 'pushing my agenda'. I called her ridiculous and told her if me eating my own lunch at a party upsets her so much she needs to evaluate her priorities. Ellie told me to go fuck myself and said I'm just being sensitive.

I was so mad and ended up not going to my niece's birthday party because it was clear that Ellie didnt want me there and I didn't want to cause drama in front of the kids. Ellie is now pissed at me for not going and said that I really upset my niece and that I'm a terrible aunt.
