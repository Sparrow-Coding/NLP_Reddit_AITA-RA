My spouse and I are having issues with pregnancy. It's been years and no luck. We're going to try fertility treatments but if that doesn't work, my best friend since elementary school has graciously agreed to be our surrogate. She basically says while being pregnant isn't her favorite thing, she would be honored to help us with this. 

I admit, I did mention it to her first, in a half-joking type of way that I'd pay her whatever she wanted to do it and, to my surprise, she accepted with no hesitation. She is only asking for a ""mommy makeover"" surgery after the birth because since the birth of her children, she's unhappy with her body. I happily agreed and offered more financial compensation, to which she declined. 

I know she wouldn't do this for anyone else - because I know how much she loves me and how strong our bond is. Again, nothing is in stone, this is just our backup plan if I can't carry my own child.

Enter - my mother - who tells me how selfish I am and how I'm taking advantage of my friend. She says things like, ""You know how much Friend hated being pregnant!"" ""She's only doing this because she's always worshiped the ground you walked on and felt like she couldn't say no."" ""You're bribing her with this mommy makeover surgery!"" 'She should be the one to offer that to you.""

Friend and I have known each other for our entire lives, basically - she has had no problem AT ALL setting boundaries throughout the years. I have asked her multiple times if she's serious, I would never be mad at her if she wants to back out, etc. But she's assured me she WANTS to do this. She

Some months ago I saw an advert looking for someone for a certain artistic endeavour that I'd been interested in trying for a while although I had no experience. I didn't even know it was a paid job, but it turned out well and ever since they have been consistently calling me for more work, totaling 4-6 hours for month netting me 1/4-1/3 of the minimum wage after taxes. 

This side job requires being a native speaker of my language and in my native country as well as others where the same language is spoken it it usually necessary to take a paid course lasting anywhere between 1 month and 1 year. I didn't have any sort of training; I just happened to be naturally good at it. It's also something people find interesting so when it comes up in conversation people tend to ask a lot about it.

Recently I was at an international networking meetup which I attended introducing myself with my corporate, full time job. We got a large group going on including two people from countries with the same native language as mine. At some point my side job was mentioned, people asked the usual questions (how did you get the job, is it hard to do, etc) and the evening went on. 

After this point I noticed that the two people who spoke my language were sort of cold and ignoring me. Well, a few drinks later one of them made a weird comment about me taking all the jobs and I asked what they meant. They explained that they thought I was greedy because it's hard enough being an immigrant without people like me hoarding all the jobs that other immigrants could do. There were also some remarks about my country historically taking advantage of theirs (this is unarguably true) and that I am proof that my country is still ""taking everything"". 

I don't think I'm an asshole because I didn't set out to look for a job in that field, or any second job for that matter, and you need some natural or acquired skills to do it so it's not like anyone who speaks my language can be hired.

I have chosen to live a child free life. I get along well with teenagers, but it when it comes to children under the age of 10 I don’t have any maternal instincts at all. I don’t have any desire to read bedtime stories, to kiss booboos, play make believe, basically all the babysitting responsibilities.
 I decided that I’m going to rent a lake house for a fun filled weekend, but just for the kids 12 and older. At a family get together where the whole family was present, I discreetly gathered all 8 of the “older cousins” and told them the plan. I told them to ask there parents permission for the vacation, but try to keep it secret from the younger ones so feelings wouldn’t be hurt. 
Later on in the night while the adults were chatting and the children were playing out of earshot we began discussing my plan. Some of my siblings thanked me, but others were offended that not all the children were invited. My father, hearing about it for the first time, visibly became upset over my age restriction. He called me a “mean auntie” for excluding half of the cousins on my vacation. I love all of my nieces and nephews, and they are all very well behaved, but I explained to everyone that I didn’t want to worry about babysitting on this trip. And everyone I invited were independent enough to take care of there own basic needs.  My dad rolled his eyes and said “she needs to be a good aunty for once and babysit the little ones. Your siblings have to deal with their younger kids everyday, so you can step up and do it for one weekend.” My mom suggested that instead, I should invite all the cousins, and take shifts with the older kids to babysit so no one feels left out. But I said no. I don’t want us all to worry about babysitting, censoring ourselves around the kiddies, watching kiddy movies and having to go to bed on time and being quiet. I want the older cousins to have a chance to let loose and have fun without worrying about being responsible. 
This whole plan caused a bit of devision in my family. My sister told me that she will not allow jack(15) to go if I will not also bring Jill (7). When I refused to bring Jill she told jack that he couldn’t go because it wouldn’t be fair to Jill. Jack visibly became angry and stormed off, then my father reminded me how all of my older siblings had to babysit me when I was young, and I’m spoiled for not having to experience that, and also that he’s disappointed that I’m causing family drama for being exclusive.
I thought I was doing something nice for planning this vacation but now I’m beginning to regret this whole thing. 
Side note, I make enough money to afford all 15 kids, so money is not a factor.

Long time AITA lurker, first time poster, throwaway account.

I (28 F) was adopted via an open adoption. I have a relationship with my biological mother since I was 12 (""Abby"") but my biological father (""James"") and I never forged the same relationship, for a variety of reasons that won't fit in 3000 characters, but more or less James (understandably) wasn't ready for a child and I never felt that he wanted any type of relationship with me. I learned later that I was kept a secret from his wife and kids until I reached out at age 12.

As the years progressed I developed an interest in learning about that side of myself, but never had a way to reach out to James. After being kept secret for so long, it felt clear he didn't want me involved in his life and he, as the ""adult,"" made no effort to do so. (I realize phones work two ways, but when I was 12-18, I was working through a lot of turmoil with regard to this). Not only from a ""where am I from"" standpoint, but also an understanding of any health concerns I may want to be aware of, as I am aware James' father died when James was fairly young.

I was told that my biological paternal grandmother is alive and would love to speak to me, and eventually gathered the guts to reach out. Once I did, she would only speak to me on her terms (when calling was convenient for her) and not respond to written messages. I tried to meet her where she's at and arrange set times to speak, but she didn't hold to those times either. The few times we did connect, I didn't learn anything substantive and certainly didn't want to rush her into speaking to me about what I wanted to learn, but it continued this way: vague conversations about what she did that day but no enlightenment about my family despite my attempts. The relationship didn't develop any further and we haven't connected in months.

I'm at a point now where I simply want to create a list of questions about my paternal biological family and send it to my biological father for answers. I feel like this could come across as mercenary, but I've been consistently denied this information at every turn. WIBTA for doing this? Is it mercenary or wrong to feel ""entitled"" to this information?

Amy brought her dog “Max” with her. (Max is about 5 and a medium-sized spaniel mix for reference.) I explained to Amy beforehand that I really didn’t want pets because we don’t have time for them, especially a dog. But Amy insisted that she would handle everything related to Max, so I allowed her to move in with Max.

This dog has been disrupting our entire household since Amy brought it into the house. Max pisses or shits in the house at least every other day. I’ve caught Amy pretending not to notice the piss/shit and trying to wait until someone else cleans it up. Whenever I text Amy that Max pissed/shit in the house, she just texts back “Lmao” and acts as if it’s funny.

In the middle of the night (usually 3-4 am) and sometimes in the early morning (5-6 am) Max will bark in the hallway outside our bedrooms non-stop until somebody opens their door. Amy would give him treats or play with him whenever he did this, so he still tries it. We’ve tried moving Max into a crate at night, but he barks non-stop until he’s let out. Even with a towel covering the crate. Earbuds also don’t work. It’s affecting all our sleep schedules, especially Zoe because she has insomnia and struggles to fall back asleep even with melatonin. She is not getting enough sleep because of Max and even her teacher reached out to me because it’s affecting her focus in class. I’ve tried explaining this to Amy, and all she’ll say is “Classic Max, always wants a snack/to play!” (Amy usually sleeps over at her boyfriend’s house. She rarely experiences this and treats Max’s behavior as if it’s funny.)

The last straw is Max’s newest behavior of barreling into people so that they fall down, drop their plates, and then Max can eat the food. Amy saw this firsthand and watched Zoe get hurt because of Max. Amy was playful with Max and again treated it as if it were funny. I told Amy that we needed to talk now. I sat down with Amy in a different room and told her that we cannot deal with her dog’s behavior anymore and that she needs to either re-home Max in the next few weeks or move out with him. Amy and Max are currently staying with Amy’s boyfriend.

Now Amy’s aunt, grandmother, and three of her friends have reached out to tell me I was wrong in this situation. They pointed out that Amy has been a great houseguest aside from the issues relating to Max. And Amy’s had Max since he was a puppy and it would be unimaginable for her to just give him away. They are saying it is my own fault because I did not/am not willing to train Max more thoroughly to help correct these issues. But that’s exactly why I warned Amy in the first place against moving Max in because I don’t have the time to train him.

Ever since I moved in with her it feels like everyone says she is using me, whether emotionally, financially, or whatever she needs at the time (nothing physical or sexual, she has a bf) and manipulating me but I did not see it at the time. When I first moved in, I had to argue with her about letting me pay for my part of the rent, utilities, etc. She's always had a temper and we've had our share of disagreements and arguments but I didn't realize until I started thinking back on it that I was always the first to apologize( I fear there may be some gaslighting involved as well).

This past year is really when I have begun to pick up on what everyone was talking about. I'm beginning to realize she has no respect for me or my boundaries, barely helps around the house, spends all her money, and it's heartbreaking because I truly view her as family. With everyone else telling me that I need to do what's best for me, my mind is screaming that I'm abandoning her and I feel like no matter what choice I make it will be the wrong one. We also have pets so on top of stressing about myself, I refuse to leave any of the animals (3 cats, 3 rats, and a ball python) in her care for fear they would be neglected. 

I can't afford a place by myself with rent the way it is especially with pets (fees are absolutely RIDICULOUS) but I feel like I need to get away before I truly can't.

Fast forward a year and we receive an email asking if she will be returning to the course from the learning group (a separate company to where she was employed. 
After looking into this we found out as part of her contract she shouldn’t have paid any learning fees so we messaged the boss and let him know this. A flurry of text messages occurred where he called me all the names under the Sun, greedy, selfish immoral etc, for asking for her wages but he did eventually say he would look into it. 
After a week or so he apologised and said he can pay her the missing wages which was only a couple of hundred quid or the furlough of about £400 for that month. At this stage we asked for her wageslips as we thought she had earned more than that and also that we couldn’t accept the furlough as she had been back at work so would basically be fraud. Wageslips arrived and it turned out he had claimed furlough for 2 months after she had left. 
Investigation by me ensues. They wouldn’t provide her any information and even after DSAR wouldn’t give her the full info. But from what we could see for the whole time she was there she wasn’t paid all her holidays or for her learning hours. A HR rep contacted us and said they would calculate her contracted work  hours because they couldn’t find a record of her hours (supposed to be kept for 2 years) so this didn’t include learning hours or overtime or holiday pay. They actually gave us a negative figure but as a gesture of goodwill wouldn’t seek this. 
So by this stage we had some evidence but not for the entire period her learning hours hadn’t been paid, we also discovered they were paying less than national apprenticeship rate and they had been fraudulently claiming furlough after she left. We also roughly calculated my daughter was owed almost £1500
We had no contact from them after this. I reported them to ISO and the furlough fraud line and for not paying minimum wage.

We are together for over one Year at this point.

What troubles me is that She now has three apps where you swipe on people and then chat if you match. (Wink, Swipr, F3)

I generally call them Dating apps eventho some of them are not for Dating. But imo the community on such apps look for that type of content so it does apply.

She also has a ""Dating Game"" on her phone last time i saw. In the game you swipe and Chat with Fictional Characters and even go on Virtual Dates.

I feel pretty uncomfortable with all of this. In my mind it looks like she wants to Date other ppl or something along those lines.

I have talked with her about it (at that point she just got Wink). I told her that i dont feel comfortable with the idea of her being on an app like that.

She responded with that she just wants to make new Friends. (She only has 2 real good friends as far as i know). This was abt 6 Months ago. (5-6 Months into the relationship).

After that the next time i saw her phone i saw that she had a new app just the same (Swipr). I asked her abt it and i got the same responds.

I also asked her why her setting for ""looking for"" was on Guys only. She just said that some Girls were trying to get her to sell and stuff like that and that she didnt get stuff like that from any Guys and she wants some Guy friends too.

At this point she also got that ""Dating Game"" i mentioned earlier.

1 Month later she now got the 3rd App called F3. I talked with her Today and asked her why she kept making new accounts on apps like that.

She just keeps blocking me out and says that she just wants to make more friends(as far as i know nothing came of the ppl she meet until now).

I jokingly asked her if shes gonna get more apps like that. She said that she would surely if she wanted to and that it is not my problem to ask her abt.

Today also she made a new snap account since her old one was supposedly ""Buggy"". She didnt add me btw, i added her after i looked in my recommendations and saw her profile.

I saw tho that she asked Guys on all of those 3 apps to add her snap. As far as i know noone added her or she added noone, but she obv didnt let me see.

I just keep questioning myself and her if she is really trying to get friends or if she is looking for someone else to get together with.

I know this myb doesnt bring forward all of my thoughts and all that happend. But if someone has a opinnion on this and can myb tell me if iam Overthinking it ?

My mother has been inviting my brother (23m) who is in the middle range of autism but comprehends everything. He mainly used to just be quite obsessive whilst younger. 

Although, I clarified to my mother that I didn’t want him to come especially after the blackouts he experiences, which could be seen as harsh on my behalf but let me explain.

Ever since I was younger he would experience these blackouts where he did unspeakable things or he would obsessively make my “look” perfect. A hair strand poking out he would have to put it back in place or shirt creased he would make me iron it.

When i saw him it was all well ends well, until, he thought he could be the mastermind and change my look. This time it was weird. I was wearing a mini skirt and I had a visible thong lining when i would bend down or get something (so it wasn’t inappropriate as that was just how my skirt was even though it wasn’t visible whilst standing straight). 

When I went to go get my baked cinnamon rolls, my brother felt the excessive need to pull up my mini skirt whilst I was still bent over, claiming that it was “pissing him off”. Okay, that’s strike one. 

Later that evening, I got a bit drunk and was dancing when my brother came back behind me again and did the same thing. 

I just saw red and told him to leave. My mother called me unreasonable but i said “it’s my house, my rules”. My brother claimed that he didn’t want to be weird it was just “annoying him”. I still made him leave.

My father told me that I was purposely humiliating him and not being empathetic.

Sorry in advance english is not my native language, snd I live in a conservative country.

There was this guy I(33f)l met online who lived in far away city. We had been chatting he was a just a little bit flirty(sending appropriate photos and sharing our day etc)and I liked talking to him a lot as he seemed to understand me. He is 30 but still in university. It came to a point where he told me although he thinks I am marriage material, he feels out of my league and wants to keep communication as friends. I was okay with that, I met a couple of guys near me and I was telling him about them, he was giving me sound advice etc. 

After a couple of weeks, he suddenly grew distant, it felt strange but I let it go, thought he met someone too. He then told me he had been talking to his ex while chatting with me for the last two weeks. He told her ex about being friends with me and she was uncomfortable. After that I stopped flirting and told him if she feels uncomfortable we can stop talking completely. He kept reassuring me that we are just friends there is nothing wrong etc. Even for 2 weeks I confronted him about still complimenting and flirting with me, he says he is sorry he made a mistake there was nothing certain with him and his ex, our chats and theirs are different we were friendly where as they were sexting etc. I still felt uncomfortable being even a tiny bit flirty with him not telling me he was trying to rekindle a relationship. He never even met this girl in real life and she was long distance also which sounded weird but there was the pandemic they couldn't meet later broke up etc. I was sorry and wanted to end the communication, he made a speech that went like we both had decided we have different life paths and we wanted to be just friends, he will never try to flirt again but wanted to see me find happiness as he knew about my relationship struggles at this point. It was emotional and it really got me. 

A few weeks later he decided to end things with his ex. I tried to give him advice to calm down and solve their problems as he was so in love with her the way he talked about her. I encouraged him to go meet her but he didn't have any money plus he kept telling me it was becoming toxic. I felt bad that if I was the cause but he kept reassuring me it was not.

And again a few weeks later he began to flirt with me once again. I did ask him to stop but this time it is a bit harder. I did confront him once again he apologized and told me he actually is kinda addicted to me at this point.

 It's not finalized. 

If it stays as is I will have her for her birthday the day before his days with her. 

As a peace offering I brought up the idea that I could bring her to her grandmas(his mom) for her birthday and let then ha e her for the night too. So we'd all celebrate her first birthday together. 

Since then her dad and I have had some arguments over petty bs. I still don't feel safe around this man at all. It kills me to have to do the exchanges in the first place but since I wasn't exactly recording the abuse there's not a whole lot of proof so the court has to do what they gotta do and I respect that. 

I have also had issues with his mom not respecting me as her mom. Best example is she will deny me access to seeing her if she has her because her son says no. No other reason behind it. (Ie daughter was sick and I asked if I could just see her for 5 min she says it's up to him and he always says no and she's cool with that.) She's asked to take her an extra day this weekend for a Christmas event and was willing to not let me see her when I asked if her son said no and he wasn't even going to sed event. 

So now I'm worried that her first birthday will be ruined by drama. 
I have decorations picked out and a theme since she was 6months. 

I just want it to be a fun little event where I can take pictures of her smashing a Lil cake and having a good time.

They get along great since I adopted my puppy (with my parent's permission). My dad works outdoors and comes across stray or wild animals all the time, and sometimes brings them home to show and release back to the wild or sometimes to keep (we had one of the most gentle rott-mix for 13 years this way). 

This past weekend, he brought home a Heeler-mix puppy (maybe 6 months old or more) with no collar (and as we found out later, no chip). The first evening, my dog was trying really hard to make friends but the puppy was still too nervous to socialize, which was completely understandable. But that night into the next morning, she was pretty aggressive over the food bowl. We always leave the bowl out for the dogs to eat when they like, and we've never had a dog (including my brother's 4 dogs when they visit) have a problem with resource guarding, including our late rott-mix. This puppy would snap and any dog that got close to the bowl whether she was eating or not. 

During that morning while my dad was at work, my mom asked if I wanted to keep the puppy so my dog had a younger playmate to keep up with her. I said it's not going to work out if she's going to be aggressive over food and might hurt not only my dog but my parent's geriatric dog that's too weak and slow to defend herself or get away. Over the next couple of hours, my mom was texting back and forth with my dad, and my mom said that my dad told her that ""you could leave her at the pound if you want"". My mom and I drove to the local Humane Society and asked to check the puppy for a chip, and when they couldn't find one, they gave me a form to fill out form them to take the puppy (there wasn't any question from them if we wanted to keep the puppy.) They told me if they didn't find the owner after a certain amount of time, they'd call me back and we could get first dibs on adopting her. I figured that was the best we could do, so we went home. 

When we got back my texted my dad about what happened and now he's *extremely* upset, he gave us the silent treatment all night and the next morning. Then over the day while he was at work, he sent my mom a screenshot of the Humane Society intake rules to show that ""we didn't have to give her up so easily"". This morning he sent me a screenshot of her picture on the Lost &amp; Found page with a text saying ""Poor, poor [name]! Look at what you did.""

It's been getting colder here (UK) the past few days but he's seldom put the radiators on in my studio, so I've been layering up, using a thick blanket, hot water bottle, drinking tea and even bought gloves to keep my hands warm.

However, after I started shivering and getting cramp in my foot earlier I bit the bullet and asked my landlord if he could put the heating on for just a bit, letting him know it's been 16*°*C in here the past few days and that's now dropped to 15*°*C and counting.

He quickly replied there's ""not much point"" in putting the heating on for me because it would require heating the whole ground floor when he and everyone else in his family is upstairs. I asked if he had the heating on upstairs and he said yes, suggesting I instead use an electric heater to heat my room. Unfortunately though, I can't really afford to do this... I'm on welfare and am already rationing food to save money.

I completely understand his reluctance to put the heating on in my room when he would be charged for heating adjacent empty rooms, but if he's not prepared to heat my home like he heats his own, is my heating really included in my rent?

As I understand, he's also on a high salary, and of course owns this big house and takes home a lot from my monthly rent alone. Meanwhile, I'm unable to work because of illness, have no one to rely on for financial support and am freezing... if he could even just put it on for a bit to take the edge off the biting cold and let my layers, blanket etc. do the rest, that would help. But he won't.

 i 19 male have a bf named let’s say Jake he is 21 and has gone through 3 car through out the year of 2021-2022 his first car was a 2008 Chrysler Sebring. 

While on the phone texting and driving he crashed into another car and it was totaled in December of 2021. 

In January of 2022 he purchased a used 2017 Toyota Corolla with 20k miles on it it costed him 20,000 he put 3 grand down on it and was financing the car with 4% interest from the dealer ship the monthly payments were 700 a month with full coverage insurance. 

In September of 2022 he said and I quote “I wanna have a car with 0 miles and I wanna drive it off the lot brand new.” 

Later in the month of September he trades in his 2017 Toyota Corolla for a 2022 Toyota Corolla with 9% interest he puts 2 grand down on the car and the total cost for the car was 30,000 with a extended warranty the monthly payments for the car with full coverage insurance is 1000 a month. 

Now in November of 2022 he got into a accident where he was turning off a ramp slide on black ice spun out and hit a sign his bumper got broken and the insurance company towed his car and gave him a rental for now.

The rental is a 2018 Toyota RAV4 he has been driving it for 2 days now and is saying he likes the suv when his car is fixed he wants to trade in his 2022 Toyota Corolla for a Toyota RAV4. 

He makes 35,000 a year i told him that he should just keep the car he has and this sparked into a huge argument between us I told him that it is financially irresponsible to keep switching cars every couple of months and it’s hurting his credit constantly having it pulled for vehicles.

He told me that he doesn’t feel safe driving a corolla I told him he just doesn’t know how to drive in snow and that’s all I said “you should learn how to drive with the car you have before deciding it’s time for a new one”. 

Now today he told me to worry about myself and leave him alone about whatever car he wants to get and that’s his business I simply said ok I’m done with this he is now shopping for a Toyota RAV4 and is constantly asking me does this color look good what about this year I repeated to him im done with this he is now mad at me for not supporting his decision on the car so AITA Reddit.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4813030,public,self,AITA For Telling My Bf He Has To Stop Replacing His Cars,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z195p4/aita_for_telling_my_bf_he_has_to_stop_replacing/,all_ads,6,top,,,,,,

My Uncle is REALLY into James Bond movies, and all the time when we visit him or he visited us growing up he would always want to watch some James Bond movie. My dad also likes James Bond but he's not a diehard fan like my Uncle (Uncle has the complete collection on DVD). My Uncle is kinda rigid and really religious and conservative and he and my dad get along but aren't really super close but would always watch James Bond movies together. 

I've never sat through a whole James Bond film with them but from my understanding, they're just action movies and really sexist and misogynistic and I don't want to watch anything thats degrading to women. 

So of course the first night, my Uncle wants to watch a James Bond movie with my dad and I, and I suggested maybe we watch something else, but my Uncle really wanted to watch James Bond and my dad was fine going along with it so they put in 'Goldfinger'. 

I wasn't interested in watching it so I just tuned out and took out my phone and started texting and doing other stuff. My Uncle asked if I was enjoying the movie and I kinda snapped and started ranting about how sexist James Bond was and couldn't we watch something else. 

My dad and uncle seemed kind of uncomfortable and disappointed but I put in another DVD and everything was fine, we sat and watched the movie. 

I thought everything was fine but afterwards my dad took me aside and said I was being rude especially since I never even watched a whole Bond movie. The rest of the trip was kinda uncomfortable but I don't think I did anything wrong, I shouldn't have to watch something that's so offensive.

I (28 F) was adopted via an open adoption. I have a relationship with my biological mother since I was 12 (""Abby"") but my biological father (""James"") and I never forged the same relationship, for a variety of reasons that won't fit in 3000 characters, but more or less James (understandably) wasn't ready for a child and I never felt that he wanted any type of relationship with me. I learned later that I was kept a secret from his wife and kids until I reached out at age 12.

As the years progressed I developed an interest in learning about that side of myself, but never had a way to reach out to James. After being kept secret for so long, it felt clear he didn't want me involved in his life and he, as the ""adult,"" made no effort to do so. (I realize phones work two ways, but when I was 12-18, I was working through a lot of turmoil with regard to this). Not only from a ""where am I from"" standpoint, but also an understanding of any health concerns I may want to be aware of, as I am aware James' father died when James was fairly young.

I was told that my biological paternal grandmother is alive and would love to speak to me, and eventually gathered the guts to reach out. Once I did, she would only speak to me on her terms (when calling was convenient for her) and not respond to written messages.   I tried to meet her where she's at and arrange set times to speak, but she didn't hold to those times either. The few times we did connect, I didn't learn anything substantive and certainly didn't want to rush her into speaking to me about what I wanted to learn, but it continued this way: vague conversations about what she did that day but no enlightenment about my family despite my attempts. The relationship didn't develop any further and we haven't connected in months.

I'm at a point now where I simply want to create a list of questions about my paternal biological family and send it to my biological father for answers. I feel like this could come across as mercenary, but I've been consistently denied this information at every turn. WIBTA for doing this? Is it mercenary or wrong to feel ""entitled"" to this information?

(all real names redacted). I know Kieth(34m) and his friend group through a sport we all did together. Everyone invited to the event has invite permissions as we were encouraged to invite our friends.

So I invite Toby(31m), Jack(30m), and Arnold(30m) from my college friend group that Kieth has met several times at prior events. Toby &amp; Jack hit ""going"" on the Facebook event and Arnold hits ""Maybe"". On the day of the party I get a text from Jack saying ""Toby, Arnold, and Dorothy are going to come over 530 and then we'll head to Kieth's."" Dorothy(30f) is Arnold's girlfriend. 

I thought to myself ""Oh cool! At first"" but after checking the Facebook event and seeing Arnold as a ""maybe"" and Dorothy not invited, I sent a text to Arnold saying ""Hey, did you let Kieth know you were bringing Dorothy?""

My reasoning for sending that was so Arnold could then either invite Dorothy (we all had invite permissions) or message Kieth, the host, who would then know that two additional people were certainly coming (Arnold &amp; Dorothy). As someone who also likes to host parties, I like to know who and how many people are coming so I know how much food/booze/etc to get.

Anyway, Arnold then responds with, ""No. I did not. Isn't it a party?"" 

I respond with ""It is, but if I invited someone to a party at my place and they brought someone I didn't know, I'd be like huh interesting.""

He responds with ""Kieth has met her once.  And it's completely normal to bring girlfriends to parties. And I don't know why you care or it's any of your business.""

Then we argued a bit and he said ""I don't think you need to be this fixated on politeness given the context of a Halloween party.  Significant others are always fair game"".

So, back to friendsgiving, he got me a gift. It was sort of a secret Santa thing. He surprised me by giving me a Trading Card Game box which costs around $150. I was expecting some socks or something not that great. Anyways when I jokingly asked him “did you sell drugs for this?” He giggled and said he worked overtime because he didnt want to give socks for friendsgiving again, we all chuckled and thought it was sweet, some friends said that socks are always useful.

Anyways, when opening the box, I pulled a card that sells for around $8000, we were baffled, we had no idea how to react and what to do, it was such a low chance of getting that card that we were just mesmerized.

My friends instantly said that I had to go half/half with him which honest I was hoping it wouldn’t be mentioned. My friend (who got me the card) said it was mine and I was not obligated to share anything with me because it was a gift. I honestly want to use the money to upgrade my PC and maybe a trip.

She claims to really like him- that she had a strong connection with him and has a lot in common with him. 

But I am not approving of him. 

First of all, she is a Master’s student and should find a guy who is matched with her in education. This guy is in a college program for computer programming. 

Second, he does not have a good relationship with his brother. My daughter explained to me that his brother has major anger issues and was physically abusing him but a stable family is very important and I think my daughter should be with someone from a stable family. 

Third, I don’t know what she sees in him. Me and my husband agree that he is not physically attractive at all. And I don’t understand why she as a girl doesn’t see it. She claims that she “doesn’t care about appearances and only cares about personality” but I don’t understand how she doesn’t see how being with an unattractive guy makes her look. My daughter is beautiful and should be with someone who looks the part.

She is in a different province right now for school, where she met him, so I have been unable to meet him. All I have is her description of him and the picture she sent me of him. And I know I shouldn’t interfere with her love life so I haven’t told her to end it but I’ve told her how she should consider finding someone who is more attractive and more educated. And she won’t listen. She insists on the connection she has with this guy. 

I just don’t want her to make the same mistakes I made. I married my husband without fully thinking it through and I regret it every day. My husband is not physically attractive and not educated and I am embarrassed to be seen in public with him. I just want her to have better for herself. But she expresses how much she really likes this guy and won’t give up on him.

I have a few siblings and they typically always receive gifts, except for maybe the oldest (28) who has moved out, but I am not sure. 

For context, my dad and I do not have a good relationship. He is highly narcissistic, does not take any interest in my life, very selfish etc. when I was younger (like 10 years old), if me or my siblings made him a card but did not buy him a birthday gift he would make us feel terrible about it. However, he has never gotten me a gift ever. My mom has occasionally but not since I was maybe 16 and once when I was about 20. 

I always get both of them thoughtful, typically pretty expensive gifts either by myself or with my siblings. I have always been the type to not ask for much whereas some of my siblings are a bit more pushy.

This year really upset me though. I was kinda going through an unrelated, tough time and they decided to not only extend the vacation that they were on to miss almost my entire birthday, but also not even write me so much as a card. And I know everyone says “just a card is fine” but I really would appreciate it. My mom wrote me a card once when I was 16 and I’ve kept it ever since. I guess I just wish there was a little more thought put in. On the other hand though, I understand I am 23 and not a kid anymore. 

They are not helping me with college, which I am understanding of, but I have 2 jobs and it kinda hurts that I spend my hard earned money and time to get them something I think they would like and they can’t do the same for me. I don’t need anything expensive, just something to show that they care would be nice. 

I expressed that this was hurtful, and my dad jokingly took a post it and scribbled “happy birthday” then handed it to me and laughed. My mom seems to feel bad but didn’t really do anything to fix it (e.g. writing an actual card). She did get me a cake on my actual birthday which I appreciated but it was an ice cream cake and I am extremely lactose intolerant (they know this).

Our house has a small guest area that we use for family visits and put on Air BnB when no one needs it. In 2020 we rented it out through the site to a grad student who was visiting our city for 3 months. She had financial support from her university for this. Before she actually arrived the pandemic hit. According to our Air BnB settings we did not have to give her a refund but we agreed to anyway because it w the right thing to do. Thing is that she never actually arranged to get the money and just kind of vanished.

Two years later I get a call, she is back in our city and wants to come stay with us or get the money back. This all felt a bit demanding coming out of the blue but I agreed to try get cash together. She went quiet again. Then a few days ago, at about 7pm on Friday night, she messaged me insisting that I must go to Western Union that weekend and pay her back. By now I'm quite annoyed because this has gone on for a while and I have a lot on, it's not that easy to just pop to Western Union. We argue a bit and eventually agree that I'll use Wise Transfer. She's about to go back to her home country and doesn't want my currency. She gives me an amount in her currency which I check before I pay her, and it's almost 25% more than I was paid her for original stay two years ago.

I tell her she's made a mistake so she sends me the proof of what she paid to Air BnB in 2020, which was in her currency. Clearly exchange rates have changed in the last 2 years, so she paid me x in her money and I received y in mine but these amounts are no longer the same. 

I have told her sorry but I can only refund her  what I was paid. She's very upset and says at least we should split the difference because she's a student and this is a lot of money for her, which she needs for her family. I said no.

She does have a point that she's a student and we are employed. But I feel like if she was that desperate for the money she would not have waited 2 years to get it back, or at least would have requested it at the start of her trip here rather than waiting till she was leaving. So since this clearly isn't a financial emergency for her, I don't think I should have to take the hit for the exchange rate changing, which was obviously a strong possibility since she waited so long to sort this out. I'm also I'm super annoyed that she's made this so stressful, when I wasn't even obliged to refund her in the first place, and that's probably impacting my decision.

They were talking quietly and Peanut keeps looking at me and checking if I'm listening in on them then said ""why don't you go hang out with [other friend]"" so I just took my shit and sat with another group of friends.

I didn't talk to them at all for the rest of the day and just stayed with my other friends (they didn't even notice).

My mother (60) has two sisters and two brothers living. The sisters one younger than my mom, had 4 kids. 

My mother is amazing in many ways. She raised my sister and I on her own. My dad was never really there. She instilled in us the correct values, the pursuit of education, being independent and a good work ethic.. She was pretty successful in that. I’m in the medical field doing relatively well and my sister is a financial accountant doing well.. 

She retired from work and she stays between me and my sister
 We live in different cities so she flies back and forth. 

Now back in 2018 , I was staying in a garden cottage in the town I worked in. It was enough for 2 people. My moms younger sister had some issues and was homeless. She didn’t have a good relationship with her 4 kids. My mother asked me if I could let her stay for a while. I agreed. Mostly out of guilt. 

When my mom came it was three people and it was crowded. Eventually my landlord remarked on this and I moved out. To a bigger place with a room for the aunt. She was supposed to pay something towards the rent. To no one’s surprise after a month she left and said another cousin wanted her to stay with his wife while he travelled. 

I was stuck with a high rental for period of a year. It rocked my mom and her sisters relationship. But my mom being the softie to her family after a while the relationship was better. I was less forgiving and everytime she was around Iade it clear to my mom my discomfort. 
 
A few days ago while at work my mom messaged and calls me like ten times to get an Uber for this aunt to her flat. I order Ubers for my mom so the aunt asked her and my mom asked. I was angry because not only was I busy and thought the incessant calls were because something was wrong. 
I was angry and I blew up. 

I told her that this aunt has twice the amount of children my mom has and that it isn’t my fault they don’t have a good relationship but this is what her kids must be doing. She said ok and said she won’t bother me again. She still normal with me but I feel guilty.

So I (28F) moved into an apartment with J (27F) earlier this year. I’d met J online along with a bunch of other people (who’d also become friends) last year during the second wave of the panini in my country and we clicked instantly. 


Meanwhile, I got a new job which required me to relocate to a new city, and by coincidence, she did as well. She was waffling on the decision and I encouraged her to make the move (she was in a toxic home situation too) I was all for being roommates with J (in retrospect, not my wisest moment, but I’ve always had a problem with rose tinted glasses in friendships) It went mostly pretty smoothly after we’d moved in, barring some minor hiccups.

One problem tho has been J’s personality. I noticed she’d had fallouts with almost all our mutual friends, and according to J, no matter what it was, it was the other person’s fault. Our mutual friend S warned us that J was going to end up alone if she kept alienating people (and ended up getting cut off himself, quite unceremoniously, over a cat of all things. That incident deserves a post of its own trust me) 


I decided to spend a couple of days back home. I got a text from J asking if 2-3 friends of hers could crash in my bedroom (bigger, and with bed) I figured since we were all adults, no harm, and I gave my blessing. She texted me in the night about how the girls were raving about my bedsheet being pretty (it is, I’m very particular about not staining it, I did not allow my friend’s cat on it etc - I’m aware that this is probably very superficial and silly, but it has been the first room I had all to myself so yeah) 
Anyway, she wanted the link to buy the bedsheet, and was weirdly insistent about it, so I shared it and thought that was the end of that. 

No. She “got it off her chest” the next morning that there was a hole in my bedsheet coz one of her friends had been smoking on my bed and hadn’t taken care of the ashes, and there had almost been a mini fire. My dumbass doormat self was recognising how hard this was for her to admit, so I was initially empathetic, but then the more I thought about it, the more indignant I got. Like I understand people getting drunk and doing stupid shit but why is your first instinct there to lie and cover up? I’ve mentioned a bunch of times how I don’t like the smell of cigarettes. I said this to her, and her tone immediately changed. She got defensive and proceeded to invalidate my feelings, and following it up with “of course, not looking to invalidate your feelings” 
When I pointed out the stuff mentioned earlier (how I didn’t like stuff on my bed etc) she got short with me and it’s been radio silence since then. 

This whole thing has left me feeling like my  boundaries have been breached, and like I don’t know this person at all. Would I be the asshole if I moved out earlier than our lease period expires?

Just finished medical school and the graduation is going to take place soon. Since Covid happened, our Uni used the opportunity to reduce these previously big ceremonies to a decreased number of people (they reminded us to not come in huge groups but bring only our closest ones), which I don’t mind too much. I only would have wanted to go there only with my dad (P.) and his partner. For context, my parents are divorced and I feel like he is the most important person to me besides my own partner and P.’s new partner (K.). My kinda toxic mother (M.) decided to invite herself to the ceremony as well so K. stepped back quietly and respectfully from the trip as he did not want to cause any trouble. The whole thing will include a 2000 km travel by plane, two night stay at the same hotel for me and my parents. My even more toxic grandma G. (the mother of P. not M.!) hinted a year before, she would want to come to the ceremony as well. For me, as I had enough to do with final exams and stuff, I did not clearly talk to her about the issue up until recently. As I knew this would be a disaster because even before my parents divorced, M. and G. hated each other and could never swallow a snarky comment. So K. and I planned out a whole dinner in our hometown with my closest friends (K. and P. have a lovely social circle, people I have known half my life and I would consider them part of my best friends) to celebrate the graduation and planned to invite G. as well. G. never was interested in any visit at my Uni city before, P. and I have a feeling she only wants to take pride now that I am becoming an MD as she never showed interest in any career of my cousins. When I told her, she could not come as the Uni was asking us to reduce guests to a minimum she flipped. Of course, the reason being not only what the Uni is saying but this fact seemed convenient as I already preferred to not have her there because there would be trouble. But now I’m the bad guy for prioritizing my mother (“the witch” according to her) over her. She does not want to come to our hometown celebration and says I should have been clever enough to figure out a way she could come to the Uni thing. Neither G. nor M. did contribute in any way to my studies. They are both well of, but only my dad supported me financially and emotionally through that time. G. is even trying to manipulate me by saying, I will be responsible if her son is going to be emotionally damaged from that weekend with M..

She does everything for Alexa. 

I’ll be honest. Alexa is a brat who honestly gets on my nerves. It’s like she exists to make my wife’s life miserable. She’s arrogant, rude, entitled, nasty. She constantly broke rules and none of her teachers ever liked her. She refused therapy. I’m amazed at the patience and kindness my wife has because the girl was a nightmare.

She came home for Thanksgiving (probably skipping classes) and came to me this weekend and “confessed her feelings.” Apparently, I treated her so much better than my wife when she was growing up. I tried to be nice to her just because she’s my wife’s sister. I’d do things like take her out once in a while to give my wife/then gf a break.

I lost it and told her I don’t like her, I never liked her, and I was only nice to her because it would make my wife happy. I told her I only put up with her spoiled self to be with my wife and I was annoyed whenever she intruded. Alexa started sobbing and ran out.

We have a good relationship for the most part as we hardly get into disputes and enjoy similar things. Recently we moved to a new state to be closer to my grandparents and because of that we have been visiting them frequently. Normally I would be happy about this, however I noticed a habit that my dad picked up.

There are some expectations when we are visiting our grandparents for my sister and I which are to keep our things organized and to clean up for my grandparents after meals. I think there is nothing wrong with this and have no problem doing it. 

However, I noticed that my dad has began to take advantage of this ""my sister and I are responsible for cleaning"" phenomenon. After meals he began expecting us to take his plate from where he is sitting and to the sink like a waitress would do at a restaurant and also clean it.  He also began to tell us to fold his bed, do his laundry, pack his things when we are leaving, and things like that.

At home, he never asks us to do any of these things and only asks us to keep our own things clean and such so these requests were surprising to me. 

Eventually instead of asking for these things to get done, his tone changed and he began asking for these requests differently. Instead of, ""Will you fold my bed?"" it would be ""Make sure to fold my bed."" This aggravated me, but I decided not to say anything because I thought it would be disrespectful. That is until I did.

The most recent visit was this week. As per usual my family was eating together, and I was with them of course. In the middle of eating, my dad placed his glass firmly in front of me and with a stern tone told me to refill his glass and to do it quickly. This enraged me. I told him no and to do it himself and that I was his daughter, not his servant. I also told him that when he is here (at my grandparents) he has began to act like a king where my sister and I are responsible to serve him. In response, he told me that it is  good for my sister and I to have that treatment because those will be our responsibilities as wives one day. I replied that it is not the 1900s and that he was sexist for saying that.

Following all  that my dad told me I was being disrespectful and that I needed to apologize. I didn't because I don't think I'm wrong, but maybe I am. I was talking back to him, so I don't know.

She has known since about June 2020 her company would never be returning to the office and would be fully remote. Mine did the opposite, I am full time in the office with the occasional work from home (maybe once every 3 months). I hate working from home and much prefer the office.

Our previous apartment was not designed for working from home so we were excited to finally move in March to a 2 bedroom apartment. In NYC a 2 bedroom apartment is very expensive, but we made the arrangement that not only would we be able to have family visit (mine all lives out of state), she would finally have a dedicated workspace. In our previous apartment we would each rotate around depending on meetings, working at the coffee table while one took a call in the bedroom, etc. 

Here we are 8 months into the lease and her desk is still in the middle of the living room. The guest room has a guest bed and her Peleton bike, leaving “no more room for the desk”. Whatever, I’m not there from 9-5 so who cares right? I do. She is in the same spot when I wake up and when I return home. Either at the desk in the center of the apartment or laying on the couch with her laptop. It drives me crazy, I feel like I have no alone time and get home tired to the opposite attitude. It must be nice to eliminate a 2 hours round trip commute. She also starts and ends works significantly earlier than me, so when I am half awake making my coffee for my 40 min subway ride she is wide awake and chipper and often is upset at my lack of communication. 

Evenings are the same, I get home and she’s been off work for 4 hours, takes naps, whatever she does but I get home at 8 exhausted. When I get home she always wants to do something. I try to explain to her that she’s been chilling for 4 hours before I get home, it would be like me suddenly getting a second wind at midnight and asking if she wants to go out to dinner then. 

I’ve been increasingly nasty, I’m not proud of it but I just want some alone time. She makes small talk all morning and is always in the same spot when I get home. Lately I’ve been getting upset about our “home office” being nothing more than a closet and Peleton room, it’s an absolute waste. 

Now I’m just ranting…. Her only response is that if I don’t like our tight space we can move to New Jersey (adding an hour to my commute and further away from my family).

I on the other hand am shy and need to have security, I have an excellent career now and am proud of where I am at in life. 

I have watched Jane succumb to alcoholism these last 15 years. She is a shell of her former self, extremely overweight, does not have a job and sits on the couch and drinks beer all day. It has been very hard to watch. I have been her shoulder to cry on for two divorces. She now on her third marriage, they were drinking buddies, but that relationship is reaching its end, her husband is it in AA now and has been sober for a while. A bit of an issue for him since she is not sober. Her lack of stability frightens me. I’m scared she is going to show up on my doorstep homeless.

I have been distancing myself. I will avoid her phone calls or let her go quickly when she does call. She said that I’ve nuked our friendship and she doesn’t know why. I have tried to explain, but she barely recalls conversations the next day so I got tired of repeating myself. I don’t really know if there is a point in trying to explain again.

So the cost of living in the UK skyrocketed this year, and so for Christmas, I (f23) have decided to take up baking, and give all of my family homemade cakes and pastries to save money. Everyone I have told in my family have been delighted with what I am doing and have told me they’re really looking forward to 

I’m really excited. I’m going to bake sausage rolls, jam tarts, apple pies, peanut butter and chocolate cups, red velvet cupcakes, cookies, cheese twists, and homemade bread from a family recipe. And I’ll do it all on Christmas Eve-Eve, and Christmas Eve to guarantee freshness. 

I have an exception for this though. My brother and my sister have daughters (not with each other!! Lmao)  and I want to buy them both a gift instead of baking. This is for two reasons:

1) they’re both under the age of three and I don’t think they’ll appreciate baked pastries that much lol

2) I’m not planning on having kids of my own. They’re my nieces, and I want to treat them a bit more. 

This is where I might be an AH. I have a cousin(m10) who I was also planning to bake gifts for. He’s vegetarian, so I’m baking the cheese twists especially for him to make up for the lack of sausage rolls, and because he loves cheese twists from other bakeries. My grandmother is telling me I’m being nasty for not buying him a gift because he’ll be disappointed with what I have planned. And that I should just buy him some things instead. 

I feel a bit deflated now. Thing is, he has quite an expensive taste for gifts (iphones, consoles, games, etc.) and I don’t think I could afford anything he’d want. And if he was disappointed with my gift, it could be a good way for him to learn that money doesn’t grow on trees. 

Am I being too harsh? Is it mean of me to exclude him from the exception? Should I just try and find him something and not bother baking him anything? 

Any input from y’all will be much appreciated!

Furthermore my parents would argue all the time and it got so bad to were one time he almost ran the car off the side of the road by grabbing the wheel. Even though he would never put his hands on my mom it still didn’t make the situation better. 

My parents disagreed on a lot and it was clear that their marriage was done and I was actually happy that they were separating.

I 37m and my bf 35m have been together for 10years. We don’t live together, and spend what time we can together but our work shifts and lifestyles mean we don’t have as much scope to hang out as much as we want to. 
Usually we text/ voice note a lot more than proper phone calls, because it is easier for us to communicate.

Now. I have a son, 18 from a previous relationship who has autism. 
He was assaulted randomly yesterday, and I’m obviously quite upset.

I called my partner to fill him in and vent about it. Obviously as a mother, I feel so helpless and upset that my son has been hurt. His face is swollen and the police are involved.
When OH picked up, he was mid game on the Xbox, which I then asked if he wanted to just call me back, but he said it was fine he was listening. So I carried explaining what had happened until he cut me off mid sentence to talk to his pal about the game. I said I was going to go this time and he tried to carry on chatting but with a change of subject. I answer his next question and he snapped at me resulting in me saying goodbye and hanging up.

I left it an hour thinking when the game he was currently playing ended he would call back. He didn’t….
So I messaged and pointed out how disappointed I was that I had phoned him for a specific reason, something important and he couldn’t even give me 10mins of his time to be there for me.

The response I have since had have been along the lines of 

‘I would have called back if you hadn’t gone in a huff’
‘I was busy, I answered my phone to you -  that shows you are a priority’
‘Next time I will just ignore your call until I have time to talk and this won’t be an issue again’
‘I couldn’t hear you because I had 3 people talking in the headset’
‘Your annoyed because I didn’t drop what I was doing when you called’
‘He is a teenager, if he hangs about these things will happen’


I don’t think I was being unreasonable reaching out and looking to vent to my boyfriend. Had it been me I would have dropped the game and listened because that’s my step son and I will be damned if anyone is going to hurt him and me be ok with it. However all I have gotten is how it’s my fault he didn’t listen/ call back and I need to be accountable for it. Because apparently me being upset that my kid was hurt, is me having an attitude and he doesn’t need to deal with that. 
It’s left me feeling so uneasy.

I decided to pull my portion of pasta onto my plate before it became sticky. I put the sauce on my portion. The salads were on the table, and I sat down. I waited about 3-4 minutes and he was still fiddling with the remote. 

I said, “well, I am going to start, before it gets cold.”

I finished my meal. 

After 32 minutes of fiddling, he gave up. He gathered his meal as I sat and had some wine.

I have walked away from friendships before, but I don't want to simply repeat a pattern. I moved to the US in 2007 after getting a job offer from the friend in question. It was not a favor -- I am highly competent in the field. But he ran his business like a charity and eventually had to shut down 10 years later. I was there for 8. I could have left the moment I got my green card (4 years in) but decided not to. Why? Because I have loyal disposition, first, but also because he hired a nasty narcissist (NN) to be the Clinical Director and I wanted to protect my clients and the agency from him. Whenever I pointed out what he was doing my friend/boss would send me an email about how important I was and how he hoped we could all sit around, sing kumbaya (his words) and move on. Every single time.

He is a cognitive dissonance dodger of epic proportions. The NN eventually cost him his business, but I stuck around until my friend could no longer pay my salary.

Fast forward to last week. Called him to say that I will not be able to hangout until mid-December because I’m swamped with schoolwork. He says he understands. I ask about how he is doing. We talk for a bit, and he brings up politics. We don't talk politics because he always flies off the handle when I don't agree with him. We have a deal. 

He takes this disagreement as an attack and proceeds to label me and make all-or-nothing statements. I asked him to stop with the labeling and the all-or-nothing statements a few times. No luck. Then I tried to ask him ""but, what if"" questions. He would not let me finish my sentences. It is like he is irate at an effigy, a picture of people who don't think like him painted by TV anchors (he is an avid consumer of political news) -- his previous and current knowledge of me be damned! When I point out his quick to irate behavior he doubles down and says, in so many words, that I “brought this upon myself”. He doesn't speak like this to anyone else -- even to people who are/were highly detrimental to his peace of mind and whatnot. It is like a brain injury, tbh.

I told him that I was tired of him not listening to me, said that I was sorry and hung up. Couldn't sleep and the next day and it affected my studies heavily. He reached out to a mutual friend to say that he is sorry and loves me more than all the political stuff we argued about, but I don’t know if his heavily protected feelings are more important than our friendship. That was also a very close statement to what he would tell me when I worked for him, but so is he saying, ""you do it too"", because he would say that the NN “didn't like me either”, basically implying that it neutralized whatever I had to say. I do know that he loves me, but I am tired, hurt and just feel like maybe this friendship is no longer for me.

GF and I met on tinder about 3.5 months ago. We had gone on 8 dates when she orginally asked me if I'd like to attend her graduation from college in December. I declined because we weren't dating at the time, and felt uncomfortable going to a graduation with her parents. She was disappointed but said she understood. 

I wanted to take things slow and wasn't really looking to be a boyfriend just yet, so I was hesitant to ask her to be my GF even tho she dropped a few hints here and there.

Last week I asked her to be my GF on our 12th date, and we went out to the bar to celebrate. We ran into her guy friend who revealed to me that he was going to her graduation. At the bar my GF got a little drunk so I planned to take her to my place to sleep it off.

Afterwards on the way home I asked her if I could go instead since I'm her BF now. She said no and said if I wanted to go I should've said yes when she orginally asked me.

I argued that it wasn't fair because we weren't that close yet and I would've felt weird attending a graduation of a girl I wasn't dating. She argued that it was rude to take the ticket back from her friend, and that the only reason I wanted to go now was because her male friend was going. 

We went back and forth and she ended up asking to be taken home. This was yesterday and she's been super short with me. My mom said I was being a jerk about it but I'm not too sure.

AITA?

TL;DR: I rejected my GF's (tinder match at the time) invitation to her college graduation, and so she gave the ticket to her male friend without telling me.

For background, my sister (26F) and I (27F) grew up very poor, so as an adult I have been saving my money very diligently. I got a decent nest egg to eventually (hopefully) try to buy a house one day. I very rarely buy things for myself, rarely eat out, don’t buy things I consider unnecessary… basically I’m very frugal. 

My sister and I have been making around the same amount of money up until recently. She is not as careful about spending as I am, which I have no problem with. It’s her life, if she wants to spend her money, good on her. But she moved into a pretty pricey apartment about 5 months ago, which concerned me a bit. She racked up some credit card debt while buying furniture/etc for her new apartment. She asked if she could borrow $2k in order to close her CC debt so that she wouldn’t accrue interest. I was hesitant, but she promised me up and down that she would pay me back. Needless to say, she has only paid back around 1/4th of the amount she owes me and I basically had to ask her for each payment. She would get annoyed anytime I brought it up and would just say “I’m not going anywhere, I’m obviously gonna pay you”.

Anyway, she quit her job 3 weeks ago because she was having major issues with her manager and was extremely unhappy. So I pretty much kissed my $2k goodbye knowing that I’m probably never getting it back. If she didn’t pay me when she had a job, she certainly won’t be while she’s unemployed. And I don’t expect her to, but I told myself if she ever asks to borrow money again, I’m going to say no. 

So we come to last week. She called me saying how she’s so broke and she doesn’t know how she’s gonna make rent. Side note, has enough in her savings to cover rent and bills for at least 2 months. She then asked me to borrow $1k. Now that I think about it, she didn’t even ask if she could borrow. I think she wanted me to just give it to her. She knows how much I have saved so I think in her mind because I have enough money to give her $1k and not be too impacted, I should have no problem doing it.  

I told her no, just as I had promised myself. She said bye and hung up on me and she hasn’t talked to me since. We usually talk every single day. I feel like I’m starting to think I made an asshole move by saying no. I’m in a stable financial position and she is in need right now. I feel like I should help my family when times are tough for them. But on the other hand, I saved this money by being extremely restrictive on myself and I have a goal that I’d like to reach one day, but that definitely won’t happen if I just give out thousands every time someone needs it.
