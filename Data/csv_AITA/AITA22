Both of our families knew of each other due to the fact we were best friends. And one time me and her cousin's brother even got into a physical fight. Anyways, she would always manipulate me and talk behind my back. I even remember her cousin telling me straight up that they talked bad about me when we just started being friends. And she (ex bestfriend) was very ""included"" in my love life, even if the guys I talked to who weren't close to her at all, she would have them added on Snapchat and stuff. And the time we ended our friendship, we fought in text. I found out through the guy I was talking to that she vented to him about what happened and even sent him the screenshots of our texts, he didn't even hear my side about it. He insulted me, asking what was wrong with me and that I was crazy. I've had enough of her treating me like crap, so I logged into her Snapchat (I also logged into her Instagram, Tiktok, etc.) She told me her password when we were friends, and surprisingly, she still kept the same password. I logged in and entered her memories, deleting everything in it, even the photos of her baby brother. She already knew it was me but I didn't care. It lasted for a few weeks until she messaged me again and told me to give her the password, I gave in since there wasn't anything in it anymore. She blew up my phone asking where the photos were, and told me how she used her Snapchat to take pictures of her brother because her mom's phone was broken.

We talk almost every day, but we're not super close, so I'm not sure if friend is the right word to call this girl - ""K"".

""K"" has always been a bit of an oddball and an outcast. At first, we didn't mind her quirks. She said something stupid once in a while, but it wasn't a big deal. But as time passed, she started sharing some of her more controversial opinions. 
She was raised in a village and her parents were devout Catholics and she took after them. And she could be pretty rude and homophobic.

Like, when a certain popular game had a pride-themed update, she commented that she's ""a proud homophobe"" and that she won't be playing the game anymore. Or whenever she sees a series with canon gay couples, she says how disgusted she is and that she'd never touch it. And if there are canon LGBTQ charactes in the series she likes? She denies canon queer representation, says that gay couples are ""just friends"" and misgenders trans characters.

Her behaviour bothered me because she's so stubborn and rude about it. Not to mention that I'm queer myself (bi/trans), so hearing all that while already dealing with a lot of other stuff just made me feel more depressed than I already was. But in the end, it's all about fictional characters, so we all kinda ignored it.

There was one time when she argued that a transphobic slur isn't transphobic and it's okay to call people by that slur. It upset me so much that I had to leave the group chat for a while.

A few days ago she, once again, kept complaining about how she ""doesn't see"" how some characters are gay and that she has an ""anti-queer shield"" in her brain and that she'd never touch anything that focuses on people who aren't straight because she's disgusted by these.

The thing is, despite all that, she claims to be a member of the queer community because she's asexual and she can't be anti-LGBTQ if she's a part of the community herself.

I got fed up with her behaviour and told her that with this kind of behaviour, she's not a part of any community. Because being a community isn't about shitting on your fellow members. 

But now I feel kinda bad for it. Maybe I should have been more understanding since she was raised in a pretty toxic environment and I'm pretty sure she has undiagnosed autism or something similar to it, because she acts a lot like I did before I got diagnosed and before I got the help I needed. 

She says she doesn't understand what the problem is and I tried explaining it to her a thousand times but she still doesn't understand it. Maybe I should have tried one more time? I don't know, I feel shitty.

I 26F met a guy 21M at work for the first time. We are working  and studying at the same time.
He is charismatic, have deep thoughts, and we share so much in common.
I have never felt this way before towards any guy, I feel attracted to him and at times I just want to give him a hug when he is talking about his personal issues.
I know he likes me as a friend, he would wait for me to finish my shifts late night (around 2 am) to walk me home, sometimes he would even suggest to take the longer route saying that he would like to walk with me longer. He give unexpected sweet hugs every now and then. Tries to cheer me up when I have a bad day by suggesting to play some sports, sing, or had some nice food outside. And he even memories the typical words I say in different situations and jokingly tries to mimic me saying them. 
I am confused and do not know if he likes me as a person or is he just being the nice person he is with everyone. I know I do like him but I don't know how to approach him. He is leaving in a month for some mandatory training and won't be back until 2024. It would be very hard to meet him for 2 years, and we are trying to get the best of the time left for us by going out often. I am not sure if I should confess to him since he said he never had any previous relations and I don't won't to take him out of guard by doing so. We also have a lot of common friends that we hangout with as a group, and after he returns from his service we would be still working at the same place.

Yesterday she messaged my boyfriend (29M) asking if he wanted to catch up and if she could stay at our house for a night or two, as she's trying to save money on accomm.

The two of them have also been friends for a while but were never close. He was good friends with her ex, and they continued to be casual friends when we got together.

He told me this and I said I was happy for them to catch up but I wasn't comfortable with Sophie staying overnight. He bristled a little and said he felt awkward having to tell her that. So I messaged her myself and said that for me it's crossing a boundary and it's something I would only consider if it was a really close female friend of his. I said it isn't to do with her, it was just my insecurities and I hope she understands.

That last part was kind of a lie tbh. I probably still wouldn't feel comfortable if it was other girl friends (unless it was an emergency) but I'm also biased against her. Mainly because

1) My bf has said/done stuff in the past that makes it seem like he's attracted to her. Like when she broke up with her ex he said ""guys will be lining up around the block to date her"" among other weird things.

2) Sophie is not super ethical about monogamy. When I saw her last she told me with no shame at all that she was encouraging our mutual friend to cheat on her husband, who is ALSO a good friend of ours. In that same hang-out, I told her I was planning a trip overseas and she tried to talk me into getting a ""hall pass"" from my bf even though I clearly wasn't interested. 

Sophie didn't take this as well as I expected. She feels like I'm treating her suspiciously, and brought up the times I crashed at her place when we were younger. She says I'm letting my insecurity cloud my judgment. I find this ironic as she has a history of being VERY insecure, definitely more than I do.

My boyfriend is also acting resistant. He keeps telling me he feels bad and that I should also feel bad for not putting her up since it's the least we can do as friends. He also pulled the ""why don't you trust me"" card even though he knows it's an insecurity/anxiety issue more than a trust issue. I feel confused and frustrated like they're both making me out to be the bad guy for setting boundaries.

It also doesn't make sense to me because we live in a rural area on the outskirts of the city so it's a pretty inconvenient place to crash. It's a 20-minute drive from just the suburbs and it's a cramped tiny house so they would both have to sleep on opposite ends of our little loft. I also know Sophie has at least two other friends that she can stay with in the city, and she's got a decent marketing job so it's not like she'd have to scrape the barrel for an airbnb if they said no.

Everyone here was white and obviously no one looked like a rusty pick up truck so I decided to pick my girlfriend of almost 2 years because we know each other so well. I pick her for that reason and because both Mader and her are brown. Now I know, that alone sounds f***ing awful. But my reasoning is that brown = brown. Not any single other feature of Mader which I made clear.

Let me further my reasoning with an example from that same night. Luckily for me I got a similar card, but this time with Hillary Clinton. So same thinking above, but I decided to go with hair color. And the girl I picked was offended internally. Later that night at a bar she expressed (in a fun joking way) how she was pissed. So I pulled up a picture of Hillary and zoomed in on her dirty blond hair. That's it. That's all you could see. Was the hair. Which was fine, but she was the one that decided to zoom out and was upset. And that is my whole point with the Mader example. I gave a very specific zoomed in piece of information and clarified that info was my reasoning. I had nothing to do with the zoom out.

I should note that when I first said my girlfriend fit the Mader car and the reasoning why (which I explained in a I'm sorry, I hope this isn't too much way) she laughed loudly. And so did the girl I picked for Hillary. Everyone laughed at the picks and my reasoning. And so I thought it was okay for the card game circumstances and joked in a couple of references by calling them both Hillary / Mader which they laughed at and nothing seemed bad.

But later at the  bar when it was brought up, she wasn't happy at all. She said she didn't want to wear the brown shirt she was wearing because she thought of Mader. I'm not saying I have the right to keep calling her Mader and what not. I apologized and told her i wont do it again. I won't do it again because I understand it hurts her. I just feel like I have reasoning to defend myself in my initial actions and shouldn't be put down so much.

Are my initial actions insensitive here? Am I being racist?? I really hope not and don't think I am. But she tells me she doesn't understand why I would pick her for that card at all and is upset.

I still speak to my sister (27) almost daily though. 

On Tuesday last week I received a message from an old high school friend wishing her condolences for the loss of my grandpa. I was shocked as I had been talking to my sister throughout the day and nothing was mentioned. I asked her about it, she called me, turns out after he’d died my dad decided that no one was to tell me. 

After some digging, I found his obituary online (which deadnames me) and that he’d died the week prior to me finding out. I also then found the posting for his funeral for Monday next week. 

I’m on the fence about attending, even if it’s just to stand in the back and leave immediately after. My grandma died earlier this year and I sent my parents flowers and my condolences after they informed me, but didn’t attend the funeral (my grandma was abusive), which they blew up about (I had said for years prior I wasn’t going to attend). But my grandpa was a sweetheart and spoilt me and my sister so much and I loved him, but my parents obviously don’t want me to be there as they still haven’t reached out and said anything. I haven’t contacted them because I’m waiting to see if they contact me as they strictly told my sister not to tell me.

I had a group of childhood friends who all shared similar interests growing up. However, two of them lived near me and those are the ones who I’d spent more time with. 

During the summer between school years, I began to spend almost every day with one of the two. We’d go out to eat, come to my house and play COD, Minecraft, watch tv shows/anime/movies. 

Then, before school started, he asked me out. Ever felt your stomach sink? Cold sweat? He left before I could say anything. 

My mother was excited, she liked him as a suitor. I was horrified. 

I thought we were good friends, that I found another guy I could relax with and chill without him getting feelings. 

I don’t know what went through his head, I had only dated one guy and the rest were girls. I even told him I lean towards women. 

I avoided him like the plague the following two days (school started) and when he cornered me for an answer, I panicked and said “no” while quickly walking away. 

He then cut contact with me for a few months. No hard feelings, I understood. 

When he began coming around again, he began to act weird. Possessive weird. My best friend and I have always been physically affectionate, I don’t get hugs very often and he’s a hugger, so it works out. Dude friend would get between us, one time he stormed out of my house because I was paying attention to his friend he had brought over (he had been watching the tv and friend and I were discussing an anime).

We meet like twice in a week.

Nicky's friend was throwing her birthday bash at a bar closer to where I work. Nicky wanted me to come say hi. Cut to the day of the party. While I was leaving, Nicky tells me to get a birthday cake for her friend since they had forgotten to (it was a group of 5 people, Nicky, the birthday girl, and 3 other demonesses I would rather not name or think about). I went to the bakery which was the only one on my way, and got the cake they wanted for Indian Rupees 950 (about 11.65 USD) (average/slight above average price for cake). THEY NEVER TOLD ME THEIR BUDGET.

I went to birthday girl's party, stayed till they cut the cake, and went home. Apparently all girls had pecked each other that night and since one of the demonesses' boyfriend had been okay with it, I should be, too. Tbf, Nicky did tell me about it t, and when I told her I did not know how to feel about it she went and told her friends, who told her I was being extra-sensitive. But I digress.

Next morning, I told Nicky the cake cost INR 950. She said that their budget was just INR 500 (about 6.13 USD), and got annoyed with me (because a 5 USD difference, split among 4 people coming down to 1.25 USD difference, is ""too much”). She then told her friends and they lost their shit at me. I was hurt. They said they can't pay me the additional amount, and that we should split the cake 50:50 (the four of them pay 50%, I alone pay 50%). My girlfriend after talking to her friends told me that this is not black and white, and that I was at fault, too.

I get angry. I tell her one of the demonesses stuffing her face with that cake should watch what she eats (low blow, I know). My sweet gf becomes the proxy for my anger towards her friends. I had spent the evening with her, where she told me what they are doing to me is not right, and that it is wrong on their part. After speaking to her friends, her tone changed. My girlfriend offered to cover the difference, and I told her I don't want her to, to which she said, and I quote, ""then you should not cry about the money so much"", and that ""you are making a big deal out of this when it isn't"". We had a conversation about it, and both of us apologised for what we said.

I have never made money an issue between Nicky and me. I pay for most of our dates. I have often driven her friends with us since they live 24 kms away from the city. I have paid for them sometimes. I have even given a professional consultation to one of her friends for free. I am hurt, broken, and deeply disappointed in my girlfriend.

Over the years My sister (18F) and I have realized our fathers flaws time and time again, But no flaw is more apparent than his drinking. Throughout my life my father has never not had a drink in his hand, where ever he goes, whatever time of day he always has a drink.
I feel like I'm damage control whenever he gets like that more than I am his kid.
Anyway my 21st birthday passed recently and this day is the reason I'm making this post
I had planned my birthday weeks in advance making sure everyone involved was aware of my plans every step of the way. I planned Thursday my sister and I would travel the hour and fifteen minutes to my dads house to go mini golfing with him, Friday my sister and I would drive back home and spend my actual birthday with my mom and stepdad, then Saturday I would spend the day shopping and spending the night at my best friends house. It's a very long plan I can admit, the week of my birthday my best friend came down with strep throat then we decided to cancel our Saturday plans. So I updated the plan and informed everyone the change.
On my birthday, my sister and I head over to my dads house, we get there at around 5pm, when we walked in the door my dad had invited a client to his house and didn't tell us. My sister and are pretty shy and reserved so we don't really like meeting new people, we decided to introduce ourselves and then go hang out in our shared room until our father was finished.
5 hours later at 10pm they still showed no signs of stoping. The mini golf places were probably close to closing and my sister and I were angry. If he was busy he could've told me the multiple times I told him the plan even the new plan.
My sister finally tired of waiting just said ""so I got ready and came all the way over here for nothing"". I wasn't even upset that what she said was mean or whatever all could do was agree.
We made up a lie saying my sister couldn't get her shift the next morning covered so we had to leave early to make sure she would get there for her 8am shift.
We made sure we texted our dad when our stuff was already packed and asked him to come see us off. He was upset to say that least, he's always been emotional especially about his kids so it wasn't out of the usual to see him start to tear up but it still sucks to see no matter how angry I was at the time.
Later on the road on the phone with our mom telling her about what had just happened. I get a text from my dad saying

""Don't blame me for anything""

""Cool glad to know I ain't sh*t to you""

""Your so fu*king mean! You have no idea how much y'all hurt me!""

Three of us are in college, but a few times a year we make the trek with my parents to see our extended family.

For context, my dad’s three siblings still live in their hometown, two of whom live next to my grandparents. It’s a pretty decent sized family, and they’re pretty codependent. 

I’m very close with my twin brother John (22m), and despite fighting like brothers, we know how the other is feeling, like twin-telepathy. John, myself, and my brother Steve (25m) are the oldest cousins, and it feels like we get most of the flack. My two uncles, Josh (50m) and Pete (45m) give it the worst, and it seems like their former frat brother mentality continued with their nephews. A lot of their intense teasing and insults become harsh quickly. 

John and I are very similar in that we play along, but when one of us is hurt we pick up on it. A lot of times it seems like the family or my uncles take things too far.

The most recent time was our “Thanksgiving” visit to what me and my cousins call “The Compound.” We were playing a family game that was like a variation of charades. Before the game, my uncle Josh made sure to say “before we start, I want to say no yelling, specifically to the twins” in front of the whole family of 20, obviously embarrassing us. I stayed quiet for most of the game, but after everyone else was shrieking I joined the fun a bit. Immediately I was shushed by Josh and others, but the other cousins didn’t receive that response. Apparently I was being too loud after his kids and others were unhinged.

There were also jokes about me being messy, being a bigger guy, and other things, which are funny jabs on their own, but really piled up all at once. I got pretty upset after this, and after being shushed like a kid. I didn’t make a spectacle, I just told the group I was gonna watch for a bit. They of course continued making fun. After I did that my mom went up to take her turn and gave me a disapproving glare, which hurts coming from a mother. Basically on the verge of tears, I tried to laugh and say I was going to the bathroom for a minute to fake having fun.

Later on, my parents thought I was being too sensitive and said they hadn’t noticed any “piling on,” that it was all in good fun. My argument to that was that it may have been, but after they saw I was upset it should have stopped; however, it continued, especially from Pete and Josh. 

This is a common occurrence.

Any time I try to talk to anyone in the family, especially my parents, they seem oblivious and tell me I’m too sensitive. Im starting to hate seeing my family, which is sad because we have a lot of good times. John has tried to back me up, but even with him I get the same response. Im trying to be an adult in this family but I am treated like a child.

This post concerns ""Jessica"" (20) and ""Anthony"" (26). They are not related. They share me as sister but that is all. They each have different parents from each other. My sister and I share a dad, and my brother and I share a mom. 

Growing up life wasn't very nice and because of certain things occurring, when I turned 20 I had custody of all my siblings. I was able to finish school early and get a degree in engineering and since I was 18 I have been working for a major food distribution warehouse. I bought a house at 19 and by 20 I made enough to be able to support all of us. 

Alright and now the main point, I discovered that Jessica and Anthony have been ""together"" for about a year an a half. I knew they each had partners but had not met them yet. Anywho, I came home after work to see that all my siblings were here. This was a surprise since only Jessica,  ""Abby"" (25) and ""Mike"" (28) still live with me. Everyone was all smiles and told me to sit with them at the table. Jessica just spit out ""I'm engaged!"" I was excited to hear this but upon looking around and only seeing my siblings I asked ""where is he?"" And that's when everyone got a little nervous and Anthony spoke up with ""it's me"". 

I had no words. Literally shocked and honestly pretty disgusted and disappointed in the both of them, as well as everyone else for apparently knowing and never telling me. I got up from the table, and told everyone to leave the house immediately. Those that no longer lived here had to go home and those that did live here, had to leave for at least 2 hours so I had time to think. They all left and after 2 hours Jessica, Anthony, Abby, and Mike all returned. 

Jessica, Anthony and I sat together again to discuss the situation. Long story short they asked if I would pay for the wedding and I told them no. I disapprove of their decision to be together and Jessica has to move out. This instilled a lot of commotion that led to Abby and Mike joining us in the living room to input their opinions. 

Mike told me that I'm an asshole for not supporting them. Abby said that I need to get over myself because it's not like they are related. Jessica and Anthony left with most of Jessica's things and made sure I heard the ""fuck you"" they gave me on their way out.

This upset me as he had been constantly saying that even while my examinations were ongoing. Out of irritation, I was constantly shaking my leg up and down. A while later, my mother asked me to stop shaking my leg, and out of spite, I started shaking my leg harder.

After a while, my uncle came downstairs and slapped me, saying that he was telling me that for my own good. At that, I lost it even further and ran off screaming about how they didn’t care about me and didn’t want me, with my uncle chasing after me to shout about the good life I had and how lucky I was to not get beat by my parents.

Since I can remember, my weight, my body shape and how I look have always been thinks my parents would mention. I’d be congratulated when I lost weight and jokes would be made when I gained weight. 

My Dad’s nickname for me in school was “Chubbster” but he always got insulted if I called him out because “It’s a joke and you’re too sensitive” 
Another point of contention is that ANY time I’m upset with them I’m called “Too sensitive”. 
My dad would say “I’m speaking as your friend not your dad” and thought that made it okay to call me fat cause he was doing me a favour.

My Dad has called me out of the blue more than once to discuss my weight and tell me I need to lose it. And wouldn’t believe me when I’d say I had trouble because of my meds, he’d tell me to stop eating cake, or offer tips like starving myself for a bit…
 
It’s gotten worse in recent years because I was in a car crash, was seriously hurt and gained weight due to a back issue and medication. I have only just had spinal surgery to correct this and i’m staying with my parents whilst I heal.

I finally snapped a couple of days ago when my parents and I were out for dinner and my dad made a joke about my weight and how it must be hard to lose it when I “have such a close relationship with Lard” 🥺

I told him I really didn’t like that and I was sick of my weight being mentioned all the time. 
I said to my parents that I know I’m fat they don’t have to pick on me about it ALL the time. 
My mum said they had never outright called me fat, so I responded with: 
“The last time I saw you mum, the first thing you did was get out of the car, poke me in the stomach and say “you need to lose some more of that” you don’t have to say “you’re fat” to do the same damage”

Her argument was that she actually said “we” and meant both of us, and I told her I had been feeling good about myself that day, and she made me feel like crap for days afterwards” 

My dad left the table at this point cause he didn’t want to discuss it any more, my mum called me too sensitive again, and when I told her I’d suffered from Body dysmorphia for years because of this kind of talk from them, she said “Don’t be silly no you don’t” and then started all but yelling at me for saying they have made me feel bad about myself and that was my fault for being too sensitive not theirs.

I have never felt so dismissed in my life. And when I told her that I was sick of my worth from them being connected to my weight she flipped even more and the evening was promptly ended.

I live in a share house with the owner/landlord. His name will be C. C is a male and is 59. He's rather inappropriate and tells sexual stories. He even has shown me nudes women have sent him on dating sites. I'm not comfortable around him.
Long story short, he used to date a gal named L. She lived here with him twice. They broke up twice because she got on meth and was abusive plus stole.
She had a boyfriend here who dealt drugs from here and even had an OD.

So C has a degree in massage but doesn't work in it. 
Last Sunday she was here again! (Weather apparently took out her power.)
She smokes like a chimney and the house reeks of it. I am asthmatic and any form of smoke gives me a skull splitting headache if there's enough.
I missed a day of work this week because of this. Now today she's here again. I took my groceries upstairs to put them away.

She was naked on his massage table in the lounge area. (Near the kitchen; the whole top floor is open.) The place smells of cigarettes and my head is already starting to hurt.

I told C Monday when I was grabbing a drink that smoke made my head hurt and it's bad for my asthma. Plus how I missed my work because of the smoke.

I'm so fed up with feeling uncomfortable, him using a common space to give naked massages and his meth ex being here smoking up the place with her cigarettes.
I'm uncomfortable, anxious and paranoid. How do I know she won't steal my stuff?

She wanted statements to use in some student newspaper article.

She forcefully told me and my friends she needs statements. I politely said I’m not the person to ask. She snapped nastily at me “aren’t you grateful for your teachers who helped you, who taught you everything.”

Well, since you demanded to know, I’ll answer. I told her that no, I actually hated 90% of my teachers and still do. And I was an A student, so there was nothing wrong with me. It’s actually a great motivator for me thinking about how I’m going into a lucrative field on track to be a successful and wealthy adult, while all the teachers I fucking hated are stuck rotting in their classrooms. I taught myself pretty much everything anyway, and if I could have stayed in my school extracurriculars, I would’ve happily been homeschooled. Most teachers I think just enjoy having power to abuse since they have none in real life. So no, I doubt you want my comments for your article because I have nothing nice to say about teachers.

Me and A have been best friends for a long time until me and her had gotten into a huge personal argument online on something my friend had said to her which ended with us breaking our relationship the next day, blaming me for the cause of the break up and for how she felt during then even though I had cried a little at school and even after the fight which I don’t think she asked or cared about(she also had said that she had talked about ending our relationship with her friends before). After that had happened, one of my friends talked to her and we ended up becoming friends again. However i had started to regret becoming friends with her again.
A month ago A had began talking to my friends in a GC we had since we got in middle school. Most of the friends had no idea who she was but as she talked more in the group they started to know who she was. I’m happy that my friends are getting along with A but I’ve started to realize how she has started to ignore and start fights with me.
Last morning one of my friends asked me a question on how to fix a bug he made on a project he was working on to which A replied with a small answer. After seeing he still couldn’t do it, i went into more detail on how to fix it, but when I was done A was mad at me for trying to help one of my friends who clearly still did not understand and was asking for my help in the first place.
Later on A asks a question to the GC 20 minutes ago on a issue she had needed help with and because no one answered once I got on the GC I helped her on the issue to where she got mad at me for trying to help and I tried fighting back.
I’ve also noticed that she’s also been trying to take my friends from me and even trying to gatekeep me by talking bad about friends I had made this year or even years ago. She has been getting more interactive with my friends who she had called annoying and rude in GC’s they were in and even started shipping me with my friends even when I’ve shown and told her I feel uncomfortable. Once, I told A about me being upset on how she had treated me unfairly to which she said that we were already on a rocky side and I wouldn’t want to make it more rocky and at that time I actually believed her.
I’ve talked to my close friends, my sisters older and younger and they told me it would just get worse and to block or bring back up the breakup. I used to feel like I am responsible a little when we broke up for the first time but now I’m starting to think what my friends are saying would be the right thing to do.

I recently moved in with them to get off the streets. It was originally supposed to be temporary until I could afford my own room, but they both want me to stay there with them because if I do, we could all use our income together to find a bigger place of our own. His mom has fibromyalgia so she is on disability and he has back issues so he doesn't have many options for work and has chosen not to work for now because it causes him too much pain. I am the only one who is working full time. And my boyfriend and I started dating in the beginning of October. 

The room is very cramped and I just really want to get a space of my own. I talked to them about this and they were open to the idea of it, but pretty much talked me out of it and asked if I could be patient enough to wait a little longer for us to find a house together. 

My boyfriend doesn't want to live in a space where his mom isn't, and wouldn't be joining me if I moved into my own room. He feels that moving out would be abandoning her. 

What should I do? I care for them both but the situation is suffocating and I feel bad for even wanting to leave. It's not that I have a problem with either of them, it's just that I really wanted my boyfriend and I to have a place of our own, and he doesn't want to do that, so I feel like my next option is getting a place for myself.

She met a couple of people who wanted to play a longer game where you continue playing over 10+ weeks. She suggested I play as well. I hadn't met the other 2 people previously, but I didn't think it would be an issue.

We began about 6 weeks ago, and right away I was kind of iffy about 1 of the guys, let's call him Al. As soon as Al came in, he was trashing someone else from the game group. I had actually played with that other guy once and he was a bit odd but mostly fine. Overall, Al seemed pretty high strung and emotional. I tried to get along with him, but I think we both just decided to tolerate each other. The game we were playing isn't super serious or competitive.

Last week was our 5th session. Through the first 4 sessions, Al had complained he was unlucky, and if he was losing he'd get in a bad mood. During this round, Al made a move I thought was illegal, so I asked to see the rulebook to check. It turned out to not be allowed, and Al was pissy, but we moved on. Later on I asked a question about something that impacted everyone and Al was a bit more snarky like I was targeting him. I'd questioned the other players about a couple of plays just to check before as well, but only Al took it personally.

Yesterday we played another session. Al was whining that my wife was winning again. He was once again doing the thing where he acted like he didn't care what happened. At 1 point he did an action where he read some instructions on a page. He got 2 different items from it, which seemed weird based on the narritive of what he read, so I asked to see the booklet. Of course it turned out he was only supposed to get 1 item. 

At this point he got really mad and asked why I only question when something good happens for him. I responded that getting 2 items there would have clearly been too good, and that I didn't understand how he could be asking why I'd question him when both times I had, he was wrong. My wife kept the peace, and we continued playing, with Al now spending most of the time typing away on his phone. I noticed Al seemingly intentionally cheat later on (he was supposed to take 3 single gold pieces, but he instead took 2 singles and 1 worth 5), but I just let it go.

After they left, my wife asked why I had been so passive aggressive. I asked her how what I did was passive aggressive, if anything it was just aggressive. She said I know Al is sensitive and I should have just let it go after I had pointed out he only got 1 item. She felt I went too far by pointing out that both times I had questioned him, he'd been wrong, but I felt that was a normal response to him asking me a direct question about why I felt the need to question him. Most people apologize when they make a mistake that impacts others, they don't get mad that someone noticed.

What makes it worse is that when i said i liked this character for the first time, the same friend made fun of me for it and i didn’t talk about them for months because of it. When i asked him about it recently he told me he was just joking, I don’t think he was joking though.

I know he can’t control it and I know this post must seem super childish or silly, but whenever he mentions it or acts like the character, I just get so angry.

Everyone in the family knew this would end up being a disaster but all were supportive and some were even excited. L was born and lived with both of his parents until about May of this year, when L’s mom was very depressed and ended up going inpatient for a week, and both her and my nephew signed over custody to my sister (42f). 

Since then my sister and her husband have been taking care of L full time, emotionally, physically, and financially. My nephew and L’s birth mother continue to be in a volatile on again off again relationship, being financially supported by my sister and her husband. They moved to another state in July on a whim, don’t send any money for L or even ask to video chat with him.

My sister asked my husband and I to be L’s godparents and we accepted. We don’t have kids of our own and have sent packages and money to help support L.

October was L’s 1st birthday. I got a plane ticket to go to celebrate (as we live in a different state). My sister offered my nephew a plane ticket to come to his son’s birthday. At first he said yes, that he wanted a ticket and wanted to return home. Two weeks before the birthday he changed his mind, so neither of his birth parents went to the birthday. To note this was not a conflict with work or money: the birth mother had weekends off, low bills, and makes decent money. My nephew was not working and was offered a plane ticket. They decided not to come. 

Both of them are serial Facebook posters, trying to portray a life that is vastly different than reality. On the birthday celebration day, they both made their respective posts on FB about his birthday, how smart, sweet, perfect he was. I also posted some pictures from the party and posted “Celebrating little man’s first birthday with those who love him most.” My nephew liked the post, then deleted me off FB and started texting his mom angrily all night about my post because it implied that HE didn’t love his son since be wasn’t there. My niece made a similarly worded post and he did the same to her. My sister got angry with us saying that we made the posts purposefully looking to get a ride out of him.

Recently my best friend got a boyfriend. I had a crush on that boy before, later she decided that even she liked him and they started to date. At first it was all chill and fine but after a while my friend started to distance herself from me little by little and and she got new friends, whom i totally despise and i have told her that but her boyfriend likes them, so she is hangs out with them, which means even i have to hangout bc ever since the beginning of our friendship we have been a duo and now i have to hangout with these new people who i dont like and even those people dont want me there. At school, whenever we sit together, we never talk if we do, its about her boyfriend or she talks with her new friends, i am always alone. Her boyfriend hates me as we have had some issues in the past, I went out with her and her boyfriend and he out of nowhere start cursing and calling me homophobic slurs (the d word), i looked at my best friend hoping she would defend me but she didnt instead she joined him and also started to call me slurs, mind you, we have been friends for over 12 years. 

I later screamed at her for not saying anything to her boyfriend and joining him, and about how she has replaced me with literally everyone her boyfriend likes, she just stayed quite with a smirk and i told her to never talk to me ever again. She started to hang out with her new friends. One day one of her friend came to me and asked me to let this situation go, as my friend is very upset and cries a lot, i simply said ""firstly she has never said sorry to me, she has always been rude to me, if she feels so sorry, why cannot she let the ego come and say sorry to my face"" the friend just tried to justify my old best friend and we fought over this for an hour, she ended with the arguement saying ""well if you dont want to let go, its okay, but dont talk about this situation in public to other people"" I had told one of my other friends about this situation and she confronted her and she started to cry. 

I dont know what spell has her boyfriend done on her, but she has changed drastically, she even hit one my friends for being friends and because her boyfriend didnt like her. She even now publicly proudly claims about how hit her mother.

After a few weeks i dont know how, but we started to hang out again, she still hadnt said sorry, still hang out with her shitty friends and boyfriend. It went good for a few days, until she started to become a bitch again and i called things off again. Now whenever she sees me she starts to cry in public, which i knew is for attention. She still hasnt said sorry to me .Now i got a call from her mother who called me an asshole for being 'jealous' of her daughter and hurting her again and again and now all her friends are also calling me and asshole.

My wife and I had such a blast doing it, that we ended up buying it.

Over the years, Santa has shown up at my friends' houses, and Church.  We've never asked for anything, other than something cold to drink, and a ""safe"" place to change (away from the kids) and get a chance to catch my breath.  Putting on the costume is time-consuming, and wearing the costume is like wearing R36 insulation.  (If it wasn't so darn expensive, people could insulate their houses with it.)

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this year...my BFF, Richard, called me up.  Apparently I was ""volunteered"" to play Santa at my Church's upcoming Christmas party by his wife.  (She has a nasty habit of volunteering her husband, and thought she could do that to me.)  Richard straight-up ""noped"" her, and told her that the people in charge needed to ask me DIRECTLY; no middlemen; they have my phone number or e-mail address.

Other than Richard and my wife, I haven't told anybody this, but if I'm not formally asked by a certain time, I'm not going to do it.    The three of us will go on a little day-trip, and not worry about it.  I'm not bringing this up with anybody, and I'm certainly not going to call anybody.  My opinion is, if they didn't have the courtesy and respect to ask me directly, then I don't owe them a thing.

Where I may be the jerk, is if the kids have to go without a Santa.  I'd hate to see them go without a visit from Santa, but I believe that's not my fault.

We decided to live together after working the same job. For the most part it’s great. She’s never really around because she works far away and stays with her parents a lot. She probably only spends 4 nights a week here. She’s in a long distance relationship and sometimes spends her weekends out of state. She also has a habit of inviting her boyfriend over to stay the weekend without asking me.

Before we moved in together, I had talked about adopting cats. After moving in, she kept asking about when I was getting my cats. She mentioned that she might get a dog if I didn’t get cats, and as much as I love dogs, I didn’t want to live with one. She has no responsibilities over my cats, which we set as a ground rule. Honestly I don’t really trust her with them, for reasons I’ll explain later. When I’m gone for extended periods of time I hire a cat sitter. She doesn’t really seem to care for the cats and avoids them when possible. 

I really want to call her out because she’s careless with my cats and other general safety measures. She frequently leaves the front and back doors unlocked. We live in a city with high crime so I really hate this. At first I told her when she did it, but with time she became increasingly defensive and dismissive of my anxiety.

A few days ago, she took a pregnancy test on my insistence as she was showing a few signs of being pregnant. She made a bet with me that I was wrong and I insisted on anal sex twice this week as a forfeit. She accepted the bet and replied that I would have to do all the dishes for a year if she won. She also gloated about the fact that she would certainly win this bet and how it would end her losing streak (she has lost all the bets we have made so far). The report turned out to be positive and my wife voluntarily declared herself beaten and offered to have sex. She referred to it as my 'reward'.

We had anal sex yesterday but I was the aggressor throughout while my wife was remarkably passive. I only remember her kissing me back a few times on the lips when I initiated the kiss - that was pretty much it. Once I penetrated her she pouted and started complaining about the fact she always loses to me. I offered to stop but she asked me to go ahead as she wanted to keep her word. Once I finished, she turned a bit red and asked me whether I enjoyed it. I said yes but remarked that she didn't seem to enjoy it much. I tried to cheer her up by praising her beauty and also drew her attention to the fact that she is about to become a mother for the second time. She seemed more bothered about the anal sex rather than about the baby. I also heard her complain that she loses to me at everything and paid up the bet because she deserved it for losing. Only when I proposed dining out did she smile and celebrate the fact that we are about to become parents. Later, when I asked her whether we would have anal sex one more time, she replied in the affirmative. However, her behavior made me feel as if I was doing something unfair to her. She is definitely being a sore loser or else she would have accepted defeat graciously.

Please note that I repeatedly offered to cancel the bet in case she was unwilling to have anal sex with me. She insisted that I could go ahead with the anal if I felt like doing it. I felt it was unfair that she should offer me anal sex and later not enjoy it.

And after like 15 minutes of this my dad has apparently had enough and asks “honey could you please move? you’re disrupting the movie” which my dad and i both think was polite and not rude at all. But then out of the blue my mom tells my grandma “my family hates me”. Like what? And i retaliated and said “no you’re just talking over the movie and it’s bothering me”. I’ll admit i shouldn’t have said that last part and so my mom gets up and slams the door to her room. After a while she ends the call and comes back out screaming and a very one sided argument begins and at this point shes beyond reasoning and goes to her usual excuse that she’s being ganged up on.

I’ll try to keep this short but it may be difficult to. Pretty much my entire life, my dad and I have never had a close relationship. He cheated on my mom when I was 5 and they ended up divorcing when I was 6. My mom got most of the custody and he was always diligent with paying child support and that was the extent of our relationship. I never felt a strong emotional connection to him even though I’ve desired a close relationship with him for a long long time. 

My dad ended up remarrying when I was 11. He went off and got married without telling me or my brother and it all just felt weird but I went along with it. 

Growing up, my dad favored my brother, he always attended his sporting events and they were always close. My brother is the golden child and while I’ve never resented him, I’ve been jealous for a long time that I didn’t get this kind of attention.

As an adult, my dad and I are in and out of contact. He’s done things that I’ve never really gotten over, like cheating on my mom multiple times, missing my university graduation, and asking if I lost weight when I told him I had good news. (The good news was that I got promoted at work.) There’s been lots of weight comments over the years from him and his wife and I struggle with self esteem and body issues now as a result. 

Anywho, I’ve dealt with a lot of resentment and I finally shared my feelings about how I feel like he failed me and even expressed that I was jealous of his wife and sometimes my brother.

I forgot to add this above but he married his mistress. I’ve never been close with her either, and I didn’t find out she was the mistress until it came out when touring colleges in high school; my brother let it slip and I was very confused and didn’t know how to feel about it. 

So back to telling my dad my feelings. I told him in a private email and instead of him getting back to me, his wife sent me a text telling me I’m a victim and called it all bull shit. She told me shame on me etc. and said that I never tried to have a relationship, that I spend more time with my in-laws, and she just all around made me feel like crap for sharing my feelings. She then told my mom about what I said (before I even had a chance to share with my mom) and got her involved which I didn’t intend to happen either. 

AITA for saying something? I don’t feel like what I said was mean but it was pretty specific and deep. I feel bad unloading two decades worth of feelings all at once but I couldn’t stand the feelings being pent up anymore.

She and I became closer in high school and fell out because I had always felt on the outside of her life. We reconnect after some time and became closer than ever, pretty much each other's only friend. 
Early this year she met her boyfriend (baby dad) and not too far after I met mine, through them. They had been childhood friends. I began to notice her slowly drift away, but figured it was due to 'finding the one'. To be fair, I feel this way about my boyfriend as well, but was still trying to make time for her. 
The pregnancy came at the beginning of summer. Everyone was happy about it so we were too. Obviously I had my concerns but I wanted to be there for her. I got her a few gifts throughout the summer and tried my best to be around.
She moved away at the end of summer (about 3 hrs away) and my boyfriend and I helped them clean out their space. After that, I barely heard from her for months. I finally initiated a conversation and it went on for about 3 days, as she would only respond after midnight one or two times. This whole conversation was about how she was doing. 
She had her gender reveal a month or so ago and afterward, she and her boyfriend came to my boyfriends house. The whole time they talked about themselves and their lives. They even had a conversation just the two of them while we just sat there. Since she has moved away, she has not asked me anything about myself or how I'm doing, even when I ask her and engage in her life.  The more recent messages I've sent her she reponds maybe once even after I reply again. It's not as if I haven't tried to connect. 
I spoke with her mother the other day and she told me that she told her mother to ""make sure (I) am helping her"" at least three times. Why would you expect me to plan this if you don't even talk to me?
Her shower is in a month and I've committed myself to her mother to help. I have put no money towards it and do not intend to but I don't even really want to go. Her mother is aware that she hasn't spoken to me, but just writes it off as normal for her. We've always been the kind of friends that don't need to talk all the time, but she doesn't even seem interested in being around me anymore.

After dinner, I went to my bedroom to get ready to get ready to take a shower, when I saw that our furniture had moved. My dresser was at an angle and almost right in front of the window, blocking it and part of the curtain. He also switched our two big dressers; he's very big on 'sides' in our room, and the dresser that I predominantly get my laundry from was now on his 'side.' He said that this was all because whenever he tries to open the door, it hits my dresser and moved so for convenience. Except, none of the stuff he moved was his. I decided to just go and tell my mom go and see what he did, then I went to take my shower. When I came out, everything in our room was the same. I asked my mom if she saw our room. She said she did, and thought it was a good idea. This angered me, so I just said ""okay, I guess just don't parent your child,"" then went back downstairs. I said this because my brother is very temperamental and pitches fits if he doesn't get what he wants; it is also very difficult to calm him down. I've tried to imply to our parents that he needs therapy or something, but nothing ever happens. This has just lead to more work often being piled onto me then my him and him getting what he wants more often. It's past the point of taking one for the team and closer to the point where its affecting their parenting. I was pretty sure that they only acted like this because they didn't want to scold or punish him, considering I would almost certainly get in trouble if I did something like this. Anyways, I got called up and we talked about it, and I was told I was blowing this out of proportion. I tried explaining that this was less what he did and more a metaphor for the fact that he doesn't care about people's privacy (I did report him to the school for sexually harassing girls, so that tracks), or about other people's opinions or how the things he does affect the people around him, and I subtly tied the parenting thing into it too, but they wouldn't hear it. My brother was told he should have asked permission, but besides that he was in the right; I was told I was being exaggerative and rude. I explained that the door has never been a problem for me, you just need to be careful. But they just started talking about ways to change it again so it could be better, without doing anything about what he did. I was also stuck with a crappy temporary solution to the way that my furniture was set up.

The final 2 are best friends I made because we played collegiate lacrosse together and also lived together during college. Safe to say we spent a lot of time together and our strong friendship has stayed after we graduated. 

Here is the issue- I got all my friends together for a small gathering and asked them to be my bridesmaids which they all happily said yes. Two days later, a friend from college sent me a note in the mail asking if I’ll be her bridesmaid. This was honestly a little surprising because all though we are friends, I did not think she’d even consider me. Our friendship is not as deep compared to the group I mentioned.
