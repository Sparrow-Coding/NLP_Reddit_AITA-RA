We have similar interests, work in similar fields. I’ve liked her since we met. She lives around the corner and we regularly meet for walks and chats etc.. 

On the other hand I’ve never been close with my partners actual mum (55F) we’ll call her Jen, my partner also isn’t close with her. She walked out on her family when my partner was a teen, consequently they’ve never been close. She also lives a few hours drive away so we don’t see her often. Everything else aside we just have never bonded; we have nothing in common, I find her very draining to be around, but I’ve also welcomed her into my home during holidays, always sent cards &amp; gifts on birthdays, been the dutiful daughter in law basically.

So Ann plays in an orchestra and tonight is one of their big performances. I bought tickets to watch &amp; support her months ago. I’ve been really looking forward to it. Ann is so talented and has no other family so I love to show up for her and cheer her on. 

The problem came when yesterday Jen calls and announces that she is coming down today to visit the Christmas market and that she wants my partner and I to go with her. I apologised to Jen and told her that unfortunately I wouldn’t be able to make it as I had plans with Ann, I explained the situation and asked if perhaps she could visit another day, maybe tomorrow or next Saturday and I’ll be able to attend the market with her then. 

Jen explained that isn’t possible, that she had already booked the train &amp; a hotel room. I apologised again and told her that I’d already booked and paid for the concert ticket and the train, as well as obviously my commitment to Ann. Jen was not happy. She told me that as she rarely comes down and is my partners genetic mum that I should be willing to make the effort to spend time with her above Ann. I politely apologised again, but was firm that I wouldn’t be changing my plans. 

Jen told me that I’m selfish and that I’m being difficult for the sake of it. I stayed polite and told her that if she can rearrange her visit and give me good notice that of course I’ll go to the market with her, but otherwise I won’t be able to and I hope she still enjoys it without me. 

By this point Jen was just verbally abusing me. I ended the call as although I won’t be rude to her I won’t tolerate being spoken to like that. Afterwards she text me and told me I’m an AH. My partner is backing up my decision, but his brother agrees with his mum. 

I don’t know what to think now. I feel guilty for not going with Jen, but I’d rather go to Ann’s concert &amp; as I said I’d already committed to Ann that I’d be there plus paid for tickets &amp; train fares.

I also have a cat (Wasabi) that I fully take care of. She is the cutest little thing and I love her endlessly. For my birthday, my roommate (22F) who well call Ashley, bought me flowers and my favorite cake which was super sweet of her and I loved it; however, the flowers she bought were unbeknown to both of us toxic to cats (Let me just say now, my cat is okay).

 I have warned her many times in the past to please be careful about what plants she brings into the apartment because of the fact that I know a lot of plants can hurt cats. Anyway, Wasabi ate some of the flowers while I took a nap. Ashley woke me up crying because she said “I’m so sorry. I think I hurt your cat.” So I asked her what was going on and she told me she had looked up the flowers after my birthday dinner and realized they were toxic so she contacted her friends mom who is a vet who told her to take the cat to the nearest animal hospital. Ashley was hysterically crying and on the verge of an anxiety attack saying “I’m so sorry. I will pay for all of this but I don’t know how to pay for it right now because I don’t have enough money right now.” I told her it’s okay, Wasabi will be fine, and made a game plan. 

I would like to say I was very worried about Wasabi but I’m unusually calm during panic situations because I work in a hospital. I told her we could figure out a payment plan later but for now I would borrow money from my sister and pay her back the following week (my school owed me $1000 that I was planning to use to pay off my credit card and the check was coming that week). We took her to the vet. It ended up being $600. I paid my sister back as soon as I could. Wasabi was fine though and she has been for weeks. 

Now, it’s been a few weeks. Neither my roommate nor I have brought up the payment because I don’t know if it should be my responsibility or not. Neither of us are in great financial situations. I’m still in college and paying my way through that. She just graduated and has a full time job but has a lot of loans and bills that she has to pay because she just got a new car since her old one broke down. Both of us are financially cut off from our parents and have been for years. I also worry if it is her responsibility, if I bring it up, will it affect our relationship? She’s also my best friend.

I'm actually a manager there. My role is fairly important, and it's our busy season right now. Frankly, my company would probably be in the lurch if I left, and I feel slightly guilty. Not for our owners, but for the ground level person.

Have a chance to leave for another job. 

I run one of our support departments. It's a high paying and fairly high intensity role. 

Long story short, I feel like my company really ""likes"" me, but doesn't value me. The ownership group has changed and is very very out of touch

Here's the type of stuff I'm leaving over. My company doesn't actually respect me that much, even though they think they do 

* Other people are turning a blind eye to the fact that I'm very overworked, and my group is under-resourced. They continue to dump more and more on me. 
* I'm left out of many closed door meetings, the sales people basically decide everything at my company. 
* As a ""support"" role, I feel very left out. The sales team got about $500 of nice company ""swag,"" and we basically had to complain about this to get a cheap plastic water bottle. 
* My company is adding high paid executives and not adding ground level support
* I've seen how the sausage is made, and have now seen how my company basically tries to low-ball people on salaries, etc. The top people are **extremely** stubborn, despite having many people leave, and getting very direct feedback. Again, there has been direct company-wide feedback on a town hall about how people were unanimously unhappy

So here's where I feel a bit guilty. My team relies on me. My company has been mostly fair to me, despite these things 

I've been fairly outspoken in my frustration, but very much in a corporate speak way. I've never been confrontational, and demanded things. 

I guarantee that if/when I resign , many higher ups will pull me aside and beg me to stay, and say ""WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS.""

Btw her cousin is coming with us. Fast forward the night before the selling, my other friend D messaged me to ask me would it be okay if she can tag along with us since she doesn’t have anyone to go with. I was actually glad she asked me because I know how much she wanted to come to this concert since she’s also a fan and it’s also a chance for her and J to meet since they haven’t met yet so I told her yes she can come with us. I then messaged J to tell her my friend will be coming with us. I thought she wouldn’t mind since she’s also bringing someone which is her cousin whom I haven’t met before. That’s when it started to go downhill. She later messaged me that night that she and her cousin won’t go to the concert after all. I asked her why and she told me that her cousin backed out. I told her she can still come since me and D are still going. She refused telling me she doesn’t want to go since she’s not in the mood anymore and that she’s shy to come with us. I assured her that I want her to come with us. But all I got was cold replies. I then asked her if she has any problems, but she kept being cold and ended up not replying to me anymore. We haven’t talked to each other ever since. 

The thing is J is a very passive aggressive person and she could be very jealous/possessive friend which has been an issue within our friend group. If she didn’t like something you did she will sulk then act up or shut off and when you confront her about it she will just play it off like she’s fine but will continue sulking. Or sometimes when I tell a story about my other friends she will be so uninterested and would then act up and tell me why won’t I just be with them. So when she didn’t reply to me, I knew she’s sulking about me bringing my other friend which is what I don’t understand. 

So as I said that was last month. Fast forward to last night, she and her cousin went out partying and she posted a story of them singing to a taylor swift song (which is an artist we both love and bonded over) with a caption saying “to all her close friends suck it”.

This morning, ""Rupert"" sent me a message completely out of the blue to show me that there was a sofa and armchair for sale by one of his friends on Insta. I say this was out of the blue, because in the entire time that i have known him, we have never discussed furniture.

I have asked ""Daniel"" to have a gentle word with ""Rupert"" and remind him that this is my home too, and to please be respectful (or words thereabouts). I said, ""this will be much better coming from you, but if you don't talk to him I will-- BUT, this is not me threatening to argue with ""Rupert"" and I will be 100% polite and respectful throughout the conversation"".

He started creating NSFW content, first on reddit, then on Instagram, now on onlyfans (OF) I think. But apparently one needs a certain number of followers on other platforms so that one can make money out of OF.

He kept telling me about it and promoting his NSFW Insta account and although I opened his stories and saw it, I never followed (I follow under 100 accounts and most of them are businesses). I admit it’s because I’m not interested in that type of content and I’m not a fan of the idea of OF.

He got upset and told me he didn’t ask me to buy anything, but a simple follow won’t hurt because it’s free and it would help him build and monetize his OF. It would be a simple gesture to support him and the LGBTQI+ community.

I told him I barely follow anything on Insta and it’s mostly pages and pets, and ofc some close friends, and I didn’t know what else to say because it might be misinterpreted (that I’m transphobic, which I’m not.

For context I have a long distance relationship with her. we met each on an app called Meetme a dating app with kinda sketchy premise cause you basically pay to talk to girls and most of the girls are aspiring only fans girls that are looking to make a quick buck with their nudes. My GF messaged me first we hit it off from there she is from the UK and I thought she is the most beautiful girl in the world. After a couple weeks we realized that we were very much into each other. Now after we got together she had asked for money for clothes now I wasn’t worried about so I sent the money about 137 US Dollars and she was grateful couple of weeks later she apparently ripped her coat and had asked if I could help get her a new one which I was hesitant about but did cause I was in the honeymoon phase of our relationship. After this she was on and off asking for money for food or taxi cause she didn’t have her license. June was when I considered the honeymoon phase over when she guilt-tripped me into giving her 256 dollars  for a new phone (which now is broken) then still continued asking for money for food and taxi when I was starting to get into debt cause I was using cash advances and loans to help her out. Before you say I am wipped I do say no but she tries the guilt tripping me into giving her money which usually works. In July I straight up told her I feel like a bank for her to pull out money cause at this point she was asking for money everyday even though she says she feels terrible about asking and says it’s the last time (spoiler alert it never is) and she says it’s not true then actually stop for two weeks then picked right up again with me trying to say no even when I’m actually broke until she get mad at me with a “Wow, ok.” Then she lost her grandmother in October and this is where my thoughts of breaking up with her is coming from they needed to sell her grandmothers house and she needed help paying for the movers to be nice I offered 50 bucks to help but needed up having to pay the entire thing which annoyed me. She is in the hospital due some reason she never specified and has been asking for money for food now I don’t know how much hospital food is in the UK but I do know they are not 30 bucks.

We’ve only move here 2 weeks ago. Our little boy I saw enrolled in a school that has classes in English (he doesn’t speak local language yet) but they learn the same things as kids in this country. Same pace and everything. It’s been a lot of adjustment for all of us as school is so different here.

One of th things we struggled with is that he was forced to take classes in 2 foreign languages. Apparently, that’s mandatory. Well, I think one would suffices. It’s  way too early to impose so many subjects on little kids.

I took a year of Spanish when I was in high school and I remember how it went, the teacher would explain conjugation and we would learn how to conjugate new words in every class for like a month. But that’s not the case here. The teacher teaches them conjugation rules, expects them to learn i and be able to conjugate all regular verb even if they never heard them beforehand. RHats ridiculous.

The pace is outrageous. One day they have to learn numbers up to 100 and two days later they’re expected to know them, learn colors and form 5 simple sentences as a homework. It’s unsustainable.

I went to the teacher and tried to explain to her that her methods are wrong and she needs to focus on teaching instead of plotting through the material. She told me she was following the guidelines and it’s a normal pace, kids learn fast.
I asked her to slow down, perhaps go through conjugations slowly, spend a few more lessons on practicing colours before forming sentences with them, etc. She shot down all of my ideas, saying she appreciated the feedback but she won’t be changing her teaching but I should spend more time with Ben practicing at home because it’s clear he hasn’t been practicing his conjugations. I told her it was her responsibility and didn’t appreciate her giving me parenting advice.
She told me she thought we were done here. 
I felt completely belittled and disrespected. I told her she’s incompetence and I would be taking it further.

When I got home, I blasted her on FB group for expats and many agreed with me but some were adamant that I was in the wrong.
The teacher found out and reported it to the principal and I met with the principal thinking he was on my side only to find out he wasn’t angry at me (how? Why?) and to
Me to stop harrasing the teacher or move my son to another school.

I told my husband and she thinks I was a massive asshole for creating drama so early on and I should’ve given it more time.but I think I had a right to react when I thought the teacher was incompetent and not teaching my son properly.

We were in the garden when someone We’ve never met (let’s call her Rose)  started cooing over our baby. We were uncomfortable (we’re both introverts lol) but still smiled along. She asked my bf if he wanted more and how many. He said he wanted 7. She turned to me and said “you better get on it”. I fake laughed then muscled myself away. 

About 30m later she found me again and asked when I’m going to have another one. Baring in mind I just gave birth 2 weeks prior. 

I fake laughed and said “maybe in a couple of years”. 
Rose - why? You should have one now. 
Me - I just had one haha 
Rose - yeah but Joe wants 7 and clock is ticking. You should start trying right away. 

She then goes on to ask about my baby but really detailed things like how much she weighed, what hospital I had her at, her full name, any birth marks etc. I thought she was just nosy until she started asking about her blood type and wanted to see her medical book. I got super uncomfortable so smelled my baby’s bum and lied she needed a nappy change so I can leave her. 

About 10 mins later I was in the kitchen warming baby bottle when she came in asking more things and followed me out to the main room where I sat down to feed baby. I tried to change the subject which worked for all of 30 seconds then she started asking again. 

Rose - you don’t have to wait the 6 weeks for sex, you’re more fertile after giving worth. Worked for me with my kids. 
Me- aww cute
Rose - so if not now, you should get pregnant by Christmas 
Me - haha no way
Rose- so when? And what’s the hold up
Me - maybe in 2/3 years haha what about you? 

Then her face dropped and she absolutely lost it. She screamed and startled all the kids in the room 

Rose - HOW F*cling DARE YOU ASK ME THAT. so inconsiderate. I just lost a pregnancy at 6 weeks last month. You should really think before you talk etc etc 

She was crying and freaking out. I was too stunned to speak. She stormed out the room and slammed the door so hard, the shelf fell off the wall and landed on the pillar holding the reveal cake which then fell on the floor and all the blue balls came spilling out the cake and all over the room. 

Joes brothers gf was in tears and screamed at me too. And then her friends tried to fight me until an elder stepped in but only because I was holding my baby. 

My bf came bolting down the stairs and ofc defended me. I was kicked out the party for ruining it and Joe came with. Now there’s a huge divide in the family and I’m uninvited for Christmas. My bf says if I’m not welcome, he’s not going either. Now they hate me and say I’m keeping Joe and the baby from them.

I recently moved in with with a childhood friend, and overall he's not bad at all. I only have minor complaints that I keep to myself and it stems from me just being a hermit.   
The issue here though is laundry. I had a full thing of laundry drying overnight as well as washing just two pillows, and was going to get it when I woke up. (He was also out the whole day and night so didn't expect him to be in). I did these loads so late because I was washing sheets and towels the other half of the day.   


I wake up to my dried clothes in a trash bag and the wet pillows back in the washer.   


Something similar has happened before, which is where most of the salt comes from rather than this since this time my main clothes were able to dry beforehand. A few weeks back I had to rewash some clothes that had cat pee on, so they needed a second turn. He just takes those wet clothes out and puts them onto the dryer, so he can do his load beforehand.  


I don't remember if I've left laundry in there longer than a day, perhaps when we first moved in, but the last few times I don't use the machines for more than a full day.

I (21 F) recently moved out of an apartment with my partner (20 M) into my mom’s old house that she turned into a rental and was no longer residing. The roommate who moved in a few months before I did (we’ll call her A) was living upstairs in my old room. In the beginning when I moved in she seemed alright, a little quiet but she didn’t seem overly eager to have me moving in. At some point I accidentally let her cat out front and I had no idea she wasn’t allowed out front and when I knew that I apologized so so much but she was still passive aggressive towards me and still even now is mad about that despite the fact that I didn’t mean for her to get out. Honestly if my old cat had gotten out I’d panic too but I wouldn’t initially assume ill intent. Yet that’s basically what happened here and she has held onto this ever since. So skip ahead to now; we had two refrigerators in the house for awhile and my mom took one for the place she was moving into. I was in charge of the turkey and I couldn’t stick it in the other fridge so I had to rearrange the main fridge to get the turkey to fit. I was feeling really productive and wanted to unpack some boxes and clean up the bedroom more. I went to the bathroom and started to unpack bathroom supplies and put them into drawers. I also did dishes and tried to make a key copy. Skip ahead to last night and all hell busts loose and it’s a texting screaming match between her and I. She was pissed about the fridge being rearranged for me to make room for the turkey. (I didn’t know what else to do, it was only a temporary set up) She called me a bitch for putting stuff in the drawers.(I last remember thinking she told me it was okay to unpack my bathroom stuff to use some of the cabinet/drawer spacing) Then Was mad I used a scrubber of hers to do dishes (last I checked I thought we were on the same page with using whatever soap or scrubbers we had so long as we replaced them.) And finally, the cherry on top of the spite piss sundae was her accusing me of using her body wash and putting water in the bottle to make it look like I hadn’t. (I never even touched her damn soap so that put me over the edge at this point.) We started texting back and forth aggressively and at some point I could hear her swearing her lungs out screaming at me upstairs and I reciprocated only once with that. Once the screaming was over she started stomping upstairs and making a lot of noise and had the tv turned all the way up. After all of this I proceeded to empty the drawers in the bathroom and we haven’t spoken. So I need some perspective here, did I do something wrong?

then, I get woken up by my mom calling at 1 am to open the door. I was sleepy so I didn't really understand. I got up and opened the door to see my parents furious. I asked what was happening and they told me they were trying to contact me since 10 pm. I said I went to bed early as I told them I would probably do and they said I should have sent a message that I was going to bed.

they started yelling at me and I was like wtf, because it wasn't like I sneaked out of the house to go to a party (which they wouldn't say no if I wanted to go to a party in the first place, I wouldn't need to sneak out). the whole point why they were angry is because I was sleeping.

I'm actually confused because I don't get why they got so angry. I had talked to them an hour prior to me going to bed, but it was like it wasn't enough. I hate when they are on my neck and won't let me breathe, because it suffocates me. staying alone at night seems like a difficult thing to accept but they knew that I was staying there and they had talked to me before, so I don't understand where all this distrust comes from. I've never broken the rules of the house or snook out, or even lied to them about where I was. and it's also weird that they make such a big deal about it at this age. I know each parent is different but I'm 18 and this type of behavior is something I've never seen in them. it actually disgusted me how much they don't trust me even when I never made anything for them not to.

also, do they not know me? I usually go to bed early, it's not uncommon for me to be already asleep at those hours. why do I feel like they don't even bother to get to know me and expect me to be a certain way?

First post here after discussing it with my boyfriend to know who is the asshole.

So today was a friend's birthday. It's initially an old friend of my boyfriend that I got to knew over the years. She live far from us (think 4 hours in train).
This morning, while we were both (bf and I) chilling at home, I send her a text to wish her an happy birthday. She answered quickly, thanking me and asking me if I went to see my boyfriend make a presentation in another city (far from where we and she live). I was confused, because if my boyfriend had a talk to present at an event, it was last week. My boyfriend not being in the same room as me when I got the text, I clarified that it already passed and that I didn't went as I had another event planned on the same weekend. I also asked her, to be polite and continue the conversation, if she planned a party to celebrate.

She didn't answered back and we continued our day. Later, while speaking, I asked my boyfriend when he told her that he had an event to attend and said to him she seems to get the date wrong. He said to me he actually lied to her on the date as an excuse to not attend the birthday party she planned after she invited him. He didn't want to attend mainly because it's far from our home, and he doesn't know a lot of her friends going to the party.

I was livid as I realized I accidentally exposed his white lie. He got mad at me for ""stirring s*it up"" in his relationship with his friend. Said to me I gave too much information and should have checked with him. Again, I didn't knew anything about the party and the lie. He also used my childhood against me (I didn't have a lot of friend) and pointed out my lack of socialisation as the reason I didn't spotted his lie. 

I told him it was his fault for lying and not telling me about it. And if his friend was pissed at him (which we don't know about because we didn't contact her since this morning), it was the consequence of him being caught lying.

As I have troubles to keep my emotions in check some times, I first isolated myself. Then, when my boyfriend came to check on me, I proposed to him we post this on Reddit to have more opinions about the situation, which he agreed to.

We moved in July 2022 in which the building's single elevator has since been broken since September 2022, totalling three months and counting. Apparently there's an issue with one of the boards and trying to get it from the manufacturer, but even when the board gets delivered, we're also being told the inspection will have passed its mark so that will also need to be addressed as part of this situation. The building management has been communicative about the issue and their active attempts to get it resolved. They have been emailing the tenants weekly, occasionally a few times a week, though admittedly it's been almost two weeks of zero communication recently.   

The first few days, weeks, even a month was understandable as this didn't appear to be the fault of management and they seemed like they were making efforts to resolve the issue. However, it's starting to really be a burden. In our original search for an apartment, we would never have voluntarily signed up to live in a fifth floor walk-up, certainly not at the monthly rent price we're paying. When I raised this to my husband, his response was to acknowledge it's not great but, essentially, we don't have any recourse. When I suggested having a discussion with our landlord to see if we could knock off a portion of monthly rent given that we signed up for one living situation and now are not provided with that situation, he said it's not the landlord's fault. While I agree it isn't their fault, I think there is a case that it's their responsibility. In terms of how much money to knock off each month until the elevator is working again, I don't know the right answer to that and am happy to keep an open mind and discuss with our landlord to come to a fair number. 

My husband also said that the only thing he thinks would be fair in this situation would be that this would allow us to go to our landlord and break our lease without penalty. My feeling here is that this doesn't really offset any burden; in fact, it means that we would now suddenly need to find new budget to cover another realtor fee (this fee is almost always mandatory in NYC and Boston, and this is usually equal to one month's rent that just goes straight into the pocket of the realtor), take time off from work to search for new apartments and tour each one, and then to finance another actual move. We also plan to be leaving Boston in July 2023 and trying to find an apartment that would agree to an eight month lease would add to the difficulty. 

I should add that both my husband and I are physically capable of climbing five flights of stairs every time we want to leave and return to our apartment; however, I am pregnant and imagine that there will come a time in my third trimester that it may become more difficult, especially when we are facing carrying up all of our groceries or large delivered items for the baby. ",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4826900,public,top,self,AITA for wanting to ask my landlord for a discount on my monthly rent given the elevator in our building is out of service?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5ahul/aita_for_wanting_to_ask_my_landlord_for_a/,all_ads,6,,,,

Right now I have the bigger bed room with the half bath, and my roommate has the smaller bedroom with the full bath that we only share when I shower- not any daily functions like flossing, brushing my teethe, brushing my hair, etc.

Our rent is $1600, I pay $850 and she pays $750 as we've agreed for the last 1.5 years on this payment plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Her girlfriend is going to move in with us, and we are clearing out one corner we hardly used  for a cat tower for her cats, a whole (the biggest) closet for her cats and their litter boxes, and I offered to break down and remove my kitchen table and chairs to give her space for a desk for a work area when she works from home. Plus we're throwing out our couch for her better condition couch, and naturally we'll make more space for her in the kitchen cabinets and in the fridge, storage area, and appliances for her as there is now three of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that my roommate who pays, with the two of us, $750 doesn't believe she should and her girlified- who we are making space for in the common area, need to pay more. I have said that the girlfriend will move here 2 months before the lease is up, and I'd rather not switch bedrooms until we sign a new lease or move complexes- but I also offered to switch if it'd help them settle in for us accommodating each other.

She is arguing that the girlfriend will be getting a storage unit, with will cost $x which is not my problem as it is her bills, not mine. If she brings too many things into the space we live in where we can't accommodate her things, that is the girlfriend's problem, not mine. I just want to redistribute rent, I want it to be that I pay $700 and they split the $900 which would be $450 a piece for 2/3 of the common area a bedroom that is 3/4 the size of mine.

This may also sound harsh, but the girlfriend has had almost a year's notice of moving from AZ and out of the military at the end of her employment to moving in with us. She has spent 1-3 weeks every month, for a year knowing what space will be available for her when she moves and for her things/ animals.

We are now staying with his family while we are back for Thanksgiving. His family is very close, loving, and has accepted me as one of their own since the moment we started dating years ago. It is pretty known that we will be engaged soon enough, and I have been considered an aunt to all his nieces and nephews since they were born. I absolutely love spending holidays with them, and I realized I don’t even want to put in the effort to see my own family in the short amount of time that were back.

My family is quite the opposite of my boyfriend’s. My parents have been divorced for a few years (they are civil) and I am the oldest of 3 siblings. As much as I wish we were, we are not a super loving, family-oriented group. When it comes to holidays, there is never a set plan for my family, and usually each member goes to a different place. It’s not just a matter of, “Are we going to mom’s or dad’s this year?” It’s: mom is going to her friend’s, dad is away, siblings are going to grandma’s, etc. As you can imagine this makes it extremely difficult to see all of them in one day. 

This year, I decided to stay with my boyfriend’s family the entire day instead of going back and forth with mine. It made the day 100x less stressful, and I really enjoyed my Thanksgiving for the first time in a while. I got a text from one of my siblings pretty late in the day on Thanksgiving, asking me to come to where they were and that they want to see me. I had already been drinking a bit and knew I wasn’t going to make it.

Since then, I’ve received the cold shoulder from my siblings and they’ve made no effort to see me. I have reached out to them and asked what their weekend plans are, and I’ve gotten no responses. I feel really guilty for not seeing any of my family in the 4 days I’m home, but they have not made an effort either (besides my dad). I feel that I have to add that my boyfriend and I always spend Christmas morning/day with my family, so it’s not like I spend every holiday separate from them.

This is very common firstly, my mum creates these weird arguments against me and I'm starting to feel legitimately crazy. So I have been cutting my own hair for years, or I had a friend cut it since I was 14, I am 21 now. I have always had to pay myself for hair cuts so I prefer how to learn and I've found a great way to cut my hair myself now. I was showing my sister how I cut my hair since she asked how it looked so good and I made a comment like ""yeah I think I've done it pretty well since I haven't gotten my hair cut by a hairdresser since grade 9."" 

Mu mum turned to me and said ""no, that's not true."" I spoke back and said it was. She then said ""I swear you have the worse memory I have ever met."" Which is really insulting and she then said I was delusional. I retaliated and said ""no I got a bob cut when I was in grade 9, its too expensive so I learnt how to cut it myself"" she said no I didn't. So I asked her when did I last go then. She said she didn't know but she kept insisting I did not know what I was talking about again stating I was delusional. 

I realised she was making this about her as a parent so I responded ""I don't understand why you're making this an argument, this isn't about you as a parent, I just don't Like how hair dresses cut my hair"" this triggered her and she said I was making it seem like I was denied getting hair cuts and made her look like a bad parent. I just told her, I like how I cut my hair, I don't like how other people cut it. She kept saying I insuated she was a bad person. 

Anyway today she completely denied what she said when she asked if I could accompany my sister to the doctor and listen to remember what the doctor says. I said ""didn't you say yesterday I had the worse memory"" she said that wasn't true and said she meant I was delusional. This is very normal however my sister will always side with my mum and I feel like I'm crazy literally crazy. I don't want to call myself a black sheep.

I am a Lesbian. Sister is poly and currently actively has a male partner and has pretty much always been interested in both men and women and everything in between (lookin at our enbies). One night, there was a dressier family event, and I had plans to get ready at sister’s apartment. When I got there, we were hanging out before we had to get ready, when I made a joke about an old fight we had. 

The long short of the old fight is we got into a huge fight because she said that she identifies as a lesbian sometimes and I told her that was offensive to me as a Lesbian as she frequently is interested in men. I explained that she did not fit into the category of Lesbian as they do not like boys and she does, and also explained there were other terms she could use to mean a woman who is into other women without co-opting an identity that does not describe her, such as sapphic or wlw, and that instead of lesbian she fit better in bi or pan categories. She said she still is a Lesbian and after that we got heated and did not talk for months. She had said I was biphobic for saying she can’t be a lesbian if she is bi and also called me a TERF, which I don’t think was fair or even related. After a while, she had apologized about that incident so I thought she understood me.

I made a joke about the old fight, and then sister revealed she still sometimes identifies as a Lesbian despite pursuing her attraction to men. I asked her when she might identify as a Lesbian and she said if she was going to a bar and was only interested in women that night. I told her I would feel very manipulated if a girl picked me up and told me she was a lesbian only to reveal the morning after she had a longtime male partner, instead of just leading with that.

I found it rude to her male partner to tell people she is a Lesbian because that is a category that excludes him as a partner. She says he is a man, but the sex they have isn’t “heterosexual”. 

Here’s where I might be TA: Sister said she did not want to argue and asked if we could just agree to disagree and view eachother’s sides with empathy, but I told her I was not able to do that. I was viscerally upset and feel like she is co-opting an identity that does not belong to her and I told her that. I wouldn’t drop it and snapped at her that there was no way to be able to think what she thought “while also considering my view with compassion” because our views on this are so diametrically opposed, and that I couldn’t just drop it and keep hanging out like nothing had happened now that I know she still feels this way. She kicked me out of her apartment and I went to my other sister’s to get ready.

I must have locked it after coming back home from walking my dog. My girlfriend came home while I was in the middle of a PvP match and only heard the door knocking. Apparently she was waiting outside for about 30 minutes, and when I opened the door in the middle of the match, I said ""oh shit, I'm sorry. I didn't realize the door was locked."" She had also called multiple times but I didn't hear or see it since it wasn't on me.

I brushed it off assuming it was an accident, that it wasn't a big issue, and that there wasn't anything I could've done to fix the situation or make it better. I went back into the game, and after it ended, asked her what she wanted for dinner, but she got more angry at me. Apparently she was mad I didn't talk to her about the issue after the game (she understands that I can't pause a PvP game), but the reason why I didn't say anything was because I had already apologized, didn't know what else to do to fix the issue, and didn't think it was a big deal to begin with. I definitely would have apologized again, and let her hold it over my head in the weeks coming, but I didn't expect it to become a bigger problem.

In my head, I don't know what I couldn't done to fix the issue that had already been done. I didn't deliberately ignore her, nor did I have any malicious intent. I acknowledged my mistake again, but also told her she could've knocked louder or done something, and said that it was a bit dumb she didn't do anything else.

I tried talking to her about the situation but I still can't get my head to believe that it was a problem that warranted any conversation outside of ""I'm sorry, it won't happen again"". I admit I could've avoided saying that she was a bit dumb, but AITA?

Was there anything I could've done better? I tried to place myself in her shoes, and yes I would have been annoyed, but I believe I would have knocked louder, or done more than what she did. I also would have let it go since it was a genuine accident. I want to learn what exactly was the issue, but I genuinely can't understand that my negligence warranted a sit-down conversation to talk through our problems.

Some context about the country I live in: It's super safe and nobody will break in. I can leave my doors unlocked at night and sleep soundly. Also, it's always summer so she wasn't freezing cold in the winter or anything. She was not in danger as a result of me locking her out. She did not have anything urgent to do today, so I didn't ruin her schedule for today or anything.

I’ve been talking to a guy for some weeks now. 

I went home for thanksgiving, and told my step-dad about this guy. However, I didn’t want him to tell my mom about it. 

I don’t like talking to my mother about relationships and getting her deep into my personal life because I don’t trust her. I’ve had many experiences where my mother, instead of helping me, has given me uneasiness and emotional distress. I do have to say though, she always finds things out in the worst possible way. But, she never lets me explain things to her, and neglects talking about feelings at all costs. My mother is very explosive, and is the type of person who would not admit she is wrong; she never cares to listen and understand you. She only blames you and only you.

The next day after telling my step-dad, my mom finds out about the guy after going through my phone (She loves doing this). She wakes me up, furious, asking about who he is and why I didn’t tell her. She makes a whole rant, and demands me to tell her everything. Before, she would have slammed me to the floor and yelled at me so bad that she would have woken up the whole house and even the neighbors.

And honestly, I felt terrible. She is the person who truly watches over my well-being and wants me to be happy. She is the one who supports me economically too. But I can’t trust her no matter how much I try because of the things she has done to me before with boys and the decisions I make: she has humiliated me in front of strangers, she has given me the silence treatment for weeks, she threatened to leave me because “I don’t love her”, has shamed me for making mistakes, and loves invading my privacy. Honestly, it’s so bad that when I do anything with a guy, I feel sad and act very avoidant with them for days. I don’t even feel like seeing the guy again because I’ll remember this situation all over again. She is now giving me the silence treatment again, and asks why I don’t tell her anything. There are plenty of past unsolved issues that I’ve tried to work it out with her but is impossible. As always, she is making me feel really guilty.

B is someone she’s been seeing.

but yeah basically her reasoning was that she wanted to see if he was online, and i stuck with my first response which was no. i thought it was a stupid reason??? if he blocked you then leave him alone, i told her that but she persisted. i told her to stop being so clingy towards him and that maybe he was just tired of her (might be ta there but oh well.) and she snapped at me saying- once again, that she wasn’t going to text any of my friends and just use my account to see if he was on or not.

I (16 F) dated Thomas (17 M) a few weeks prior to this incident. We decided to break it off because he wasn’t really interested in me anymore and I didn’t know him as well as I should have (we went to different schools but have mutual friends.) My friend Brooke (also 16 F) dated him before me for around 4 months. They broke up because he thought she had cheated though she didn’t. After me and Thomas broke up, him and Brooke started to talk again. By the time of this incident they had been together for about 2 weeks.

Now onto the actual story. Brooke and a few of our other friends were going to a game for our school. I usually don’t go to these but it was coming close to the end of the season. Also I wanted to clear up some awkwardness between Thomas and I. So I waited for everyone to arrive at the game and then we went on our merry way to get food and drinks. 

I should also mention i’m not a girly girl. So while they went off to do some girly things, I stayed behind with Thomas and we had a conversation that made me feel better about the weeks prior. They all came back and Brooke was wondering what I was doing with her boyfriend. I told her honestly that we were just talking and joking while they ran off. She got super pissed at me and ran off into the bathroom.

She also accused me of purposely trying to get his attention. I was wearing a tank top under a flannel and I wasn’t paying attention to how it shifted and she told me i “Purposely was trying to get him to look there.” I didn’t even notice.

The last thing she did was text everyone who was there and told them that I was trying to get with him. I found this very infuriating since I found out and asked her about it and she claimed she was just making sure i still didn’t like him like that.

I can see why she made these claims but I was in no way trying to get with him at all. She has some attachment issues and has a hard time getting over these types of situations.

The favoritism is very obvious. A few examples: MIL and FIL are currently six figures in debt for SIL’s college education because they paid for all of her living expenses and the majority of her tuition while DH paid his own way through school. For graduation, SIL was gifted a month-long trip abroad and a $25k car while DH got no trip and a $8k car. After college, DH lived in a closet at a friend’s house for months in a rough area because it was all he could afford while PIL rented a downtown luxury apartment for SIL. When DH and I bought our first home, we worked hard and saved every penny. We were never offered help from PIL, but we didn’t think anything of it at the time because we didn’t need it. Later, when SIL decided she wanted to buy a house, PIL offered to pay for the entire down payment and closing costs because she’s not good at saving money. And every Christmas, we all wait around to watch her open literally twice as many gifts as DH gets. You get the picture. DH never says anything because he’s just grateful for everything he has and he thinks it’s even better to work for it, which I agree with.

DH adores his parents and his sister. He goes above and beyond to help them around their house with anything they ask for at a moment’s notice. We spend nearly every weekend with them. We even allowed SIL to live with us rent-free for almost a year after her ex kicked her out of his house until she bought her own. It kinda makes me sad to see how much he goes out of his way to do everything for them. 

It really isn’t my business or my family, so I didn’t think too much of it at first. What really affects me, though, is how everything revolves around SIL. Every family event needs to be planned around SIL’s schedule. If everyone else wants to do something and SIL doesn’t, the whole thing gets cancelled. If SIL isn’t available to go somewhere and everyone else is, then no one gets to go.

I’m not a confrontational person, so I’ve just gone with the flow for years. But I feel like I’m finally at a point where I want to put my foot down. This year is our baby’s first Christmas, so our families want us to host. SIL is not married and does not have any children. Normally, she would dictate the schedule on Christmas. And she expects to do the same this year. Since it is hosted in our house, however, and we’re trying to keep up with our baby’s nap and feeding schedule, I think I should be able to schedule things how I want. The problem is looking like an AH if I try to insist on anything that SIL doesn’t want to do. She likes to sleep in late. I want to just tell her to come over whenever she wants, but that we’re starting whenever baby wakes up and everyone else is ready. But I also don’t want to seem like one of those parents who thinks the world should stop for her child. I’m just tired of Christmas revolving around SIL, and I’m ready for a change.

She hasn't paid rent and its been over a month late and she isn't going to school like me so my mom told her if she cant pay rent then she has to help take care of our cats took, like clean after them and help buy food and litter when she can. Her room has started smelling bad of cat pee and her once friendly cat is now attacking us and starting full cat fights and food grading. Ive been taking care of cats my hole life and i comfronted her about the the cats sudden change of behaver and the stupid strong cat pee smell. she brushed me off and said she doesn't know what im taking about and her cat is acting just fine and there is no smell. well last week her cat drew blood on me after walking to close and i said something again here's how the convo went.

Me: (angry) cream plsss do something about your cat there's clearly something wrong.

Cream: (brushing off) There is nothing wrong with her shes just having a bad day.

Me: (even more angry raising voice) she just brew blood on me \*points at leg\* and attacked the elderly cat for trying to eat! she never used todo this there is something wrong.

cream: (now angry) well i don't know what you want me todo im saving for a car so i dont have the money todo something about it

me: (annoyed angry) well if you dont have the money then ill take her to the vet but shes clearly in pain or has some sort of illness that needs to be looked at.

How do i tell him that I don’t like it without hurting his feelings.. I know the proposal is coming soon but I really don’t want this ring. Also, I am well aware that this makes me look like a spoiled brat.. i just thought he knew what I wanted and i’ve been dreaming about this ring since I was a little girl.

Hello everyone, I apologize firstly for my mediocre mastery of english. 
So I’m a 20 yo (f) dating a 21 yo (m) since 1 year. We live together since 3 months, and everything was fine till we moved in together. He used to be comprehensive to me; I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. I’m doing my best to deal with it by taking regulary my medecins… and he used to help me with my fears, and panic crisis. Depending on the period I’m passing through, the frequency of these crisis changes. 
But since we live together he became as insensitive and imperceptible as an inert object. The changement hit me so hard, and I was in the total incapacity to do anything to change the situation. You have to know that I belong to a minority group who undergo a lot of racism. It didn’t really bother me till his friends (that I hate cz they made suffer from bullying) started to call him every night to play league of legends, this shitty game which make him scream and insult even If I’m sleeping just next to him. Yeah he has to be confortable when he plays, so he plays on our bed. I sometimes think of going to kitchen to sleep. Anyways, one night I flet kinda sick so when he screamed I spilled my bottle of water on him. Unfortunately i got slapped and when I tried to run away he pursued me and half strangled me. 
Beside that, I forgave him cz I love him, when his friends tell racist things to me he doesnt defend me, he even find it funny and laugh. But when I respond to defend my ownself, he tells me that I’m cringe and that I embarass him. Two of his friends are dating and both don’t hasitate to defend eath other, or uses nicknames as sweetie honey… my bf told that even If he finds that cute he will never do that with me cz it reveals his « weaknesses ».

The issue is that it feels like we never do spend time with each other outside of that one required day. Whenever he has the choice of who he wants to spend time with, it's never me. He will always choose to be with his friends over me. He told me straight up that it's because he prioritizes his friends over me. This really hurt me a lot. I have dedicated so much to this man, I send him love letters, I make gifts for him often, I give him so much time and love and I truly felt for him. It just feels like he never gives that same effort back. I don't think I can name one thing that he did for me outside of my birthday. It really just feels like he takes me for granted. When I told him that I was upset that I wasnt his priority and that I wanted to be his priority, he got extremely offended that I wanted him to change and said that it made him uncomfortable that I would even ask him to change himself. He kept telling me that he's known his friends for a long time and they've done a lot for him which I understand, but all I was asking was that he at least makes me equal priority to them, as his girlfriend? I don't want him to never hang out with his friends or to abandon them when I decide I want to spend time with him, and I made that clear to him. Even so, he came to me a day after this conversation and told me he wanted to break up because of all of this. I just don't know if maybe I am in the wrong for asking him to prioritize me.

I (41 F)  am married with two children. As a child I was a carer for my disabled parents, and as a result missed out on a lot of things, including not learning to swim until I was in my twenties, which I did after a friend of mine drowned. This is relevant as I will explain.

My husband works away Monday to Friday, and I work full time as well, so weekdays are hard for me. The kids have activities, clubs, etc and don’t go to the same school so there’s a lot of running about.

On Friday evenings my eldest and youngest both have clubs. My husband gets home and takes the youngest and I take the eldest. On Saturday mornings my youngest has a 30-minute swimming lesson.

Now, because I have a bit of a thing about swimming, I pay for the lessons out of my own pocket, and they aren’t cheap. But equally, since by the time Saturdays roll around I’m absolutely shattered, I often ask my husband to take him. 

He frequently says he will, and then the morning comes round and he doesn’t. Either he was too tired, or the child was, or the weather was bad, or he forgot. Last night I said to him that I would do it and he insisted it wasn’t necessary and he’d see to it.

When I woke up this morning husband was glued to his phone and child was glued to his iPad, and I lost it a bit. I called them both lazy and said that next week’s lesson was coming out of child’s pocket money or husband’s non-household money.

I tried to ignore it, thinking my boyfriend would take it, but when he didn't wake up, I went to stop it myself, but noticed that there were some flirty messages between my boyfriend and a mutual friend of ours. I put the phone on silence and started scrolling through his phone while my boyfriend was still sleeping and I saw that he was flirting with this friend for days and he was planning to spend the next night at his place. So tomorrow, when my boyfriend that he's gonna take the night swift at his work tonight, I followed him out and like expected, he did actually went to the friend's house with whom he's been flirting with.

I was fuming with rage by this point and I went to knock on the door, but saw that it was left opened and when I entered, I was surprised by my boyfriend and our friends with a party. When I asked what was happening, he tricked me into thinking that he was cheating on me in order to make me follow him where he prepared a surprise party for my birthday. I told him that my birthday was literally over 2 weeks, but he said that he needed it to do it earlier, so I wouldn't figure out his plan. He asked if I liked the party, but honestly, I was furious for tricking me like and I told him that I hated it and that he should've never played with my feelings. He tried to apologize to me and justify himself that he only did it to surprise me and we should just enjoy the party now and we'll talk about it later, but I was having none of this party and just left there and then, despite even the guests tried to convince me not to do it.

When my boyfriend got back home, he was very mad that I ruined all his efforts to surprise me and all the money and preparations for the party now went to waste, but I told him that I never asked him to surprise, especially not this day and in a day that wasn't even my birthday. He's spending this night on the sofa, but I do wonder if I should've enjoyed the party considering that he put time and money and then talk about the issue of tricking me later.

Today I (19/f) had a little encounter with the mother of my boyfriend.
She talked to me about the lacking of his hygiene or more like his lacking interest to clean his room.

My boyfriend (20/m) isn't the tidiest person. 
He's got the chair full of clothes, a desk full of random stuff and that one shelf, where you can write in the dust.
So to say, I can understand her point.
Before we came together, we were best friends for years, so I knew about ""his mess"".
(tbf mine isn't much better)

I also gotta say that mom is a cleaning freak and she cleans her complete house at least once a week.
I, on the other side, clean my room only about once a month.

We had that conversation before so I didn't think of it as something serious until she started to blame me.
She told me that she ""had hoped that I would push him to be more clean but that this hope faded"" and that she couldn't understand, ""why I would let this happen as a woman"".
The sentence that struck me quite hard was, when she told me, that ""I wasn't a real woman"", because ""Real woman care about hygiene and cleaning"".

Once I told her that I only clean my room once a month, she was absolutely disappointed in me. 
She told me that I should *at least* clean my room every weekend. 
She said that I'm the woman and that I should set a good example for him to follow, if its about cleaning.
She then continued and told me that I should clean the room of my boyfriend with him regularly, when I'm staying over.

I tried to defend myself and to make her happy with my answers, because I didn't want her to hate me but I really don't wanna change my cleaning habits let alone clean the room of my boyfriend.
But his mother now expects me to clean with him.
I mean, yeah it's her house, but I don't wanna spend the little time I have with him privately, with cleaning.

So: Am I really that messy for cleaning my room only once a month? 
And does, not wanting to clean every corner of his room, make me a bad woman/ girlfriend?

I (15M) was talking to my (16F) friend  (who I will call J) about our subject selections coming into Year 11. J said that she had taken 3 general subjects, so I asked if she wasn’t going for an Atar. The ATAR is the admission rank, basically to get into universities and things. It’s very important and in order to qualify for it you need to take 4 general subjects at least. She for some reason, got very defensive and kept calling me names. (Stupid fuck, dipshit etc.) It was a little embarrassing, since it’s in a discord server of our friend group, and she was acting unreasonable. Throughout all of this I did not insult her and tried to give her opportunities to calm down. I just was asking if she took 4 general subjects or not. She kept sprouting things that weren’t true about how the ATAR works so I really wanted to see if she was all good to get it since it’s very important. Eventually, she found that she had taken 4 general subjects, didn’t apologize and blocked me.
