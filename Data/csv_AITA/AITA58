She told me she's proud of me that I cook everyday for everyone etc etc.

My parents abused me both mentally and physically for as long as I can remember as a child. I am the eldest of 4 children and I was always treated like shit while the rest (especially my sisters) were treated like royalty. My dad pretty much beat me everyday and my mum also beat me occasionally. They would make sure I knew that I was the child they never liked by spoiling my siblings while I watched. As a child all I ever wanted was to be loved, hugged and do any activity with my parents as I saw cousins and friends got what I cried for every night. Eventually I began to think that there was something wrong with me and maybe I was not worthy of love.

I never asked for anything because I had been conditioned to know that I was not worthy of it. I was a very smart child my teachers would often tell my parents of my creative intellect and how I saw the world differently to most children. My parents never cared and because of that I have failed alot in life because I thought I was not worthy of being proud of so I should just give up.

I tried to hang myself at 11 years old because of the abuse and neglect but only fell unconscious and woke up a while later. This is when I also decided to denounce my faith. My dad kept beating me till I was around 15 but by then the damage was done. I was secretly serverly depressed, had a awful eating disorder and developed a fear of cameras.

At 18 I began dating and tried to fill this hole in my heart with failed relationships which didn't help at all. However it made me realise that I can't expect family and random girls to love me for who I am if I don't love myself.

I began doing things to start loving myself. Eating properly, going to the gym etc. Now I don't care about my parents loving me because I no longer need it.

Everyday I feel as though I'm living a fake life at home because now my parents are both very religious while I am completely against religion.

They have changed as people with age maybe having grandparents pass away has made them realise a few things in life so they now try to show me how much they care and love me. But I know that if they knew the truth about me that I am not Muslim and I want many things in life that are against religion to express myself they wouldn't understand at all. I don't know whether they would disown me or not but I know they wouldn't keep it to themselves and tell other family members because they wouldn't be able to handle something that stressful and probably make themselves the victim thinking they have failed as parents.

She was just getting out of an LTR so she was a little relationship-weary. We never said we were officially in a relationship, but it wasn't nothing either. I even drove her to the airport over the summer when she needed to go somewhere. We were texting everyday she was gone for a while before the communication suddenly dropped off on her end without much explanation. I finally kind of asked her what was up, and she said she wanted to be friends instead. I didn't think she handled the situation that great, but I knew it was a weird time for her, so I didn't hold a grudge. We faded quite a bit.

Then the school year started again (we're both in college and in the same club). So we saw more of each other and she started texting me a lot again and we became friends again. Mia would text me about problems in her life, which I was happy to listen to as a friend. But at the same time, there were flirtatious and late night texts too. It all culminated in her coming over one night. She was cuddling me and we kissed and she spent the night. After that night, Mia acted kind of weird and I said we should talk. She said she thought we should still just be friends. I agreed because I know that's for the best, but I was a little confused.

Anyways, we both have a mutual friend (male, Roger) who we'd both hang out with together as a trio. After Mia spent the night, she seemed to be distancing herself from me except when we hung out with Roger. It seemed like she liked him now. He was a newer friend for both of us, but I had explained to him the history. I told Roger that it seems like she likes you. He said maybe, but he didn't want anything to come between us.

Lo and behold, I found out they're a thing now. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong about it. But I just don't feel that comfortable with it. I've always been there for Mia who was never even officially my gf, and as a result she's lingered in my head longer than she probably should have. And on Roger's end, he was always persistent that we all hang out together, but now I can't help but wonder whether I was just a way for him to get close to her. That's probably not fair to him, but I can't help but wonder. 

When they told be about it, they said they didn't want things to be weird and wanted to still be able to hang out with me. I told them I don't wanna lose them as friends, but that I needed space at least temporarily before I could just get back to that point with them. Idk, AITA for wanting some space?

She then left for a graduate program related to writing. We continued dating long-distance for her first year in the program and talked about me joining her where the school is for the second and third year of the program until that idea needed to become a real plan, at which point she let me know that she's unsure about our future together and didn't want me moving to be with her if that was the case. I was heartbroken but fair enough, we broke up.

Yesterday she texted me asking if I'd read an essay she's considering publishing in a public literary magazine. No problem, I always supported her writing goals 100% and love to read her excellent work. She went on to say well she's asking me because I'm actually a character in the story so it's kind of an ethical hurdle before she can submit it. I figure okay, well I must be a secondary character or briefly mentioned or something. I let her know that I appreciate the consideration, I'll take a peek and let you know if there's anything I'm not comfortable with.

The piece is essentially an extended parallel epitaph of her time in the city we lived in together, as well as our relationship. The eleven page essay starts with a paragraph that includes my real name, my dog's name and very identifiable breed, triangulates where we lived together within a block, and states an admission that the last months we spent together she knew that the breakup was coming without communicating that to me as we continued to tell each other we loved each other and discuss the next years in a new place. Further on in the essay there are entire pages listing dozens of specific experiences we shared, dates we went on, etc, down to word-for-word dialogue with me, with friends, with strangers.

I am extremely uncomfortable with this information being made available in the public domain. It would be published under her real first and last name, and even if my name is changed in the essay anyone who ever reads it who knows either of us personally is in my opinion accessing a window in to a part of my personal life that I never meant to be packaged up for public consumption. Her goal is to become a famous author, and if she achieves that, thousands of fans might google her name and end up reading the explicit details of a very painful time in my life.

The essay itself is beautiful and I know she worked hard on it for many hours and is proud of it. Her priority has always been her professional goals, and she is angry that I would prefer that she not submit something that she thinks is some of her best work to date. I don't want her publishing it unless she removes the romantic aspect entirely, or changes significant details about my character and our experiences together so it's not about my personal life.

I told his family I wouldn’t bring my son hoping they would understand but they were all angry with me for not thinking about what my ex wanted.

My ex’s mother, who I’ve remained close with since we separated, told me I was a selfish woman and a bad wife.

He asks me “what can I do for you?” When I am in the middle of crying and hurting, I tell him I don’t know, because as mentioned, I don’t have the energy to repeat myself over and over again. And his response is “okay” then nothing more.

He just leaves it there, no further questions, no nothing, leaves me all alone, with my dark thoughts. And when I confront him he gets upset and says that he doesn’t know what I want him to do so he does nothing…

For instance, we have designated household duties that are our jobs alone. Such as he takes out the trash, scoops the cat litter, and picks up around the house (I’m the messier one and tend to leave things out and not in the proper place). And I cook dinners, make
Lunches, walk the dogs, feed the animals, do laundry, and grocery shop). 

Now, the reason I have more household chores is because my husband and I had agreed I would take more on because I don’t drive. We carpool to work and when we need to leave the house, obviously he is driving. And I appreciate that he does that and I understand it’s a lot for a person to drive another person around. 

(Side note: I don’t drive because of some accident related PTSD and driving anxiety. I am currently working on that and having driving lessons.)

I started a new job that has a vastly different schedule than my old one. I used to be home much more often and now I have a regular 9-5 type schedule. 

And I’m exhausted. I get home around 6 PM and cook dinner, prepare lunches, walk my dogs, feed our animals, and by the time all of that is finished it’s practically time for bed. 

I talked to my husband and he said he didn’t think it was fair of me to ask him to do more because he goes out of his way to drive me to and from work. To be fair, I understand that. It’s a 20 minute drive to my office and then 14 more minutes for him to get to work. Then at the end of the day it’s 14 minutes for him to pick me up then 20 minutes home.  (I work 8:30 AM - 5:30 PM, he works 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) and I Uber when I need to or if he’s sick or something. 

And I do feel guilty he drives so much but I’m so tired and I’m reaching such a miserable point that I hate going home. And when I asked him again last night to help me he was like “yeah, I guess. But you know I drive all day” and now I just feel awful about even asking.

I have a job that gives me free movie tickets and discounted concessions to a specific theatre chain. To be able to still give a fun present to some young cousins (5m&amp;7m) that I don’t get to see often because I live 2.5 hours away, I asked my aunt if I could take them to a movie and get them whatever concessions they want since they’ll be incredibly cheap with my discount. I started planning with her a couple weeks ahead.
Now it’s several days before the planned movie day and my aunt says she’s not comfortable having my cousins go with me alone saying the 5yo can be quite a handful. I offered to get her a ticket to the movie as well since it would be free but she declined because she doesn’t want to see the movie I was taking them to.
Instead she wants us all to go to a theatre chain I don’t have any discounts or free tickets to so she can see the movie she wants (that doesn’t have any showings at the other chain) while I take my cousins into the kids movie. I really can’t afford that, movies are expensive and so are concessions and the only way I could afford the fuel to get there is if I’m basically spending nothing on tickets and concession. I explained the financial situation to her and the free tickets and discount. My aunt offered to pay for my ticket or snacks but then I’d still be paying for one of those plus my cousins tickets and the fuel back and forth. I said maybe then we should plan something for a later date when we could do something that works for everyone and she won’t talk to me now.

Reasons why maybe I’m not TA: I planned with her well in advance to get used to the idea and I offered to pay for her ticket when she didn’t feel comfortable with me taking the kids by myself. The movie she wants to see is an hour longer than the one I was taking the kids to which would mean I would have to entertain them in the lobby for an hour by myself anyway plus handle them in the theatre by myself. This makes me feel like it’s not about the 5yo being difficult, just about her seeing the movie she wants while having a free babysitter. Also I’m still broke

Reasons I think I might be TA:
When I was younger and my aunt was single and had a lot of disposable income she would often splash out on Christmas gifts for us. I’m not being flexible with plans that work for her. I understand it’s difficult as a parent to find time to yourself to do things you’d like to do. Instead of finding a solution I just became stubborn because I was annoyed and suggested other plans at a later date.

I apologize in advance for the incredibly long post.

My husband and I both were furloughed during quarantine in 2020. After enjoying almost a year of quarantine together, I decided to switch professions and got a job working from home. My partner decided to pursue his passion and enrolled for a 4-year degree program, also remotely. When we found out I was pregnant we were both ecstatic, it seemed like the ideal situation. We could trade off with him taking care of the baby during the day while I worked, and I would take care of her late afternoon, evenings and nights (he's a deep sleeper, and mixed with my plan to breastfeed this made the most sense).
Cut to the beginning of the year when our baby was born, I was given 6 weeks (unpaid) leave from work. Husband was taking classes part time remotely and had no lectures to attend. We managed those 6 weeks as smoothly as anyone could with a newborn. 
Once I returned to work things changed, we had the agreement that he would be the ""stay at home dad"" while I worked, even though we were both technically home. But being handed the baby for every feeding, which turned into me putting her down for naps, while working full time and being up all night was too much. I started to resent watching him play video games all day and leaving the household duties for me when I got off work and was responsible for our baby. At about 3 months we transitioned to formula in hopes that I would be able to soley focus on work during the day.
Cut to now, where my husband is taking 12 units of undergrad and has decided that it's too much to save school for nighttime when he's tired, and during the day it is too difficult focus on school and watch the baby. I am now responsible for nighttime feedings and changes, 80% of watching the baby during the day, full time work and taking care of household duties and nighttime baby duties. I've told him I am burnt out and can't continue this way, our relationship has gone down the drain. He somehow still finds time to play video games, watch YouTube videos and chat on the phone with friends and family while I have no time for basic self care like showering or cooking meals. 
I've told him he either needs to get a job to contribute equally financially or he needs to stick to his half of the originally arrangement and take care of the baby and house for the 8 hours I am at work. His response was to tell me that I don't understand how much he does and I am being emotionally abusive by suggesting that I do more than him. 
We're at an impass where he feels he does more than enough and I feel he's not meeting the basic requirements of a partner.

My (f25) family is huge. Holiday time is when they all gather together and have a huge celebration.

As a result they said they could not afford yo have a decent christmas celebration which is devastating since all of our relatives wanted to come to celebrate both christmas and their health improvements.


Dad came up with the suggestion to borrow money (3 thousand dollars) from my husband. My husband's are well off but my husband is dependent on himself and rarely asks them for help. He has a savings account to start investing in the land his father left him. He's been saving for 3 years now. I brought up my dad's suggestion to my husband and he refused saying he didn't have that kind of money but I pointed out how he has a savings account with over 7 thousand dollars but he said sorry, but he needed it to fix and invest the land to be able to change his job and work less hours because the land wikl be a source of an income once invested in. He said my family don't have to to have a fancy celebration and instead having one that fit their budget. I explained that we're a huge family with many kids and the money will go towards them. He tokd me he wasn't willing to waste his money on such ridiculous ""cause"". I got upset and told him that he'll get his money back but he pointed out basically how my parents are still struggling with medical debts and questioned their ability to return the 3 thousand dollars.

My dad has cancer. I don’t want to go into detail beyond the fact he’s really not well but his prognosis isn’t terrible at the moment.

My parents divorced when I was 6 because my dad had an affair and actually even introduced me to the woman (not that I knew who she was at the time). 

I saw my dad on and off throughout my childhood, couple of times a year. Typical absent dad who never came to my school stuff, didn’t give me xmas presents, couldn’t remember how old I was or what year I was in at school etc. As I grew up I realised he was a narcissist (he did some other really unpleasant things but I don’t want to ream them off here, he was basically emotionally abusive to everyone around him) and in 2018 I went no contact. 

A year ago he contacted me and said he had cancer and wanted to reconcile. My grandma (his mum) died while I was no contact with him (I had to go no contact with her and his side of the family too unfortunately as he was using them to get to me). So I didn’t get to see her before she died and I’m still eaten up by the grief of that. I didn’t want it to happen again so I said yes. 

It’s been weird since because the relationship is really strained and I don’t particularly want to see him but I feel like I have to because of obvious reasons. Then he invited himself to Christmas with me and my fiancé. It’s only me, my fiancé, my mum and my grandparents; we host. I felt super uncomfortable about it but I said yes because this very may well be his last Christmas.

However the more I thought about it the worse I felt. Like it’s my Christmas too, I won’t enjoy him being there, my wider family sure as hell won’t either as my mum hasn’t spoken to him in about 15 years. And I’m just going to be on edge and anxious the whole time waiting for him to be unpleasant.

So I text him to say that I don’t feel comfortable with him coming and could we do something in the run up to xmas instead. He said I’m a terrible daughter because he has cancer and this could be his last year to see me. That I’m especially nasty for saying yes and then no. Don’t I have any sympathy and do I want him to be alone on xmas etc (not that he would be because he has my grandad and uncle). Normally when he gets like that I crumble but this time I put my foot down and said it’s my Christmas too and I don’t want him ruining it and him being sick isn’t an excuse for that. So obviously now I’m the “bitch” and I’m really upset and I feel like I can’t win because either way I’m ruining the day for someone. My fiancé agrees with me because he always sides with me when it comes to my dad, but my grandparents said I should reinvite him because it’s the right thing to do and I’ll regret it if I don’t.

One of the parents replied that she did check the cameras and saw the verbal/emotional abuse and ""said something"" several times until they took the cameras down.

I said that I felt awful for the children who weren't protected and that some people shouldn't be parents. My friends got pissed saying victim blaming is gross and that I'm seriously messed up.

My (20f) younger brother (18) was very troubled. He was mean,, destructive, drank, smoked weed, etc. My parents did their best to give him the best life, sent him to institutions when he threatened to hurt himself, etc. He was just a troubled kid who I guess brain weren't wired right. My parents are thousands of dollars in debt for his medical bills, rehabs, car wreck. They've ruined themselves to take care of him.

I met my boyfriend (23m) when I was 17. When I turned 18, his father got a better job and got him one too, which meant they were moving. I moved with him, part of it to get away from my brother and my parents. It's been tough. My boyfriend makes 3x what I do, spends his money like crazy, but demands we pay the bills 50/50 because it's ""fair"" and criticizes if I ever spend money on anything other than bills or groceries.

My brother passed away Tuesday from a drug overdose. My mom was the one who found him. Things are just...not good. They want me home. I spoke to my boss, was given 3 days off, started looking at plane tickets for both me and my boyfriend and started trying to make plans for me to go home and he to accompany me to my brother's funeral.

This I guess pissed off my boyfriend. He said I wasn't entitled to his money, nor was my ""worthless drug addict"" of a brother. He made it well known he thought my brother deserved to die, was trash, and he wasn't paying to go to his funeral and told me ""If you go, I'll f&amp;cking hate you for the rest of your life."" I started arguing with him - this is my brother, I need to say my final goodbye. I know my boyfriend doesn't care for drug addicts, but it's not like I expected to lose my brother. My boyfriend said he was ""forbidding"" me to go and he threatened to break my cell phone to keep me from talking to my parents/going.

He left for work, and I reached out to a friend of mine (more so a coworker of my boyfriends) and asked her for advice. She said my boyfriend is right and I need to ""respect"" his feelings and said she felt the same way - I shouldn't go to my brother's funeral because of the way he died. I feel like this is so wrong and I told her I wanted to go, and was going to figure out any way I can to go - ask my boss for my next paycheck or go donate plasma and she said that I was being ""short sighted"" and ""really dumb""

We moved house around 3 months ago due to job prospects and we now live around a 25 minute drive away from my mom [f60s]. Due to previous distance my mom and my wife haven't spent a whole lot of time together.

My mom became physically disabled in recent years, and is a full-time wheelchair user with multiple chronic conditions. She's able to manage her own needs but is unable to have a job and lives on welfare.

Ever since we moved, my wife had an expectation that my mom would have the kids over at her home a lot because ""that's what grandparents are supposed to do"". 

I immediately tried to shut this expectation down, as I know my mom wouldn't be able to cope with babysitting two energetic 7 year olds, as much as she loves her grandchildren. My wife seemed to understand but then went against what I told her.

A few days ago, my mom called me in tears and asked if she's a bad grandma. 

I asked what she meant and she sent me screenshots of my wife pestering her over and over to take the kids for the weekend. 

There was a Christmas party that weekend me and my wife were interested in but we haven't been able to secure a babysitter unfortunately, but stuff like that happens when you have children.

The texts basically went like this (not exact quotes, otherwise this post will be too long):

Wife: please please please take the kids for the weekend, OP and I want to go to a Christmas party

Mom: I would love to, but I don't think with my health status I can really cope with babysitting the kids and taking care of myself

Wife: please, you're our village.

Mom: I can't

Wife: please? You're their grandma, getting you to babysit is like pulling teeth and it shouldn't be, the kids want to see you

Mom: I can't, you're more than welcome to bring them over for a visit but I can't babysit

Wife: you're a piece of work. you buying us clothes and toys for the kids isn't helpful, what would actually be helpful is you actually helping and babysitting. You're a bad grandma and a bad mother-in-law.

I talked to my wife about the texts and she believes that she's completely in the right. She called my mom lazy and a ""evil MIL"".

The ground floor bathroom is *my* personal restroom and where I get ready in the morning and I really don’t want to share it with anyone. The basement bathroom is no longer very private since the contractors are working in the basement but it’s our only freaking shower. 

So the contractors are asking if they can use a bathroom…..and….these are fine people but, ew, I don’t want to smell a strangers pee (or worse) while I’m showering. 

Background: 
I’m getting work done on my house because a water leak damaged 2 of 4 bathrooms, my gym, basement office, and basement bar area. My house was built in the 40’s therefore, it has a limited number of bathrooms and showers. 

Yes, ideally I shower before they are here or after they leave…. But sometimes my schedule simply doesn’t permit this sort of flexibility. I need to remain productive. 

This is possibly going to be a long process of repair and renovations and so I’d like to keep things cordial between us. I’m also working from home for several days and so I’ll overlap with them quite a bit. 

So… FINE….I told them they could use the basement bathroom but I’m really annoyed. I’ve never had a contractor or service person request to use my toilet before (though I’ve often wondered how they manage to avoid it) and while I normally wouldn’t mind, these people *know* that half my bathrooms are out of commission!

When my sister was getting married, I was already disappointed and irritated because even though I'm her sister she didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid. She said it wasn't practical because I live out of state, they had decided on a small wedding party (a maid of honor and 1 bridesmaid for her and a best man and 1 groomsman for him) and she was making the bridesmaid's dresses, but I think that was bullshit and she just didn't want to include me.

Next few things that happened were when they were planning at the beginning of the year and I found out they were going with a medieval theme I really wanted to wear a flower crown that I could order from a florist I know but sister wouldn't let me because that was the head piece she was wearing. I think she was afraid that hers wouldn't look as nice because they got married on the cheap; she literally foraged the flowers a day before and made the crown and bouquets. She offered to have her stylist that dose hair braiding to do something for me but it was clear she just didn't want to include me as she hadn't involved me in the wedding in any way.

I had a tentative date for the wedding but when I got my invite it was the week after the one I had been previously been told because of a conflict date with venue, or at least that's what she said, but the problem was it was the same day as an event I had and had already paid to be in. I had a compromise in mind, if she could move the ceremony back an hour I would have enough time to do my event that I had already paid for and be able to fly in for the wedding. She wouldn't and said I could come to the wedding or not. I did go the wedding but was out $200. The day itself seemed fine and afterward I took a bottle of the mead they had served at the reception to take home but I couldn't take it on the plane and had to leave it. I knew sister was mad about this, told me that in her spiritual practices (paganism) that the mead that was left was to stay with the couple that they would drink together over a certain time period, apparently that's where the term 'honeymoon' comes from but it all seems hokey to me and just another excuse. Apparently she is still mad at me for what I asked for at the wedding but I was the one out $200 and wasn't even included in the bridesmaids, so am I the asshole?

TLDR: Sister didn't include me in her wedding and is mad about requests I made so I could attend.

Well basically it is tougher for me as i had different subjects in school because my mom forced me into taking other subjects that i didnt wanted to.
Well i wanted to do a mba in finance but inr 30 - 40 lakh is a lot and i didnt wanted my parents to take a loan for me . So i chose something that isnt that expensive but need a lot of time to study .
I try to take classes regularly but sometimes it is tough to complete them as they are really exhausting but i am still trying . I havent gone out of house for like 3 months to hang out with my friends or whatever .She points it out infront of everyone that i dont go anywhere and i am   in the house always but when i do go outside even for like 4 hrs or less she complains that i dont want to study . When i was a kid she used to say that i shouldnt care about clothes, hair or how i was looking and i did what she said cause i wanted to please her . But now she always complains why i dont put work into my looks or my hair or everything .
She always cared for my grades and never how i was , when i told her that i was having trouble in school because no one was talking to me all she said was "" you are only doing this cause you dont want to study"" i was 9 then .
She was never affectionate towards me or my brother when we are kids all she cared about was our grades but now she asks why am i distant from her or why i am sad . 
I dont usually say to her much and only listens to her but i snapped at her some days ago when she said to me that i am being ungrateful to her and my father even when they only want ME to have a good life and even after being a girl they are putting efforts on me ( i am indian so not many people put efforts on their daughters i mean its not like total village but the exams i am preparing for takes a lot of time which is not usual for middle class people here as they marry off their daughter at the age of 24 or 25).
I told.her how i am struggling beacause she wanted me to take the subjects which she taught were good for me . She treated me horribly when i was a kid and i cant give her the love that she want now as its too late for me to forget anything . She havent talked much about it from that day but ya she was crying that day and i have this guilt that i made her sad .

The reason is irrelevant to the post, we simply need to go. We don’t live near there so we have to book a flight which as you know costs plenty.

I tried to turn the flight into a family trip next year so we could have fun and build memories at the same time but all of my family has spent pretty a lot of money this year (wedding, renovations, moving, etc) so unfortunately it’s not possible. My brother offered that we make it a siblings trip (we have two more siblings) but this isn’t very possible either. I ended up telling him that I’d go on my own and he accepted but then later after he left, both my parents asked me why we don’t go together just the two of us.

Here lies the problem. My brother and I aren’t close, never really were. We have a 14 years gap between us and we’re just in very different stages in our lives. He’s married + three and I’m still trying to figure myself out. I have nothing really to talk with him about other than dry stuff like how have you been, how are the kids, how’s work, what my plans are and such as. I wouldn’t feel comfortable if we do go just the two of us. He didn’t offer to join or even ask me if I wanted us to go together in the first place and again, he was the one who offered the siblings trip so that just makes me feel like he wouldn’t be comfortable either.

I also have a social anxiety (not using as an excuse, just think it explains my feelings even better) and my brother has no clue about it. He knows something is off but I don’t think he knows to this extent unless my parents told him.

And yes, it could be he didn’t offer because I give off a vibe that doesn’t want it and he catches it but idk I don’t think that’s the case and even if it is, I don’t really want to correct him.

She's been skipping school, lying that she goes to her language classes, lying about going to her swimming practice, lying about going to her piano practice. I don't know where she's going and grounding doesn't help.  


I tried talking to her but her only solution is that she wants to quit all after school activities because she doesn't like them. That's not an option. She needs to keep her grades up to go to a good college, she needs to be on the swim team and she needs to practice her languages (she's doing French and Mandarin after school and her school requires her to do Latin and Spanish) and at least one instrument. They're not frivolous activities, they're to set her up for life and she needs to continue with them. One sport, one instrument and two languages is an appropriate amount for a 16 year old. She has already quit ballet, I think dropping one activity is more than enough to free up some of her time.

The nuclear option would be to drive her to all her activities and sit with her to make sure she attends them but I wanted to give her a chance and instead installed a tracking device on her car to find out where she's going and to make sure she's not getting into trouble and doing inappropriate stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching her movement and found that she skipped her French class and went to her friend's house. I was really angry, I drove to her friends' house to pick her up. The parents let me in and it turns out my daughter was fast asleep in her friend's room (her friend was doing homework). She claims, she's too tired with all her activities. I was enraged, she didn't come to me to talk but was deceptive and made me look like a bad parent in front of her friend's parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took away her phone, laptop, car keys, and all her privileges. She's only allowed devices in common areas now to make sure she's doing her homework. She seems to be fine with her privileges being taken away, she didn't fight but she's really angry at me for ""spying on her"" and has called my grandmother to cry about this. Of course, now the whole family of my ex is against me, calling me, trying to tell me how to raise my daughter. My daughter literally called me an asshole in my face because she's faced all the consequences she can so she had nothing to lose.

And while I don't care about my ex's family's opinion, I was surprised to find out that my own sister shares their opinion.

She suddenly really needed to go, so I put on her harness and we hurried down in the elevator. She hit the building lobby and ran as fast as her tiny legs could out to the front of our building on Columbus, a busy main artery through New York's upper west side. She ran toward the curb and suddenly squatted about half way across the sidewalk, which is about 20 feet wide at that point. Not an ideal spot, but this was around 10:45 on a Thursday morning so there were almost no people around. She's a small dog, so she deposited something the size of three jellybeans which I scooped up in a bag. I was just tying off the bag and breathing a sigh of relief, when a man walked by while jabbing with his finger toward a parked white van, scowling, and shouting, ""THAT'S THE CURB! THAT'S THE CURB!"" at me. He left me standing there, shocked, and just kept on walking with a look on his face that I can only describe as smug.

Whoever he was, I think was entitled to his frustrations. He didn't stop to explain, so I can only speculate as to what may have really been going on in his world. Had he had a string of bad experiences with dog owners? Did he think he was performing a great public service? Regardless of the motivation, his action hurt me. Deeply. Now, not to presume to know what another person is thinking, but just to describe how the event felt on my end: I'm a five-foot tall woman with a 10 pound lapdog. I felt like I was on the receiving end of bullying from a person who saw a safe opportunity to vent his frustrations at someone who looked non-threatening. Would he have done the same if I had been a big man walking a big dog? I have no idea. Maybe it doesn't even matter.

Ultimately, I feel bad that I couldn't get my dog closer to the edge of the sidewalk this morning, but I don't think it did anyone any harm and wasn't deserving of an act of unkindness from a passing stranger. We didn't hurt him. The sidewalk wasn't soiled. We weren't even in his way. And yet, even as I type those words, I sit here filled with doubt and wondering if I am, in fact, the villain of the piece.

It would happen every couple of months and I got tired of it. I'm aware of laws that in most places you can't have your mailbox cemented or damaging to cars. If a car goes out of control and crashes into your mailbox and causes damage to the car/person because it didn't fall over then you are liable. So I had a buddy of mine reinforce the mailbox just enough that if a car were heading toward it, it would fall. But if someone were driving by and swinging a bat it would resist. Again, not trying to hurt anyone here I just didn't want it broken anymore.

I just said that I have a mailbox within regulation and that their son decided to do what he did. They tried to take me to court over it but as my mailbox is legal they basically turned their 18 year old son in for a crime.

So, my cousin in law drugged her newborn baby because the baby was cranky. Yep, you read that right. 

I (30f) is currently helping my cousin S (34m) and his wife D (33f) with their life because D had to go for an emergency C-section at 30 weeks pregnancy. Baby was in NICU for a month and just came home 2 weeks ago. Due to the earlier due date, S couldn't get paternity leave, both S and D moms also failed to come due to the unexpected circumstances. So I volunteer since I live quite near and I'm not busy with my life.

I noticed D was having PPD symptoms so I told S to get D to the doctor for treatment, which luckily has helped D a lot. D is not allowed to breastfeed due to her meds which is fine because baby can accept formula milk. However, I noticed that baby was sleeping abnormally long, so I asked D if she wants me to take baby to the doctor, D said no and that the baby is fine. But baby was sleeping the whole day and not drinking milk on time which is weird for a newborn. So I pushed and pushed and D finally relented and I took the baby to the clinic to get checked and lo and behold baby is drugged. Shocked wasn't enough to describe my feeling. I had to called S coz it became a police case. S and D had argument, baby in NICU and D blamed me for stepping into something that doesn't concern me. Screams and ugly words were thrown at me which make me snapped.

I yelled at her ""a sane mother wouldn't drug her baby just because the baby was noisy, a loving mother wouldn't harm her baby just because she needs a good rest"" I told her that I was there to help, but she was insistent to keep the baby with her at all time to ""bond"" even tho she herself is incapable to take care of herself.

D was crying and had a panic attack and S asked me to leave.

My dad had an affair after 20+ years of being together w my mom. Half-bro’s mom works day in day out and never has time for him. Ever since he was born, my dad would bring him over to my house where I lived with my mom, sisters and paternal grandmother. Though the situation was difficult to deal with and all of us being heartbroken, we cared for this child because it wasn’t his fault. We practically raised him, and my mom loved him as if he was her own, despite the emotional pain attached.
When he started speaking, he called my mom “mommy”. 

When he wasn’t with us, his mother would make her other children (all teens) miss school to watch him. He never wanted to be at his own house because they didn’t give him the care and attention we would. He’d cry every single time he had to go back home. Once as I was walking him to his brother’s car, he bolted down the sidewalk about 7 houses down so he wouldn’t have to go.

Time passes by and he is now 4, turning 5 on new year’s day. We haven’t been seeing him often and come to find out, it’s because that b*tch was so upset that her little boy was calling my mom “mommy #1” and she was being titled as “mommy #2”. 
One day he comes over and as soon as he sees my mom, he’s bursts into tears saying he’s sorry because “my other mommy said I only have 1 mom”. This happens every time now. It hurts him, it hurts my mom, it hurts me. 
I used to tolerate her because I love my little bro, but now I just don’t like her at all. My dad doesn’t even like that b*tch anymore.

I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what this means.. my only guess is that it stands for ""Girlfriend Commitment""... So in my mind, I'm thinking this has something to do with a proposal. I mean it just makes sense after everything we have been talking about for the past year.

Well.. turns out GFC is a f$@king camper... he spent 7K on a camper for his truck... not a ring. He has been hyping up this ""surprise"" for weeks now and turns out he just wants to go on more couple trips around the country. 

I'm livid at this point and honestly sad that I got my hopes up for a proposal. So when he went to play golf with his buddies yesterday, I went out to the camper and keyed down the side of it.

She previously lived in it, but moved out and found renters before we met. This house was ""gifted"" to her by her mother, but my wife never actually wanted it. We currently don't live in the same state that the house is in.

My MIL is so set on ""giving her kids"" houses. My wife's house is one that they all used to live in when she was younger. One of her sibling's (sib 1) houses is the house my MIL currently lives in. And the other sibling's (sib 2) house is a house the MIL picked out for him in the same neighborhood as the other houses. Sib 1 &amp; sib 2 both don't live in ""their"" houses, nor do they want them.

My wife's house currently has renters, we have no plans on moving back to that area/in that house, the renters pay my MIL, but sib 1 pays the mortgage... MIL does not pay sib 1 back, she just pockets the money from the renters. Sib 2's, house is in his name, was not picked out by him, used his FHA loan for it, and has renters. MIL wanted to get this house ""for him"" because at the time it was a ""good deal"". My wife put a good chunk towards the down payment of sib 2's house &amp; helped pay off sib 1's house.

MIL loves to hold the house over my wife's head as if she is doing my wife a favor by ""giving"" her a house that my wife doesn't even want. They get into arguments about it and for probably the 10th time, I have heard my wife tell my MIL that she doesn't want the house, to put it in my MIL's name &amp; take it. MIL refuses to do this &amp; hold the house above my wife in the next argument. Unsure why sib 1 agrees to paying it, but that's between sib 1 and MIL (but wife and I still don't like that).

The current renters have expressed that they plan on moving some time in 2023. I thought it would be an opportunity to sell the house once they moved out, if MIL still decides not to take it under her name and find renters for it. When I brought this up to my wife and that MIL is clearly taking advantage of sib 1, I was met with frustration because selling the house would ""make my wife look bad"" in her family's eyes &amp; it would make her look ""ungrateful"" by selling the house her mother gave her. We also discussed that having renters while we live out of state might not be a great idea to continue to do.

I feel like MIL is taking advantage while constantly using the house against my wife to make her feel bad/guilty. If the house is my wife's, she has the right to sell it if MIL doesn't want to put it in her name in order to ""keep the house in the family"".

He is the breadwinner in our relationship - by a LOT. 

I have never in my life cared about luxurious items or the dollar amount that someone spends on me, which is why I’m confused about whether or not I’m just being snotty here. But my boyfriend has told me a few times throughout our relationship that he plans to buy me jewelry. Like, he has brought it up completely on his own multiple times. For my birthday he offered to get me diamond studs, but he never did and he instead got me a couple “useful” items and paid for a very expensive dinner. I didn’t care that much, but he said a couple months ago that he wanted to get me some studs next time we were near the jewelry store he goes to. He never followed through. And most recently, we picked out a ring together that was about $300 in price and it was going to be my Christmas gift. I showed a lot of excitement and gratitude in the process because he took my ring size and everything and I honestly thought he was buying it then and there. 

The other day, as I was leaving his house from staying that weekend, he told me that he wanted to wait a couple more months on the ring so he could save some cash and because it’d be our official one year mark. I’ve just felt really upset with him since then. I’ve been bottling it in hopes it’d subside, but it isn’t. 

He has disclosed to me before that in his previous relationship (which did not last as long as ours) she wanted jewelry all of the time and he emptied his savings account at one point just for his ex partner. He said it changed his mind on buying luxurious things and he is more cautious for his own reasons. He’s always said he likes how our relationship is more mature and feels like we’re really just two people in love who aren’t funding one another. I do appreciate that. But man I just feel slighted and hurt right now that I was apparently deemed unworthy of a nice gift. 

He doesn’t really get me anything but I buy him gifts periodically just because. I do a lot for us so we can just have a good time together when we’re off work. Overall he does pay for most stuff when we go out, but we split things pretty proportionately at times too. I try really hard to not empty his savings or overspend on superfluous stuff, but I just wanted a nice ring from my partner.

I've been also attending my own therapy for 9 years now for multiple reasons. I've been learning that many of those issues started during childhood (what a surprise) and the authority of my grandmother (F69) and submission of my mom (F49) been a great deal on all of that.
Recently the controlling and fights started again. But I don't live with them anymore. I got married two years ago. My mom started dating again two months ago. As always, my nanny always loves the guy at first, and then the controlling starts to the point she will scream and shout. ""He's just too lazy cuz he wakes up at 1pm"" (he works night shifts mon-sat), ""he's too attached"" (because hes been sleeping at my mom almost daily). At the end my mom is always to blame, never allowed to make her own decisions and to learn from her mistakes because my nanny intervenes.
Btw, this wasn't just with my mom. My uncle was the same. I always said that the only reason his daughter is here today is because he moved out of my nanny's house when my nanny started constantly screaming at my aunt (who's an angel). With me was also the same.
We all know my nanny is definitely TA.
But again, my mom calls me saying ""you're like my therapist, I know I can count on you"". And tells me about everything that has happened. I listen. Advice. Take her side, as always. But yesterday something changed. I finally opened my heart and told her how much I've been hurting. Now I am indeed a therapist, but I've been the one to help everyone in the family, but when I speak up about my issues with nanny, I'm the crazy one. I'm too impulsive. Yesterday my mom was on my side. Cried and apologized for never realizing this. Today she sends me a text saying the talked to nanny about HER issues and that everything is ok and that I should just ""move on'"" and ""not be mad at nanny"", even though yesterday I told her multiple times that what I feel has nothing to do with them.
Today when she said that, and tried to call me, I declined. I just said ""good for you, but next time, remember that I'm your daughter, not your therapist. I'm the only one paying over $100 a week for my therapy, for over 9 years, trying to take care of y'all's shit"".
Now I feel bad, but also feel like in the right here. I really want to talk to her, because she's been a good mom for the most part and I know this nanny situation hurts her too. But I feel like if I break and forgive, I'll be the one having to swallow my feelings once again for the peace of the family.
I'm just tired. My therapy was yesterday before my mom's conversation and I have a week until talking to my therapist again.

Some examples of things he has done are destroying valued items such as my father's ashes that were in a pretty silver vase which he destroyed with a bat. He has been not coming out of his room and is being disrespectful to my wife who is trying to be nice and supporting. He is acting a little extreme when we ask him to do simple tasks like chores (etc.).

He has recently stopped going to school, but I was not informed as to the reason why. A week ago, the police showed up at our door and told us that our son had a conflict with a challenged kid because the kid ""was being rude"" to my son (found out later that the kid wouldn't give my son homework answers). My son was trying to act ""cool"" in front of his classmates at school.

Me and my wife had a discussion and my wife mentioned that my son just broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years. After the fact, I realized that my son was probably sad over his girlfriend's death but it's now too late. We decided that my son was getting dangerous, and we would supply him with therapy, but he would have to leave the house and work a job to earn his living.

The police took him in, and he got a 5-day sentence, but we bailed him out as we think he is too young for jail. He is now living in an apartment 10 minutes away.

We are wondering if we are being too harsh on my son and if we should bring him back to the house, so, Am I The Asshole",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4843904,public,top,self,AITA for kicking out my son?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9t9tj/aita_for_kicking_out_my_son/,all_ads,6,,,,

I only had a t shirt and a big jacket so in my head I was thinking once we get to the mall if it still bothers her I'll give her my jacket and stay in t-shirt 

She stopped to take out her sweat(still had a vest) to wrap it on her belly so it could cover her ass up she then said in a very annoying / screaming ish manner ""pff I have to do everything here and calling me useless in our language"" then started to walk very fast leaving me behind.

At the grocery store she realizes I'm hurt and annoyed and we both express what we feel :

She tells me, she is very embarrassed, that I could have put my hand on her ass to cover it up and that if she had her periods I would have done nothing  and that basically I was in the wrong

I replied that, I asked her if she wanted a picture so we could see if she wanted to change her outfit, that she didn't have her periods (if she did I would have said  to come back home obviously) and that I couldn't know what she wanted if she didn't tell me (put my hand on her ass to cover it, and to be fair I don't really feel comfortable walking with my hand on her ass the entire time)

We both stood our ground, to me she was wrong for screaming at me, calling me useless and leaving me behind
 
I decided and told her that I'm going back home, she followed me. We come home and I try to explain myself again, she tells me again  that I don't understand her and that I did nothing to help her

I answered that I did try to help her but just not in the way she wanted and that I couldn't guess what she wanted if she didn't explicitly tell me. 

She then told me I need to apologize because I was clumsy

I answered  that she was dumb to create such a situation out of this and that there is no way I'll apologize because I didn't do anything wrong, she then slapped me really hard and I instantly told her to go home and that it was over. She said sorry and then told me that we were both in the wrong, I just told her to get out, she wouldn't so I took her by the shoulders and pushed her on the way to the door (in a gentle manner ,just steering her to my door), she screamed at me to not touch her and she left.

I went up to him and told him I'm sorry that chair was specifically brought here because I'm sick and can't use a regular one. He snorted and reluctantly got up and I learned from other classmates that he uses it when I'm not there for another course I'm not taking. I didn't care as long as I could use it when I needed it.

Yesterday though, I came in and found him sitting there once again. I go up to him and say excuse me. He looks at me and says what. I tell him I'm sorry that's my chair. He then says ""says who, what's your justification of this chair belonging to you"". I explained to him that it was approved by admin but he said you simply took it from the meeting room, it's public property and not your chair. He also said you don't look sick anyway and I also hate those regular chairs.

I told him if he hated them, he should go get one and he told me no you go get one that's none of my business. I was so mad at his attitude and decided to complain to the TA. The TA asked him what's going on and he repeated to him what he said to me. So the TA turned to look at me and told me don't mind him just get a new chair, class will be starting soon.

I then went out but didn't go to get another one, but told security someone was occupying my chair and wouldn't budge. So he came in with me and told him son, I'm gonna need you to get up from that chair. Classmate told him I'm not going anywhere and you can try to force me and see what happens. That's when TA comes up to us and tells security I already told her to get another one but and the problem would be solved but she wouldn't listen. Security then stared at him for a while, turned and stared at calssmate for a while, shook his head and told me wait here. He went and grabbed me a chair. 

TA told me I specifically asked YOU to get another chair. I retorted and told him but that's my chair and he said I know that's your chair. I told you to get another one and then you could have taken it to admin about what happened and not delayed class. He then went on a long tirade about how a smart engineer should know how to solve problems peacefully....etc etc

We are moving into a house together soon, we both love one another deeply. There have been some issues with trust in past - specifically with him having female “friendships” in which the woman is clearly into him and he doesn’t acknowledge it or see it, and later admits it to me - in some cases they have directly said things like “I wish you didn’t have a girlfriend.” (That particular one he kept from me…but I digress). We have done a lot of work to repair this mistrust, though I can’t help but be worried about this recent thing: his high school love texted him recently asking to get coffee, and he immediately said yes. 

Him having a simple coffee to catch up is not what bothers me; in fact I have thought of doing the same thing with one of my exes, although when I did I asked my partner beforehand if he felt comfortable with that and he said yes. We never ended up meeting, although for me it was more of a closure thing, not an excuse to spark up a friendship/have continued communication. 

Current boyfriend informed me of his ex’s texts after he’d already agreed to go. Full disclosure: I initially freaked out. I felt insecure and told him it would make me comfortable and honestly I feel badly for how I reacted. I followed up telling him I trust him and it’s not a big deal at all and I want to go forward with trust. We had a good chat and things were fine at that point. 

The next day, I asked him what he was hoping to get from this, if he just wanted to see where’s she’s at, etc.? He then proceeds to tell me that he’s a sentimental person and wants to have her in our future, maybe even her and I could become friends and she could be in our lives in the long term. This completely changed my feelings about it just being a casual “how are you doing” visit. I do NOT want to invite exes back into our lives for any reason so it concerns me that he already appears excited to reignite a friendship with her. They have not spoken in almost 10 years prior to this so it’s not as if they have some on going friendship - that would be totally different. They also didn’t fall out of love per se, life just took them in different directions and so they broke up. 

I directly asked him to please not go as I now view the situation differently and he views it as me just being insecure.

My gram was super excited and wanted everyone to dress extra nice. She went to the trouble of booking a fancy venue to make the event even more specialShe and I are very close so I was excited. 

But the issue was that she got me a dress without even asking if I liked it. She told me to wear it to the dinner. My gram knows that I don't like wearing dresses. Even worse, the dress is super girly. Most of my friends are guys and I'm in my element when I'm wearing camo n boots with them in the woods. I wouldn't even wear a bra if the guys would stop staring. My mom and gram aren't fans but that's just my style. 

My younger sister, who's admittedly got issues, was allowed to attend the party wearing whatever she wanted. But ofc I was expected to wear this dress. And I was gonna have to wear an uncomfortable strapless bra because ofc the dresses straps were thin. I told my gram how I felt but she ended up begging me to wear the dress for her just for this special event. I agreed in the moment.

But on Thanksgiving day I just couldn't do it. The outfit was so uncomfortable!! And it felt like I was just not being myself. I decided instead to wear leggings and my bf's big camo shirt. I wanted to show everyone my style. And besides my sister got to dress comfortably so why not me too.

Well at the party a lot of people gave me funny looks. The people standing outside the church weren't even gonna let me inside at 1st if you can believe it. My gram was also not as social as normal. And for some reason I was left out of the family photo. After the party my gram texted me saying how dissapointed she was in me. She just wanted to have a nice dinner and apparently I ruined that. She said that I'm really immature to not be able to meet simple requirements like hers. But I feel like everyone was rude to me.

I was out doing my groceries and when I came home there was someone parked in my driveway.  It's really not that big a deal to me. So I parked behind them and brought my stuff into the house.  I watched a hockey game.  Then a friend invited me over.  

And I completely spaced. I went to my garage that faces my alley not the driveway in front of my mouse.  And I took off on my motorcycle.  The next day I got home around noon.  When I checked my mail I saw notes in my mailbox and on my car.  I had trapped some poor guy in my driveway.  I honestly felt bad about it.  I moved my car onto the street.  

Until my neighbor came over to yell at me for trapping her daughter's boyfriend on my driveway.  I apologized and mentioned that I had been home for nearly four hours before I left and they could have asked me to move at any time and I would have.  

She said she saw me come home but didn't want to bother me until it was time for him to leave.  And when they came around ten at night I wasn't home. And they don't have my number.  

I apologized again but now I feel kind of stupid because they were parked on my property. And they chose to wait nearly four hours.  What if I was home but asleep.  I think that it was kind of a dick move to trap the car. But it was an accident. 

I think that they are jerks for not asking to get the car out as soon as I came home.

Lillian has wanted to be a doctor since she was in 5th grade. She used to slack off hard in school, get detentions regularly, and do poorly academically until we told her that if she wanted to be a doctor, she'd have to learn professional behavior and get good grades. I honestly think that is what turned her around.

She got into a top public university and was premed when she initially started college at 17.

However, she suffered from mental health problems in college, even withdrew for a semester or two, and did not do so well in organic chemistry.

Ultimately, Lily graduated a semester later than intended with a degree in economics, cum laude.

She got a great internship AND job right after. I felt that was life telling her she was meant to be a businesswoman, not a doctor.

My wife ""Bianca"" is an accountant, but her mom ""Danielle"" was an anesthesiologist and it was stressful as hell. Dani never had time for her kids and was always stressed about work. Similarly, my brother in law ""Tom"" did medical school abroad because he did not grow up in the US.

Tom's a smart dude, but had to pass board exams and failed a few times. Tom and his wife ""Kelly"" lived in a VHCOL city with 2 kids, and they were surviving on his wife's income. Kelly would call my wife sobbing because they were so stressed about being new parents on so little money and because she didn't know if Tom would ever pass.

I reminded Lillian that medicine wasn't for the faint of heart. I told her that the most intelligent and resilient relatives in our family were cracking under pressure; so how could she withstand it when she cracked in college?

However, today, despite our warnings, Lillian called us and showed us this ""presentation"" about how she was trying to apply to medical school in 2029.

We were aghast. For one, she already earns great money, so why pivot? It makes no sense to attend medical school financially.

Moreover, we are worried that Lillian will not survive medical school - that she will be left with 6 figures of debt with no medical degree or not match into residency. Her science grades are not the strongest. She earned a B- in Orgo 1 in undergrad and some B+'s in math and statistics.

We are getting old and are both close to 60 at this point. We want to know that we can retire in peace and that she's on her way to a better place instead of taking on risky ventures like med school.

My SIL AND BIL"" Zach"" and ""Olivia"" have 2 kids, one of which also took risk by founding startups. It was stressful for Zach and Olivia, who had to pay Nadine's expensive NY rent and worry about Nadine ever getting a real job.

Well a couple weeks later he comes to me saying he has my mothers address. This really upset me. Part of me is grateful for him making an effort to find her for me and the other part of me is completely mortified.

(P is mom's sister).

Kind people of reddit, please help me decide whether my decision to go LC with Pis right or wrong &amp; if it's worth the argument with my parents.

Background: I was quite fond of P as a kid but later realised that she was rude &amp; entitled. All my cousins (6 people, above 20 years)feel the same about her. For context: P moved overseas many years ago so we only see her once a year.

Now as to why I dislike P:
When P visits, she always stays for about 2-3 months &amp; is incredibly rude to everyone. She has made comments about where we live, saying that rich people don’t live there.
Every time P visits, she tells my mom to run multiple errands for her because she just wantsto enjoy her vacation &amp; can’t be bothered to waste time on her own errands. She has also on multiple occasions ""borrowed"" a lot of money from my mom &amp; never paid itback.Mom puts up with her because she's ""family"" &amp; basically runs around catering to P’s every need.
P is also a huge attention seeker who starts crying at everyfamily event &amp; makes everyone uncomfortable.

All this made me dislike her but the tipping point came when I was 16. I had always been an extremely thin child &amp;had put on some weight.For context, I wasn't overweight by any means, just a little chubby(I weighed less than 120 lbs). P saw a picture of me &amp;sent me a LONG text saying that I looked extremely ugly &amp; it was not good to put on so much weight. I just responded with an ""ok"" but was really hurt &amp;started ignoring a lot of her texts. P continued making negative comments about my weight &amp; looks every time she visited which negatively affected my mental health as I already struggled with self confidence. After speaking to my cousins we realised that none of us like her &amp; have been treated badly by her in different ways. By then, we had all started avoiding her texts (most of which were random videos or unsolicited&amp; rude advice).P quickly realised that she was being ignored&amp; made a huge deal about it. She called all of our parents &amp; started crying saying that we were being rude. So we were forced to have some contact with her.
But now I’ve almost completely cut her out of my life, as have all my cousins. Recently, P announced that she will be visiting for 2months. P never brings her own clothes (carries 2-3 pairs of clothes for 2 months saying her bag is heavy) so she borrows mine without asking. I'm happy to share my clothes with people who have the courtesy to ask beforehand &amp;not just raid my cupboard &amp; take what they please.

My parents noticed that I wasn't too happy about it and the topic came up again &amp;we fought. They say I shouldn’t be rude as she’s family. To be clear, I am civil to her when she visits but I refuse to spend an extended amount of time with her or keep in touch constantly. Once I move out, I plan to go NC with her.

We plan on getting married next year (horah horay 🎂). We had a rough start into out relationship, but around the 4 year mark, we went to individual therapy and are now thriving (childhood traumas being sorted out and all that).

So the issue comes from my side. My parents tend to do a back and forth cringy argument thing for almost EVERY LITTLE ISSUE. Think Honeymooners but without the abuse. Whether they're parking too close, pointing out obvious issues, etc. Yknow, old people complaints. While I've found them cringy myself, they're very generous and kind hearted people who I love very much.

Over this past Thankgiving, they treated me and my fiance to a small overnighter into the country side. It was wonderful. But, in the car, my parents started up again. I could see the discomfort from my fiance, and asked if he was good. He didn't say much and nodded. Once back at the hotel, he told me how uncomfortable their arguments made him. I said that they're small old people arguments and to not pay it much mind. He insisted it was an issue and I snapped back to defend my parents. I said that his parents weren't exactly perfect either and that his mom can be very critical and pushy towards me, but I accepted it because it wasn't her whole personality. 

He seemed to accept this. But I felt bad after. I was trying to keep peace, but was I too soon to brush off his concern?

All the time. He's not great at it. Sometimes he's ok when he's playing guitar and focusing on the singing but most of the time he just belts with the actual song on the background and it's way off pitch. Especially in the shower. It drives me insane. 

My hesitation in asking him to stop singing so much comes from a couple of reasons. 

1. He's been singing like this for 2 years, I feel like it'd be a bit out of the blue to bring it up now. 
2. I've told him he's a good singer before when playing the guitar so I feel like he'd think I was lying those times and I don't want him to be discouraged because he does love to do it. 
3. The man loves it. Sings at least 2 hours a day. I don't want to be a buzzkill.

However, it really makes me angry whenever I hear him. Not sure whether there is pent up anger projected at this joyful activity of his or if it is warranted.
