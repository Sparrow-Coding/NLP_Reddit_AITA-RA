We started to drift as teens. I was quiet and shy. She was a social butterfly.  We just sorta veered off in different directions from that alone. If I'm being honest, she was pretty mean to me - just kinda general mean girl teen stuff. By the time we were adults, we had very little in common.

When we were in out early 20s, she got married very suddenly. She was super upset that I didn't attend, but I couldn't afford a last minute flight, car rental and hotels with two weeks notice. She spent months telling me I was an AH for not just putting all that on my credit cards.

Years go by, and we're pretty much sending ""Happy birthday"" texts and the odd joke to each other. My little brother lives abroad and both of us had had a really rough year. I'm making a little money at this point, so I fly to visit him. While I'm there my cousin texts me that she's in life threatening danger. I call her, and she says she's fine. She only texted that because she knew that'd get my attention. She spends the next hour berating me for visiting my brother instead of her.

A few more years go by. Just happy birthdays. 

Finally one night after no texting from either of us since her previous birthday, she randomly she texts me to confront me about us not being close. I figure I may as well be honest. I text back telling her I don't hold any ill-will towards her, but that we really don't know each other anymore. My priority as an adult is my brother and my chosen family.

She calls me every awful word in the book. At first I try to explain that it's not personal - we're just two adults living on opposite sides of a massive country with not a lot in common anymore. Eventually I just get tired and stop engaging. She keeps going. Rage texting turns in ""I hope you're happy that you've made me cry"" and ""Anything I do to myself tonight is your fault."" That eventually turns into ""Can you just please talk to me?"" All told there are north of 100 texts in a row that night.

I haven't responded to anything since. She messages from time to time, but I'm not interested in the relationship. I just got another - she says she's praying for a Christmas miracle of a text back.

I think that makes me a bit of a jerk, but I don't see a positive for the relationship for me.

I recently revised the employee handbook that hadn't been touched in years and we're hoping to get it out and signed by employees by the end of the year and have it take effect January 1, 2023. One thing that changes from the og handbook is that the bonus policy goes from 90 calendar days to 90 working days. The og handbook was didn't specify but for years it had always been 90 calendar days. No one has signed the new handbook yet and it's hit or miss if they even sign the old handbook based on how awful it is. Last month, I was even told to not let anyone else sign it

When people were up for bonuses last Friday, I reached out to the owner to get things cleared by him he cleared it, I sent out stubs, then he changed his mind and said that it is now 90 working days and it had always been 90 working days. So I was told to take the bonuses off the checks which I did. I feel shitty about taking the bonuses away, especially since people were expecting it and were rightfully upset when I was told to retract it.

I didn't send out new paystubs because it was not my problem. I didn't change the policy last second. It was my understanding someone else would talk to them. That never happened so on payday they were asking where their bonus was at. I told the owner he needed to call this guy and explain and the owner made me do it. When I updated them later and said that I had done it, I got in trouble for not doing it right away.

Then I got yelled at by the guys for taking the bonuses off and all that.

At the end of the day, I was just doing what I was told, but right now all my coworkers hate me and the owner is pinning it on me.

Me(17f) My sister(23) My brother(21)


This was on my brothers 21st birthday a few days ago. The previous night my brother starter talking to me about wanting to buy me a laptop for my birthday. I thought he meant something along the lines of $50-$150 dollars, but he pulls up walmart with a picture of a laptop worth $1000. I told him over and over again that I would feel bad if he bought it for me, but he was persistent, so I gave up and let him buy it. When I went over to my sisters apartment the next day, I was telling her about how I felt bad that he was buying it and asked her for her opinion, but instead she got mad because ahe never received and expensive gift from him. Keep in mind, when her birthday rolled around at the beginning of the year, he didn't have as much money as he does now. He's been promoted, given a raise, and broke up with his GF who he would spend a lot of money on. He probably planned on buying her something expensive for her birthday next year because he would feel bad for buying me something and not her. But that's not the part that causes trouble, me and my sister get into a lot of petty fights, usually cause by her. My issue is when she came over later and went off on my brother for buying me the laptop and telling him that she was hurt that she never received anything like that. He got mad at me for 'spreading his business' but that was never my intentions. I just wanted someone elses opinion on whether or not I should've let him buy it for me. So he's mad at me and I feel like shit cause it put a sour mood to his 21st birthday.

I have a dog and shes a covid baby and isnt used to being alone. Since shes my service dog she usually goes wherever i do but she gets really nauseous during car rides that are more than 40 minutes. So if we ever go on long trips we get her the same babysitter. My dog is relatively easy to take care of, all we ask is that they take her and pick her up from daycare and then spend the night at our house. This has never been a problem before and we always ask them weeks prior to the trip so they have plenty of time to say yes or no. 

The day before the trip comes and I get a message at 9 PM asking me if they can sleep in one of the beds instead of the couch because they had a bad night the last time they slept on the couch. I know I’m biased but I’ve had family that has slept on the couch before and no one has ever complained. But people are different so I decided to just let them. I set them up in my mom’s room and I put my dogs bed in there. Mind you every room in our house has cameras besides the two bedrooms and the bathrooms. I really regret this now. Sunday morning I got a text from them saying that my dog had thrown up and had diarrhea on the carpet where her bed was. 

My dog is very well housetrained and she knows to not to always warn us whenever she has go to the bathroom, even when she has diarrhea. What she always does it starts knocking on her pen and making noise so we can wake up and we can take her to the bathroom. She’s also really loud when she’s throwing up. This is not something you would miss if you were in the room with her. I thought this was really weird but since we were far away and it she’s had tummy problems before I just chalked it up to her being a little stressed. I monitored her while she was in daycare and I asked her daycare to let me know if she had any more accidents and they even gave her a bath. She didn’t have any more accidents. 


Now here’s the problem I just got home from my trip and it’s wild. Heres what happened: The house smells awful (which they did warn me about) I went to get the carpet cleaner and my mom had accidentally thrown out the part of it that holds water, I went to Home Depot, I rented a carpet cleaner, I came home, my mom told me that they had also clogged her toilet and then when she went to use it it’s spilled water all over the bathroom floor. 

The bed looked like no one touched it. So either she’s an expert at replicating how my mom makes her bed or she left my dog home for the entire night when we paid her to be there with her. 

I’m really at a loss I did just don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should ask her about it or if I should just clean it up and deal with it. I’m definitely never using her again but I just want to know what to do from here whatever the asshole if I asked her about it and for my money back.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4834853,public,top,self,WIBTA if I asked my dog’s babysitter for my money back?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7aijd/wibta_if_i_asked_my_dogs_babysitter_for_my_money/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

I told her that she didn't have to get involved in her business and that it was my hand, not hers, then Saul said she was crazy and said something like ""that crazy d3vil can't find what to do with her life"" I told her that He was the crazy one and he shouldn't mess with me... 

hang out and I start cleaning the palm of my hand with a napkin and it doesn't work, it only makes it worse... to hell I had both palms covered in ink ...

They realize this and start saying things like ""d4mn crazy now she's trying to get clean"" ""medicate"" ""you'd better start taking pills to get rid of the crazy thing"" another said to take him to my house since he lives near me (I don't know why) I got angry but before I say what happened next I'll add something that I think is relevant...

Well, then I tell him ""d4mn c0cksuck3r leave me alone I'm not doing anything to you, d4mn wretch stop meddling in my life"" they all stared at me, now the teacher did pay attention to what I said, but not to what they said and she took me out of the room...

Hello all , 9 days ago me and my pregnant partner moved into a downstairs flat ( temporary accommodation as we were made homeless because our flat flooded ) . Above us Is a 40 ish year old mother and and 17 year old daughter .on the first night we were kept up till 4am by the daughter ( I will refer to her as k ) talking very loudly on the phone and heavily walking from one side of her flat to the other , I hear them walking all day and this was different,  so I knocked 2 taps on the ceiling , didn't help anything.

 Nearly every night since then we have been kept up till 2-4 am by banging and talking and dropping things , the floor is wood upstairs so some noise is expected but it's more then just normal living  , we made a complaint twice to the hotel around the corner that deals with these temporary accommodations.

 2 nights ago at 3am I knocked on the ceiling again and k rung the hotel and had security come round and said we were constantly knocking ,my partner came out and apologised for the bangs but asked them to keep it down and was met with a mouthful of abuse , k seems very firey , she had a big row with the security guards that came over to speak before telling them a pack of lies about me apparently harassing her by knocking on the ceiling ( which imo is the international sign of please keep it down your being too loud ) k claimed she has anxiety but she didn't seem to anxious to scream at 2 burly security guards . 

I left it at that , I don't like confrontation,  today the mother has been chanting amen for hours , not a problem , it wasn't late and everyone has the right to express their religious freedoms however they like but after a while the chants turned to "" Neighbour you are not welcome here after tonight "" "" the fire will cleanse "" which is unacceptable to me and causing me and my partner stress.

I recored some of this on video but the audio on my phone is very quiet , I took this as a threat and called the police and reported it to the police and went round to the hotel to complain , the security guard came with me back to our flat and spoke to k and the mother , she then claimed I was a racist , said proof was I have a bald head ( I'm 31 but have allopcia , also missing a eyebrow ) and that she had lived there 2 years without problem , as the audio was pretty quiet I can't properly back this up , you can hear ""neighbour "" but the rest is a bit muffled.

The police said they will come round but they are busy , my partner ( who has diagnosed anxiety ) is terrified and she would rather be homeless then put up with this,  I would buy a cctv with audio but payday isn't for another 11 days .

My girlfriend has always had issues saying no and establishing boundaries. This led to a lot of fights in the past where others have thrown baggage at her. For example, her sister abandoned her infant a while back, and no one would take him, so her dad asked her if she could take him, and she said yes without consulting me. I understood the gravity of the situation and we took care of him until - unfortunately - we put him in foster care, but I digress.  
  
My girlfriend has a lot of “homies” she’s met over the years. They all used to hang out together but after covid and the bad economy, they slowly moved out of the city except for one guy. He still hangs out with my girlfriend and he had feelings for her in the past.  
  
I’ve noticed in the beginning, she would still hang out with him the same way the old group hung out - movies, music, video games etc. However, as time passed by, they started hanging out late at night, often till 3-4 AM. I got suspicious and confronted her about it. She was honest with me and told me he had a crush on her and that there’s nothing between them. I shrugged it off and told myself this is my insecurities talking.  
  
However, there was this one time where we invited him to dinner they stayed late and I went to sleep. I woke up later - around 3 - and saw them still sitting on the couch having a quiet, whispering conversation. After he left, I told my girlfriend I’m uncomfortable having a guy friend over that late. We got into a fight and she got defensive of him.  

She invited him a couple times after, and I noticed he would wait for me to go to sleep to have intimate conversations with her again. He invited her to a fancy restaurant the other night, and last weekend, I was using my girlfriend’s iPad and I saw a text pop up that says “I’ll take you to dinner next weekend”.  

I trust my girlfriend, but I feel uncomfortable with him hovering over. I get that this happens and will happen in any relationship, but the fact that he keeps “asking her out”, trying to take her to fancy places and waiting for me until I’m not around to talk to her at length for hours, is something I’m struggling not to take offense at. It makes me feel he’s dismissive of the relationship as he continues to hit on her.  

The other day my girlfriend and I were watching a movie and he calls her, then a text pops up saying “are we rain checking again?” - she chuckled and said “he overthinks stuff”. It bothered me because he’s the “friendzoned” guy who is just “waiting for the right time”

I got offended that night and texted him saying that asking her out repeatedly and waiting for me to go to sleep so he could have intimate conversations with her, is extremely disrespectful. 

He got defensive, saying they’re just friends and that I have no right to tell him that.

Now I've chosen an idea which consists of flowers which each of the family members will draw on their own in their own style. At the tattoo shop, those sketches will be turned into a bouquet of flowers and tattooed on me. 

Now I've got a huge dilemma. One part of my (mother's) family is the side I see the most. We see each other every week and often play games together or have a gathering where we eat out etc. Safe to say we are together a lot. 

Now my dad's side are a little more on their own. My parents have been seeing my dad's mom on and off because of fights. She thinks we don't visit and see her often enough. My parents have been going out to visit her again lately, but she never comes to our house ever again. She says she misses the children (me and my brother) and tells us to come over. We are both busy and reserved a weekday in the evening for her to come over and see us so we can see her too. She basically never comes that day. 

My grandma has always favored her other grandchildren; going on vacation with them, giving them gifts and eating out with them. She also visits them every week. It is just so noticable that we arent really priority to her. 

It is that she has always been like this since I was little. She once bought flipflops for my small nieces, but when my mom called her out and said we (me and my brother) would have loved them to, she simply said that she didn't know our sizes so she couldn't get them for us. She basically could have called about it, but who am I. 

Anyways, back to the tattoo. I really want the flowers from my mom's side, but I'm figuring out of i should get my dads side too? It just feels both wrong as right to get her share too. 

I don't want her to really feel left out because shes my grandma, but she actually treats us like we don't even exist? Should i skip the idea as a whole?

I told him the weekend that the showing would be then, and checked in with him periodically to make sure it still works.

During that 6 weeks I wrote tasks for 6 of his closest friends/siblings, coordinated all of their schedules with mine. Spent a whole day filming, and then cut together the footage into an episode. Come to find out from a friend 6 days before the planned showing that he's made plans that day to go to a Christmas party.

I'd asked if we could celebrate her next birthday together and she promised we could and that it was what she wanted too.

I was in Sahuayo Mich. , Mexico visiting relatives (thanks to a nice company Thanksgiving days off as well as some vacation days). I'm from LA so sometimes I act a little different than the other people here.

Anyways, in this city there is a typical Spanish plaza where they were having a beauty contest for Miss Sahuayo 2022. This was hours after a rain storm that flooded the plaza. 

 One of the first contestants was trying being introduced where they dance a little dance for the talent section. Anyways, there I was drinking my mocha from one of the coffee shops watching the contests, when the contestant start jerking backwards and falls down. The host help her off stage (she is fine and continued the contest). I thought she was attacked by a bee, overreacted and slipped on a wet stage. 

I laughed after I saw she was fine. I was the only one laughing in the plaza of a couple hundred people. It was dead silent for several seconds except me laughing. My wife and my family scolded me later because I laughed. 

Turns out the contestant was electrocuted and not chased by a bee. I maintain (in arguments) with my wife that I shouldnt feel bad because I thought she was stung by a bee not electrocuted. I wouldn't have laughed if I thought she was electrocuted.

Here is a link that someone else took.

I was further back didn't hear anyone mention electrocution until after I was done laughing.

The lunch consisted of some Rotisserie Chicken wraps, carrot sticks with homemade Greek yogurt ranch, baby corn, strawberries, and some Aunt Annie's chips for her and she took it to school. I thought everything was fine until my mom called me upset saying why did i make her lunch when my mom already made her one. I wasn't aware of that, and when my mom asked my sister why she didn't take the lunch she had made her, my sister said ""because I wanted to try Leliana food.""

We have been together for 3 going on 4 years together. We ended up having to move out of our house due to the lease ending at the beginning of this year. However, we welcomed our beautiful and handsome son into this world this year. (5/18/22) With us being homeless we began to couch hop from place to place until finally moving in with my mother in law. After my fiancé suffered the loss of her stepfather. I would like to bring up the fact that I offered my stepmother the idea of us moving in prior to his passing because of the mountain of bills she had. We moved in with a few bumps along the way. However, let’s fast forward about 2-3 weeks after the passing. My mother in law(MIL) goes to bike week to pay tribute to her late husband, but this is where things get interesting. While away for bike week MIL meets up with an “life long” old friend whom she gets butterflies in her stomach from. She complains after 2 weeks of them hanging out that she feels like he’s trapping her and making it stuffy yet she continues to date him. Mind you this man has a wife whom he hasn’t started nor finished his divorced from, and supposedly he is the friend of stepfather. Flash-forward, our son is about 5 months old. We've been staying at my fiancés moms house for about 2 months now. I had just got done work early so my fiancé had come to get me. While I'm on the way back we get a FaceTime call from MIL. She proceeded to show us her new BF from biker week holding our side. Mind you my fiancé had told her mother that he makes her uncomfortable as well as told her that we as a collective don’t want him holding our son. Yet her mother decided to go against our wishes as parents and disrespected us as parents by letting her boyfriend hold our son. So I’m going to ask Am I The Asshole for snapping at my mother in law. For telling her she needs to respect our wishes as parents and that we told her we didn’t want someone to hold our son yet doing it is disrespectful. Because her response was “my house, my rules”, I can do what I want in my house. Idgaf if it is your house this is my child. You will respect my wishes about my children. As a reaction to the argument my mother in law kicked my fiancé, our son and myself out of her house. We have been sleeping in a van for a couple days before her friends threatened to call CYS on us for sleeping in a van when we’re kicked out. I now am being bashed and barraged with accusations of being an abusive, controlling fiance. I have been shit talked by my fiancés mothers’ friends all for speaking my mind about the situation. Yet the narrative is spun that I am the bad guy. I hate to say it but it’s all because I’m the kid from Philly who grew up on the wrong side of town. “All my mother sees you is a black kid who got her daughter pregnant.” ~My fiancé’s words.

But background information first. 

I live in a dormitory floor where we all get along pretty well, we hang out, go to parties, and consult each other for our relationship ailments. Here’s the problem, we have this one person that LIVES for drama, the most minuscule transgression is blown out of proportion and we’re all subject to her talking shit about that one person for the rest of the day. (I.E. she owed someone for food and forced them for show her the debit card and the receipt to make sure that they weren’t lying to her just to get her money the food was less than $5) 

Recently there was this guy that she was into but he wasn’t interested in anything further that a casual friends with benefits. Regardless she was convinced that he was in love with her and wanted to be with her. 
Even though this guy is friends with a lot of us and we like him better than her, she does not want us to associate with him anymore 

She is still obsessed over this guy even though there is someone else she is currently with right now! It’s giving me emotional affair vibes.  

Someone texted her asking her for that guys snap which I later found out was because they were having car troubles and OG guy is good with cars. 

She busted into the room almost hitting me with the door and I was already reaching my limit that night. She spouted into a spiel about “why would this person want his snap?” And “she knows I had a thing with him”

I snapped and said “who cares? You’re your own person don’t give it to her if you don’t want to. She probably has her reasons for asking for it.” 

She looked stunned and the apologized for almost hitting me with the door to which I replied with “I don’t give a f*ck” which I admit was rude 

She spent the rest of the night crying about how I hated her

Okay, background information. My mom has borderline personality disorder and while I love her and understand she's mentally ill, she has caused me a lot of trauma and made my life a living hell growing up.

Ever since I was old enough to have social media my mom has been obsessed with making sure I post on Facebook wishing her happy birthday or happy mothers day. If I didn't she would accuse me of not loving her or being ungrateful and would refuse to kiss, hug or even speak to me for sometimes up to 2 weeks. When I lived with her for my own sake I appeased her and made a nice little post but now that I'm older I feel like I need to stop enabling her childlike behavior. 2 years ago my father passed away and on fathers day and his birthday I now make a facebook post and tag him in it as I feel like this the only way I still have left to celebrate him. I never did this for him before his passing. I don't ever post on my facebook for anyone's birthday as I think calling them or spending time with them on their birthday is much more personal. Most recently for mother's day, I spent 100 dollars on her, took her to lunch, and spent the entire day with her. On my father's death date I made a facebook post saying how much I missed him. After I made this post my mom called me and told me that she knew I always loved my father more and accused me of not loving her. Her birthday is in the coming weeks and my family told me that this year I should just make a Facebook post to make her happy, however, I don't feel like I should be enabling her manipulative behavior and I think it's time to start having some boundaries 

I am starting to think I may be the asshole because she does have a mental health problem and this issue is because of it and I am a nurse so I feel as though I can go no contact with her because her behavior is because of her illness.

Since my partner and I got together almost two years ago everything has been a roller-coaster. 
Mainly because we are both very impulsive and against better judgement acted on most impulses. Which lead us to being homeless and broke. Thus having to move back into my fathers house. As it so happens my dad is sick and recovering from a long term alcoholism, and the house is falling apart. Thus i justify living here again - while gathering money to pay off debt and getting a place - with renovating the house little by little. Plumbing, electricity, carpenting etc. 

This, plus running my newly started plumbing company and studying for a high-school diploma of course takes a lot of energy, and can be somewhat stressful. Which makes me prioritize my partner a bit less, compared to the past year where she has been my only priority. 
And now I dont really have the energy to keep her mood up anymore, and when I tell her I will still support her however I can't help her and she needs to seek out therapy and treatment gor her depression. She responds with calling me a cold asshole and she have done therapy and dont need it anymore. ""Depression is just part of who she is"", still she wants me to elevate her mood everytime she has a depressive episode.

For my 18th birthday, I had a nice dinner party with 3 of my friends. I chose a cake from this really nice store. While my mother and I were picking up my cake, we saw another really beautiful Hello Kitty cake in the fridge. I loved it so much that I got a picture and saved it. About a week later I decided that this is the cake I want next year. I always plan things early. I made the mistake of forgetting to tell my mom not to tell my sister, resulting in her saying she now wants the cake.

It's the special thing I get for myself once a year, and she wants it. Not because she likes it, but because she knew I did. This is not the first time. I tried to give her other options. Cakes with themes from shows she likes, cakes with toys she likes, but my mother insists that I'm being childish and it's not a big deal.

When the day came to go in-store to place the order (2hr drive), I still tried to reason with my parents to please talk her out of it, but just got told ""you're 18 now, things like that shouldn't matter to you"". They ordered the cake, $115. My sister starts tugging my mom and says ""mommy I won, mommy I beat her!"". I tried to hold it together in the car, but as soon as I got on the phone with my boyfriend, I feel like everything I've been holding together for the past 6 years exploded. I bawled my eyes out in my room and it was the worst breakdown I've ever experienced. My hands were stiff in place and my entire body felt numb. I've never cried so hard where I began to gasp for air.

It wasn't just the cake. It was everything leading up to the cake too. It was every single time I felt like second place, every single time defending myself was turned back onto me. I get how it seems on the outside, I cried because a 6 year old got the cake I wanted. But it was the one thing I get a year that is special for me.

Okay, background information. My mom has borderline personality disorder and while I love her and understand she's mentally ill, she has caused me a lot of trauma and made my life a living hell growing up.  

Ever since I was old enough to have social media my mom has been obsessed with making sure I post on Facebook wishing her happy birthday or happy mothers day.

I never did this for him before his passing. I don't ever post on my facebook for anyone's birthday as I think calling them or spending time with them on their birthday is much more personal. Most recently for mother's day, I spent 100 dollars on her, took her to lunch, and spent the entire day with her. On my father's death date I made a facebook post saying how much I missed him. After I made this post my mom called me and told me that she knew I always loved my father more and accused me of not loving her.

They leave this coming Saturday and come back the following Saturday.  Months ago, when they were first planning this trip, my sister asked me (29F) if I would be willing to stay at their house and watch their 2 kids (8 &amp; 6) and their dog while they are gone.  

I can work from home, so I would still be able to work from their place.  And their kids are in school during the day so I would have time to get all my work done before they get home.  My sister said they can also pay me $750 for the week and will have the fridge and pantry stocked with food so that I don't have to worry about any of that either.  I was a little hesitant about it because I've never watched kids for that long before, but I did end up agreeing.

At our family Thanksgiving last week, my BIL was talking about a date that he and my sister recently went on and how expensive it was to find a good babysitter.  He said they found one they really like who is great with their kids, so they have no problem paying her $25/hour because they trust her and the kids like her.  

I did some quick math in my head and realized that they were only paying me like $100 A DAY when I'm going to be in charge of their kids for an entire week.  My BIL was shelling out $100 to their babysitter for a 4-hour dinner and movie date.  

I made a comment that if they can afford to pay a babysitter that much for a few hours, they should be paying me the same rate when I'm watching their kids.  My BIL at first kind of laughed it off, but I told him I was serious and if he wants me to watch his kids for an entire week, I want the same rate as they would pay their regular babysitter.  

He told me that we had already agreed on the terms of me watching their kids, but I told him that I want to change those terms, or I am not going to watch them and they'll have to find someone else.  He got pissed and called my sister over.  He explained what was happening and my sister got pissed at me too.  She said we had already agreed and since the kids will be in school and I can still work, it's not like I'm missing out on income and am also saving on food for the week.  

I stood firm and told them that unless they increase what they are paying me, I am backing out of our arrangement.  There was some back and forth, but my sister eventually agreed to pay me $1000 instead of the $750.  

Right after that, my BIL grabbed their kids and they left.  He walked past me on their way out and said ""You better hope you don't need to ask us for anything anytime soon you f#\*&amp;ing extortionist b!tch.""  I told him if he keeps that attitude up, I'll demand another thousand.  

After they left my mom and dad were also pissed at me.  They said that I was wrong to force my sister and BIL into that and that isn't the way we treat family.  I told them that I wasn't going to allow myself to be taken advantage of just because we share DNA.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4834657,public,top,self,AITA For demanding that I get paid more to watch my niece and nephew or I'm not going to do it,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z79319/aita_for_demanding_that_i_get_paid_more_to_watch/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

Pls forgive the rant, I (39f) have been told that I’m overreacting by my (40m) husband by pulling my son (2.5m) out of an activity because of a set of parents who will be there. 

tl;dr former friends are spending time with my 2.5yo son behind our back when he is with a babysitter,  calling themselves auntie and uncle, AITA for pulling him from an activity where he’ll be interacting with them? 

I have a 2.5yr old son who is the absolute love of my life. Through a mom group I became close with a family who has a child similar in age. Long story short - the friendship is ended abruptly by the wife, the husband phones me to explain, stating she “pushes people away” when she’s struggling with her mental health. Ok, fair enough, I leave the door open for her to reach out if she wants/needs to chat. We had actually been feeling like the friendship was nearing its natural conclusion, as our parenting styles differ greatly and we were starting to see an “angry” side to them (mainly towards their daughter and each other). 
This is where it gets weird - our babysitter (who watches our son once a week and their daughter at other times)says she met with them at a local park and had a play date with our son and their daughter. We are a bit weirded out but decide to not let it bother us. These playdates start happening pretty much every time she is babysitting him, though. Still not a word from the parents to us. The play dates start to become lengthier, to the point that I have to ask the babysitter to bring him back home bc it’s past his supper time. We then find out they had our babysitter and our son over to their home (no one cleared this with us first) and are referring to themselves as his Auntie and Uncle. Please let me add that they don’t engage with him if we run into them at a local pool or anything, nor do they talk to us. I messaged them and politely told them to back off. The wife never responded, the husband said something about our son needing to go to their house to “warm up” before the “long walk” home which makes NO geographical sense given the park they were at and adds “ok boundary has been set” 

I just found out that my son is registered in the same parent-toddler activity as their daughter starting this winter. I immediately pulled him from the activity and explained to the organizers that the parents crossed a line with our son and we don’t want them around him. AITA?

Usually me and my extended family from my mom's side meet twice a year. Thanksgiving and Easter (Christmas I'm with my dad's side of the family).

But e assume that my mom got sick from overdoing it.

And then, that very evening, I start getting a nicht throat. I denk some water and electrolytes to keep myself hydrated.

The moment my friend got home, she started to complain of body aches and chills. And I felt my heart drop out of my asshole. Because her boss had arranged for her to later after she got back home.

My husband loves his meat and fish to LOOK at the grill.

I just don't like the flavor or texture of SUPER rare meat. I don't like my salmon cold and raw in the middle. I like all meat and fish cooked medium-rare, just not cold in the middle.

I feel terrible because he has made something for us and we just don't like it.

He gets really offended. When he cooks for the kids he always adds EXTRA cheese to eggs and bananas to pancake mix (even when they ask him not too) because he says they need to open their pallet. It honestly frustrating because it wastes food AND he gets mad at me because he says I am making them picky. I'm like maybe the kids just don't want cheese in their eggs and want plain pancakes and don't like their meat bleeding. He says ""You made them that picky"" and it is my fault and I am raising them to be spoiled.

My husband (31) is in love with Christmas. Usually we never do secret Santa for kids (especially his family since it’s so huge) they have over 11 kids in total that’s not including family friends. This year I’m ecstatic to celebrate Christmas with my baby. We’re spending it at my parents house since last year we were at his moms It’s better for my parents since it’s their first grandkid and of course this will be their first for everything with him (baby). Just for reference (I buy my Christmas gifts early by September) I try to skip the chaos with last minute shopping..When we mentioned we wouldn’t be attending their (my partners) family for Christmas in a group chat they “boo’d” an said we should come since they’re doing it at a hall this year. I said no, I wasn’t down for that. But then they suggested we do secret Santa for the kids. I also said no to that. Because we weren’t going to go. I already bought each kid a gift an now I have to sit on them for Christmas because they decide to do a hall and secret Santa (TODAY)… also they know and I’ve brought up before that I already bought each of their kids a gift. So I refused to do secret Santa since we won’t be there. My partner agrees with this. But not his sisters or other family. Mind you they’re only doing a hall to impress one of his cousins girlfriends mom that’s coming from Germany for Christmas… it feels all like a show instead of Christmas spirit with the family. So regardless I wasn’t gonna attend and skip my parents.

Not knowing what to do i told my mom about it , to which she said as usual""oh just shut up , you're being dramatic"", i took my medication which didn't help .

After 2 minutes of relaxing my sister demanded i get up and clean the kitchen , i told her I needed a minute until my legs stop shaking and the pain goes away , she said that she didn't care and said she'd tell mom that i was being disrespectful and lazy.

After a while the pain got so bad that i fell and passed out , i woke up a few minutes later to my dad and the guest standing around me as i got up . My dad decided to take me to the hospital . While there the doctor told me that it's gotten worse and only surgery can fix it. They scheduled my surgery and we went back home , the guests were gone.

My dad got very upset and started yelling at my mom saying that my health and wellbeing is more important than some dinner party . They argued back and forth.  My sister came up to me and told me it was my fault that their arguing and i should've just sucked up the pain

It's progressively gotten worse over the years as I moved out to go to school in another country. I appreciate all she does but she gaslights me for moving away and claims that I dont love her. We had a really huge fight when she helped move me in for college and hasn't texted me since. No check ins, no update, no nothing. She lives alone but my sibling lives close by (doesnt visit much tho). My mom loves to pick apart our lives and criticize everything we do, and when we try to have a conversation with her she always turns the tables on us. For eg. If I try to communicate to her that I wished she checked in with me more, she'll reply by saying ""But how come you never check to see how I'm doing?!"" Keep in mind, I'm a busy college kid living my own life in a new city. I honestly don't think it's on me to make sure that she's doing ok. She's an adult capable of managing herself. On the other hand, she hasn't even texted a ""how are you"" or checked to see if im ALIVE. 1) AITA for not checking in with her?

Most recently we got into a fight over text. I'll admit I was aggressive because she bought me a late flight back to school. (I was upset because I wanted to an earlier date so I could didn't have to spend as much time with her). She says Im ungrateful (ok maybe that was on me) and pulls the ""you don't care about me card, I'm actually sick right now"" THEN proceeds to send me an unsolicited picture of her \*\*\*hole. Yes, that's right. Apparently she's been having \*\*\*hole problems and needed to go to the doctor. I've been literally traumatized by that photo. I was thinking of apologizing to her for arguing but every time I want to I just think of that photo and how disturbing it was. I can't help but think she used it to try to gaslight me into feeling guilty. I understand she's going through her own problems, but I don't feel like it's on me to solve them for her.

She lives for her 4 adult kids and I feel she resents me for not being one of them

She often causes conflict and uses unrelated reasons as excuses. Eg I moved out because of her but when I was living at home and she wasn't, I was in the kitchen preparing food. I complained that the kitchen was too small, it's not, I was overwhelmed and frustrated. She took this to mean that I was saying she wasn't welcome at the house. So she gave the silent treatment for weeks

After I moved out I wanted to take my dad and her out for Fathers day. My dad told me they weren't coming anymore because she said my bf and I don't attend their Xmas parties, so she won't attend lunch with us. My bf and I are never invited to her parties, so we don't go

I eventually asked my dad for the four of us to sit down and make peace. When I asked her what her problem was she brought up the kitchen comment and the fathers day incident. I don't know if she misunderstood but this time she made it seem like she wasn't invited yo fathers day and that's why she didn't want to come

We called a truce and I've been trying to bite my tongue and get along with her.

When they have parties, we're not invited. When they have lunches we're not invited but if they go away and need someone to drive them to the airport, look after pets etc we're the ones doing it

I won't lie I resent her immensely but I make an active effort to get along. Recently I've been planning my dad 60th party. I've made another post about this

Essentially, she won't contirbute to the party but wants all her family members to attend. She's offered me some money to contribute to the party(or to her FMs food, nothing else). I told her she can't just invite her people and expect me to pay for it

She blew up at me over the phone for not being willing to pay for her FMs. I am beyond pissed about this because I was going to pay for some of her FM but not enough for her liking. I also feel like she is using my dad's birthday and party as an excuse to host her FMs and have a little reunion at my expense

Because of this I have changed the plans entirely, moved the venue and have not invited her. I kind of feel like an AH for this but I am worried she will cause a scene and ruin the day for my dad

So I'm considering creating significant distance between us and avoiding her entirely but I'm scared that this will cause issues between my dad and I and I don't want to cause issues in their relationship. But I'm tired of constantly being the bigger person and having my most innocent actions blamed for causing conflict.

I feel like I might be the AH for not inviting her to the new venue, for not being the bigger person and just paying for everyone.

When I (F18) got there I went to go pet my horse and everything was well. My friend (F18) sat on her horse waiting her chance to go jump.

Our Groom decided to not do his job today and didn’t take the horses to their stables and he left all the gates open. Allowing all the horse to have free roam over a lot of dangerous areas. When I turned around there were about 15 horses around me. I was trying to figure out what to do, because they were all running around. 

This is when I heard a big bang. I didn’t quite understand what was happening. I thought one of the horse just kicked something and shrugged it off. 

Suddenly I heard a gunshot. Then another one. Then another one. And then yet again another one. I was shaking thinking we are getting robbed or someone is attacking us. Even though I was terrified I immediately ran to my horse to calm him down. The groom then came running down. Yelling. “We had to put her down”. Then the owner of the farm came running down yelling. “Kids don’t come up”. There were two children F9 and M6. 

When I looked up. She was laying there. Her intestines all over the floor. My friend and I start hysterically crying. We immediately recognised the horse. The other girl saw everything and she ran to her car. She was also crying. Everyone except the kids understood exactly what was happening. We all knew this horse and we loved her. 

Turns out that first big bang that I heard was her trying to jump over a very sharp pole after some of the horses gathered in a very small area. She was trying to get away most probably, because she felt overwhelmed by the other horses around her. It cut open her entire stomach and when she got off she started to kick and her intestines were all over the floor. The owner had to shoot her to put het out of her misery, but she was running around too much, she was in pain and bleeding out so he had no other choice, but he missed 3 times, because of how much she was freaking out. Till he eventually shot her. Afterwards he was crying and he was white as a ghost. My trainer was crying. Safe to say after crying a lot, I got in the car after untacking my horse and left to go home. 

My heart is still hurting. And idk what to do. I just feel so numb. She was the most gentle and caring horse in the world. That groom cost her, her life. And made that we all have to mourn the lost of a loved horse. He caused us all pain and trauma.

One of the friends I made was this girl named ""Jessica"" (also F19) and we've done a lot of social goodwill for minority groups online and in college together, and we've hung out a lot as well. However, I've recently been in a little bit of a conflict with her. 

A week or so ago, me and Jessica went to a party and she got pretty wasted. While she was at the party, this Indian guy tried to hit on her. Jessica declined and he seemed to take it pretty well, and I thought that'd be the end of it. However, when we got back to my dorm, Jessica started ranting to me about the guy and it later turned into a full-blown rant about Indian men and Indian culture as a whole. I won't tell you everything, but some of the points she made were that Indian men were ""creepy incels from a backwards, misogynistic culture"" and that she'd rather die than date one. She also made fun of the guy's accent and ended the rant by calling him a ""funny-voiced nerd."" After that, the booze seemed to have its effect on Jessica so she went to sleep. While I didn't do much during her rant, I was appalled at how racist she was being, and even more so about how what we'd been working for was completely lost on her when discussing other groups.

I (30m) have been in a committed relationship for 5 years with a man (50m) who does not want to move in together or progress our relationship. 

We used to talk extensively about our dreams of getting a property and homesteading, and how much I wanted to learn to build homes and do renovations and etc. Everything that comes w building a house and creating d homestead. I even started learning how to garden and preserve veggies and etc. 

We are in very different places economically. He recently sold a business an drought an amazing property and started building a home last year which is almost finished. I live in the next county over and unfortunately have hit some hard times. Lost.my vehicle, my job, and have very little income at the moment while I am building my own landscaping business from the ground up.

We had talked about moving in together, but he never gave me a straight answer. He says he's making me a room in the house and wants me to keep my stuff there, but doesn't want a 'spouse'. I have only been able to visit the construction site maybe 5 times in 2 years because he always has an excuse. 

The bottom floor is being made into an apartment for a tennant in order to cut cost of living. I had offered multiple times to rent out the apartment, relocate, get work, and pay the rent but he kept saying he wasn't sure if he was even going to finish the apartment due to funds. 

Then yesterday I brought the issue up again to him and he tells me that the apartment is going to be rented out. To a young, attractive straight guy my age who has worked for him in the past. 

He has shared with me that he used to oggle this guy and that he thinks this guy is hot, but he's straight. I don't care if he cheats or whatever, we're open, but my heart is completely broken that he 

1. Doesn't want to live with anyone but
    2. He's fine having a hot straight boy living there instead of me 

His explanation so far has been that he didn't know it would upset me and that he didn't think I could afford rent. My argument is that he knew exactly what he was doing, that he's emotionally unavailable, and that he didn't give me the chance to prove myself. I could have been working and saving for months if I knew I could move in, he didn't even tell me until yesterday that the apartment would even be finished. 

I am incredibly hurt by this and I don't think our relationship can continue. I don't trust him anymore and he's acting like I'm the crazy one when I just want a normal relationship after 5 years of working together to create something.
