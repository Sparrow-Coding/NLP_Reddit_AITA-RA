I won't go into specifics to stay anonymous, but this is the 2nd time I've been diagnosed with a Bone Cancer. Before I was treated outpatient and this time I'm inpatient in the hospital for a full week with 24-hour chemo. It's debilitating to say the least. My family doesn't come from wealth and we barely have been above the surface even before I was diagnosed. The first treatment, we set up a gofundme and fundraisers to help pay for my treatments and surgery.

My mother said at the beginning of all this that I would never have to worry about finances. I was grateful, but knew deep down I would worry anyway. And sure enough, I did. But not about the Financials, but about her.

 Following my surgery, my mother finally (about 6 months into diagnosis) formed a gofundme, asking for an outrageous amount (I think $100,000) My surgery was well over $250,000, but was thankfully covered by insurance. However, we did have bills still that we had paid through other fundraising.

I asked my mom how much we owed from surgery(prior to calling billing and asking for the itemized statement). My mother said that we still owed over $50,000 and she had to take money from her retirement to cover it. I actually felt guilty for getting cancer and surviving such a lengthy surgery. My mother said the gofundme would be used for my medical bills but also to pay her back for the retirement money. I later found out that insurance did cover everything and that we didn't owe/pay anything from my 15-hr limb salvage surgery. I was furious.

After finishing chemo in April, I went back to work to pay off my medical bills and hopefully return to normal life. My mother didn't help with the financial part at all, most of my bills were close to collections and I ended up having to go into credit card debt to save my credit score from medical collections.

Unfortunately, only after 6 months of remission, the cancer came back. I would be going back to chemo and amputating my leg that the cancer was in.

I've been honest, telling my mother I wanted her to have no part in the financial aspect.

She's threatened to sue and remove me from her insurance. I've even tried compromising with her saying we could both be on the charitable account, gofundme, and any other sites used, of course with my direct supervison and joint ownership. But she's still upset and won't budge.

I'm tempted to take my recovery time between chemo to create an account at a financial institution myself, start a gofundme without her, and start a venmo as well. I know that will make her very upset though and I don't have the capabilities to handle her that way.

I (mid 20s) live with my brother, his SO (both early 30s), and a roommate (late 20s).
My brother and I tend to order a lot of packages out of everyone in the house, and I guess for him it gets confusing as to whose package belongs to whom because he has accidentally opened a package of mine before. The first instance of this happening was a couple months ago, and I wasn’t mad or upset (just mildly annoyed if anything) and I just brushed it off since I understand that accidents like that can easily happen, especially if you’re not paying attention.

But it happened again recently and while I still wasn’t mad about it, it was annoying that it happened a second time.

So I text him and ask why my package is open and he says he was expecting a package and that he had opened it “literally by accident 🙄.” I get that he apologized but his response rubbed me the wrong way and it didn’t seem like he cared. Instead of reacting emotionally, I figured it would be better to be firm but nice about what I was asking of him. So I respond with “if it isn’t too much to ask of you to do a quick glance at the label before you decide to open the package and make sure that it isn’t mine I would appreciate it.”

For some reason he took it as me being passive aggressive towards him and began questioning if there was something wrong with the package, and asked why I was making this a “big deal” when he “wasn’t trying to look through my stuff” (I didn’t even mention anything about that) and the fact that it’s only happened twice since I’ve been living with them (about a year).

Not understanding why he is giving me a hard time about it, I respond with “okay nvm, I guess this was too much to ask of you” and after that text, the rest of the messages escalate further to arguing. He tries to prove his point by saying that accidents like that happen, especially if you live with more people and that his SO has made the mistake of opening his stuff before. 

I didn’t understand the point he was trying to make since I’m not his SO nor have I ever discussed/consented to ever having my stuff opened by him and his SO has never had an issue with not touching or opening any of my packages. The roommate doesn’t have the same issue either so I don’t get why my brother can’t do the same as them and not open other people’s packages. 
The label on the package he opened is literally right next to where the box is taped on the front and that’s where it was opened so I’m not sure why he couldn’t take 2 seconds and check to make sure that that it wasn’t his before he decided otherwise. 

I didn’t think my request was too much to ask of him but maybe it was? Or maybe I went about it the wrong way (if so, lmk because idk what else I could’ve said).",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4823149,public,top,self,AITA for asking my brother to be more considerate when opening packages?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z45iod/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_be_more_considerate/,all_ads,6,,,,

I sat on his bed where he put his airpod pros and knocked them on the floor and the buds went flying out across his floor. I went to search for them and found the case and the right airpod and told him to play music so I can find the left one but he told me ""It doesn't matter. Just watch the movie."" 

Three weeks after that happened I went abroad to Asia and that's where I am currently and he just messaged me yesterday saying that he can't find the other airpod after searching extensively and feels bad but wants me to pay £80 to replace it with brand new ones (and when I come back in a month's time if I find them in his room then he would pay me back the money). I told him no, I will pay £50 to get him refurbished/used ones (with the previous stipulation) and also offered to let him to use my beat studio wireless 3 until I get back home to help him search and he refused.

There are a few reasons I am unwilling to pay for brand new ones:

1) Because he told me to stop searching for them when I first dropped them, we could've played music to locate them but now after so long they're obviously out of battery which I feel is on him.

2) He never mentioned this in the three weeks I was still in the UK before I left and thus I cannot verify how hard he has looked for them or search for them myself.

3) They are definitely in his room unless the airpod dropped into rubbish and then he threw the rubbish out in which case I feel he is responsible since he didn't seriously look for them when I wanted to.

4) I don't see the problem with using refurbished tech since my whole life I've always used second hand phones etc.

Me and Joe are really close and have known each other for 4 years so I doubt he is scamming me but I also did bring that up as a reason why I'm not going to pay for brand new ones when I'm gone and he got angry. R is on Joe's side but they're also together in person and closer generally.

Being my best friend, he tells me everything and I helping him out (ie telling him some things to say that will woo her). Eventually they start getting super close, but he doesn't have his license yet, so I am basically their chauffeur because neither of their parents think they are ready for a relationship yet.

We had discussed this prior and had decided to hold off on having kids at least until 5 years later when we were both set so I was sure we'd safely abort. I thought I'd just be there to comfort her and give her time to process what's happening.

3 weeks later she tells me she wants to keep it. I keep pleading with her telling her I'm not ready and were not going to be ok financially but she insists that this is what she wants and that we'll be happy. I firmly told her I was not on board and she responded saying it was her sole decision and she'd made up her mind. 

We decide to take a break from each other because of the constant fighting and eventually decide to part ways.

I speak with my parents about this and while i was initially planning to stay back and help raise the kid, they convince me that it's best if I leave the country. My father was a dual citizen of both the US and another country which I also inherited.

We spoke to multiple lawyers and knew that I would be untouchable by US courts and there weren't any enforceable child support treaties with that country. 

Last I heard, she had a successful pregnancy and was reaching out to all our mutual contacts to try and reach me. I only disclosed this to a few close friends who thankfully didn't share anything with her. 

I do sometimes wonder what it would've been  like to raise the child and I wish her well.

My playlist mainly consists of alternative rock, heavy rock, nu metal and similar genres and some of those have screamo and growls. I picked up my bf, his and cousin and gf and on the way, the gf told her boyfriend that she didn't like the music. I joked that's too bad since I'm the driver but I turned the volume down a bit in case they wanted to listen to their own music on their phones. But the gf wanted me to entirely skip the song because it gave her a headache so I thought fine, and the next 2 or 3 songs were a bit more mellow, before another heavy one played.  The gf then asked to change the playlist and my boyfriend also pleaded with me to change it or turn it off. I got really annoyed at this point and told them no, if they don't want to listen they can plug in their earphones and listen to their own music. They said they didn't bring any earphones or headphones to which I replied that wasn't my problem. The gf then asked me to stop and told her bf they just want to take a taxi. I was confused at first but let them out so they could get a different ride. My boyfriend was livid, asking why I couldn't even accommodate such a simple request and make them uncomfortable and that not everyone likes my music.

They had booked and decided everything already.   
It's a place I have visited twice already and they know that.

I decided last minute to join the trip because I have been feeling down, and wanting a change of environment. Plus it will be nice to celebrate that friend's birthday with her. 

The asshole part is this.

Today I told them I can join them, telling them NO PRESSURE, but I am available and can come out too...  they were both so happy and wanting me to join.

I asked for the flight details and hotel. 

I saw immediately some things I don't like.. 

For example, their flight involves a connection and I know they did that because it is cheaper. I hate connecting flights. I like nonstop, and would easily pay more for that especially for international travel.

So I will be booking my own separate flight for the same dates.

The other thing is.. the hotel. Their hotel is not up to my personal standards.

They wanted me share a room, like 2 queen beds and the sisters would share and I'd have my own bed. But  I personally like having my own space. I've shared with these girls before no issue, but one of my reasons for joining this trip is to give myself a vacation too.

I also don't like the area they picked to stay in. I know these friends would find it more 'fun' if we all stay at the same hotel and the same room too.

So would I be an asshole if I picked my own hotel even if it's in a different area, and a nicer hotel? and would I be the asshole for doing some things independently but also joining them on most of the other days? Some of the stuff they are doing I've done before because I've been to this place twice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid of being a 'mean' person or for making them feel bad by staying in a nicer hotel.. not staying with them etc. 

I know it's somewhat annoying as well, like at night when we have to split up.

I guess my reason for doing this was to get to experience a bit if solo travel, but also have the training wheels o friends nearby, and then to celebrate my friend's birthday and spend time with her and her sister.

To me it seems reasonable, but talking to my siblings, one agrees with me and the other thinks its mean.

My mother (54F) left My father and I(27F) when I was about 8 for another man in a different country. She never kept in touch until I was 16. Never visited, Never wrote letters, not a single means off contact. So, naturally, when she came back into my life, I asked her why she left and never looked back. She would always tell me how my father's side of the family stone walled her. How my father was abusive and how the mentally tortured her. How she tried contacting me, but they never allowed it. The thing is, I have lived with my Grandma all my life. She raised me. She's the sweetest person and puts everyone before herself. My father? I know he's not perfect, but when it came to me, he always put me first, even if he had nothing in his pockets to give me. He made every effort to be there for all my first like concerts, graduation, boyfriends, etc. I was brought up in a very stable home by a single dad, loving aunts and uncles(who treated me like their own child) and my grandma who was more of a mom to me than my mother. But since I've spoken to her, she has always looked down on them and me for staying in India and told me to move. She constantly says things which triggers me to snap back and defend my family and it ends in arguments. Recently I had forgotten her birthday. I immediately texted her the next day apologizing and asking if we could get on a call. She didn’t respond for a week and when she did, her text said this wasn’t the first time I hadn’t wished her(true, but whenever her birthday would come by we would never be in touch because of some fight). It is not the act of not wishing her but shows a deeper issue that I dont care or I dont have values. If these simple things I can forget after being reminded (her current husband had reminded me a week before) then I can imagine how you deal with both your professional and personal life. This set me off and I’ll admit, I called her out for being a shitty mom and not being present in my life and those words were so uncalled for. I never used any foul language. Just told her it was rich coming from her. She then proceeded to tell me how venomous I am and considering what her and her husband have at stake, she would like to know now if she needs to cut me off. I told her I’ve been telling her this for a long time. I didn’t want to keep in touch because all of it seemed so toxic. She then told me this is the end and I should not dare to contact her husband(I never did. He would always email me to mend the bond between the two of us and I would tell him I wish them the best but I couldn’t with the way she acted). I’ll admit, Ive been stubborn and refused to forgive her since she never asked for forgiveness. But AITA for cutting off ties with her?

Here's what happened. I had a friend who was about to give her German shepherd up to the animal shelter. She got it because one of her friends gave it to her and then vanished. He was about 3 years old and very large. This dog was a problem dog, specifically if it saw any other animal it would hurt it. But around all people the dog was loyal and friendly. They loved that dog and if they gave it up the dog would be euthanized because of the incidents. So I offered to take in the dog and try my hardest to train him. My family and I took him in and instantly he became a family member. We got him specialized dog food just for him, built a large dog door, and spent most of our time loving him and keeping him safe. 

One day my kids take him for a walk and he sees another dog walk across the street. He runs off, drags my kid down, and immediately hurts the other dog. I was able to get him off and we had to be limited on his walks. My kids are only scratched up though but they aren't allowed to walk him so it's up to me. A month later he sees my neighbor's chickens and pulls out of his harness and hurts the chicken permanently.

The next time he does it was when I was trying to walk him alone, but another neighbor's Frenchie got out and he hurt him. This time I try to pry him off but he hurts my hand and I have to go to the emergency room. I now have permanent nerve damage in my hand but still I am trying.

Over the next few months we try out hardest to temper him, we get fitted collars, we employ training we found online, I even try to start a GoFundMe to get him special obedience training. But he kept finding ways to either slip out of his harness or find a way out of the yard  But the final time he did it was when he was outside. He saw the same dog he hurts the first time and he finds a way to jump over my fence and hurts it again. It was then that the owner threatened to sue and call the police. I was so scared but I called my friend and told them that I was going to give him up to a pound. I couldn't risk legal action against me because I can't afford it considering I still have to pay off my emergency room bill from my hand injury. But instead my friend took him back and told me she'd try to get him to a nk shelter.

Afterwards she asks me for money to help with the fees. I tell her I can't yet but I will try. After that she blocks me for some reason that I was never told. Cut to 5 months later. I finally find a way to contact her, she tells me that my dog was given up and put down. She tells me she and her family was devastated and that it was my fault. That I didn't fulfill my promise to keep him. Now I'm incredibly sad for losing my dog like that, but he definitely had problems and I don't blame the shelter for putting him down. But now it's my fault? Please tell me if I did the right thing. Was it my fault that he had to be put down?

We'll call her Friend #1. She was my closest friend and I became close with her friend group to the point where we would all spend time together often. It truly felt like I was a part of their friend group. They were my people.

As years passed. They got a little more secretive and exclusive. I didn't see them as much as they would often spend time without me (I am a gay man in a group of 3 straight women and 1 lesbian woman... I would say the dynamic was pretty balanced). I understand girl's night type situations, which is totally fine, but i started to notice was getting left out of things. As Friend #1 got more distant, I got extremely close with the lesbian one who is now my closest friend (Friend #2). In the meantime Friend #1 wouldn't answer my texts and I almost never heard from her.

This past Halloween they all went out together without me, which was a stab in the chest for me. Nobody thought to invite me? I told friend #2 about how I felt and she agreed that I should end the friendship with the rest of them. Friend #2 also didn't invite me to Halloween because she already knew how I felt about the rest of the girls. I took them all off of my social media.

Friend #1 reached out to me tonight for thanksgiving saying she's thinking about me and wants to take me out for my birthday this Sunday. I wished her a happy thanksgiving and told her I was booked out for my birthday (which is half true). I also didn't tell her that I didn't want to continue the friendship anymore. Is this something I should've reconsidered and maybe given her a second chance to be a better friend?

We biked over to a clothing and surf shop chain store that was one of the few places open today. ""We"" includes me, my identical twin sister named Zara (fake name), and our dad. The shop had a rack of loungewear items that were a ""buy 1 get 1 free"" deal. Zara and I pick out or items and go to pay. 

We go up to the counter together and place our items on the counter. The little scanner thing to swipe your card is on the other side of a big computer screen that shows what exactly you're purchasing, but I can't see the counter from that view. The screen and the employee, who is a young woman in her mid-twenties, prompt me to insert my card. Now, I can't see the counter, so I have no idea that she hasn't scanned the other item and put in the discount. I mean, she's already prompting me to pay. So I pay and my sister and I go to take our items. The employee tells us to wait and asks if we were checking out together. I mean, I thought it was obvious because we put our items on the counter together and are very obviously sisters. She then tells us that, since the store doesn't do returns (exchange only), we can only take the one item because she didn't scan the other and process the discount. 

I don't like to confront or be rude to employees (I know retail sucks), so I call my dad over. He's instantly on the employee and a little more aggressive than I thought he should be. However, the employee doesn't seem to want to solve any problem and would rather get us out of the store. She goes to get her manager, who has a similar sour and flippant attitude. Fortunately, the manager does fix the issue and we got our items. My dad rips a little on her too, though.

His sister “Lisa” (27F) is a single mom to her 3 year old son, “Milo”. Lisa’s baby daddy “Freddy” (31M) makes quite a lot of money and as a result she gets quite a lot of child support. A substantial portion of the child support payment is to cover Milo’s daycare costs as that is quite expensive in our area. 

Recently I found out Lisa games the system and “double dips” because she works at Milo’s daycare so he gets free tuition but she still collects the portion of child support meant for daycare costs. She justifies it by saying that she would make way more money working somewhere else and Freddy has to pay the daycare portion of the child support no matter how much she makes. 

This rubs me the wrong way because Lisa clearly doesn’t use all the child support money on Milo. She makes $17/hr at the daycare but she also has a $120/month gym membership and spends about the same amount monthly on spin classes. The math just doesn’t add up. In the same conversation she will talk about how hard it is to be a single mother and then flaunt how much child support she gets. Freddy knows that she is doing this but hasn’t said anything because he doesn’t want to cause more drama.

I don’t think it’s right for Lisa to be taking advantage of Freddy and the system like this and I’m considering reporting her to the state for fraud. I’m feeling torn though because if she were convicted it would make it much harder for her to find employment and possibly make life harder for Milo. At the same time I feel like she should be taught a lesson and not be ruining it for other single mothers out there who actually use child support money for their children.

I know the title might sound bad but please stay for the information. 

2 years ago, around October of 2020, we found a dog running around our front yard. 

We brought the dog in, posted on all of the neighborhood sites to look for the owner, posted fliers, and took the dog to the shelter to test for a microchip (none) &amp; (no collar) but we heard nothing. 

I've heard a lot of horror stories about animals that get brought into shelters and the animal lover in me just couldn't take her to one. We (my husband and I) knew that she had to be owned by someone because of how well behaved she is. We tried from October 2020- June 2021 to find her owner, but no luck. (at this point we essentially stopped looking.)

Fast forward to recently, October 2022, and I get a phone call. A woman on the other end asked me if I had a black dog, (the dog I found is black), I asked who was calling and the call ended. I did not really think anything of it until I received a notice of court summons at my front door the other day. The paperwork says that I stole someone's dog. This confused the hell out of me because I had posted fliers everywhere and no one had reached out to claim her. The court date is set for January, but I wanted to ask before then, Am I the asshole for keeping the dog? And why didn't anyone reach out to me about finding her to ask for her back?

My boyfriend (22M) told me (21F) that for his birthday he would like for us to have a threesome. I was cool with the idea but we both came to the agreement that it would have to be someone we had both decided on and were comfortable with.

I confided with my friend (21F) that we were wanting to do this and she kept volunteering herself. She would “joke” about how we should do it with her, and would always say things like “I’m down” or bring the topic up with little to no initiation. It got to the point where I talked to her about it and said that my boyfriend and I were not comfortable with it.
 
On November 3rd, we had been hanging out with her and said that we needed to finish off the liquor we had leftover from the Halloween party we had thrown. She volunteered to help us and began drinking heavily and somewhat irresponsibly. We drank with her and she was very persistent in getting us to take shots. My boyfriend and I had taken many shots of Smirnoff and got pretty drunk, and my friend was completely wasted from the heavy drinking she had been doing. She asked us if she could stay the night at our place and we agreed. 

As my boyfriend and I got ready for bed, she came into the bathroom and said that she had a proposal. She said that we should have a threesome like my boyfriend had been wanting for his birthday. She explained that this was the perfect environment for it to occur. My boyfriend and I said that we needed a few minutes to think about it even though we had decided we were uncomfortable while sober. Drunken, we came to the conclusion that we would see how it went.
 
Once it commenced, my friend undressed and started to touch me. Straight away, I could feel that I wasn’t okay. My boyfriend looked to me and I knew that he felt the same. Before it went further, I told her to stop. She began crying after I said this, saying that she felt rejected. The room went silent and became uncomfortable. I sobered up and it hit me that she may have been using this situation as a way to take advantage of us and to get her way. Politely, I asked her to leave and purchased an Uber for her.

After this, I didn’t text her for about a week. She texted me asking if things were okay between us. I simply told her that I felt she had taken advantage of my boyfriend and I and that she had possibly premeditated what happened. She read my texts but did not respond. 

Yesterday, she texted and said that I was insane to think she had taken advantage. She said she was drunker, we agreed to it, and supplied the alcohol.

""You're the love of my life""

""I knew from the moment I first touched you""

""I'll see you soon""

He then went overseas for a ""business"" trip that lasted around two months. I spent the time trying to figure out my best course of action, which I determined was to confront him when he returned.

What ended up happening was he denied everything. It went so far as to me telling him to look me in the eyes and promise me he didn't cheat on my mother, which he obliged. I, however, didn't believe him one bit. 

I woke up the next morning to my mother crying and screaming at my father. I assumed that he realized how much shit he was in and finally confessed, but it turns out that my mother found another woman's hair all over my father's clothes, and even still he initially tried to deny it, until eventually admitting to his actions.

My mother told me after some reflection that she loves my father too much, and plans to stay with him. Although I didn't agree with this sentiment, I kept quiet and supported her fully. Since that night where I confronted him, I haven't said a word to my father. My mother wants that to change, but I couldn't, and still can't do it. My father lied to my face, and I have the strong belief that he is still withholding information. He told my mother the affair was a spur of the moment thing, yet the phone call I overheard which he continues to deny remembering makes me believe that this was premeditated. He admitted to my mother that he has a drinking problem (which we were both well aware of), and that he is going to attend AA meetings. I think this was done solely to gain sympathy from my mother, as one of the first things he did when he came home was crack open a beer. Also, he texted me apologizing for lying to my face, claiming he wanted to tell my mother first. This is BS because he only told my mother after she confronted him. Plus, the day he returned (before I confronted him), he made reservations for my mom's birthday dinner. If I was going to admit to my wife I had an affair, I'd cease all planning and prepare for the worst. Not to mention he came home acting like how he did after all his other business trips.

All in all, my mom sees a man who feels remorse and wants to change. I see a man who was caught and is frantically trying to reconstruct the pieces he shattered. I see my mom as blinded by love, unable to see (what I interpret as), my father's true colors. I worry that my mom sees me as a bitter son who refuses to let bygones be bygones and isn't allowing the rift between my family to heal.

I (21 F) and my boyfriend (22 M) had been planning an anniversary Disneyland trip for the past 6 months. We planned a 4 day trip, Wednesday through Saturday, and we had both asked for the time off way in advance. Everything went well until the end of the first day in Disney, Thursday. He sheepishly tells me that we need to talk about Saturday (the day we were supposed to be leaving/going to the beach.) Side note about my boyfriend; he works 2 jobs, one as manager and another as a middle school basketball coach. He proceeds to tells me that his parent's texted him that the coach that was supposed to cover his team for the weekend has been fired and he needs to be back in time for the game on Saturday morning at 10 am or the girls wont get to play. Needless to say, I am floored and I ask why they were going back on his approved time off. I have always felt that when someone requests time off, they shouldn't be bothered with anything work related until they are back. I'm reasonably upset about the news and I'm ashamed to admit that there were a few tears involved. He gets upset with me and tells me that I know that this is important to him and the girls on the team need him and I just need to accept it. He tells me that I have no right to be ""this upset"" about this and at that point, I just shut down. I was upset because of the money we had put down on the room, of our trip being cut short by a day, and because I felt that he was putting this part time coaching gig over our relationship. This was our first big trip together and I just felt that the romance behind it was ruined now. He felt that I shouldn't be upset over things that are out of his control and I should just get over it since I was ""overreacting"". I feel like he is gaslighting me but I also know that he dreams of being a coach full time and it's probably wrong of me to make him put his dreams over me. Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong for being upset and ruining our trip with my bad attitude, so am I the a\*hole?

Side note: His parent's dislike me with a passion and have made it clear that they want their son with someone better.

Basically, I believe that my partner being invited as a friend to our annual Xmas dinner is homophobia. However, my mom thinks that my family is NOT homophobic, and that I'm TA for upsetting my aunt and family. Here is the situation:

I (18F) have been with my partner (19F) for 2 years. I'm invited to her family's Xmas dinner as her girlfriend. My partner is very close with my parents, but hasn't been allowed to attend any family functions. Normally, Xmas is hosted at my Aunt's house. I asked if I could bring my partner, and here is her message:

""Im happy to have \[partner's name\] come. It would be great ! \[Cousin's name\] thinks she is your best friend. But I’m not sure if we are ready to tell her that you are a couple. We will tell her in due time for sure ! But everyone else i the family knows for sure and we are happy to have her there and be a part of the family""

To be clear, I have absolutely no issue with my aunt! I don't want to force anything that makes her family uncomfortable. For context, her daughter is 12 (grade 7) and they don't feel comfortable with her knowing that I am queer (but she does know what that means).

I said thank you and have let my mom know that I will attend Xmas with my partner's family, as they don't ask us to pretend to be friends (even with her 11 and 14 year old step-siblings).

My mom says that it has nothing to do with my partner's gender, and it would be the same if she was a man. She had to hide her boyfriends growing up and also wasn't allowed to bring them to family functions. Also, my mom says that if my partner were a boy, we would not be allowed to have sleepovers under her roof. However, I have broken that rule with my girlfriend and so am actually getting more leniency due to her gender.

I agree about the sleepovers. However, it seems to me that my aunt was suggesting it was because of our genders, and not because of being in a relationship. My mom's exact words were: ""I know it must be so hard to hide something from a kid that is not mature enough to understand"" (referring to my cousin). I also think that this may be homophobia because we have had many arguments in the past about my sexuality.

I told my aunt that I wouldn't be attending (because of scheduling conflicts) and my mom says that she is heartbroken. She has texted me saying that she's crying. My mom thinks that I am TA in this situation and that we should just attend as friends, but my partner and her dad say that it's my choice. I know that this isn't outright homophobia and that I am very lucky to have a supportive family that wants to meet her. AITA?

I am Ok with him doing so if he is on his leash, but they just let him roam free and while he is older he can be a speedy bugger and vanish in 2 seconds if you take your eyes off him. We also recently moved to a new house, out the back is a nature reserve and in front a main road, so extra level of anxiety because he is a dumbass country cat &amp; will get run over or caught in pest control trap. I'm also not 100% but I'm pretty sure there are laws in place to encourage people to keep cats inside(mostly) so more anxiety.  When I tried bringing up my concerns with my mum she called me a dictator and that if I'm so concerned I should take over 100% of his care, which I'm happy to do(and was doing while we stayed at a friends place for a while looking for homes) she just does it because its more convenient for her to do it her way and gets angry when someone wants to do something themselves.

I feel like I'm constantly being undermined with my pets health and wellbeing and told I'm overreacting, but all of my pets have lived beyond their predicted lifespans, I know I can potentially get 7 more years with him if I treat him well and do the right things. I love my cat so so much and the thought of him dying because of their negligence is beyond heartbreaking, especially since he is the last of my childhood pets(the others passing away from old age when I turned 17&amp;22).

My friend (f 20s) has been hung up on her ex bf (m 30s) for months now. Long story short, they were the toxic couple that were always arguing and getting jealous of one another. Although she broke up with him for her own well being, she still can’t stop talking about him as if one day they will get back together. I (f 30s) have tried my best to be a supportive friend, but considering what I remember of their relationship and the stuff he put her through, I’ve always encouraged her to seek therapy and move on from him. 

Today she called me to talk about some work events coming up for us. (We all work in the same industry, thus avoiding her ex tends to be really difficult.) She has mentioned in passing how she’s scared to run into him at said events, and she says that he’s been trying to text her just to make conversation. Every time he’s done this in the past, it opens up a whole new can of worms where she takes him back, things are cupcakes and butterflies for awhile, and then he starts lying and mistreating her again until they break up again. 

My roommate (m 30s) also works in the same industry and has just worked on a project with my friends ex bf. He informed me that my friends ex is now dating a new girl that she has met before and is also in our industry. This comes only a couple days after my friend told me that her ex had texted her again trying to make conversation. So when my friend brought up her ex in conversation, I told her “You know he’s dating someone new, right?” She was quiet on her end before replying “You shouldn’t have told me that. Don’t tell me those things.” The line was quiet again before she decided to end the conversation and hang up. 

Now I’m sitting here wondering if I’d overstepped in telling her that info, or if I was doing what a good friend would do.

My partner had set a precedent before we ever got together to make the tooth fairy extra special with $2 bills and half dollars etc. Today the 11 year old lost a tooth. On a holiday. So nothing is open. I suggest that we ask for a coin from my mom who we cohabitate with (she can afford a house, we can't, thank you economy and housing market). My partner has given me permission to be the tooth fairy for the first time ever.

I ask my mom about it, she says she'll look and message me.

A little later...

""I can’t find any Kennedy halves (the coins in the sock). I have a dollar in quarters you can have.""

I ask if I can help her look.

""No.""

I go downstairs and I explain the significance of it needing to be more than quarters.

She allows me to look. I go through all the possible places it might be in her walk-in closets, yes, two. I am losing hope.

That's when I find a silver dollar in a drawer at the bottom of a little white wooden basket. I ask her about it. It wasn't in the lock box, must be okay to part with.

She's unwilling to part with it.

We talk, I don't understand why it's more important for her to keep it in a drawer than to go to an 11 year old who would cherish it just as much. Sentimental things like this should be passed down generations.

I asked what she was going to do with the coins. She said when she died they would go to me and I could do whatever I wanted to with them then.

So why didn't she want the coin going to the girl?

She just didn't want to give it to her.

Finally, in exasperation, she says to just take them. Give them all to her.

I don't want to bequeath one of her coins like that though. I want her to understand that allowing an 11 year old to receive this coin from the tooth fairy will be much more meaningful than sitting in a drawer, forgotten.

I understand that it is sentimental to my mom. I understand why she doesn't want to part with it. I just don't understand why she is unwilling to compromise to help her son on his first day as the tooth fairy and make a meaningful moment out of a single coin to a young girl.

She ended up begrudgingly giving me the silver dollar I found to give to her. But in a way that it felt like stealing.

The gallery is run by an older (mid-50’s) married couple who are a bit hippie-dippie granola. The husband is very goofy and loves to make puns and will usually sit down and shoot the shit for a while. The wife is a bit more serious and will come along and shoo us back to work. The gallery is a fantastic place to work and I genuinely care for my bosses and coworkers: when I was a teen I spent every hour I could working here and my bosses treat me almost as if I was a child of their own.

The Bosses have an old blind lab that they let wander the gallery. He usually curls up to sleep under our desk, but he sometimes will follow you around. I noticed he often follows me when I vacuum. About a month ago I was goofing around and playing with him while I was cleaning: I put on one of the brush attachments and “groomed” his back. Dog loved it! He immediately rolled over and began wiggling around, and I vacuumed his belly. His tail was wagging like there was no tomorrow! So, the next few days, I always spared a few minutes to vacuum the dog.

About two weeks ago, Mr. Boss walked in on me vacuuming the dog. He got a kick out of it and immediately took over and began vacuuming his dog. He spent the rest of the afternoon chuckling and giggling and coming over to the desk to reminisce about all things Dog. When his wife (Mrs. Boss) came over to ask what was so funny this time, Mr. Boss shushed me and said it was a secret. Mrs. Boss rolled her eyes and just told us to get back to work.

Mr. Boss has kept the vacuuming a secret from her since he found out. He has acted like him and I have this big secret and he will make exaggerated motions to pull me close and whisper in my ear, stage acting as his wife goes by like “Oh no, darling! You mustn’t hear this!”  Mr. Boss joins me after my lunch break every day and we spend a serious 15 minutes grooming Dog. Whenever Mrs. Boss walks by while we are doing this I immediately swap to vacuuming the actual floor and Mr. Boss starts whistling and acting all suspicious.

So, Mrs. Boss has begun sending me raised eyebrows and questioning looks because this secret joke of her husband’s has begun to go on too long. Today she lingered quietly in the doorway watching us and when I met her eyes there was a pretty heavy mood. I don’t want to say that she thinks Mr. Boss and I are having an affair, because that is a pretty huge leap to make, but it is also the kind of logical leap to make because Mr. Boss has always been pretty touchy-feely (think arms around shoulders, greeting you with a hug, huddling up close to whisper the worst jokes you have ever heard in your life) and we have been acting suspicious whenever she walks in.

I want to just tell Mrs. Boss that nothing bad is going on, that we are just vacuuming the dog, but Mr. Boss said he would add a bonus into my paycheck at the end of the month if I don’t tell her.

P and I lived together in college and she got pregnant while we were together, so obviously i’m closure to her and her kid.

H’s son, thanks to her constantly encouraging his terrible behavior is just rude and mean to everyone.

Tonight (thanksgiving)- we’ve finished eating and we’re playing games, H son loses to P son in uno several times. he throws a fit, went into his room. P son felt bad for upsetting his cousin, follows up and tries to apologize for winning, H son pushes him out and locks the door.

Since I work 2 jobs, I decided to split my availability in two.  I work at my other job Monday-Wednesday and I work at the restaurant from Friday-Sunday.  My managers at the restaurant I work at were super accommodating when I told them I was getting another job.  They asked if I wanted to make any changes to my hour, so I requested to work mornings on Sundays.  They decided that I could take the 10am-3pm shift every Saturday and Sunday.  This worked out because I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and the consistency helps me.  So for the past 2 months those have been my shifts.  

Last night, when the schedule for next week was released, a coworker who I’ll Anna (F20) messaged me and asked if I’d be willing to switch my Saturday 10-3 shift for her 4pm-8pm.  She said it was because my shift would give her more hours and she also forgot to book it off and has an important dinner that night.  I responded that I’d prefer to keep my shift and apologized to her.  Anna and I aren’t friends and didn’t feel comfortable telling her that it was mostly because of my anxiety.

Anna apparently didn’t appreciate that answer.  She asked if I had plans or something and I said that I might but it doesn’t change my answer.  She then told me she would go to one of the managers and get them to change the schedule, which they won’t do since the schedule has already been released and they only change it if both people agree to trade or give away/take a shift.  I reminded her of that, but she just left the message on seen.

I sat on his bed where he put his airpod pros and knocked them on the floor and the buds went flying out across his floor. I went to search for them and found the case and the right airpod and told him to play music so I can find the left one but he told me ""It doesn't matter. Just watch the movie."" 

Three weeks after that happened I went abroad to Asia and that's where I am currently and he just messaged me saying that he can't find the other airpod after searching extensively and (feels bad) but wants me to pay £80 to replace it with brand new ones (and when if I come back in a months time and find them in his room then he would pay me back the money). I told him no I will pay £50 to get him refurbished ones (with the previous stipulation) and also offered to let him to use my beat studio wireless 3 until I get back home to help him search and he refused.

There are a few reasons I am unwilling to pay for brand new ones:

1) Because he told me to stop searching for them when I first dropped them, we could've played music to locate them but now after so long they're obviously out of battery which I feel is on him.

2) He never mentioned this in the three weeks I was still in the UK before I left and thus I cannot verify how hard he has looked for them or search for them myself.

3) They are definitely in his room unless the airpod dropped into rubbish and then he threw the rubbish out in which case I feel he is responsible since he didn't seriously look for them when I wanted to.

4) I don't see the problem with using refurbished tech since my whole life I've always used second hand phones etc.

Me and J are really close and have known each other for 4 years so I doubt he is scamming me but I also did bring that up as a reason why I'm not going to pay for brand new ones when I'm gone and he got really angry. R is on J's side but they're also together in person and closer generally.

But that’s stopped only a couple weeks ago because my mother has allowed my brothers girlfriend to spend the nights at our house when my brother is at work. When I lived at home my boyfriend was given the rule that is I leave the house he leaves. So After several arguments of them trying to make me feel crazy for seeing the difference in treatment I decided to cut contact. There was a thanksgiving last week at my Gma’s house and I went only for her. Mother had spun lies to my Gpa and he refused to talk to me or my BF. (She has a history of painting me as the bad guy to him) she texted me the day before today begging me to come to her thanksgiving and I told her I would not be. 
    Flash forward today I’m being breaded with messages and I decided to give it a shot at going. ( I know) I got there and the whole family was leaving because we were late due to being at my BF’s dads dinner. My cat 17 year old cat came out of hiding to see me because people had left and my brothers GF took her from me. I was pissed and kept quiet. They started a movie and her younger brother (9) talked the whole time. (Was asking me questions like who was I and why was I there) brother ended up turning on the lights and started putting together his new gun because he ordered it all in pieces. I had enough I very politely said that We had more places to visit ( I didn’t ) and left. I knew mom could tell but I couldn’t stand the way that they paint me as the bad guy for noticing the difference in treatment of our relationships.  I know tomorrow my mom is going spin it to everyone that I left because of being annoyed for bo reason but I couldn’t even hold my own very elderly cat.

I had a friend who was about to give her German shepherd up to the animal shelter. She got it because one of her friends gave it to her and then vanished. He was about 3 years old and very large. This dog was a problem dog, specifically if it saw any other animal it would attack it. But around all people the dog was loyal and friendly. They loved that dog and if they gave it up the dog would be euthanized because of the attacks. So I offered to take in the dog and try my hardest to train him. My family and I took him in and instantly he became a family member. We got him specialized dog food just for him, built a large dog door, and spent most of our time loving him and keeping him safe. 

One day my kids take him for a walk and he sees another dog walk across the street. He runs off, drags my kid down, and immediately draws blood on the other dog. I was able to get him off and we had to be limited on his walks. My kids are only scratched up though but they aren't allowed to walk him so it's up to me. A month later he sees my neighbor's chickens and pulls out of his harness and kills the chicken.

The next time he does it was when I was trying to walk him alone, but another neighbor's Frenchie got out and he attacked him. This time I try to pry him off but he bites my hand and I have to go to the emergency room. I now have permanent nerve damage in my hand but still I am trying.

Over the next few months we try out hardest to temper him, we get fitted collars, we employ training we found online, I even try to start a GoFundMe to get him special obedience training. But he kept finding ways to either slip out of his harness or find a way out of the yard  But the final time he did it was when he was outside. He saw the same dog he drew blood on the first time and he finds a way to jump over my fence and attacks again, drawing blood again. It was then that the owner threatened to sue and call the police. I was so scared but I called my friend and told them that I was going to give him up to a pound. I couldn't risk legal action against me because I can't afford it considering I still have to pay off my emergency room bill from my hand injury. But instead my friend took him back and told me she'd try to get him to a no kill shelter.

Afterwards she asks me for money to help with the fees. I tell her I can't yet but I will try. After that she blocks me for some reason that I was never told. Cut to 5 months later. I finally find a way to contact her, she tells me that my dog was given up and put down. She tells me she and her family was devastated and that it was my fault. That I didn't fulfill my promise to keep him alive. Now I'm incredibly sad for losing my dog like that, but he definitely had problems and I don't blame the shelter for putting him down. But now it's my fault? Please tell me if I did the right thing. Was it my fault that he had to be put down?

We do a lot of awesome over-the-top themed parties, especially birthdays. It is glorious and I love it.

Yesterday I got a Facebook invitation to an awesome themed Christmas party...but it's on my birthday. There is no mention of it being my birthday on the event. I was really hurt.

I've known the main party planner for 6 years and have had 2 birthday parties with this group of friends, one was just last year! I can forgive someone for forgetting a birthday, but if you are planning an event at least remembering what month it was and checking to make sure the party wasn't the same day.... I was going to send out invites to my own birthday gathering for that day, but hadn't let anyone know yet. I definitely can't now since there is already something going on then.

I always feel on the outside in social groups, my whole life. I don't know what it is that I do wrong. I know this friend group does stuff together without inviting me, I try not to let that get to me. But a whole party ignoring my birthday completely? I always try to get nice gifts and bring food to other people's birthdays. It hurts to see people not care that much about me.

I messaged the party planner that the event was on my birthday and that I wasn't upset, I just wanted to let her know. That was yesterday and she hasn't replied. I really enjoy spending time with these people, they mean a lot to me. 

I don't even know if I should go. If I do, it could be really awkward since it would be obvious that they all forgot about me. Or, no one would care at all and I would feel even more hurt. I could just skip it, but I don't like making big statements like that. I don't want to attendees to think I'm mad at them for forgetting too. I'm not even sure how the situation can be fixed. I guess the planner could make a small mention that it's my birthday and there will be a cake?  I hate feeling selfish and greedy. It's not that I want anyone to make a big deal about me at all.

Aside from minor squabbles, we get along well.

Gina spent three years telling me what a terrible person her ex-boyfriend Jon (M28) is. Example: he told Gina he was single when he wasn’t and his girlfriend walked in on him and Gina in bed. Gina also once stated that Jon “arguably messed \[her\] up more than \[her\] abuser”.

So I’m ill-disposed to think well of Jon. Two years ago, Jon was in a relationship with Chloe and he started chatting with Gina. This upset Chloe so she asked him to stop and sent some nasty messages to Gina. 

A couple months ago, Jon sent Gina a message apologizing for letting Chloe convince him to cut contact and said that he and Chloe weren’t working out.

Gina told me this and my reaction was like “Pssht, boy bye” but she said that she had responded to him. Jon also told her that Chloe was crazy, may have poisoned his cat and that she was abusive. I expressed that I thought her getting back to together with him was a bad idea, but she brushed it off and I didn’t push it.

Two weeks later, Jon and the Chloe got into a fight and they broke up. Immediately Gina went from saying they were just friends to saying that she and him “were probably going to get back together” but that he had to sort his life out. Less than a week after that, while he was still living with his now ex-GF, Gina started talking about how Jon was coming for Thanksgiving.

Since the house is small and the walls are thin, I asked if I needed to purchase noise-cancelling headphones. She was thrilled that I thought they might be having getting physical but tried to disguise it by acting shocked. She said that I “definitely” didn’t need headphones, that it “isn’t like that”. Also, because Chloe was abusive, Jon would have to go to therapy before Gina would consider getting physical with him. Then she got an implanted birth control device and told me that Jon would be sleeping with her instead of the guest room as originally planned.

Every time Gina brought Jon up, I changed the subject and she questioned why I was acting like I wouldn’t be there. I told her that I would not be interacting with Jon. 

When Gina asked me to elaborate, I said I’m not going to be around a bad person. She pressed me on why I thought that so I listed the things she had told me, and that he lined up his next GF before he broke up with his previous one and he’s coming here even though he still lives with Chloe. 

Gina told me that overlapping relationships are normal. She even said that asking about getting headphones was a really disrespectful question. I asked her what she thought the right thing for me to do was but she couldn’t answer me. 

I told her that I choose who I associate with and that I wouldn’t talk about Jon positively, negatively, or neutrally anymore but I’ve made clear that I’m not trying to get in the way of this relationship. She keeps calling me childish but I want to keep my boundaries.

I’m so conflicted about this and I don’t really know if I’m in the wrong. 

When I (22M) was 15, we found out that my dad (42M) had been cheating on my mom with a man, this was a surprise since my dad was the most homophobic jerk you could’ve met, he left my mom and divorced her because “ he wanted to be authentic to himself”, it was a really hard time for me and my siblings (15M, 13M ages today), remember I grew up with this homophobic background installed in my head by my own father so I was disgusted, he tried to apologized but I said hurtful things to him, I even told him that he was dead to me because I was embarrassed to have “fg \*ss” father, I deeply regret those things now specially since I’m bisexual and have a bf. You could tell my dad was deeply hurt by what I said. 

He ended up moving out of the country with his lover (To Germany, his AP’s native land) and we barely talked after that, he invited my siblings to spend Christmas with him but never me, he sent them plane tickets to go but I was ignored, I kind of understood since we had a huge argument before he left so I let it go, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t hurt since I was being ignored by my own father. Last year (for Christmas) He posted a photo of him, his AP, my siblings and a child they have, under the caption: “My family is complete, no missing piece” that hurt as hell. 

We had been NC this whole time until a couple of weeks ago when he called me telling me that he wanted us to reconcile so he thought it’d be a great idea if I could come (to his house, in Europe) for Xmas to talk about our relationship, he also offered to pay for my bf’s ticket, so I didn’t feel alone and vulnerable but I told him he should keep that money to spend it on his real family, since he made it clear last year on his post that I wasn’t part of that family, he called me AH for treating him like that knowing that I hurt him first. Yes I know that while he was trying to apologize and make me understand the situation I said many nasty and insulting homophobic things but I was a literal child dealing with the divorce and a parent coming out plus I was homophobic because that’s the way I was raised and he was the adult and the “No missing piece” was the fcking cherry on the top. 

My grandma says that I should understand that this is perhaps the first time he feels safe to invite me and not being insulted (he just found out I have a bf), she says I was too rude to say “Your real family”.

Currently, my husband (35M) and I are at my in-laws’ house across the country for Thanksgiving and I unfortunately came down with RSV a few days after arriving. It’s basically a cold, but it has knocked me out a bit, so I’ve mostly been holed up in the guest room in bed. 

As some background: my in-laws and I are not close, especially following a big fight this time last year. Generally, they see me as inflexible and too quiet (probably fair, in some cases) and I see them as unwelcoming. For years I felt like I was constantly begging for their approval and acceptance, but since the fight last year, I’ve “dropped the rope” as I’ve seen it said and now it’s pleasantries, not much else.

Yesterday, after doing early prep on the stock, my husband came up to ask me if I wanted some of the extra stock mixed with rice for lunch. He knows I’m usually not a big soup person (relevant), but broth and rice sounded pretty good, so I said yes. However, a good 30 minutes later, my MIL brought it up (which alone caught me off-guard because I was gross/sick/in my pajamas), the broth and rice also had tons of cilantro, onions, and fresh ginger swimming in it — the kind of texture stuff that makes me hate most soups. I still thanked her, of course, and said nothing about the expectation discrepancy, but I noticed she frowned as she walked away. 

After she left, I picked all the extra stuff out of it and just ate the broth and rice. This was also difficult because she had added vinegar and lemon juice to the broth, which aren’t flavors I like. In all, it was disappointing because I was looking forward to a simple meal of plain broth and rice. I know that probably sounds boring to a lot of people, but it’s what was offered to me and it was what I wanted, especially while sick and away from home in a place I’ve never felt comfortable.

But when my husband came to pick up the tray, he basically said I was the AH because no one would ever think an offer of brother and rice would be JUST broth and rice, but also because I “made a face” at his mom, both when she walked in and when I looked at the soup. (I don’t recall doing this, but it’s possible. I’m bad at schooling my face.) He said his mom wold be hurt again by seeing all the leftover ingredients and I asked him why he didn’t tell her I don’t like soup with a lot of “stuff” in it. He said it didn’t matter because it was still a gesture from her, and it looks like I pettily rejected it. 

Basically, he thinks I could have/should have been a lot more gracious and grateful, even if it wasn’t exactly what I wanted… which is, to be fair, something I’ve heard a lot in my life. But at the same time, I felt like I was offered something very simple (broth + rice) but instead got handed yet another social minefield, only this time when I feel like crap too.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4822985,public,top,self,AITA for being “ungrateful” for MIL’s soup?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z43yc7/aita_for_being_ungrateful_for_mils_soup/,all_ads,6,,,,

We were invited to Friendsgiving at her friend's house, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go. I'm not super close with their friends, but I will occasionally join them for events (mostly to appease Taylor). I'm usually the only POC there, and I generally find it hard to relate to her friends. I find their friends to sometimes be passive-aggressive or pretentious. 

I've lately stopped going with her because I don't enjoy her friend group and neither does she tbh. Taylor complains a lot about how they don't feel super close to them or like she can't be her full self with them, but she goes anyway because she wants friends. 

On top of this, I feel like I'll be the wet blanket of the night. Mom backed out of visiting, which threw a wrench in my plans to have people over here. I had a recent falling out with one close friend I had here, and another close friend is going through their own depression and has been distant. 

I'm not close to my family (dead parent, abusive parent, and a lot of geographical distance) and find this holiday to be really hard. I feel really orphaned right now, and the last thing I want is to grin and bare it for some fake friends. I've been taking the time to focus on my needs and care for this genuine sadness I feel. 

My therapists and best friends back home agreed that I should take today to myself and not go to the party if it felt bad. I was consistent about being unsure if I'd go, and last night Taylor kept going on and on about whether I would go, so I balked. 

Today I tried to share how I felt, and they seemed to understand. We spent all morning and afternoon together, which I hoped would communicate my want to be with them, but not to be in a performance. Now Taylor's upset and surprised that I changed my mind about going, despite being on the fence for weeks and only saying yes yesterday when I felt pressured.

A perfectly healthy 1 year old dog, however, when we adopted her she seemed to have abandonment issues from a previous owner who didn’t take care of her correctly, therefore it was extra work to get the dog to trust us that we wouldn’t leave, and would constantly stick by our sides .
Everything seemed fine in the first few weeks of the dogs arrival, she was a good ol dog, she liked barking up trees and the standard, chasing-the-squirrel act 
However, it seemed like she wanted something more from us, we tried practically everything from treats, to bones, to new beds and blankets, she shunned them away, or, tore everything to shreds (I forgot to mention, she’s like a damn wood chipper). When seeing the poor ol thing outside she wanted to hunt small animals, we were confused for a while before our dog started giving aggressive hints towards us, it seemed to go on for a while, and we thought it was some type of unregistered homesickness, but what for? We didn’t know what home she had before us
Skip to a few days ahead and there’s a picture of a familiar looking place at our couch. I picked it up, stunned, it was a picker of the trailer park a few miles down the road, we never had any pictures of a trailer park, nor ever lived in one. I saw Bella, sitting next to the couch, her tail sweeping against the floor like a broom as she gave me one of her usual, hopeful looks, like how she looked at us for food or for a walk. 
My mom walks in and sees the picture and asks what this was all about, and why on earth I had a trailer park picture in my hands. I shrugged and explained that it was here before I entered the room, the only other person that was here was the dog. We didn’t question it further, is it was probably my grandma who put it there anyways
After that the dog seemed pretty pissed off about our ignorance to her, this lead us to puzzle piece things together, more and more the dog kept dropping hints upon us. The dog wanted to be at the trailer park, but why a damn trailer park? Our neighborhood had a dog park filled with dozens of other dogs at a time, as well as plenty of trails and sidewalks, trees and mailboxes to pee on. Bella kept giving us sour puss looks, we didn’t want to give the dog up as WE rescued. I told the dog no, and that she could roam free in the space of our glorious back porch. We got into a fight that night, an ugly one indeed, the dog barked and I yelled, tears in my eyes. My mom hearing the whole fight from her room. Why does she wish to go back to the trailer park?

It's a kind of therapy where they give her some ketamine then she stays there for 2 and a half hours then she is walked out to her car to leave. The reason she is walked out to her car is so they can make sure she has someone to drive her home because it isn't safe for her to drive right after her appointment.

Last week, I learned that she had been taking my younger sibling (14) to her appointments with her to wait in the car and pretend to be there to drive her home. That day, she needed me to go with her to pretend to be her driver since my sibling had covid and had to stay home that day. I was nervous about being in the car with her while she was still a bit high but I figured it would be okay since my younger sibling had been there and been fine in the past so I agreed and I went with her.

On the way there, she told be how I could just stay in the car the whole time and they would take her out to check if she had someone to drive her and then we would be on our way. I sat in the car and waited while I listened to a podcast then listened to some music and sang. My singing was interrupted by my mom calling me saying that I actually had to go in and sign a paper in order for her to leave. I went in and signed it and then I overheard someone saying that they started having people get signed out because someone had left there without a driver and they got in a car accident. After that, I was anxious the whole time my mom was driving us home.

Yesterday, my mom had her weekly appointment and she needed me to go with her again and I said I didn't want to go because I was nervous to be in the car with her right after her appointment. She said that I had to go but I was defensive and told her that she was putting her children in danger in order to get high. She yelled at me and said that I had to go with her or she would take away my phone. So I reluctantly went with her. (I'm 16 so naturally I felt like I needed my phone otherwise, I couldn't talk to my boyfriend)

She was quiet the whole way there and I was crying the whole way there. She got out of the car and went in to her appointment. I started having a panic attack because I was really scared to be in that car with her when she drove home so I called my older brother (19) and I told him what was going on and he came and picked me up. I knew that my mom might not be able to find a way home but I just wanted to get out of that car and get a ride home with someone sober.

Later that day, my mom sent me a long text about how mad she was at me for leaving her there and screwing her over.

This happened yesterday. So today is Thanksgiving, an American holiday where we eat our feelings and snap at our loved and unloved ones about sensual policits. ""Don't wag your finger at me!""

Yesterday was not Thanksgiving, but it was our Thanksgiving Pageant at the private elementary school I teach at. It was not going to be formal at all, just children dressing up as pilgrims &amp; Indians and recreating the Mayflower voyage and eating a pretend meal. We have a fairly diverse school racially, so I had the white kids be the pilgrims, since the pilgrims were white. The others would be play other parts. Obviously, since we don't have any real Indians anymore, I chose the closest races (black and Asian), and the remaining few Latino kids got to play the food.

Long story short, it was a travesty. I only wanted to make it accurate as possible, yet that is precisely what parents took issue with. We hadn't even started the pageant, and parents were coming up to me and letting their invalid feelings be heard. Mr. Jamal Jackson got up and made his kids leave because they're vegan and were wearing real feathers. Ms. Mei Ching claimed she had actual ""indigenous heritage"" but don't we all? A Latinx mother wanted to know why her daughter was dressed as a pesseguinho, after which I called her a putinha (inside joke). Other parents were being similar, and even some of the white parents betrayed me.

The pageant didn't end up happening after so many kids were pulled, but that's not what made me mad. The parents didn't trust me, the teacher, to do what I thought best for their children. When they're at school, they're my kids. That's just how it works here. I am wondering if it would have been better to just use teachers as ""Indians"" to avoid the unnecessary offense, so maybe I could've done better from the start, but I don't think I did anything wrong. Sometimes things like this just make us say or do ""racist"" without even trying.

Well about 1.5 months ago we started spending more and more time together and really getting more in depth with our relationship in our conversations and time spent together. A few weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to be official and my girlfriend. She asked what that meant to me, and I specifically said “exclusivity or at least open communication in defining an open relationship”. She said yes to this. 

After that we started spending pretty much 5-6 days a week together. Our friend groups were becoming intertwined and we really started hitting it off. Then this past Sunday, she just goes dark on me out of nowhere then finally around 11 pm hits me with “hiiiii sorry I’ve been preoccupied today with company” I was just like uh ok. Then she was like “I can tell you as little or as much as you’d like”. I got upset. I was asking why the fuck, I thought we were gonna talk about things like that before hand, blah blah blah. I end up telling her fuck you, and the next day telling her hey this is over I’m not going to deal with someone who can’t communicate.

We're consensually non mutual. She has other partners and I've been with others as well. My partner has told me multiple times that I'm her priority and I have felt that way towards her.

We connected with a couple on a dating app. We go to the bar and they immediately hit it off. I'm an immigrant and new-ish to the city. They kept talking about their college sports teams, frat houses, sorority stories, etc. I confessed to the group and apologized that I didn't grow up here and so may not follow their conversation. My partner didn't bring me into the conversation. I felt ignored through the evening but she was having a good time so we eventually agreed to go back to her place.

Whenever we've had sex, my partner looked into my eyes a certain way, stroked my hair a certain way and told me that she's never felt this good ever. 30 seconds into the swap she's doing all the same with this guy. My heart sank and while I was getting a blowjob I literally lost my erection immediately. I felt sad to be very honest, like I was a little foolish to believe that I could be special.

I made an excuse to get water and left the room. I stayed in the living room for a minute not knowing what to do while she's having a good time with them. She eventually calls me back in and asks me to lay by her. I was very checked out by then and pushed her hand away a couple of times to signal to her that things are not okay with me. She looked confused, just rolled her eyes, rolled over into his arms and started making out with him. I continued to be disengaged but no one really cared to pause. My partner went ahead and sucked him, and even begged him to cum in her mouth.

As they left I told her I was heartbroken that she chose to ignore my disconnect and the fact that I'd checked out and continued to enjoy with them while I was lying right there.
