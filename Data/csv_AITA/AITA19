She is also  very close to a girl (R) that I never really liked, but I always talked normally.  When classes started this year R asked me to move in with her and we started looking at apartments. A couple days latter she just disappeared without giving any response to my messeges. After 3 weeks I let her know that I needed to know if she still wanted to see houses with me because I live in another state and need a house before school starts, she ignored me again and I put it down.  Arriving at college, she kept acting like nothing happened, but started treating me badly.  I tried to reconcile with her several times to preserve my best friend, but she never responded and my best friend always played down the situation as if it was a problem that me and r created. In the middle of the year R and my best friend started looking for a house together and in the middle of the process I had to move in a hurry from where I was living (in a very traumatic process).  I asked my best friend if I could look for a house with them and to my surprise R told her that she wouldn't live with me because ""her parents didn't know me (she's 21 years old)"".  My best friend defended r and said she couldn't do anything to help me.  I ended up looking for a house on my own after going through a lot of trouble Far away from my family and friends.  R continued to act as absolutely nothing had happened.  When they moved togheter, R wouldn't let any of my best friend's guests go to the open house party because ""they wouldn't have any plates"" and my friend thought that was normal.  After that, I found out that my best friend and our group of friends had done a project together and didn't ask me to be in the group because ""I wasn't taking class the same day they were"" and because R ask her to make the work with her and not with me.  I told my friend that I was sick of screwing me over to please R and that I didn't like the way she defended R no matter the way she treats me.  My friend compared me to her abusive ex-girlfriend (who hit her) and said she saw no reason for me to be upset.  We haven't spoken for 3 months since them and she just ignores me everywhere we go.

But my wife thinks it’s an “unhealthy obsession”, which is just completely and utterly false!

We continued going at it and we were reaching the climax, as soon as I came I yelled “Jesse! Feel my crystal blue cum!” And my wife threw me off instantly and yelled “I’m done! I hate you and I hate your stupid breaking bad obsession, and I’ve been fucking another guy because you won’t shut up about ‘Better Call Saul’ and how ‘Kim’ is a better wife than me!”.

As she was yelling more about how breaking bad is ruining me I told her “you’re acting just like skyler!” And she yelled that we are getting a divorce.

She has now moved into a motel and I’ve been thinking about what happened, I personally don’t believe I’m in the wrong, but I want to hear it from Reddit.

He and my mom had joint custody, but my mom supported all of us (myself and my 2 brothers) financially (paid for parts college, helped with down payments on cars, covered rent if we needed help). My dad has not supported me in any way since I turned 18, however when I was in college he took me to dinner a few times a year and also would pay for dinners when visiting me (1-2x/year), we live about a 4 hour drive apart. My dad does not know how much money I make or anything about my financial position, or my fiancés. 

Now the current situation. About a month ago, my dad let me know he and my stepmom (65f) would be in my city for a convention for stepmom’s work. He asked if I wanted to go to dinner their last night in town, along with my fiancé (38m). I said ok, and he asked if I could pick a restaurant and make reservations. I suggested a relatively trendy restaurant and sent him the menu (which showed prices) and website, and asked if this looked good. He said yes, so I booked a table for 2. It’s a tapas restaurant with shared dishes, typically a bill for 4 people (with 1-2 drinks each) would be between 300-350 (not including taxes or tip) - this is not spelled out on the menu, but it is able to be easily assumed and calculated as it’s explain how tables typically order (the menu says typically 2-3 plates per person, and prices range from 15-35/plate). There was no conversation about who would pay or how the costs would be split at the time of the reservation. 

We all enjoyed the meal, ate equal amounts and both my stepmom and fiancé had 2 glasses of wine each (dad and I drank water). When the bill came (330 total, not including taxes or tip), the waiter placed it in front of my dad. A solid 2-3 minutes of awkward small talk continued and no one reached for the bill. At the point, my fiancé whispered to me we should just split the bill. I begrudgingly got out my wallet and agreed. The waitress came back, and we told her to split it down the middle. She returned, presented the check back to my parents (assuming they had paid), my dad pushed them across the table, we signed them and left.  

I didn’t expect them to pay for the meal, but I was surprised they didn’t even make an offer to split. I can afford the meal in full, but my impression was that since I gave him the menu and asked for approval before booking that he was ok with the costs and it was within in his means. I recognize I could have addressed this before putting down my card, but I was sort of shocked by the whole thing and didn’t want to have an awkward conversation at the table.

It’s the next day and this is still bothering me. WIBTA if I said something to my dad? I don’t want money for the meal, but I want to address how it made me feel used and to set expectations for how we handle this in the future.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4809645,public,top,self,WIBTA for talking to my dad about sticking me/fiancé with the check?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0dm0o/wibta_for_talking_to_my_dad_about_sticking/,all_ads,6,,,

I therefore found out that he knows my sister which is great and after that, him and my sister have been together for 8 months.

Me and him would attend these gatherings together as my sister had a different social circles but ever since he started dating my sister, he wouldn’t show up (which is fine).

Skip forward to a two days ago, when we had to all attend my mother’s birthday party and this was my first time seeing him after a month because he was busy (me and my sister don’t live together).

The party-esque gathering was great, most of us got drunk and i had to use the bathroom so I went to the second floor because the one on the same floor as me was occupied. Conveniently, my sisters bf is upstairs trying to find something (I forgot, it was all a haze). I told him that I was about to throw up and went into the bathroom, which he proceeded to follow me in. I was throwing up and he was holding my hair (an awful sight, i know).

When my sister comes upstairs to look for her bf, when me and him tidy up, we both leave the bathroom (I always look dishevelled whilst drunk). Guess who is waiting outside the bathroom to “use it”, my sister!!! How great! Of course, one might find this as a weird sight especially at a family party.

My sister looked like she was on the edge of tears and her bf was telling her that “I was just helping her because she was throwing up everywhere”. My sister has immense trust issues so you can guess how this will turn out. I call her “insane for thinking anything besides from what it is”. She starts crying, calling me demeaning things, calling him grotesque things and leaves. She tells our mother that “you’ve raised a betrayer and a disgusting creature” ( I hear this from upstairs. It was the most awkward moment of my life). He tells me that he’s sorry ( I don’t know for what) and proceeds to leave after her.

I got more inebriated and slept over at my mother’s house. My sister has been ignoring my messages and calls. Her boyfriend has told me that she told him to get out and to not come back.

He said some mean things and basically calling me a whore and saying that I’ve slept with the same amount of people in three months then he has in 25+ years. 

He also said something about sloppy seconds and said that it’s not possible to sleep with someone and not have feelings for them. Is that true??

So, I've been seeing this girl ""Mandy"" for few months now and she's recently moved in with me in my house.


Days ago, I had to travel out of town for work and came back yesterday.



The minute I walked in I was shocked to see that she decorated almost the entire house for christmas. There was bright and colorful stuff hanged everywhere. She put little deer models on every shelf, little pine trees and knomes on every window. Wrapped up the curtains with bows, put christmas mats infront of every door, gingerbread signs on the walls and doors, santa clause themed cups, plates and even pillows, containers stuffed with cookies and candycanes. it's just...it felt so nausuating to put it civily. I called her and had her get off work and come home immediately.


When called out, her response was ""what? It was supposed to be a surprise, I thought you'd like it"" I said no because for one I'm an athiest I don't celebrate this holiday...or any other holiday for that matter but christmas in particular makes me anxious and gives me depression. And also....I did not give her my consent to turn the house upside down like that. She had a breakdown, began crying saying she put so much money and effort into decorating the place and said that lots of non religion people celebrate christmas as ""one of the country's largest holidays"". She said that even if I don't approve of it, she does and since she lives here and helps with mortgage then she gets a say. I said ""WRONG"" because it's my place my house and she only moved in a couple of months ago. We had a huge (probably the biggest so far) argument and she went to stay with her friends and has yet to return nor respond to my calls. One of her friend did reach out and called me an ""asshole"" for how I reacted and for yelling at Mandy and making her feel bad for doing a ""nice gesture"" to make my home ""warm and lit"" this season.

But, I wouldn't be here if I was just saying that my life is all sunshine and rainbows. I met another new senior (I'll call her C) who had a similar experience as me. I started talking to her at the third week of school when C got her new schedule and had started going to her new classes, which were almost similar to mine I saw her talking to the teacher at the end of US history I saw her schedule when and offered to help her to her new classes, C agreed and we talked while walking to French, she mentioned her situation and once I noticed it was the same as mine we hit off.

So buckle up because this is a long one. I (14 Female) and my friend (15 female, we'll call her Sarah) along with my other friends, (all female and 14-15) had a little chat on snapchat the other day in our group chat. One of my friends sent us a snap saying ""what do you call two bros doing algebra together"". We all know what this joke is so we all replied with the right answer. Except for one friend, sarah. For a little context me and Sarah aren't the best of chums, we have had many disagreements in the past and have discussed these matters over text. One of the things that were mentioned in an apology were 1, to stop making monkey jokes, and 2, to stop making gay jokes. Ex: ohhh the way you sit is gay, ohhh we all know you're gay just come out already. Stupid jokes like that. To some of my friends, this made them uncomfortable because like any teenage girls do, they are having an identity crisis. We told her to stop and there hasn't been one. Until that fateful Sunday night. Sarah decided to be so silly and reply with the two words ""gay nerds"". This brought back flashbacks and I immediately replied, ""Wtf"". She kept ignoring me until I asked her for an explanation. She then replied with ""It's not that deep"" and "" Just chill it was a **joke**."" Oh yea, and what did I tell her to stop making? Gay jokes. So i said ""Are you gay?"" Sarah: ""Wtf no"", so i said ""then why are you making gay jokes?"" Sarah then replied ""chill OP it's just a joke it's not that deep."" So then I said ""so that makes it ok for you as a straight person to make these jokes?"" and Sarah thoughtfully replied with ""OP chill, it's a freaking joke."" 

At this point, I will admit I was kind of frustrated of how she way replying and how she wasn't understanding my point of view so i gave her a real life example that she isn't quite fond of: Me ""so that would make it ok for you a full white person, to call me (brown) a (insert racial insult) as a joke even though you are not brown?"" I used this example because I felt that it directly pointed out what she was doing, and I thought she would connect the dots but she didn't. Sarah then replied with ""what does that example have anything to do with what I said?"" So then i as camly as i could said ""Listen the bottom line is that if you are not gay you cannot make gay jokes."" and then sarah said ""since when was gay a bad word?"" Bro what? I asked again, ""Sarah are you gay?"" Sarah says ""No"". Me ""So you a straight person should not make gay jokes because that is wrong."" Sarah still couldn't connect the dots and said ""But why is it wrong?"" Then i starting to get more angry said ""because you are not gay, just like how white people like you cannot make jokes about brown/black people being monkeys, straight people cannot make jokes about people being gay."" Sarah then cleverly replied with “ok OP take a chill pill.” After that some things were said.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4809616,public,top,self,WIBTA If i decided to expose my friend in front of our group?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0ddpc/wibta_if_i_decided_to_expose_my_friend_in_front/,all_ads,6,,,

My (M28) older brother died in an accident a couple of years ago. He was 27. It was completely unexpected and hit me pretty hard because our Dad is dead and neither of got on with our Mum, so we were all each other had really. 

When he was 18 he left home and went to uni in London which is a seven hour train journey from were we grew up. It wasn't a coincidence that he was so far away, I think he just wanted to put as much distance between himself and Mum as possible. I stayed at home. He came back when he was 21 and we had been sharing a flat for a few years when he died. I am still in the same flat and now live here with my boyfriend. 

A few days ago a woman showed up at my door claiming to have been his girlfriend in London (he never mentioned her) and claiming that he had a child. An eight year old boy. The boy wasn't there, she left him back London apparently, but she showed me a picture. She didn't seem to know he was dead so I had to tell her. I asked if she was sure he was the father and she said it couldn't be anyone else. So I asked why I didn't know about any of this and she said she had decided to raise their son herself so didn't tell him. She came looking for him now because she thought ""it was time"", whatever that means. I am pretty pissed off about it, because my brother would have loved to be a father and now obviously he will never have a chance. I also suspect she has ulterior motives coming looking for him now. 

She asked if I would be interested in meeting the boy, maybe introducing him to his grandmother, but I said no. I feel if I've not been involved in his upbringing for the first eight years of his childhood there's not much point in getting involved now. And I really don't want a reason to have to go over to Mum's house. I also suspect that money is going to come up at some point and that's just insulting to my brother's memory.

She has always been competitive with me. She just always wants to prove she's better than me at something. Whether it was games on the playground or grades. She always had to prove she was better. This issue revolves around writing, which she didn't like until she saw me like it. 

When I was a senior in college and she was a freshman, I started a blog. I eventually gained 2K followers and got small brand deals and PR stuff. All throughout HS writing seemed to stress her out, and she then decided to major in English. (of course because I'm in communications) All of a sudden her freshman year of college she decides she loves to write. At the time she said it was because she realized that she was a better writer than she thought because the ideas in her classes challenged her more and interested her. But really, it's because there was almost no structure or formula to how she had to write, anyone can be a good writer when you don't have rules to follow.

Anyway it was convenient that as soon as she saw me getting successful, suddenly she loves writing and it's all she does. She never got into blogging but presented papers at writing events and academic stuff (symposium or conference or whatever). She also got her Master in writing and is about to get a PhD. Suddenly the family pays attention to her work which is again an example of her needing to prove she's better than me. She presented at some big conference last year, was invited back this year, which of course my family things is SO impressive (meanwhile I studied abroad and only got told how nice it was that I had the opportunity). The real joke of it is that she only ever publishes articles and chapters in books, she apparently can't write a book herself. 

We're all in town this weekend for the holiday and she spent a lot of time holed up writing because she has another one of her articles due and instead of seeing it as rude, the family thinks it's cool and are excited. Meanwhile I got another PR deal for a company on my blog and only got told ""that's so nice."" I'm making more impact in my work, but she gets all the recognition. And all of this started because she can't let me have my one thing that I can be the best at, as soon as she saw me succeeding she had to jump in and find a way to prove that she's better than me. 

When she came back from her hotel the family were aksing her about her dissertation that she's finally almost done with and ignored my PR deal. She said she's basically done and needs to edit and write acknowledgements. I said I hope she'd acknowledge her jealousy and competitiveness with me as the driving force behind her work. She just laughed and turned away and I said ""no seriously"" and she said ""it wouldn't be true."" My family is now mad and calling ME jealous and apparently can't see that she only does things to compete with me and can't handle me having attention instead of her. They called me pathetic.

Well I e been asking him if it’s ever going to happen or if he would just prefer to elope somewhere or something but he tells me he will when the “time is right” or when I “prove I deserve it.” Well and issue a raised today about an old asset he has that is just sitting there. I asked him if he would want to sell it and maybe invest into a trailer for us to do things on the weekends. He proceeds to tell me if we spilt the trailer is his which I would understand but the main issue I have is him saying I have to show I deserve it is because I always tell him the house is mine because legally it is. So he is telling me I am not proving I deserve to be a wife because I say things are mine not ours? But isn’t he doing the same thing with the asset he has? He is saying if we spilt he is out an asset that’s his but yet same thing would happen if I added him to the house?

So, this is something really meaningful to me. Many times year we were dreaming quite a lot of visiting each other, and in about last 3-4 months he finally got the plan about how are we about to meet (after what I previously felt like us getting more distant for the last previous half of year) . He decided to meet me during his week long Erasmus+ (European students' cultural exchange program) that he applied to.

He didn't share much of his experience during the current program itself but he spoke highly about some of the people attending there atm whom he met before, but also the country that the event taking place in.

Then finally today, at the last day of his Erasmus+, he told a place where we could meet (there I have to add that I has to dig myself all the additional information like the exact time frame of the event, it requiring a registration form and so on. He didn't even answered my question on when exactly to except him). The problem was however, that this place (initially we planned a totally different one) was connected to some really bad experience from my past, that I am still traumatized by. For him it was however only ""past"" that I should have move from. Finally, despite my initial reaction, that I also told him, I agreed to meet at this place.

However in the last moment I decided that I still can't go inside that place and decided to wait for him nearby instead - but I didn't specify beforehand that I won't come in (our communication was also quite weak because we were only chatting via email). After almost two hours of waiting nearby and not seeing his group coming I decided to leave. Only after I came back I did read his email saying that I didn't come that he sent when I already was a half way home. From what I already know it's the last day of his Erasmus+, and likely the time when he heads back home (with a slim chance it being tomorrow).

Because of this missing opportunity I was really frustrated about the whole outcome that I sent him E-Mail basically calling out his irresponsibility to not even provide an exact time when he's coming and a plan ""B"" like meeting him at the airport on the final day, or even just simply some place where I can just pass by and quickly say ""Hi"" for half a minute. 

At the same time I can't throw the thought out of my head that I am acting self-obsessed and out of jealously. That basically I am just frustrated for not getting the attention I wanted and trying to project my insecurities into this situation. That's my E-Mail rant was nothing more than me being again ""that one dark cloud on someone's clear bright sky"" and that I just got a codependency issue here.

A week ago me, j and our other friend (m) T went out for drinks, it was a pretty tame night and we just ended up having dinner and a few drinks, me and J were wanting to have a couple more as it was still early but T had to be up early the next morning so he decided to leave. 

About half an hour after T left, while J and I were sitting at the bar we heard a loud voice behind us and I turned to see a girl wrapping her arms around J hugging him from behind, turns out it was his ex girlfriend S which I thought was very strange as they weren't huge fans of eachother, they exchanged a few words and she went to sit with her friends across the bar. 

Another 30 minutes pass and I'm about ready to go, i asked J if he wanted to go once he finished his drink and he straight up said he wanted to see what S was doing after which I found strange since he knows E wouldn't be comfortable with that. So he leaves me sitting at the bar and goes over and starts talking to her, comes back and tells me he's going to hangout for a bit of I wanted to go that's fine, I was quite annoyed as I came here with him I didn't feel comfortable leaving him with people I didn't know, so I told him I would wait but he insisted I leave which really caught me off guard as I wasn't going to wait for someone that didn't even want me there so I paid my tab and went to the bathroom, now this is where it gets fishy since he must have thought I left after paying, on my way to the door I glanced over to see A sitting on J's lap on a stool in the corner NOT EVEN WITH HER FRIENDS and before I knew it they were kissing. I don't say a word to him and I walk out. 

I admit maybe I was a bit angry at J for ditching me when we planned on going out together, but I hate cheaters, so the next day I text E and explain what I saw, we talk and she seems very calm about it but obviously not okay with it, I apologize for being the one telling her and she assured me it's not my fault and thanked me for looking out for her.

Later in the afternoon I get a text from J freaking out at me for being a terrible friend and saying I don't know what I seen and I was lying about everything, he said I'm the reason he lost the love of his life and he never wants to see my face again,  saying I caused E pain over nothing and I'm the reason his relationship is ruined.

My partner is reveling in this because I am quarantining with them, so they’re taking the time to argue out every problem in our relationship. The issue with that is that almost every problem in our relationship is because they are likely BPD and refuse to take accountability for anything.

They follow a pattern of behavior in which they project their anger on to me, gaslight and blame me when I tell them they violated a boundary, and then misdirect, completely changing the subject and ignoring my concern. I told them that they follow that pattern and they repeated it back to me, but never took accountability, saying “because of past experiences, you do…” instead of “because of the way I have treated you, you do…”, nor did they apologize.

There’s been a lot of other unhealthy behaviors that I should have dumped them for long ago, but the constant gaslighting has completely fucked with me and it took a long conversation with a friend to help me realize it.

After this shitty week, I just want to go home and they know it. Today, they said “I’m okay with booking you a ticket home for whenever, but I’m not okay with doing that and not talking about and committing to when you’ll be out here again”.

I plan on dumping them the moment I get home.

I usually work out at the gym and then go to sauna. I don’t wear my gym clothes and shoes to the sauna because I was taught the proper way by my Finnish family. I don’t go there naked like how it’s supposed to be either. I just change to a clean swimsuit and wear my bathroom flip-flops. 

I change in front of my locker in the women’s locker room, because there are no separate changing room (just toilet and shower rooms with no hangers), and I have seen many others did it. Today, I was already in my bikini bottom and was about to put on the bikini top, a boy (about 7M) ran into the women’s locker room with his sister (around the same age with no adults following them) and saw me. I immediately covered myself up and waited for them to go away. They went into a toilet stall together and started hitting the wall with something, yelling and screaming at each other.

I was annoyed, but I put on my bikini top (high neck, nothing revealing) and went to the sauna. When I came out of the sauna and back to the locker room, their mom approached me and yelled at me that I was indecent for being naked in front of her boy. She said I should have gone into a toilet stall or a shower room to change instead of in front of my locker. “Boys shouldn’t be exposed to that”, she said, pointing to me. I’m not used to confrontation, but I told her that it was a locker room for women, and others changed in there like me too. She said it didn’t mean we were right to do that, because little boys could go in there and see us naked. She also told me that next time if I do it again, she will report me for indecent exposure.

I’m not originally from the US, so I don’t really know what is the right thing to do anymore. I feel that I shouldn’t have to worry about changing in a locker room for women (I used to have severe body dysmorphia and it took me a long time to be comfortable with my body).

I said to my GM that she said hurt my Sis and how she don't responded her for ""respect"" but I hear she talk into that mood to my Sis again we don't like de consequences and the discussion end.

 Next morning, during breakfast my mom and dad left, so talk with my GM again with my GP hear everything like a testimony just in case. I told to my GM how hurt the things what she said and explained a every action has a consequence. If I had to choose her o my Sis, always choose my Sis.

After I moved in though, things went downhill fast. I swear it was like she embodied every trope of the shitty roommate and just ratcheted it up to the next level. 

She'd leave dirty plates on the counter until flies and mold grew on them. I've walked in on her being intimate with different partner five or six times in a month in our shared living room. She's taken my car without telling me to ""run errands"" before, leaving me stranded at home. She once stole prescription medication from me as well.

I could honestly go on and on with how many times she's been disgustingly dirty, crossed my boundaries, or was just miserable to live with. 

I finally had enough when one of my friends told me that she sent him unsolicited nudes. It was embarrassing and awkward, and I decided that I couldn't live like this anymore. 

Here's where I may have been the AH: I was never on the official lease and would just Venmo her money every month. While she was at work, I grabbed all of my things and just dipped to my mom's house.

She said I was an AH for not giving her warning and that it would be impossible to find a new roommate during the holidays. I told her I'd repeatedly talked to her about her behavior (for at least two months) and she never changed. 

She just texted me though and said that she wasn't going to make rent this month and might get kicked out because of me.

My friend had her child taken away by social services. It was rough. To help her get over it she got a hamster and a month later a Frenchie. Once she got the dog she ignored the hamster until it died. She then got bored of the dog a rehomed. 



A few months later she got a collie and a few months later moved in with us. We also have a puppy around half the age of her dog.



This poor boy is locked in her room with her for hours every day, only walked for about an hour and expected to sit quietly the rest of the time. (He doesn't) She works nights and leaves him alone in the room for him to bark and howl and slam himself against the door. 



She swears he has water but whenever I go in there is an empty bowl and when he comes downstairs he guzzles our dogs water, confirming he hasn't had a drink in hours. He used to be completely emaciated with his ribs and hip bones visible from a distance. She said its because he was fussy but jn under a month my partner and I had him back to an almost healthy weight. She just doesn't feed him. 



His crate is also dirty, one time she locked him in every night for a week when there were mouldy vegetables and urine in his crate. The second I noticed (it stank in her room so didn't take long) I pulled his bed out a throughly cleaned it. She left him like it for a whole week! 



She claims I do not help enough, but I used to spend full days and weeks helping her train her dog only to have her smirk and say she won't bother being consistent. I work very early mornings and so cannot stay up all night to care for her pet and don't think it's fair I'm expected to. However, because of his frustration and boredom of being locked away all day, he howls, barks and throws his full body weight against the door trying to escape. It breaks my heart to heat but when it's 1am and I wake up at 4am I need to get to sleep! We cannot have him in our room as he's extremely dog aggressive and will attack our dog and bark at us all night.



I've told her time and time again how to properly exercise him both physically and mentally yet she continues to ignore it. She also hasn't bothered training him to be alone as he has separation anxiety. 



She says I am being unfair as she's been through a lot and I truly understand that but I cannot be lead to believe that being sad is a good excuse for animal abuse, and honestly in my eyes not feeding, giving water to or walking a dog is absolutely animal abuse! 



So AITA for telling her the other day that her dog needs a new home? I feel like I'm left with the backlash from his neglect (including apologising to the neighbours every week!)

She laughs and shrugs it off, and I continue cleaning like nothing happened.
A few minutes later, she does it anyways and grabs me there even after I said no. I screamed and kicked her out of instinct and when she kept laughing, I yelled at her for overstepping my boundaries. Then, she has the audacity to get annoyed and tell me to “Take a joke.”

I only asked because I wanted a have a basis for when I CAN ask for things since I don’t really know how to ask him for anything. 

During the car ride, he talks about how far it is, how much he has to do afterwards, and that it’s a lot to get us where I’m going. I’m assuming this is his way of saying that it isn’t easy and that I should be grateful. 

Time skip he gets me there, and we agree he’s gonna come at 12:45 because he has a game he wants to watch at 1:30. I’m watching my phone around that time and I haven’t gotten a call and I check in the window to see if he’s outside. I see neither, so I assume he’s running late or that he’s driving. I don’t want to call him if he’s driving so I wait to call him. Around the same time, the pizza comes (I’m at a friend’s and was helping with a project). I eat some pizza and sit with them to talk. I have some food and I check my phone and I realize my phone ringer was off (I remember turning it on because I have a habit of missing important calls so I panic when I realized it was off) and he had been calling me nonstop for ten minutes (it had been 1:15 at this point). I call him back tell him I’m coming, rush to get my things to get in the car and he’s PISSED. 

My dad told me how I shouldn’t just think about myself and that there’s other things he needs to worry about and asked me if I thought he was a chauffeur. I don’t respond because he’s angry and yelling, driving really fast, and I don’t want to get him more upset. We make it home at 1:35. 

My mother comes to tell me that I “know how he gets” about lateness and that his medication “doesn’t make him himself”. She told me how I was wrong and that I should let it go. I told her that I made a mistake, didn’t mean to be late, and that he shouldn’t have yelled (I get why he’d be upset because that’s not fair to his time, but the yelling and the speed he was going at genuinely scared me). She talked about how easy he is on us, how much he does for us, and how he ‘can’t say No to his kid’. I don’t want to be a hindrance on the schedule he has but I’d assume he’d be able to say no because he’s the one taking up the favor.

During it I overheard my dad telling my mom something along the lines: ""Worst case we won't put it there.""

I have a long history of having my opinions disregarded by him like that so I am quite sensitive to it(in a sense also kind of insensitive because I've gotten used to it?

For background, the goal of the trip was for me to meet a few of her close friends that I had never met before. We were invited to a party that evening and we attended and I had a great time drinking, eating, and meeting several of her friends. We traveled on a redeye flight the night before and then worked the next day so we were both running on about 3 hours of sleep. 

We were there later than most of the guests and even stayed to help clean up the party room before the afterparty continued in her friend’s apartment below. I was extremely tired at this point and past my physical limitations,  and her friends we drove with also wanted to start heading home (it was past 1am at this point). I had told her a couple of times earlier than night that I was really tired, but didn’t explicitly mention that I wanted to leave.

 I told my girlfriend as others were starting to leave, “hey if we stay much longer, you may find me asleep on the side of the room or the bathroom. I’m just dead tired.” 

We ended up leaving and there was a huge explosive fight we had and she’s adamant that was “an extremely fucked up thing to say” and if I didn’t see why that we had “core value differences.” Also, she said that if I “didn’t give a fuck about meeting her friends after coming all this way, then why should she?” I calmly mentioned that we had 2-3 more days and we had a lot of time still to socialize and spend time. I feel terribly about it because she ended up having a really strong emotional reaction to the situation and her friend had to talk and calm her down over the course of a couple of hours. She’s angry with me still. 

I know that I could have been more direct with my communication and could have communicated more constructively, but the comment I made was in a lighthearted tone and truly honest, I was that tired.

She got diagnosed with brain cancer in 2020.
Long story short, we've been through several chemo sessions and surgeries but nothing seems to help. The tumor just keeps spreading.
In September, the doctor told me that she's got 3 months left at most.

Well, I believe in science, but I do not believe that my daughter will die. I do not believe that she's terminally ill. 
I believe that she'll survive. I believe she'll live. I believe that I'll watch her go to college, get married and start a family. 

Yesterday she asked me to buy her a dress because she's always loved it and would want to have it as a birthday gift (her birthday is tomorrow). 
The dress costs less than $50. But to be honest, that's a little too expensive for us at this point because her medical bills has really hit me hard. 

I'm a single mom and we live on a very slim budget. My husband passed away in 2015 and life has never been the same ever since. 

So yesterday when my daughter asked if I'll be getting her the dress, I said to her 'No Anna, we can't afford it. I'll rather put any extra money towards saving for your college education'. 

I don't know if this statement sounds insensitive and silly since it's probably her last birthday (she's only got a month left). But then again, we really can't afford it and I don't believe my daughter will die anyway. 

Now she's mad at me and hasn't spoken to me in hours, which is odd because we're like best friends and we talk all the time.

It breaks my heart to see her sad. I really don't know if I'm wrong for putting it to her in that manner. 
I wonder if I could have said it in a much better way.

I told her it was just between us and had nothing to do with anyone else in the family as we will be buying the rest of them gifts.

My bf and I have one pup who is still quite young.  She doesn’t get to socialize very often so I fear she may become reactive.  I decided that taking her to my office would be the perfect way to introduce her to strangers and show her that strangers are nice.  My bf did not like this idea because most my coworkers are guys. He told me I can take her but not to let any male coworkers pet her anywhere but her head.  Now that made no sense to me especially since our pup loves belly rubs.  I asked him why and he said he didn’t want any dudes caressing his dog’s back, belly, or touching her butt.  Now this really upset me because it sounds absolutely ridiculous and kinda like he is sexualizing our dog so I disagreed. I asked him if he would feel the same way if we had a male dog or with female coworkers and he said no.  He said he thinks of our dog like his daughter and he wouldn’t want his daughter being talked to for very long by other dudes in my office.  We have had fights with him being upset that I have polite friendly conversations with my male coworkers in passing (not often though because I have social anxiety and tend to avoid everyone). He got upset that I wasn’t “considering his feelings” and is now not talking to me.

(Fake names but more ideal for story telling) Lisa is a very outgoing person, she isn’t shy or introverted at all. 

Lisa and Tom started dating two months ago. Tom already met all of Lisa’s friends quite early in the relationship. Tom wanted Lisa to meet his friends as well, but she was very hesitant about meeting them. 
He gave her a few options, like having dinner together, meeting them one-on-one or at an upcoming birthday party.
Lisa didn’t want to meet his friends at all, claiming that they wouldn’t like her (for no reason, there was no back story to it). She later decided that she’d attend the party since there was alcohol included and she was allowed to bring another person for comfort, so she chose me.

The day of the party, we arrived at the venue about 5 hours before the party started to help some friends of Tom with decorating the venue and setting up the bar. Everyone but Lisa helped. She just sat down and started texting someone, she didn’t stop for even a few minutes the whole time we were there. 

When the party eventually started, she didn’t try to socialise either. She was either on her phone or with Tom, sometimes checking up on me. I talked to a few people, including the birthday girl, as well as her whole family. Lisa never made the effort to talk to anyone. 

When me and Lisa left, I thanked the birthday girl and her family for throwing the party and “inviting” me. 
We came early the next day to help clean the venue. Again, Lisa stood there doing nothing, just staring at everyone. Meanwhile I scrubbed the bar down, picked up trash and threw it away, helped with putting away full bottles and presents. Again, when we left, I thanked everyone for the party yesterday. Lisa didn’t. 

Me and the birthday girl exchanged Instagram users and started chatting about the party, about her mum who apparently loved me because I was so polite and about meeting up again because she thought that I was really nice. She didn’t do the same with Lisa.

Now, Lisa is quite mad at me. She asked me to not invite the birthday girl to my birthday, saying that it was unfair to her. I told her that it’s none of her business who I’m friends with and she could’ve made an effort to at least thank everyone. Tom confronted the birthday girl about this as well.

I would sometimes have outbursts about it and he said it really took a toll on him which is why he cheated on me in the first place (honestly idk). 

And what sucks the most is we have a really good relationship besides this. We do a lot for each other and have sex like once a day. I do everything in my power to provide a good life for him. 

But recently he has been extremely suspicious and it drives me nuts. He changed his phone password, he texts random numbers, he hasn't posted me on social media in like 2 years. And anytime I bring up not feeling secure or feeling anxious, he gets angry and defensive. I don't even know how to approach him about anything without being gaslit. I'm so bad at holding my ground the second someone raises their voice at me. He says that it's my fault that he acts this way and if I just trusted him he wouldnt do this stuff.

In the morning, she sent me a message describing the documentary as if we hadn't discussed it the night before--she had been very tired at that point, so sleepy that she sounded like she could barely stay awake. To this morning message I replied:

&gt;Beebee, we talked about that in some detail last night—aww, were you too tired to remember?

She didn't reply to me for half an hour. I had no idea anything was wrong. I sent a few friendly voice clips in the mean time telling her I was excited for our normal morning call. 

When she finally replied, she revealed that she was so upset she didn't want to talk to me. She not only says that the comment I made was ""rude"", but that my comment was like

&gt;“aww the poor little baby can’t remember that she told me something that I wasn’t interested in, so I’ll sneakily stab her” 

She thinks I was being deliberately, ""sneakily"" condescending. Not even rude by accident or carelessness, but deliberately rude with the intention of making her feel stupid.

My girlfriend is the love of my life, and we've been together for nine months. She's one of the most intelligent people I know. I hate having conflicts with her, and not only would I never want to say anything to upset her, I would never want to make her feel the slightest bit bad.

-She is finically unstable. As could be seen in my first point. That’s why she gets dependent and never INDEPENDENT.

-Likes to drink wine a lot. Like I’m starting to think she might be an alcoholic. Haven’t seen her doing it lately. 

-Lives with parents and doesn’t know how to properly clean up after herself well.

-Has a dog who is spoiled as hell. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I genuinely think that if she keeps the baby, the baby is going to end up like the dog. The dog literally commands her.

-Is immature. Talks about how she’s an adult but doesn’t do adult things.

-Is young, and I know she will probably regret having her youth taken yo by taking care of her child.

-All of her boyfriends turns out to horrible one way or another. Baby daddy is probably will be too, and she’s going to live with him.

-If she screws up or leaves her boyfriend, our parents will not let her live with them again.

Long story short, my fiancé and I went through a serious health scare where we weren't sure that I was going to make it down the aisle. When my doctor gave me a clean bill of health, we immediately began planning for our wedding. 

Because the wedding almost didn't happen, one thing that really mattered to my fiancé and I was that we really got to experience the ""magic"" of the wedding we almost didn't have. One of those moments was a first look where my fiancé expressed that he really wanted to be surprised by my dress and have a moment to take it all in just the two of us (he said he's always wanted to see me as a bride).

We made this very clear to everyone who went wedding shopping with me, and they all knew the reason why. I was super concerned about my MIL specifically because she had already previously forwarded inspiration images of my dress to my fiancé that I had sent to my bridal party for reference. My fiancé was upset, they had a talk, and everything seemed ok.

Because my MIL said she did it from ""being too excited"" and it didn't seem malicious, I decided to extend an invite to the actual dress shopping with one rule: she had to give her phone to my MOH. She agreed, but the day of, my mother saw that she took my SIL's phone and sneakily took photos. 

I told her to stop, and she got defensive, and we ended up fighting to the point where I asked MIL and SIL to leave. I felt like they betrayed my trust and ruined what was supposed to be a special moment. My fiancé is on my side, but the rest of his family thinks I was being too dramatic over ""one photo"".

We had our costumes but no plans. Two weeks before Halloween, I met a guy (now my boyfriend). He asked me if I would like to do some woodworking with him on the Saturday of Halloween weekend. At the time, I still didn't have plans with my roommates. I told him yes. I still wanted to dress up with my roommates and thought Sunday/Monday were good.

Then, after making these plans with him, my roommates made plans to go to a Halloween social at a brewery on Saturday. My boyfriend and I had to make it to the wood store before 5pm, but we all didn't make it to the brewery till 4:30. We took a picture and then he and I had to leave. Thinking back, I realize I could've done this any other day with him, but I liked him so much that I wanted to seem him. Also, I figured my roommates and I still had two more chances to dress up and that it wasn't a huge deal (we didn't dress up again).

The way I think they see it, even though no concrete plans were made before I made plans with my boyfriend, we'd all agreed on doing something that weekend, and so the fact I blew them off for a guy I met two weeks prior was really shitty. I also took my costume off in the brewery's bathroom. They saw me walk out and didn't like that I'd immediately taken my costume off, like I must've believed I looked stupid and couldn't wait to take it off. They said they felt silly being just two Power Puff Girls for the rest of the night.

This has turned into a larger issue of not spending enough time with them. I'll admit, I've spent most weekends with him. My roommates and I all moved here fairly recently, and so we're really each other's only friends. They've felt like I've been neglecting my friendship with them for my boyfriend. I realize now that I have, because I didn't know what it meant to them to hang out each weekend. Moreover, I didn't realize what dressing up meant to them. I had no idea how hurt they felt until it all came out today.

They now have a negative opinion of my boyfriend because of this. They feel pretty uneasy when he's over. They need me to message them well ahead of time if he's coming over, even just to pick me up. For example, he and I were hanging out around town and then decided to go back to my house. I immediately texted my roommates, but that wasn't enough time. Both their boyfriends are staying with us the week before finals for extended visits. They think this is okay because they asked well ahead of time. I felt obliged to say yes, but now I'm peaved that my boyfriend can't come over for even a brief moment without sufficient notice.

And really, I don't know why they're blaming him. He did nothing wrong as he didn't know about our costume plans. I think they just see him as the reason things have not been the same.

When my mom went in my room, she immediately started getting mad at me for charging something on my bed, as she has told me repeatedly to not do it. There is an outlet behind my bed, and she wanted to put everything there, so things would not charge on my bed. I was naked at the time, since I sleep naked, but was under the covers. 

I first told my mom to get out of my room, since I was naked, but she wouldn't listen, since she said the cords were more important. I told her many more times to get out of my room, since it was violating my privacy for her to be on my bed, trying to plug something in, while I did not have any clothes on. Her response was that I was under the bed, but it was still invading my privacy. When she called my dad into the room, to help her put the plug into the outlet behind my bed, it made me even more uncomfortable, since now there were two people in my room, knowing I was naked, and both of them did not leave, which was violating my privacy even more. 

When my sister came to my room after hearing all the commotion, I lost it. I told my sister that she should ""get out of my fucking room."" My dad then slapped me, for using the word, and everyone just left since they finished plugging in the cord into the outlet behind my bed.

My POV: I know that using the F-word on my sister was inappropriate, but 3 people violating my privacy, while I am naked, is far more inappropriate, even if I am under the covers. In my mind, if you walk in on someone covering their naked body, that person is going to get very mad, and in my situation, there were 3 people in my room, so I am not really sorry for using that word, as a bunch of people were in my room even after I repeatedly told them to let me get changed and to leave.

Parents POV: The only thing I can really see from their point of view is that my cords were on my bed, and they have told me many times not to have them there. However, I feel like it is common courtesy to wait for me to get dressed, before they do what they wanted to do, as I was not against them putting the cord behind the wall, but was just against the time in which they did it, since it violated my privacy.

The babysitter is someone new (our regular is busy that day), a college kid who will be home for break who nannies. We discussed possibly having her babysit during winter break, too. We met up last month at a park to get to know each other and for her to meet the kids. I thought it went well and made the plans for her to babysit the kids this Wed.

Important context: I've got 3 kids, 12F, 5F, 5F. The 5yo twins are both autistic and non-verbal. One elopes occassionally. We go do quite a few things as a family, but of course the twins take some extra prep and vigilance when we do, as well as it takes understanding their non-verbal communication to make outings go smooth and so everyone has fun. No one besides myself, my husband, and my MIL have taken them both out solo, and my MIL only does rarely or in super safe spaces for them.

When we met up, the babysitter mentioned taking them places and she has a nanny group where they all get together and take the kids they nanny places, like the zoo, kids gyms, etc. I told her I wouldnt be comfortable with that because of all the reasons I mentioned here.

I just confirmed with her now about Wed and she mentioned taking them to the zoo. I said again Im not comfortable with that and prefer they stay home (which I will be WFH in my office in the basement). 

I'm getting nervous that she doesnt quite understand how much work the kids are, and if she'll even want to continue babysitting for us once she does. My husband said my MIL just got her schedule and will have the day off Wed and offered to watch the kids. We're a bit tight on money, so that would help us quite a bit.

G and I have been best friends for over a year now and I've liked the guy since I met him, which was around April of 2021.

There have been several points where G and I have been around people that go to my school.

If people ask me if we're dating I either don't answer or say no because I know if he gets shamed for it, it'll be at least partially my fault and I probably won't be able to get over that.

I (F20) moved across states to be with my boyfriend (38M) a year ago. 
I immediately started a full time job in childcare, and maintain a workout routine of some sort of strength training every other day. I want to get stronger, but have a history of exercise addiction, and am recovering from a 9 year eating disorder. He knows this. I used to go crazy with cardio. Then when I met him and wasn’t scared to put on muscle, I started strength training. But the past two years, I’ve been trying to find something that works for me. My goals keep changing.

He workouts out 5-6 times a week, multiple hour long sessions. But he has more time than me, as he has only ever worked part time, and is currently unemployed. 

Many times, he has told me he thinks I need to go harder. Each time he sees me workout, he questions it. “are you sure that’s heavy enough? Looks light, go harder. When I workout im sweating.” 

When I slowed down my workout schedule and was just walking for cardio, and then light strength 3-4x a week. He said I needed to  do more cardio, that I’m capable of so much more and he doesn’t understand why I’m not giving it my all. 

I’ve told him many times that this doesn’t encourage me, it makes me feel bad. This is *my* fitness journey, and I feel like everything I do has to go through him for approval. “Who told you that formula? I’ve never seen anyone do this and make gains. You’re wasting your potential. You’re a woman and have limited time. You don’t try hard enough.” After hearing all of this, even though I know his intent, we agreed not to talk about it because it hurts me a lot. I’m trying. I don’t have the motivation to do anything after work, but I still do it. We are in a bad living situation, I have no family here, and some days I just want to lay in bed and sulk. But I manage to get a workout in. That’s what makes me proud of myself. But somehow its still not enough. 

Yet it comes up again two days ago. We do a workout together and he beats me by 5 reps. He brings this up multiple times and says “why is a 38 year old working harder than a 20 year old?” “Why am I the only one putting in effort with workouts.” “You dont understand how lucky you are to be young and be able to make gains, keep doing what you’re doing and you’re only going to be slightly above average, this should motivate you to go harder.” 

 I tell him I work more than he does, I am trying to balance my life, and he shuts me down and says these are all excuses. 

No matter what I do, I never feel like I’m enough in life. I’m proud of what I do in each workout, but hearing this, even though his intent is to motivate me, just kicks me down. 
He apologized, but I know even he has made excuses in the past. He quit a $200 workout program he convinced me to buy with him, because it was “too long and boring.” Yet tells me that working out shouldn’t be about enjoyment.

He wants to be a power fitness couple, but at this point I don’t want to do anything in front of him.
