(I understand that was a bad decision, keep in mind I was 11). what followed after summer break was harsh bullying for the rest of my middle school career. over the summer i had apologized profusely. but still i was met with bullying. this bullying wasn't directed to the shitty thing i had done but rather that I was an unfunny, ugly, unworthy person of friends or attention.

This persisted through 7th and the beginning of 8th grade, when they finally moved away. a big reason why the bullying continued was that we where in the same friend group and all of my friends remained friends with this person despite seeing them bully me in front of them. they told me it was no big deal and that i was being dramatic and ""I've seen them, its not that bad, i'm friends with them they would never do that."" when they moved away I thought I was free. that I could be OK again. but a few members of my friend group picked up right where my original bully had left off. This time without the history of me doing something stupid. They told me it was all my fault that everything i had gone through was on me . That's followed me into high school. Because of what happened. i have a hard time getting close to people, i don't trust my new friends not to turn on me. recently I've be having panic attacks because of what happened in middle school.

Is it really my fault like they said it was? Was this stupid thing I did when I was 11 a valid reason to give me long lasting anxiety and trust issues? Am I to blame for everything I went through?

and to add to the fact, this wasn’t the only instance of their ableism towards me being present in the group. a friend in the group (lets call him brian,) would constantly fling derogatory names my way, would constantly make stereotypical jokes about me, once even found a way to hack into one of my private social media accounts just to find info to use against me (hence why i made a new anonymous reddit account) and so much more. at first i didnt really care because i let a lot of my friends off with joking about my neurodivergency with me, but its more about the fact that he constantly makes these jabs at me, no matter how inappropriate the timing is. i was getting pretty uncomfortable, so i asked my older sister to tell him to stop. she did, but he didn’t listen to her. so, i asked her to tell him again, but she didn’t. now i have to deal with the constant bullying of her friend group and the burden that my older sister chose her friends over me. 

hopefully i explained the situation well enough, but i can elaborate on some parts if needed. part of me thinks i am overreacting, part of me feels guilty for not taking some kind of accountability in these situations, and part of me is hurt from my sister not helping me when i needed it. at this point, i dont even want to be included in the group anymore because of this.

Jane said she was fine and had drunk a little bit. But She couldn't name her friends (except her best friend) or the pub they had attended. She wouldn't be so irresponsible to drive while intoxicated. So, I asked her to check her phone. I wanted to investigate her bank account, photos, and location history to see if they confirmed her claims.

She started to throw a fit because I was controlling and toxic and said she would go to my in-laws' house. I had preemptively taken the car keys from her, so I told her that she should ask her parents to pick her up. I couldn't drive her because someone had to look after our son.

When my in-laws arrived, they started arguing. My mother-in-law sided with Jane, but my father-in-law said his daughter had behaved like a teenager and he wouldn't support her. Hence, they left without her.

Jane is sleeping while I'm writing, and she's getting better. In the end, there isn't any concrete evidence that someone doped her. And now I'm wondering if I overreacted and was paranoid.

Three months passed and I wasn’t able to properly move on as E had asked me to wait for him to get out of bootcamp (bad idea) he finally contacted me a week of him getting out and we talked for a bit. He’d changed and it wasn’t a good change it was like I meant nothing and he hadn’t cared that I’d been miserable for months. We fought numerous times almost every time we talked.
After talking with my bsf and sister they both told me it wasn’t healthy to let him lead me on and I fully realized it wasn’t what I deserved nor wanted. I texted him asking to talk to him and in summary I asked for closure and why he was acting like nothing between us ever happened. He didn’t respond instead D texted me after I hadn’t talked to her in months she told me to “leave him alone and that he wanted nothing to do with me” I told her that I’d just asked for closure so I could heal and move on with my life. She attacked me and came at me and I finally defended myself and she admitted to sleeping with him when E and I were together and then a friend of hers texted me and admitted the same. 
D and I fought over text for a while and here where I might be the AH she told me and I quote, “At least my family raised me to work for my own money” implying that I was a gold digger, I told her in response, “At least mine raised me to not be a baby momma at 15 and how to keep my legs closed”. D became absolutely livid and she started coming at me for bringing her kid into the fight which most people say I didn’t. Her friend texted me calling me a “b*tch and how bringing D’s kid into it was a low blow” then E’s little sister came at me too and told me that “blocking them wouldn’t fix the problem”.

Not wanting things to snowball and the issue would go from the size of a pebble to a boulder so I stepped back and talked to my husband.(found out later when they ""joked"" and people laughed it was because they knew the truth whereas we didn't) it hurt but again sticks and stones.

A couple months ago his great grandmother passed away I attended the funeral with him to be his comfort/support person as he has NEVER lost anyone in his life.

We have talked about it extensively, yes it hurt him that I can't be there, but he gets it.
I always make my secret family cake recipe for holidays, my immediate and extended in-laws always ask for it when there is a gathering, dinner, or event.

The baby's dad is not in the picture but she has a new boyfriend. I adopted ""May"" out of foster care as a teen, so I didn't raise her and she has stronger emotional ties to her bio-family which is normal. She almost always spends holidays with bio-family, a boyfriend's family or a friend's family instead of me. In fact, we've only spent a couple holidays together in the 7 years since she was placed with me. She prefers to stop by, pick up her gifts and leave. She has almost never given me a holiday gift or card although she gives lavishly to her bio-family and to her friends' and boyfriends' families.

May likes to set me up for humiliation. She likes to make a big deal out of accepting an invitation from me, then not show up or call. She likes it best if I'm left with a big bill, an unused ticket or an empty table. The more other guests see it, the better she likes it. In fact, enough other people saw her pull that stunt enough times, they got the idea that they should stand me up too, or wander in late whenever. I take a lot of effort to cook a good meal so it sucks to be stood up.

In 2019, the last time I hosted Thanksgiving, May and her boyfriend stood me up again along with another couple. A third couple showed up 45 minutes after I started putting the food away because nobody was coming. I decided I would never host another holiday meal again. Instead I travel like I did before I decided to adopt. I told May that she was an adult and could do what she wanted on holidays but I was not going to let her treat me badly anymore.

This year something came up and had to cancel my travel plans and stay home, but my niece invited me to T-day at her house and I accepted. Yesterday May invited me to T-day at her new boyfriend's family's house. I turned it down because I'd already accepted my niece's invitation and there was a time conflict. Also, back in 2017 May and a different boyfriend invited me to a holiday dinner at that boyfriend's family's house, but they hadn't told the hostess (whom I had never met). I showed up uninvited like an idiot with a bottle of wine. I have never met this new boyfriend's family either so I figure it might be the same prank again. The setup is identical.

I may be the AH since my daughter is mad and I could have cancelled with my niece.

This persisted through 7th and the beginning of 8th grade, when they finally moved away. a big reason why the bullying continued was that we where in the same friend group and all of my friends remained friends with this person despite seeing them bully me in front of them. they told me it was no big deal and that i was being dramatic and ""I've seen them, its not that bad, i'm friends with them they would never do that."" when they moved away I thought I was free. that I could be OK again. but a few members of my friend group picked up right where my original bully had left off.

Tonight we drive down to see them as we were doing our Thanksgiving dinner with them as we are doing Thanksgiving with my side this year. We get to their house to find out that the nieces and nephews have also been sick with colds. Ok fine I can live with that as we were getting over stuff too. My Mother in law was talking about one of the kids who was going to come later, “E,” saying that that she was throwing up and had a temperature so she clearly wasn’t feeling good. I was panicking thinking that she would come and infect our kids with the stomach bug and I was telling my husband that I wasn’t comfortable with her being there around the kids as they would have been all playing together. He didn’t care at all. He gave me the excuse of that the kids will just catch it at daycare anyway.

I enjoy it, but I’ve only been on 2 VERY easy, top rope, climbs. He wants to do a much harder, lead climb (no top rope) with me, but I don’t feel experienced enough for that. It’s 200 foot climb, two 100 foot pitches. The thing is, he wants ME to belay HIM. For those who do not know what that is, i would be feeding him rope from the ground, pulling and giving slack as needed, but, if he falls, I’m supposed to catch him. Now, the issue here is, my dad is almost 300 pounds. I, am 95 pounds. If he falls, then he goes straight down and I get drug up the side of the rock face. We did some practice (not on a wall, simulated it in a small empty workshop) and every time I failed he would say things like “if I die, it will be your fault and no amount of therapy will fix that” (he is avidly against therapy and hate that I go) “you fuck up like this on the rock face and my blood will be on your hands”I’ve been having nightmares that he died and it’s my fault. I don’t feel like I can keep myself or him safe on the wall. I’m a very inexperienced climber, I’m not ready for this. I love my dad, but I’m nervous about telling him that I don’t want to do this. We are an Asian family, and he expects perfection from me. I’ve done ONE belay practice, not even on a vertical wall. Today. In the workshop. With him yelling at me every-time I made a minor mistake. Every time he tells me it will be my fault if he dies, he follows it up with “I know you can do this!” And other, pressuring flattery. I don’t feel like I can tell him I don’t want to do this, but I also don’t feel like I can make this climb. The part where I’m wondering if I would be an asshole, is the fact that I know he is very excited to do this climb, and he has no one else to go with, and I don’t want to ruin this for him. My dad loves climbing, and he wants me to love it to,and I do, but the level of stress I’m under wondering if I’m going to be the one at fault for my dads death is to difficult to think around.

Second time in a week addressed to the same name but at our address. Last time they wanted money and I turned it away, this time it was paid for and my roommate accepted the delivery thinking it was for someone else in the house.

None of us ordered it. I texted a friend with the same name as the delivery to see if she was involved. Wasn't her. We live on East Whatever Street, and in the past have received stuff for West Whatever Street. It's a mix up and its fallen on the person who ordered it or the restaurant, but that's not what happened this time. We didn't know whose it was so we kept it and started eating it. $50 of food.

45 minutes later, our neighbor who apparently ordered the pizza comes over banging on our door demanding her food. I missed this part playing video games with headphones on. The woman had told the other roomies it was supposed to be addressed to her house number and she'd written our number by mistake (again). She screamed at my roommate and told her she was a shitty person and shitty neighbor and wanted 60 dollars for her food, which my roommate told her she didn't have. So she left not taking what food was left or getting any money. Her family had no take out food for dinner. Kind of a bummer.

When I found out she'd come over I went across the street to their house to see if I could make nice and Venmo her the money and we'd split between the roommates. No oine answered the knocks or the doorbell cam thing.

In retrospect I could have called the number on the order next to the name to try and figure it out. Or called the pizza place. But even if the pizza place took it back, it might be too late for them to re-delivery? But I didn't think of any of those things at the time. It just seemed like that Monopoly card where an error happens in your favor.

I don't mind apologizing and giving them money if we're in the wrong, but it also seems like the neighbor messed up and it's kind on them. Whatever service she ordered through may give her money back, whoever she did send the food to the wrong house.

my buddy Kent and i (both 22m) are both car fanatics. today (about an hour ago) he asked me to drive to connecticut with him, to potentially buy a car. we do live 4 states away but this is our hobby, and we will drive anywhere to get a good car.


i personally was very excited about this trip. well my fiance (20f) came home crying from work. there's a coworker she has trouble with a lot, so the crying isn't uncommon. i told her about my trip, and my friend Kent was about to come get me and drive there.


her face dropped and immediately turned into anger. she yelled at me ""REALLY? I COME HOME FROM A SHIT DAY. AND YOURE SPRINGING ON ME THAT YOURE JUST GOING OFF AND LEAVING???"" she sobbed and refused my hug. i offered her to come and she still yelling, says she has to work and she just wanted to spend time together. it instantly ruined my mood. we are in the car now and i think Kent can tell im in a bad mood now.


i personally think she is over reacting. yes - i told her at the last minute. but we are adults, this is my free time on the weekend, we don't have to be together all the time. i am only going on the weekend. will be back sunday night. we spend enough time together, almost every single day. i just want to hang out for once without her.


so reddit, Am I The Asshole?


TLDR; my friend Kent and i (both 22m) just started on an impromptu trip to Connecticut to see a car. i told my fiance 20f when she got home and she started sobbing,  didn't hug or kiss me goodbye. and acted mad about my trip rather than happy for me. she made me feel like TA for being excited about my trip saying that i ""sprung it on her"". i just want to hang out without her sometimes but she's so clingy",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4804852,public,top,self,AITA for going on an impromptu trip with my buddy (both 22m),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yz0l6q/aita_for_going_on_an_impromptu_trip_with_my_buddy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I(20f) have a good friend, Ana(21f) and we’ve been friends since middle school. In Ana’s senior year, she disappeared after the first month of school. I was ghosted. I went to her house, asked her grandma(who was her legal guardian at the time), her brother, and it seemed like she didn’t even exist. 

Then in my senior year, I was at work and I saw her. We reconnected, hung out a few times, she ignores my questions, and then I meet her fiancé. He’s okay, I guess. I got a weird vibe from him, but I figured, she knows him better than I do, what do I know? And then she introduces me to her son. 

I was shocked. She was a senior in high school when she got pregnant, and the baby’s father is hardly in the picture. 

Okay. That happens. 

But then a few things come to mind. She doesn’t have a drivers license, she takes Uber to her job, her fiancé doesn’t work but is looking to work soon, you can tell my judgment came to mind. 

I felt like a b***h, because I was judging my friend when I don’t know the whole story.

So I smile, nod, and be her friend. I don’t say anything. Until now. 

I moved recently, so I can’t hang with her anymore but we FaceTime and text, and today she texted me, if I could loan her $50. I ask why? It’s for bills, presents, food, etc. 

I didn’t know what to say. I have the money, but from her actions, I didn’t know if what she was saying is true. I immediately thought back to when my parents said to never give people on the street money, they could you use it for drugs and alcohol, so I said no. 

She asks me why. So I tell her, her irresponsibility is not my responsibility. She still doesn’t have her license, after saying she would get it, how can I be sure she’d pay me back? 

I thought me being logical was the right decision but she told me I was being a bad friend, that of course she would pay me back, but I still said no. 

I told this to my parents, who said I did the right thing but I shouldn’t have said that she was irresponsible, but I feel like what I said was true.

She pretty much hates me, but forces a fake relationship. 
Recently, our last grandparent passed away. We have a very blended family and this was an odd hit (paternal grandmother passed away / father passed away 16 years ago, we only have one parent remaining). During the days of the out of state funeral which we travelled together to, my sister lost control of herself and had several complete meltdowns. Blamed me for not being supportive and not hugging her when she was sad when our father died, 16 years ago. Not caring she is emotional and not dealing with death well. It’s too fresh and she needed support and it was my duty to provide it apparently and I failed her as a sister. She hollered for not defending her when I was six years old and she was being picked on. For me getting married first, and having kids first. I should have waited for her since she was older. She exploded and unloaded. I didn’t say anything, just walked away and left, as I do not feel her emotional issues are my burden. (I did not leave her alone, I just removed myself from the situation).
I’m being called the AH for walking away when she was mid-breakdown, knowing how emotional she is. The majority of those who know the situation think I should be more sensitive at times, but she is also out of control and they support my actions of disengaging and walking away. But I do not think it is my responsibility to cater to my older sisters heavy emotions, that have somehow been my burden for 30+ years. Who holds a 30 year grudge over something I do not even remember? It wasn’t mentioned until now. 
These were my family members, too. And she’s never hugged me, asked about me or tried to see outside her own world and her own feelings to think that maybe losing our family was hard for me, too. It’s all about her. 
So, Reddit, am I the AH for physically turning and walking away from an adult in the middle of a public emotional meltdown? Should I have stayed and provided the sympathy she wanted? I wouldn’t have meant it if I did and don’t feel as if I should be an emotional punching bag just because we share blood.

This post does involve a conflict between me and my bf (I'm a gf obviously), but it has nothing to do with our relationship. Rule 6 and 10 out of the way. As I said, I'm freshly 17 and my boyfriend Tyrac is 20 pushing 21. We're part of the same genealogical generation, generation Z. I'm what they call a hopeful romantic; I like romanticizing my life in every way possible. Because of this, I come off as wanting my life to be like a movie. But that's not true, I want a happy start, climax, and ending. Skip the terrible times, don't kill me to make me stronger, screw the theatrics, re-happen that classic, give me the real thang, give me the magic, let me watch my funeral before I die, roll the credits. I'm trying to live my best life.

Movies like *The Polar Express*, *Tangled, Hannah Montana: The Movie, Me Before You, Mean Girls, Tall Girl*, *Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse*, *From Justin to Kelly*, and Beyonce's *Renaissance Visual Project* that are almost sickeningly happy through and throughout, at least from my admittedly nayive perception, have inspired me to live happy if this was a movie. It's less of ignoring problems and more vibing and enjoying crying when you can. I've trained myself to not be sad because all this crying in my room is cute. Nothing new but my outlook. I'm telling you this useless information (help me) because I recently watched a movie that influenced a convo with Tyrac. I can't tell y'all the movie because I'd definitely get clowned/pennywised for it.

So on that day, I’d just gotten home from a cheerleading practice that unfortunately brought my spirits down more than I usually allow them to. I facetimed Tyrac because that felt like the natural continuation of my plot. Near the start of the call, I remembered the movie I had watched previously. I can't give off too much, but it involved time travel, an age gap, or both to correct each such. I have said too much. Anyway, I told Tyrac ""Your aura's moonstone, you should've been born in 1989! You were born in the wrong generation."" What I thought was an interesting analytic of his personality is what he called high... er, he called me high!

I was shocked, but still vibes. I had no idea he’d take so much offense at me implying that he’s like a Millennial. If you knew Tyrac yourself, I'm confident that you'd think the same. Whatever, this was necessary harmless drama for this chapter in my hopefully more than metaphorical story. Either way, I was already planning on how I was going to go about with treating Tyrac as more of a 33 year old than a 20 year old. I expressed this all to him on facetime and he was completely against the idea. As the argument got more and more heated, I told him that I hope our near future is like *The Fault in our Stars* because I really romanticize that. My character would be full of felicity!

Tonight she came back from going out and basically told me she started talking with a guy there and he seemed to have a bit of a thing for her, and that being honest she kinda did too but feels really bad for feeling that way. We talked about it a little tonight n she expressed when I asked if she chose me still, to which she says yes. I asked just to clarify if they did anything and she said well they didn't but there was definitely some emotional tension.  I wasn't sure wether it was fair to say, but I did say I don't think I'd be happy with her persueing any sort of close friendship with this guy. Whilst I don't have issues with her feeling that way other than being worried currently, I feel her persueing something with this guy would almost inevitably turn into emotional if not physical cheating.  


This kinda feels extra bad cause it was just the other day she said she'd be worried about being attracted to me if I started hormones which I'm unsure if I want to but if I do decide to is a very real prospect.

So I'll try to make this short, my girlfriend of 5 months started staying over at my place more often then not. No quite moving in, but we're at the phase where she's leaving clothes and her bathroom stuff at my place. 

We've already hit a few road bumps, but the biggest one so far is her getting mad at me about my bar of soap. She's made at me for not washing my left behind hair off of it. 

Honestly when she brang it up, I laughed a bit. She was chewing me out like I was a child for leaving hair on my own personal soap. 

She says it's disgusting and she fully expects me to run it under water until I get every piece of my hair off of it. That's a waste of soap. Not a lot, but still wasteful.

It's my soap, she doesn't use it.

When I told her she was over reacting to a simple thing, she called me an asshole.

I shot back that I never give her trouble about the mess she makes of my bathroom with all her products. Her response was that it was different. 

Different how?

I ended up telling her that this argument was dumb and I'd like to be done with it so we could move on with our day. 

She wouldn't back down and tried to make it a bigger thing then it was, I'm starting to think she was fishing for an argument. 

I finally raised my voice and told her to stop. 

She called me an asshole again and left.

&amp;#x200B;

She came back the next day and acted like nothing happened, and I went with it.

Sadly, she decided she'd get her way by throwing my soap in the trash when she found hair on it. 

Her excuse, ""It was dirty, so I tossed it out."" 

Say what you want. But I grabbed that thing out of the trash bin, rinsed it off and put it back.

&amp;#x200B;

She flipped out about it. This time because I took something out of the trash. 

She yelled at me for being a controlling asshole. 

I took her home myself this time.

Went back to my place, sat for a bit.

And now I don't know what to do.

I (20F) went back home for the summer break. There were 2 men working there.

One day I was reorganising some papers when I heard someone screaming for help outside of the house. 
I ran down the stairs to go outside and there I saw one of the construction workers on his back not able to move on the stairs made of stones in the garden. 

He basically fell right on his head on the hard stairs and was heavily bleeding. In that moment my brain froze and my body took over, I called the ambulance and put pressure on his wound as I asked him basic questions like « what’s your name » « what day is it »… the man had a memory reset every 30 seconds and I was all alone with him for 30 minutes.
The ambulances finally made it and he was treated adequately.

Fast forward to last month, I received 10 texts and phone calls from the man where he said he wanted to see me and thank me because « without you I’ll be gone » but to be honest even thinking about him makes me freeze and so scared. I don’t think I could ever see him again even if he really wants to. I am so glad he is okay but seriously traumatised from this event.

I told him I was hesitating because I wanted to live closer to a new job that's about to start. He started asking about it, somehow got the impression it's an awful place to work. Then he started asking what I can do, what qualifications I have and other normal interview questions. Soon he offered to work in his company, get training, trainee salary that would eventually go up, described this role and what I would be doing, all of it sounded very normal yet I was suspicious. Later I messaged him saying I won't rent the room, but I'll give the job a go. It seemed like a nice opportunity, I figured if he had an issue with me refusing the rental, his motivations would be clear so I wouldn't go. To my surprise his response was completely unbothered. But when I started the job next week and almost instantly he asked am I sure I don't want to be his flatmate, we're both single...Not to mention he misled me about how many people work there, it was me, him...and one other guy. It's true he needed staff though, he used to be all by himself doing 15h crazy shifts, only few months ago the other worker started, and my role there surely took some load off his shoulders. He made it clear he wants someone long term, he keeps asking can I do this job permanently. I tell him it's way too early to make any lifelong decisions. I know 100% I will quit, this job is very different from what he described, he made it sound much nicer, the raise in salary is years away too. He's always very condescending and snide, assumes everything I do is wrong, his perception of things is higher in every way, not just work related, I get ridiculed or just snippy remarks constantly. Another thing is, when the other colleague is not around, he constantly reminds that the room is mine to rent, keeps asking me out, keeps asking about my private life, I told him in a million different ways that I am not interested, in a calm way as I'm afraid if I piss him off too much, I'll lose my only source of income. He is convinced there is noone better for me, apparently he is such a ’good man’ and he really seems to believe that...He's 46 and only now decided is the time to have a family and children, and wants me (30F) for this. Normally I'd quit with no hesitation, but at the moment I am out of options, the crisis hit hard, I'm moving to a new place so I simply cannot be unemployed, not even for a short while.

I have a friend we can call Joshua, Joshua grew up atheist/agnostic, even being a satanist for a while.

That said, he has attempted to convert me (and some of our mutuals) pretty much daily since he joined this church (they're a local Baptist church that's incredibly strict) he has also made comments about not wanting me to go to hell for my ""perversions"" (mind you, he and I have done a *lot* and he's not exactly straight himself)

He however brought a gift, I was thankful, until I opened it, he had purchased me a book, a book about how I should believe in Jesus, by an author I already know of, who writes very Pascal's Wager-y nonsense. I waited until he was alone and handed it back to him and said ""I have asked you before to stop this, I don't appreciate it, and I don't want it, please respect that""

He immediately lost it, went off on me for ""denying god's love and glory"" and ""insulting"" him as a Christian.

We are planning to move to other country for few months-because (M) needs and wants to go there for work. He is letting his flat where we live now for this period of time, and we plan to rent a flat in the new place together.

I managed to negotiate to work remotely during this period of time, to be able to join him.

I would like to rent place in a peaceful and safe area, near the sea-side as I will be spending there most of my time working. He wants to live walkable/cyclable distance from his work place. Area where I want to live is max 15 min by the car from his work.

For the context: 2/3 of our cohabitation time together so far I was commuting to work 2h while his commute was 15 min(we live in his place that he chosen when we were already together);when we travelled to other(different) country for his work in the past for few months, we lived minutes away from his work(he was given the place by the employee) and I was commuting by the car to my work there.

He also wants to invite several friends and family members over to stay in our flat that we will rent in the new place, and is saying 'yes' to people if they ask or invite them himself without discussing it with me first.

I am not happy about that, because our apartment will be also my office, and I do not want it to be a hotel for people wanting to use it for their holiday(his friends and family can afford to rent a place to stay in this country easily if they want to visit us). I am also not happy to pay rent for potentially bigger place to accommodate guests.  We will be paying 50/50. My work is demanding and I am easily distracted when working from home.

He calls me not generous and difficult. I think that it is his turn to compromise on the accommodation and that it is not ok to just agreeing for people to stay over (for at least a week at a time) in the place we share and the place I work at. He claims that 'it is not the same in this situation'(about me compromising on place where we lived so far), and that I am being rude and controlling by not agreeing for people to stay over if they want to visit ('because they will fly all the way to see us').

So long story here. I live in college dorm rooms, and I have an ESA. Im working on getting her into a better place but it’s tough right now. My cat Lila sleeps with me. She was a barn cat I adopted, she’s very shy but is social when you get to know her. 
Anyways, I was sleeping in on a Friday morning. Fridays I don’t have classes until 11, so I usually sleep until 10. Around 9:30 I woke up to abrupt, loud banging on my door. I could tell it was obviously two people banging on the door. I usually don’t answer my door unless I know the people knocking. So I wake up startled, my cat runs and hides, and I get up and put pants and a shirt on and open the door thinking there’s an emergency. 
My friend and three other girls greet me at the door and come inside. I’m not sure why I let them in, I barely know them. I just woke up and didn’t really know what was going on. They stayed for a while. My friend led them in, knowing I don’t hang out with them or really know them. We were all visibly uncomfortable, I looked like shit and was worried about my cat. 
Here’s where I may have been the asshole. Once they left and I found my cat (she had hidden for an hour and was shaking), and I really started to wake up, I got pissed and texted my friend. My view was that he knows my cat is shy, he knows she gets scared easily, and still banged on my door. And even if he wasn’t trying to be loud it’s always loud, the hallways echo every noise and it was loud enough for Lila to run and hide in fear, which just made me mad because I am very protective over her. We fought for a while and he eventually blocked me. Long story short, I started out calm saying “Hey, you can’t see Lila anymore, that wasn’t okay”. He replied back with stuff like “didn’t realize banging on your door would be so scary, didn’t realize you didn’t like being woken up at 9:30 on a weekday”. I got more frustrated by his lack of self awareness and things escalated. I told him I would always protect my cat before someone’s feelings. He kept saying things that lowkey sounded like gaslighting to me, like “why is the only option of protecting Lila hurting someone’s feelings” and “I thought we were friends who can communicate without hurting each others feelings, especially after I already acknowledged that I fucked up”. He never said that he realized he messed up and he never apologized. He also said that he “just wanted to be playful and wake you up the way people at my old college woke me up”. I don’t see how he thinks that just because people did it to him and he was okay with it that means that everyone else will of course be okay with it. Eventually I said I didn’t give a shit about his feelings because he was acting very ignorant about what happened, saying “it wasn’t that loud”. I told him I wasn’t going to give kindness to someone who didn’t give it to me. 
I haven’t spoken to him since and my other friends are saying I was too harsh.

(Fake subject)

All of us did research during the semester for this assignment. It was decided that when putting the assignment together, that then we will address plagiarism. (At that stage everything was just sourced from other documents, copied and pasted). 

There was 4 questions. 1 question being an illustration question and 1 being an extra long questions with sub questions under it.

After putting the assignment together (everything still plagiarised) it was decided that Ali (fake name) would do 3 questions and Belle (fake name) the other 3 and I the remaining 2 questions of that extra long one.

Take in mind, that I was responsible for also 2 questions full questions outside of the 2 small questions from the large one.

Belle was responsible for the illustration question.

I later asked for help in about doing 3 pages of plagiarism from Ali since it was a lot of work.

I also then created the final document putting everything nice and doing the nitty gritty stuff like table of contents, bibliography, in text referencing (they just put links up and I had to search for every source and put that also in), spell check, format etc.

When submitting the assignment on Turnitin, the plagiarism was in the mid 20's. Did I freak out when I saw that! Even if you subtract the coverpage of our college, it forms 20% plagiarism. 

All of the plagiarism is from Ali and Belle (mine was just 1 paragraph). Several of their stuff was highligted, not lying pages straight up without any spaces, all just plagiarized. 

So even with the 3 pages that Ali helped me out with I went and had to redo it on my own anyway because all of it was plagiarized.

I then went and fixed all their stuff, and notified Ali that I won't be doing any of the work for the presentation.

I will admit Ali did do her fair share of work, but I also did my fair share of work. I am not mad at Ali, but at Belle. Belle did the least amount of research on the assignment out of all of us, got the easiest 3 questions of the long one, and still every page of her was plagiarized. EVERY PAGE. She only had 3 pages of plagiarizm to fix while me and Ali fixed at least 10 pages each. The illustration Belle did was not very good either. 

It is near end exams, and I just feel that since Belle did so little, she should be responsible for handling the presentation.

My bf quit his job 2 months ago because he was burned out and decided to take a sabbatical as he made a lot of money in the years he worked. 

When I came home from work exhausted, I really had my mind set on eating this tuna mix I had. I know it sounds super specific and dumb, but I really had my heart set on that all day. I had 3 tin cans, but when I got home they were all gone.

I confronted him saying that I come home tired after 8h of work and he just sat around all day. 

He said was planning on going to the shop 10min away to replace them and do the other shopping he offered to do. But apparently the whole chain of shops was closed down because there were some legal problems (was all over the news the next day).

He went 40min roundtrip (he made a note of mentioning this) to another shop, but they didn't have the items he ate so he could replace them. But he did get me a bunch of other stuff, that I could eat with minimal preparation.

I told him I don't like the stuff he got me and he said that I had eaten these things before, and he thought this would be ok, at least as a substitute for one night.

He apologized for the situation, saying that when he ate those things he had every intention of replacing them, but he got screwed that the shop carrying those items was closed down (for the first time in 20 years). And that he didn't leave me with nothing but left a substitute. 

I asked why he didnt order them online (quick 20min service), and he said that it literally never crossed his mind until the moment I suggested it. And I said to him that online order is still available so he should order all the things for me.

He then send me a long and very formal apology like the one you get from HR (it's clear he was being sarcastic and not really that sorry), like ""I'm very sorry of this unfortunate situation and that you had to endure such hardship"". And transferred me money for me to order. He actually transferred me double the amount for the items he ate, so that it covered the minimum order.

But I still felt screwed over, because he went through my house and ate my food without asking first, didn't inform me that he failed to replace them. He offered to help me with shopping because I would get home late and tired (which made me feel loved and that I could rely on him), but when I got home I felt a bit betrayed and that I can't rely on him in general to help me out, or do what he says he is gonna do.

This evening, baby was sleeping in his crib when I started feeling unwell too, so i went to bed. An hour later, baby started crying and husband took him downstairs. When sometime later I heard husband making a bottle for him, I told him I could do it (was feeling a bit better). He told me to get some rest and he would do it.

Now husband has stormed off to go sleep on the attic, because he's pissed that I put the lights on. Baby is now my responsibility since he won't do shit anymore. AITA for putting on the light?


More context if needed: Baby hasn't been feeling well for a few days, and yesterday he had a fever too. In the evening I took him and went to the emergency room because I was uncertain about his breathing. At home at night, baby was crying a lot, me and husband went to him a few times for his pacifier. At 6 in the morning he started crying again, and I took him to our bed to keep him calm. At 7:30 our toddler (2) started screaming: mummy! My husband picked her out of bed and put her with us, knowing our baby was there too. Immediately, baby woke up and I got angry. I told him to go out of bed because baby had a bad night sleep and is sick, and I wanted to let him sleep some more.

Because this happened in the morning I was even more pissed about what happened tonight. Husband is good at complaining about all he has to do and that he can't game enough. When I want to help with the bottle he declines, but later on makes me feel guilty. So AITA or not?

Relevant info about the tickets. The box is a owned by a competitor to the company wife works for. We get tickets through my relationship with the competitor company. My relationship with the competitor company predates my relationship with my wife. And the services that I use at the competitor company aren’t all offered by my wife’s employer. 

My wife recalls… Wife telling me about how much she loved the artist and grew up listening to her. How she didn’t want to sit in the box because it’s her competitor. She wanted to be in the crowd. How I never mentioned that we were going to switch seats or be in the box at all.  How I dropped that info on her when she was getting ready for the show. 

I recall… we both were excited for the concert, but she never said anything to make me think she was a super fan. I really don’t remember if I talked to her about swapping seats. Maybe I did tell her, maybe not. It was months ago. 

Before leaving for the concert, I mentioned to the wife about swapping seats and when. I was just trying to go through our plan for the night. It was immediately apparent that she was not happy with this plan. 

At the concert, there was a little tension from wife, to say the least. Wife had no issue making it know that she was mad at me. Then when we switched seats and were sitting next to my parents in the box, she turns and whispers to me “I fucking hate you”, then turns back to the show to continue watching. 

Wife says that I choose my brother over her. Something wife tells me I do at times. 

My brother recognized that my wife was fiery on the ride back to our house with the whole family. Once everyone left, wife continued to justify her position and that it was all my fault because I ruined her night and I knew how much wife loved this artist and wife knew all her songs.

I’d had a few friends around, one of my friends was in his first ever committed relationship, we’re all super happy for him.

He mentioned that he’s having problems sharing a bed with her, she kicks, this led to a few of my friends laughing and sharing a few stories of their own…I did join in and said that sometimes sleeping next to my wife was like sleeping next to an old man, but I didn’t really go much into details other than mentioning she drools (not a problem)

In reality it’s that she’s diabetic, type 1, and whilst normally in range when her sugars are high she’s up and down every 5 minutes for the loo!! This is personal, didn’t say it to my friends (they don’t need to know) it’s just gotten worse since we had a baby because now bathroom + baby keeps me awake.

I suppose she overheard because she got super pouty, said she didn’t appreciate the joke and that she’d sleep elsewhere since I didn’t wanna share with grandpa, I may have laughed at that (**wrong thing to do!!**)

I apologised and mentioned that my friends were sharing stories and honestly what I said wasn’t overly embarrassing! She said “I don’t care, I’m not their partner” I apologised again, she said she’d sleep elsewhere but I’m sleeping on the sofa so she doesn’t have to - ironically enough though she’s still proving my point as the baby has yet to cry but she’s up and down for the loo (like an old person)

I honestly don’t think I’m this much of an AH in this situation?

I only work a couple days a week at a pet clinic and I work with the same person every shift, Maddy. Our job consists of taking care of animals and cleaning the clinic after hours when everyone leaves, and the work is usually split 50/50 but about two or three weeks ago I’ve been doing 90% of our work by myself. 
One reason being she always schedules her dog’s appointments on days we’re working so she has to be with him when the vet sees him (which I don’t understand personally, schedule his appointments when you don’t work). This has happened multiple times and she’ll even mention his upcoming appointments on our shifts which honestly just piss me off to the max. 
Another reason is she’ll just stand around and try to chit chat with almost everyone, but the catch is that it’s not a conversation, she’ll just repeat the same 6 stories and she doesn’t give you time to respond other than ‘right’, ‘yeah’, and ‘no’. It’s gotten to the point where she will just follow me around talking to me while I do OUR job. It’s also not just people in the clinic but she’ll get or make numerous phone calls to her family and friends; that’s another 20-30 minutes I do all our work by myself.

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation. I'm a 30 year old male who shares an apartment with his mom. I'm the only person in the household who works and I just so happen to live in a very experience part of the U.S. Think NYC/Bay Area/Boston levels of expensive. I make about $40k/year and have a little more than $50k in savings. 

I live in a section 8 type affordable housing unit and both my mom and I absolutely hate it. The thing is that she refuses to help out financially at all. We could look for apartments outside of affordable housing in the ~$2k/month range, but she absolutely refuses to get a job. She just endlessly bitches and complains about living here, but doesn't do anything proactively to change her living arrangement. I can afford up to $1200/1300 or so on my own and I'm even willing to get a 2nd job because I just want out of here so badly. She's told me that she refuses to give a landlord all this money and calls me a sucker for evening thinking about doing so. 

The insults and arguing are really taking its toll on me and it's causing alot of tension between us. She calls me a pathetic son for not ""taking her out of the projects"", worthless, less of a man compared to others. She's constantly insults my manhood. It just never stops. She tells me to purchase a place, but what the hell can I realistically afford for 2 people in this area? She makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. She just complains over and over and over again. It's so fuckin' frustrating. She's flat out told me that she will not help me with anything.

The job itself sometimes can have a toxic work environment, but for the most part I enjoy when it is calm, I can do my work peacefully, and spend it with my coworkers.

This one coworker (30s Male) was already in a bad mood today and took it out on everyone. All morning he complains how maintenance work is building up. And everyone keeps leaving a mess. He yells at me for getting in his way and walks away revealing that I irritate him a lot. But doesn’t tell me that asking questions or help bothers him?

Then proceeds to vacuum at my feet because he refuses to talk to me that he needs to vacuum and clean the floor. 

A few hours later he apologizes to me after I told the store manager how weird the experience was. I’ve gained a lot of advice here from nice mature people who’ve taught me, to not worry about others and focus on yourself. So all I said was ok, but that doesn’t mean I forgive you or accept your apology. It’s caused some tension in the store because other people said it was uncalled for and rude.

Personally I think that no matter how much stress you are in, it’s not an excuse to be rude to push people around and say things you will regret to them. And you can’t expect people to be all willing to forgive you.

Now because of that I was planning on bringing food and drinks to work to celebrate with a few coworkers an early Thanksgiving. Other people did the same. The guy finds out because we were eating in the break room when it wasn’t busy. But is mad he doesn’t get anything. It also wasn’t meant for everyone, the ones who organized it made it a small one.

So I just started a new job at a well known fast food place. Like I give no fucks about this job I just like the extra money cause I spend all my pay checks on car parts to restore my old car. 


I worked in fast food for a short while when I was a teen but quickly realized I could make more money hanging out at the park so I quit real fast..... also I'm a grown ass woman that actually owns my own business so I actually have some common sense and a brain that's more devolved than a kids (this is important for the story) 


I'm still in ""training"" so I have to be treated like a baby despite having the ability to type on a screen perfectly fine;as well as knowing the correct change before I even hit the button.


Okay here's where I might be TA.

 I have stared at the stupid screen for over 20hrs combined now. I have good visual memory and I'm a baby  Millennial so my fingers have had many years of typing fast. 

I am 1000% capable of taking the orders by myself but this girl that started like maybe a month before me is supposed to ""shadow"" me. So when we get a huge lunch rush she can't also take orders since 'I need to get to know the menu' and then they have her doing stupid boh jobs during the busiest hrs so nobody is taking the trash out or wiping the tables down.... 

I told management that I need her to take the trash out cause it's over flowing and restock stuff cause I have 20 ppl in line, OR I told them to let her take the orders (cause tbh she actually needs more practice with the order taking than I do) so that way I can spend 1min wiping tables, 1 min, restocking, and maybe 5 mins max taking all the trash out. (I'm a pro cleaner so I know efficiency)  


But yet I'm told I can't do that and I am not allowed to tell her to do things cause I'm not her manager. :/ 


Our restaurant is so extremely busy and I'm legit just trying to make things go as smooth as possible. 


Also I get short with her because when I have an order she tries to butt in and touch my screen but she's not actually pressing the correct buttons (like if the customer wants to modify)  so I'm the one that's actually teaching her! And then she needs to act like a manager or something like me... 


I will say though she is a sweet girl and I enjoy talking with her on our down time but I don't need her to be my teacher or whatever. 


TLDR: I'm an adult with an actual brain that can handle fast paced situations. I've been working for a week at a fast food restaurant and they have a teen that is struggling to say the least ""train"" me. Management won't let me ask her take the orders while I do the much needed cleaning/restocking since I'm in ""trainging"" our restaurant looks like shit during lunch rush because of it.

Even so, I still grapple with a lot of shame over this, and I want to know if it's warranted.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past two years, my grandmother’s health has been in decline. She basically raised me, and I was just as close with her growing up as I was with my parents, if not even more so. This past August, she had a stroke and wound up hospitalized. She was discharged after about a week—only to almost die a day or two later. She was unconscious for a while, but the paramedics revived her. My mom actually spent time thinking that her mother had died.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all bad enough on its own, but it was made worse by the fact that we had planned to help my sister move into her new apartment the very next day. I was on the verge of a breakdown that night, and I was worried about losing control of my emotions while helping them move (more on that later). I called my mother the next morning to tell her that I couldn't come because I was afraid I'd have a meltdown while I was there. We got into a fight where I actually cussed at her out of anger. I later sent text messages apologizing to her for what I said, telling her that my mind was going to some dark places (which is the truth), and then I tried to backpedal and offer to help anyway. She told me to just stay home. I felt like I \*really\* let her and everyone else in my family down. That evening, I actually had to call a mental health hotline to try and get a handle over my emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

Both my father and my stepfather told me that losing a grandmother is \*\*\*not\*\*\* the same thing as losing a mother, and that it is very self-absorbed of me to think that it's in any way comparable. My dad even called me up and yelled at me about it a few days later, telling me to ""man up"" and that if my mother could pull herself up and do what she needs to do, there's no reason why \*I\* couldn't as well. He basically told me that I was just being lazy and that I always seem to ""call in sick"" when people need me to do any work.

Just to be clear, I have no problems helping move furniture—I’ve done it many times before—but knowing who I am and my history of meltdowns (albeit far less frequent as an adult), I couldn't in good conscience let myself go into what might have turned into a high-stress situation. I have ADHD-PI, I suspect that I also have OCD, and it’s long been believed that I’m on the autism spectrum, although I’ve questioned that one. I’ve always had a \*very\* hard time regulating my emotions. Yet, I still feel a lot of shame for how I acted at the time. Is it warranted?

They're more like aquaintaces to me.

We were all by the pool, but I needed to pee, so I went to the bathroom. The downstairs loo was a bit dirty so I went upstairs but before I could open the door I heard some light moaning and realize someone was dancin the devil's tango. I went downstairs and did my business.

When I got downstairs I realized the only people missing was Laura (30s) and Paul (30s) (fake names) -- we were in a group of 12ppl so it was easy to notice. I went to Mark (30s) and said ""hey, Laura asked me to call you now, she's in the upstairs bathroom. Some ppl around heard and made jokes about him and Laura ""doing it"" in the loo. He left and a fews minutes later there was some screaming and crying from the house, so everybody went there to see what was going on. Mark almost got into a fist fight with Paul, but the other guys got in the middle of it.

Paul left with Laura, Mark took a shower and some pills to sleep. A couple of hours later we were talking about the whole scene and one of the people who heard me telling Mark to meet Laura asked me if I knew she was with Paul, I said yes and she called me a nosey ahole. I said ""don't worry,  if I ever see your husband cheating I won't tell you"".

My wife works in the special education so she would be best to diagnose. But we believe it's too early to be sure. One example is that my daughter is very particular about the routine she undergoes before school. It needs to be almost exactly the same for her to have enough comfort in the emotional bank for her to be ready for school.

Every morning I help get my daughter's snack ready for school, pack it in the backpack, make sure she has a full water bottle and leave it all by the door. My wife helps to get her dressed, brushed, loads the car with her two jackets (while on the ride to school she drapes both over herself like a blanket and then wears one to school), backpack and shoes. Meanwhile I get dressed to log in to work. Once she's ready to go, I stop, I pick her up and load her into the car and drape the two jackets over her. I don't typically offer to help load the car because in the past when I've forgotten things, my wife tells me that it's better if just one person is responsible for loading.

This morning we couldn't find the second jacket. My wife asked, me, ""Do you think it's at school?"" I didn't know, I asked her if it was on the hallway hook or in the car. She said no. So I said, ""Yeah, I guess it's at school.""

At school my daughter starts to cry. She refuses to wear another jacket (the missing one is her favorite one). And she can't find it in the classroom. She insists that mom go home and find it. Again, imagine that our daughter has a finite emotional bank, my wife very generously knows that not filling that bank can mean a meltdown and temper tantrum or that my daughter will tire out before the end of the school day. My wife goes home, pissed off and stressed out that she might not make it back home in time for her virtual training and that she'd have to sit through the entire training without breakfast because she has to find and drive the jacket back to school.

She told me she found the jacket on top of a pile of toys and that neither of us saw it until she went looking. She tells me that I should be sorry and that she was furious with me. She says that I should instead have replied, ""I don't know"" when she asked if I thought the jacket was at the school.

So I said I'm sorry for misleading you. I'm sorry that was a stressful situation and that you had to deal with that. I'm also sorry that you didn't get breakfast. She purposefully corrected me and said, ""I'd rather you say, 'I'm sorry for the jacket' because it is downplaying your role in the problem \[by only saying you misled me\]."" She tells me that it's also my responsibility to know whether or not the jacket came home the prior day. In this particular instance maybe I recall that she still had her jacket on yesterday... but I'm not even truly sure. These are details that I can't place (having a 1yro son at home who likes to play at 1am doesn't help).

The mobile home sucks all around and is barely big enough for the three of us…. My sister and maybe myself would both be living with our mom but she got a boyfriend Jonathon and in 2019 got pregnant by him and had my baby sister Chelsea in May of 2020. She started going over to Jonathans house for weeks at a time around August and left my sister and I at our apartment alone. My sister moved in with our dad and his girlfriend Lisa after about 3 months of our mom barely coming home. I moved in with my at the time boyfriend for a while. My mom moved her boyfriend and his 2 young children in shortly after. My Dad lives in his girlfriends house and they fight a lot so she kicked my sister and Dad out. They moved into my other grandmas in March of 2021 and I broke up with my with my boyfriend and moved in with them as well. It was really cramped there and my grandma and dad were never really there for us. I begged my mom to let us come back but she just kept saying theres no room or she needs time to make room for us, even though Jonathans gave up custody of his two children, i dont know why but i believe my mom was behind that and maybe wanted it she complained about them a lot. Well my mom just kept pushing it off until my grandma died in July of 2022. Then my mom just said we’d be better off somewhere else so my sister went to my grandmas and I went to my current boyfriends. My mom recently told me my sister is having a hard time at my grandparents and that they’re getting in arguments a lot. She asked if I would let my sister live with me (she would just be on our couch and my mom knows that). I said I don’t know and I love my sister but I don’t want to basically raise her. Im not sure my boyfriend and his sister want her here full time either. Plus I work at a mill full time and do school and I am often tired. My mom got mad and said I wouldn’t be raising her because since I live closer to her that means she can keep a better eye on her and I won’t have to do anything. I said I don’t know still and she got mad at me saying I need to help family but I really feel like it’ll be too much for me, I don’t understand why my mom doesn’t let my sister come home, she has the room now.
