I was 16 at the time. He was pushy and wanted me to tell a lot of things that I wasn't comfortable about. I was at my cousin's place because I had family problems at home. And he wanted to know about it specifically which made me feel uncomfortable because it was legit an hour since I met him. He kept using my name to guilt trip my cousin by saying he should leave since it seems like I needed space or whatever..

She eventually broke up with him because he went through her phone and somehow put his fingerprint as one of the passwords in her phone, he went through our dms and saw that I didn't like him and his creepy behavior. She told me he did things without consent if you know what I mean, and that's really triggering to me as I've dealt with people who can't take no as an answer. He's just weird.. he said that he doesn't trust my cousin at all and he's blatantly insecure. I helped her break up with him since she felt bad for doing so. But then two months after my older brother told me he saw two of them at the mall holding hands so I called her and asked her if she's been lying to me the whole time, she said yea. So I hung up and cut her out of my life, hes just a triggering toxic person and the fact she got back together with him sounds like to me she's accepting this after I told her about my trauma. She showed up to my younger brother's birthday party after like two months of me cutting her out of my life, it was hosted at our house. She showed up with her boyfriend and it was so uncomfortable. I didn't feel safe with a man like him knowing what he's done... at my own house.. I confronted her and asked her why did she bring him knowing what I went through. She said shes not comfortable talking to me, then her mother kinda scolded me and she was like yelling about the whole thing. telling me this party is about my little brother and not me.

I guess my cousin told her that i cut her out, did she tell her the truth? I don't think so since she lied to her mom about how she met her bf. (They met on a dating app but she told her mom they met at church)

Her mom wants her to have babies soon and to marry her bf in a catholic church. her mom probably thinks Im jealous of my cousin having a bf. Im in a relationship too. I just care about her, but I can't help someone who doesnt want help. I just wished she knew there were boundaries like bringing a creep to someone's home knowing it's triggering.

He forgot about it for a couple days and is now at the shops getting it with some other stuff, 3 times today he brought up the fact I have a bit of my own money I could use instead of him using his.

All of this money is Birthday and Christmas money and I'd rather not spend it on yeast or anything that small and temporary (I've had a similar argument with my sister, which I don't hold any sympathy for). If I had a job I'd absolutely get it myself but thing is I don't. I'd very much like to have a job and make a stable income to support myself and my family even be able to buy Christmas gifts for them without going through someone else, but things have happened to make it a big chore to try and do which if people want details on I'll elaborate, but basically Centrelink sucks.

The 2nd 2 times he brought it up how annoying it was and once more before leaving I tried making it clear that if it's really such a big deal for him I could try making something else from the cookbook, but he'd insist despite making it clear he's annoyed with how stingy I'm being.

I had thought about writing down how much it costs and when I earn it back I would repay him when and if I do get a job (hopefully before the next year but I'm not getting my hopes up) but his attitude to me being stingy about money I can't replace has me in a sour mood

We decided to attend one of the shows in Seattle because that is where my roommate Lily is from. we would stay at her house instead of a hotel.

I was given a code to my 2nd choice show but Lily was given a code to Seattle. Lily has no idea how she got a pre-access code. If you are a Swiftie you are aware of what happen during verified fan sales. We decided that I would sign into Lily's Ticketmaster account and purchase the tickets via her account. I payed for the tickets because she didn't have enough $ to buy the tickets. My job: purchase 4 tickets for me, my sister, Lily, and one other roommate.

11/15 I waited from 10:00am Monday morning well into the afternoon trying to get tickets only to have Ticketmaster postpone the west coast sales until later on Monday. I then waited from 3:00pm to 5:00pm-ish in the queue trying to get tickets (I skipped class for tickets). When I was finally given access to the seats I was able to get four tickets plus one extra because I had a gut feeling I should get one.

Later Lily asks what I am going to do with the extra ticket. She wanted me to sell the ticket to her so she could give it to her sister for Christmas. I told her I would be happy to but she needs to talk with her parents first. I also mentioned I have a cousin who I will offer the ticket to. She agreed and went to talk with her parents.

Next day I talk with my cousin. She was thrilled. Later that same day Lily says she convinced her parents to buy the ticket for her sister. I wasn't able to talk details with her because she was on her way out but I said that my cousin is still interested coming. Later my other roommate tells me Lily is nervous to talk because from what she understood of our conversation I told her she could have the ticket. She also told her sister about the ticket. I am frustrated because I remember telling her I have a cousin who is also interested. I never said yes. I said maybe. I admit that some of this miscommunication may be on me but I thought I made myself clear. Lily is the kind of person who will push for what she wants and manipulate situations so she can get the outcome she wants. I feel very cornered by her.

I am going to give the ticket to my cousin because this tour experience is extremally important to me. I want people I love with me during this experience. I have dreamed of this for 10 years now. My family was never able to afford tickets to one of Taylors shows. Now that I have moved out I am able to afford the tickets. This will be the only concert I will ever attend. I feel guilty if I take the ticket, then my cousin, my sister (who has her own ticket) and I stay at Lily's house. The solution: my cousin, her mom (my auntie), my sister, and I are going to get a hotel instead of stay with my roommates family.

Two months ago I moved to a new town for work and moved in with this guy that was mutual friends with one of my old coworkers. I have had zero issues with him as an actual person to live with, he’s a nice enough guy and keeps things relatively clean. However, in the past month he’s been at the apartment less and less. Earlier today he stopped by and told me that the reason he’s been around less is that he is planning on moving in with his girlfriend and has already began packing. 

I don’t have an issue with that by itself, it’s been nice having the place pretty much to myself lately. The problem I have is that he also mentioned that one of his coworkers is looking for housing and that he is planning on subleasing to them, but since our the contract language lease is pretty murky about subleasing he said he is gonna do it under the table and just have his coworker pay him the cost of rent and he will continue to make all payments to the landlord. I am a little annoyed about this because I did not sign a lease to live with this other person, and while I have not read the entire lease yet, I would think he would probably have to OK it with me in advance before making such a change (if he’s even allowed to sublease, which doesn’t seem to be the case), and if nothing else I feel like it would just be common courtesy for him to ask me about this before just dropping it all on me out of the blue. 

A part of me really wants to contact my landlord and fill him in on this situation as I am 99% sure that subleasing is not allowed, but I hate being a snitch. The proposed new roommate also happens to be an old acquaintance of one of my good friends and she did vouch for this girl as a good person and said I wouldn’t have any gripes rooming with them for the remainder of my lease. I will admit that a big part of my reasoning of wanting to report my current roommate is that I have really enjoyed the quiet apartment as of late, but I also think it’s pretty crappy of my roommate to just drop this on me without consulting me about it beforehand. Although my friend vouching for this girl is making me consider just taking this one on the chin, I am still leaning towards messaging my landlord about this situation.

I know that when I yell at her I am the asshole, but it's the only emotion I can show or feel in these moments. I mostly yell at her to stop talking and asking me questions and to leave me alone.

We’ve lived together for almost a year and while she’s always been a bit entitled though recently it seems like she thinks the world revolves around her. For the context of the story, it is important to note that she has a very masculine build to her. She is 6’4 and around 230 pounds with very broad shoulders and quite a bit of muscle on her. In contrast, I am 5’6 with a very slim and petite figure and I’m not even 130.

The issue started back around Halloween when she had asked to borrow one of my outfits to dress up for a party. Given she didn’t have many feminine clothes at the time, I said yes. Granted I had also assumed she would wash and return said outfit after the party but no. Since then I have noticed that a lot of my skirts, dresses, thigh highs and even sweaters have all gone missing from my closet only to catch her wearing them. She never asked for permission to borrow them, she would just sneak into my room and take them. Every time I called her out it was always the same excuse “I had nothing to wear and I’ll return it when I’m done.” Or when I would ask her for my clothes back she would make up some excuse about them being in the wash. I even offered to take her out to buy new clothes but she refused because she “couldn’t afford them.” Eventually, I had to resort to sneaking into her room and stealing them back and many of my favorite outfits have holes or tears now from trying to make them fit her.

I had been fed up with this behavior for a good minute but finally snapped the other night when she went through my closet for something to wear for a date. The dress she tried taking was very special to me so I immediately took it back and told her I wasn’t letting her wear any of my things. I tried being nice when she asked why and explained that she had her own clothes and I wasn’t letting her borrow anything else until she returned or replaced the ones she stole. She got defensive and said she didn’t own any feminine clothes so I finally snapped and told her that if she wanted feminine clothes she could go and buy her own. I understand that she wants to feel like a woman but her build is masculine and she needs to think about that because I’m tired of her destroying my clothes to make them fit her.

She took great offense to my comment and called me a selfish asshole who doesn’t care about who she is. I found my clothes thrown in a pile in front of my door and she refuses to speak to or even acknowledge me.

For a year we all paid 600 a month, but a few months ago my roommate suggested a 680/560/560 split since one room was much larger. The two of us with smaller rooms (myself and roommate H) were willing to pay the higher rate for the bigger room, but the roommate with the bigger room (C) accepted. We've done the 680/560/560 split since.

Separately from the rent, about six months ago, C wanted a tidier house. C was doing more of the cleaning and felt that wasn't fair. C proposed a cleaning schedule. H and I agreed. At first I did my chores regularly. 

After the summer, though, I started slacking and haven't done my chores recently. This is in part because I have been home less than half the time--I have been out of town and at my girlfriend's a lot--and in part because I fell out of the habit and am a slacker when it comes to cleaning. I acknowledge I was in the wrong here. H and C did their chores regularly, with C doing extra tidying to cover my slack. The chores aren't things that absolutely need doing every week, but they keep the house tidy- e.g. cleaning the bathroom, mopping the living room, etc. 

This week C calls a roommate meeting. C announces that because I haven't been doing my chores, they will no longer pay 680, and will go back to paying 600. H and I don't sense any room for discussion, so no discussion happens.

Over our group text I suggest that this isn't fair to H, since H always did their chore. Furthermore, in my mind, chores and rent are separate issues. I suggested that going forward, we stick to the agreed upon rent, but I can pay $20 each time I skip my chore for the week. H thinks this is a fair plan. 

C says no to this plan, unless they get ""back pay"" for the skipped chores. I think back pay isn't fair because we didn't make C pay back pay for the year that they had a bigger room for the same price. We also had no agreement in place for what happens if you skip a chore, so I think it isn't fair to establish a retroactive penalty.

Most importantly, I think I've been reasonably reactive at addressing C's concerns. They wanted it cleaner, so we came up with chores. As soon as the issue was raised that I've been slacking (this week is the first time it's been raised), I suggest a penalty system. C says back pay is fair because just because I put more value in rent than in chores doesn't mean everyone sees it that way. C reiterates they are only going to pay 600 from now on. C says they are going to move out in 2 months but only pay 600 until then. I tell C I expect them to honor our agreement for rent until they move out, unless they want the smaller room for the lower price.

I had to cut down a bunch to stay under the word limit.

Some of the people I'm talking about in this post may go on Reddit, so I'm going to be quite vague about some things.

I (14F) used to be part of a friend group which had A (14F), B (15F), C (14F) and sometimes D (15F) but later joined another friend group who I am around more often.

Recently, A, B, C and I  were talking about a book series that we had all read, though A was in the middle of the last book and I was waiting for A to return the final book to the library. A asked what our favourite characters were. B said H, C said E, I said F and A said that hers was also H. A asked who our least favourite character was. C said she it would spoil the plot, A said that she disliked F, B said she disliked G. I didn't answer, but after A specifically asked me, I said that H.

(If the interests didn't make much sense or if I mixed up some of the names, the only important thing is that A and B have the same favourite character, which happens to be my least)

A and B were shocked. They asked why I disliked H and I replied that I didn't like the way the author give H much of a personality besides being gay and the way that H's romances seemed forced.

A accused me of being homophobic and I said that I wasn't. B then added that I didn't want to read books mainly about LGBTQ+ people as well as none of my favourite characters were ever LGBTQ+, adding that I disliked a lot of them. She also said that I never ship m/m or f/f. A then said that I even didn't like quite a few openly LGBTQ+ kids at school.

I then said that I didn't read books surrounding LGBTQ+ people because I don't like reading something that is mainly about romantic or realistic fiction. I didn't like some of the LGBTQ+ kids at school because I don't like their personality and the way that they act towards my other friends and me despite the fact that they're kind to A and B. I also don't like non LGBTQ+ people for the same reason why I dislike them.

A started listing out names of fictional characters that are LGBTQ+ (or potentially are) that I disliked. I gave a brief reason for each one that I disliked and also said that some of the ones she listed weren't ones I disliked but ones that I didn't really care much for. I probably sounded quite irritated and sighed a bunch, but I'm pretty sure I didn't yell, swear or curse.

I left, hoping that we could just cool off and apologise the next day which is what we usually do. (In a lot of the fights in the past, one or more of us would leave and the next day, we'd all apologise and joke around again)

The next day at school, I walked towards A in the hallway and she gave me a disgusted look before turning away in the opposite direction. I noticed C around the locker area and spoke to her. She was dragged away by A and B who said that she shouldn't speak to homophobic people like me.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4802766,public,top,self,AITA for not liking LGBTQ+ fictional characters?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yydugm/aita_for_not_liking_lgbtq_fictional_characters/,all_ads,6,,,

For context we stopped being friends with Mackenzie(f21) and Madison(f20) because they both did us dirty. Mackenzie decided to consistently ignore us and lie to us ab why she couldn’t hang out with us. basically told me that I wasn’t raised right because I vape, curse, and I wasn’t “country” And Madison left us drunk and stranded an hour away bc she lied ab being tired from drinking to go hang out with her friends.

Anna(f21) and I have been through a lot of horrible things from Mackenzie and Madison and from previous ex’s. I’m not going into detail ab the ex’s because  it’s something that I’m still not over 4 years later. Anyways Anna knew about all of my insecurities and embarrassing moments and the other way around. Our sophomore year in college I dropped out to do trade school And Anna had just joined a sorority. For the first month everything was normal until she met a new friend group. We all hung out every weekend and drank. This was all first semester. When we all hung out she would always bring up my insecurities and embarrassing things about me to get the guys to laugh. It was pick me mannerisms. I never said anything bc I am not confrontational. It went on for months. She would say things like “don’t hit her vape bc she has mouth disease.”  And I had just gotten over strep for the 4th time that year. And no I was single and wasn’t with any guys. I’m just really prone to it bc my lymph nodes and my tonsils are really messed up. Fast forward second semester and I have been dealing with depression. I have had it since middle school and it was getting really bad at the time. At this point Anna had been acting as if she was better than me and smarter than me bc she was in a sorority and I chose a different career path. Anyways, she started to hang out with our new friend group without me constantly and not tell me about it. So one day I decided to ask her “big” if we all wanted to hang out and party on campus because I hadn’t yet and it was almost the end of second semester. Her “big” told me that she had plans with her boyfriend so she couldn’t. And I said ok no big deal. Later that night I got a text from Anna a screen shot of her big texting her “hey, you need to tell her(me) that she can’t ask to hang out when I already have plans.” And i had only asked her one time the entire semester. So I texted Anna back and asked her what that was all about. Anna started going off on me how I was selfish for thinking I can go to their house every weekend. And keep in mind Anna would beg my sister every weekend to party at her friends house every weekend for two years straight. And yes it annoyed my sister but we never said anything.

She lives alone but her son (60yM) comes to check on her a couple of times a week. Just for context I and my DH(49) are retired early and financially comfortable. Also for context I am black woman and my elderly neighbor is white.  So to my issue. My elderly neighbor has a lot of health issues which causes limitations. She can't cook for herself, she can't clean, she's incontinent and soils herself regularly. Her son lives 2 hours away and only visits at the most 2 times a week. I took it upon myself to take care of my neighbor. I go to her house every morning to administer her meds and make her breakfast. I make sure that she does her physical therapy exercises, buy her groceries at our expense. Sometimes I even stay over at her house if she's feeling particularly bad that day. One day I noticed a camera inside of her house and I asked her son about it when he dropped by. I thought that maybe he put it there to watch her in real time in case anything happens to her. But nope,  he told me that he put it there to make sure that no one took advantage of her or stole from her. I am the only person who goes to her house. I told him that I was uncomfortable with him spying on me and he got upset and told me not to ever come to his mother's house again and that he'll come over daily to help her( he lives 2 hours away and works)So I complied. It was hard but I don't want legal issues. So we noticed that he hadn't been to check on her for about 2 days so at the risk of being arrested I went to check on her and she was hungry and sitting in her own filth so I called adult services and they now have him under investigation for elderly neglect and I have been appointed her caregiver until everything is sorted out. His wife keeps calling me telling me that I'm ruining her husband's life and he could lose his job and license. He is a LPN. Another neighbor said that I could have handled it better by calling him. My elderly neighbor told me that he said that 
he didn't  mean any harm by recording me and that he's had some bad experiences with black employees and he was just trying to protect himself. Not her but him.

Our communication is strong, our values are aligned, and he’s truly the person I’ve been trying to find for so long. We are just a happy, queer, non-religious couple. Unfortunately, that’s the problem.

My parents are Catholic and don’t believe in my gender identity (transmasc nonbinary). They believe being gay is a sin and trans people aren’t real. I don’t plan on cutting my parents off because of their beliefs (at least for now). I can still have good moments with them and get along with them well, at least when these issues aren’t talked about. 

The reason I haven’t told them is because when I was 18, my parents found out by going through my phone I was going by a different name and they absolutely lost it. They didn’t kick me out, instead, they fought to convince me I made a mistake and it’s “a fantasy” until I relented to appease them. I haven’t talked about it with my parents since and I’m not sure if they know I still use this name today.

From 2017-2021ish I dated a gay man and my parents found out about him the same time they discovered my gender identity. My parents met him shortly after and treated him respectfully, but they did not respect our relationship. My parents continually misgendered me and used my legal name in front of him and his family (who were very accepting of me). My parents were aware I used this name with him and his family. Because of this, the relationship was never very public and only my friends, and his friends, and our immediate families knew about us. This took a major toll on the relationship and it quickly became full of toxic ultimatums regarding my family and my identity. 

After that relationship ended in 2021, I’ve been scared to bring up my current boyfriend. I don’t want to repeat the same poor reaction from my previous relationship, and I don’t want to “play straight” with my boyfriend whenever my parents are around.

My mom flat out asked me during the summer if I was dating him in a very accusatory tone when she saw a picture of us together. I lied out of fear. So, it’s safe to say at least my mom has some suspicion.

I do want to tell them, because I know it’s beneficial for both of us to not have to hide. I can’t hide forever either, because I do see a future with my boyfriend. 

I also recently discovered my sibling (21 f. The golden child) has a boy who likes her and she told my parents right away. I honestly feel really guilty, but at the same time I’ve never been happier with my relationship.

My boyfriend is very supportive and is willing to do anything for me (even lie about when the relationship started if we have to). He’s not rushing me into telling them, so this is solely my move.

my sister came over this week. a couple things she got mad at : i asked her how long she would be staying and she got offended (she lived with us before as well it didn’t work out) she only asked me to come over but she planned to stay 4 days. i also got upset that she brought groceries over and started stuffing my fridge. even with things that don’t belong in fridges like baking soda, maple syrup, and almond butter. she also brought her own potato chips and things my mom likes (nothing for me her pregnant sister) i freaked out when i saw it and told her that she cannot just stuff my fridge like that and she got offended and felt unwelcome. she told me she would fix it the next day.

Lately though, it's seemed like we have drifted apart. I tried to be more proactive and reach out but would rarely get a response. She'd cancel plans alot, and I'd see on SM that she was always traveling and hanging out with other people.

She started texting me randomly saying she missed me. One day I texted back that we make time for the things we want to make time for. She said other things have just been ""more important"" and I can always see her around her schedule. 

Months later we had a phone call and she apologized for what she said. We then decided to have a Friendsgiving on the 17th. I also told her I'd love for her to meet my bf(28M). He was my first real healthy relationship. 

2 weeks later I text her to confirm if the dinner was going to be at my place or hers. I offered my place. She didn't respond until 10pm the next day saying we can have it at hers. 1 sec later she says her gf(35F) doesn't want a man at their place and if we can have it at mine. I was so taken aback, I asked why. 

Elle said her gf has trauma so she doesn't want to meet a man for the first time in her ""safe space."" This ""man"" is my loving partner, not some Joe Schmoe. It seemed unfair to me that her partner would be welcome no matter what the location, while mine wouldn't.

She said her gf would be fine about it once she meets him in ""neutral territory,"" which she could have mentioned 3 WEEKS AGO. We could have had met up prior to Friendsgiving or something. 

She said ""I hope you understand,"" and I responded ""I don't."" She said that everyone responds to trauma differently. I understand this as a victim of trauma myself, but what did she think my bf was going to do? And I'm her friend. Why wouldn't they trust me? I told her to forget the whole thing because my bf isn't a stranger. She said he was a stranger to her gf. She went on about boundaries and respecting her partner. (What about respect for my partner?) She even went as far as to say she's proud of her gf for having boundaries. *Eyeroll*

Then she said she feels uncomfortable and doesn't even want to do friendsgiving anymore. I responded with, ""Uncomfortable? Oh I'm sorry that YOU'RE uncomfortable. I didn't want to do it the minute you said that."" She stated she knew and that's why she said it.

I told her that she seems to be more concerned with everyone else's boundaries but my own and that she was rude. I was fed up so I even threw in ""if you can't understand why I'm upset I don't know what to tell you."" She never responded.

I could have just let it go and agreed to host at my place but I was hurt.

My family said I'm in the wrong because it's her house, which is valid, but she didn't need to say all that. We could have just decided on my house from the beginning.

Recently Schmidt went out of town and his and Nick’s college friend Megan who went through a break up asked Schmidt if she could crash in his room as he is not gonna be staying there for a while. Schmidt asked Nick and I if Megan could be our guest till she finds her own place as she used to live with her bf. I felt bad and said sure she can. Nick was a little uncomfortable with the idea as Megan is known to gossip a lot and Nick doesn’t want his personal life to be a part of her gossips. But I convinced him and she moved in with us, as a guest, 2 weeks ago. 
Ever since she moved in she’s been weirdly obsessed with cleaning the kitchen. At first I didn’t mind, then she started rearranging the kitchen. So the guys don’t use the kitchen much and most of the kitchen is filled with my stuff. It’s a little messy but I categorize different things and arranged it. She started moving everything in my shelves around, like putting pot lids with coffee mugs, coffee powder with ramen packets , spices with pans etc. 
I told her politely, three times, not to touch my stuff as I am very particular about where things go. 
Now here’s where I might be the a-hole, today when I told her not clean the kitchen for the 4th time, and went inside my room, she sneaked back out of her room and started rearranging again, when I came out to get some water I saw her moving my stuff and I got mad and told her that she’s a guest and she should behave like one and not go around moving stuff in my kitchen. 
She called and complained to Schmidt who called me an a-hole for not understanding what she’s going through and I shouldn’t have talked to her like that. Nick is on my side and he said Megan has always had boundary issues and she never understands where to stop and I am in the right to call her out on her behavior, but Schmidt and Megan are really mad at me.

For the most part it’s been great we are very compatible. We do long distance due to school so we FaceTime very often. The other night when we were on the phone she said something that really rubbed me the wrong way. I have always been very of the opinion that the past is the past and I’d rather just not know. I know she was a more sexually open person than me. We’ve never had the body count talk and quite honestly I’d rather just not know but she’s said many things about her past that I could have definitely lived without knowing. Looking back I should’ve said something after the first time it happened and stopped it then but unfortunately I did not and feel as though I might be in to deep and can not continue to look past them. It started when over the summer she told me a story and a time she had to drive home with ejaculate in her eye. The next thing I remember was her saying “As someone who enjoys casual sex” when I was telling her about a situation with a friend of mine was dealing with. Next she said something about a date she went on soon before out first date where the guy drove her up a mountain and then they got stuck on the way down(this one definitely fucked with my overthinking a lot). Then the other night she says to me “My freshmen year I mostly talked to black men but none of them really seemed to be interested in really getting to know me”. This one I don’t know if I will be able to look past like I have the others. I just can’t get out of my head the idea of her just sleeping around with a bunch of different men. I have felt and probably acted very off towards her ever since but I just can’t seem to get rid of these thoughts.

Rather than let her go home alone or god forbid leave with someone else, we put her in an Uber with us and took her to our apartment. We have two entrances (a front entrance and a back entrance) but only have the key to the back door. The drunk friend fell down on our front lawn, so my roommate suggested I wait with the drunk friend out front while she went through the back and opened the front door. While waiting, my drunk friend grew impatient in the cold and pulled on the door of the unit next to us, which was surprisingly open. I noticed immediately and pulled her out before she got beyond the entryway. The neighbor (22/23?F) sent a nasty message about 15 minutes later to our building’s groupchat, cursing us out and saying our friend “disrespected her property.” I messaged her privately to explain the situation and that we hope it won’t impact our relationship in the future. She said we should reconsider our friends and that if they cannot respect her boundaries, they cannot come over. I think this was a bit extreme given the situation, especially since our friend is now asleep on the bathroom floor and poses no further risk to her, but didn’t fight her on it. I invited her over for coffee so we can get to know each other a little better and understand this is not the norm for us, but she declined the invitation.

I feel we are the assholes and our neighbor is right in that our friend should not have opened her door, though I don’t agree with the vulgar language she used in the building’s groupchat. My roommate feels we are not the assholes because the neighbor’s door was unlocked and our friend did not fully enter her apartment. Even if our friend was sober, she could have gotten the number to the apartment wrong and in that case, opening the door would not be disrespectful, just an accident. My roommate also feels that even though the experience is scary, the neighbor should have been more understanding after I explained the situation.

my bf and i, both 18, enjoy our time over at my place when he has some time away from school. we dont always have sex every time he comes over, but it's usually 4/5 times. he comes over 2-3 times a week.

my room has a single/twin bed, we've had sex on my bed but the sheets always end up sweat stained and gross, and i'm not the smallest girl so i'm comfy with more space.

the spare room has a double bed. no one uses it when they come over, so i don't understand why it's an issue my boyfriend and i have sex on it. we also just use it to sit and cuddle on, watch movies when we have more time together and when he sleeps over we use it.

we dont always keep it the cleanest, we often leave pillows and blankets (mine) on the floor afterwards, but we always wash our towels and pick up food and rubbish.

my grandma, who i live with for some reason, every time she finds out my bf has been over, needs to check up on the spare room and complain about everything. she's ungrateful and always complains before she even remembers to breathe. she's old and stuck in her ways. she always yells at me for the smallest mess or wants me to do all the house work 24/7. she calls me lazy because i ""want to sleep all day"" when i'm an insomniac who cant sleep unless i'm extremely sleepy, so my sleep schedule usually changes every week. i dont like her sometimes.

the weird thing is, she's very sex positive. she took me to get condoms, preg tests, and a rod in my arm that acts as birth control. she's never at home so i dont see her much either.

i might be TA because i usually just block out her complaints. i'm from a very messy, abusive situation from both seperated parents, so i block out what people say a lot. i have a have a very bad memory.

she recently complained about the bed in the spare room being a little bent, since the ancient thing's leg broke in one of the corners. she has decided to completely uplift and remove the bed from the floor and has put it against the wall, removed all the legs and sheets and everything. my bf and i think she's batshit insane, since no one but us uses the bed and she's obese and 80yrs old so not like she's gonna sell it anytime soon, and she has her own bed.

i might be TA because i usually just block out her complaints. i'm from a very messy, abusive situation from both seperated parents, so i block out what people say a lot. i have a have a very bad memory.

she recently complained about the bed in the spare room being a little bent, since the ancient thing's leg broke in one of the corners. she has decided to completely uplift and remove the bed from the floor and has put it against the wall, removed all the legs and sheets and everything. my bf and i think she's batshit insane, since no one but us uses the bed and she's obese and 80yrs old so not like she's gonna sell it anytime soon, and she has her own bed.

The thing is, I try to keep it clean but when I see that she doesn’t give two shits to maintain the cleanliness (like wash some dishes or put stuff away after using them), I’ve lost motivation to care as well. 

She’s divorced, stay-at-home, and her chores consist of cooking (4-5x a week) and buying groceries. I am grateful for that of course. But basically, when she is not doing those things, she has over 12 hours of free time (I did the math) and does nothing but lay on the couch with her phone. When I ask her if she can clean up a few things atleast, she gets angry and screams at me, telling me I’m old enough to do it myself and shouldn’t order her around. 

The thing is, I love cleaning. And when someone initiates doing the chores, I get so excited to keep it clean that way. But my mom doesn’t do ANYTHING. Seriously, it’s an honor if she washes the dishes once a month or laundry once every 2 months. She barely even keeps up with herself. So I feel super unmotivated to clean because I know it’s gonna go back to its original, filthy state in a day or two’s time. 

I want our house to be in good shape because it has affected my mental health very badly. I know I do not have depression and my mom shows no symptoms of it in her demeanor or behavior. How do I help it? She is so hard to convince and she takes everything personally. She’s a very emotional person and will go days being angry at me if I bring up anything that criticizes her ways of being.

I am friends with a lesbian girl who I'll call M. She argues I was inconsiderate for ever ""setting her up"" with another girl (who I'll call Z) who I was never sure was gay to begin with.

The thing is.. my initial intention for getting these two to meet was for them to be friends because they have similar personalities. I would tease her about the fact that if Z was possibly interested in girls they would be a great couple, but all joking aside mostly I just wanted them to meet and become great friends. 

Back then M asked me if Z was gay... and since the beginning and throughout the budding of their friendship I always told her I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY SHE SWINGS.

I never expected M to really fall for this girl.. but she did and when she would gush about her I think I made the mistake of not keeping her grounded in reality enough... I was caught up in her joy and I would celebrate the little wins she had with her.

A day came when their relationship progressed enough that Z had become progressively more flirtatious with M... so M decides to ask another friend to ask if they're straight because this behavior was confusing her and driving her insane... and then it was confirmed that she was indeed.. straight.

When we finally come together to talk things out she relays to me that after conversations she had with her friends and our classmates they concluded that I was weird and inconsiderate (ie THE ASSHOLE) for ever matchmaking her with Z. They told her that I should have never introduced her to Z if I didn't know for sure that she was into girls and that I never should have hyped her up in the first place and I should have known better and that I am at fault for ever planting the idea in her head to ever get into a romantic relationship with this girl.

I told her that although I take responsibility for celebrating too hard whenever good things happened between them I told her that I cannot control how she feels romantically about another person?? Why does there have to be someone to blame in this situation??

Not even a couple weeks ago she suggested I meet this girl she works with to help me get over my romantic interest and she DID NOT KNOW if this person was gay or bi and SHE STARTED IT OFF with the intention of me being together romantically, not as friends!

I'm just hurt that after the discovery of Z's sexuality, she vented to everyone including people we mutually know and somehow I have become a central conversation point and scapegoat for her pain..

They’re great kids, and so much happier living with me, but they came with a lot of bills. Which isn’t their fault.

Anyway last month I went to pay my phone bill,  and she asked for $130. (I’m on the same plan as my mother, and usually pay her $51 every month.) When I asked why the bill was so high, she said it’s because I needed to start paying for my sisters phones as well. 

I paid her the $130, but I felt agitated about it, because for one she makes $23hr. She doesn’t pay rent (lives with family now), has no car payment ( her car is paid off), and isn’t contributing any money to take care of her kids. In fact, she always seems to have enough money to buy copious amounts of alcohol which is one of the long list of reasons her children were taken from her.  

Mind you, I do get a stipend each month for the 2 kids from the state but it’s barely enough to cover basic grocery shopping. That’s not counting rent, bills, gas, and extra things they need. 

This month I paid her only my portion of the phone bill, and when she asked where the other $80 was, I told her I didn’t see how she couldn’t at least cover $80 a month for her kids. She said she doesn’t have enough money to do that, and that being a “single mom” is hard. (She isn’t even allowed to contact her kids at the moment  because of what she allowed to go on in her house.)

I lost it, and told her I would be putting them on my own plan, and would be removing myself from hers. My mom got an attitude, and told me I don’t know what she is going through, and that this is hard for her. She also said she needs the money for bills, and that it’s so hard with only a single income now.

We both supported women's, LGBT+ and other minorities rights. I thought of her as someone smart and well-informed. But recently she got in a relationship with a guy who is, well, a fascist. She pretty much hided it from me, and even kept making progressist commentaries in our group chat. I only found out because I saw his Facebook and was pretty much shocked. Since his latest update was in 2021, I kinda hoped he had changed... I guess I could have confronted my friend and asked her, but unfortunately I was in denial. I didn't want to believe my friend had choosen to date him. I had only met him twice, because my friend gotten distant since she started seeing him. Anyway, fast forward and I make a new discovery: she went with him in a pro-fascist protest. And to put the cherry on the cake, she shared a post about how Disney brainwashes kids to turn queer. I scrolled throught the poster's account, and the profile had anti-LGBT+, anti-feminism, and conservative values content. My blood boiled when I saw that; I am LGBT+ and have LGBT+ friends.

Then he grabs my toe and goes to touch the hangnail and I flinch telling him not to touch it, that opened a can of worms, back and forth we argued. He told me it ""wasn't that big of a deal"" while I begged him not to touch any of my toenails because it made me **very** uncomfortable, I've told him before that I don't like my feet touched but I let him because I'm comfortable with him. He eventually let go of my foot which he wouldn't let go of the whole argument while I desperately tried to take it back because again I was uncomfortable.

I let him have my foot and it was like I handed it to a child, he immediately started touching my toenails and I began to get visibly upset and tried to tell him again ""PLEASE don't touch my toenails."" Something about my toenails being touched over and over had my heart racing and I was on the edge of tears, there's something very sensory-wrong with them being touched. He let go of my foot and was just pissed off, telling me to leave the living room and go to sleep over and over while I told him that I wasn't tired and didn't want to go to sleep. He finally looked at me and said ""Just go anywhere else, get away from me. I tried to take care of you and be a good boyfriend and you're being an asshole about it."" I left to my office after that. Am I the asshole for not wanting or letting him touch my toenails?

Side Note: I had a few sips of a cider but that was a couple of hours before this interaction.

I have been a foodie ever since I gained consciousness. I love great food. We three friends have been going to the same college. I manage my transport through the college bus and they do so by their own motorcycle. (they live near each other)

I usually have 5, 6 dollars with me (In our country, it equals to about 1200 pkr). I use them up carefully just buying enough food so that money can last me at least 2 weeks. Our family had been in a lot of financial stress lately and getting any more money is well, Impossible. I usually eat in the college cafeteria. 

For the last couple of weeks, Tony and Mike have been on my nerves asking that I get something to eat for them too. I tell them I can't manage if I have to buy extra other than mine. After they emotionally blackmail me, saying that I am not a true friend, that did our friendship even mattered to me, I am compelled (sometimes threatened in a passive aggressive way) to get lunch for them. I can't ask for more money from my parents because they already work too hard. Occasionally, they would get lunch but buy the worst and less priced item on the menu.

Fast forward to present, yesterday I told them they'd be getting no lunch from my side and they had to arrange it themselves. I received huge backlash and a threat to end the friendship if I didn't comply. I asked what the hell was this behavior. Is this why we'd been friends for so long? They replied they do not really have any money to pay for their own food due to motorcycle expenses. I told them I am not the one who lives a luxurious lifestyle.

They told me that they are not fucking talking to me again. After college, I messaged them but both have been ignoring my messages and leaving me on seen. I am feeling guilty that I refused them and now, I deserve this. AITA for not paying for their lunch?  


For details :

1. We'd been friends for about 9 years.
2. They are good friends who are usually ready to help me whenever i need it. (Dropping me off at my home, helping out study-wise etc.)
3. They paid for lunch for 3 days. I paid for about 16 days.
4. Tony's father is a doctor and Mike's father is a businessman. They both can afford expensive mobile phones and gaming laptops whereas I cannot even afford an average mobile phone. I still run core 2 duo on my PC.

About a week ago, i found out that one of my friends had possibly contracted herpes from another friend. I'll call the them OC (original carrier) and Amanda. OC had previously told me about her own condition and Amanda's possible infection as well, due to them sharing many drinks/utensils before OC's knowledge of her own infection. After receiving this knowledge, Amanda told absolutely no one that she might have been infected, not even her boyfriend, and was not taking precautions for her possible virus. 

When I found out about Amanda's possible infection, I told our friends, the ones that she could have infected. This was due to her sharing food and drinks with everyone, as well as engaging in romantic behavior with her boyfriend. Everyone agreed that Amanda should get tested, as a precaution and to calm everyone's nerves. That night, Amanda texted OC and behaved as if she did not know anything about various clinics, or symptoms of herpes. She managed to book an appointment but acted as a victim and tried to get pity from various sources in the group before the test.

The day of her test, Amanda called OC in an angry state, asking why she was sent on a ""wild goose chase"", as the doctor told her herpes can't spread through sharing food and drinks. The doctor also could not test her, due to her having no symptoms and no active outbreak/infection site. She began to tell everyone that she and OC had never done anything that would spread the disease (i.e. making out) and she therefore couldn't have it. This part upset me because she was now acting like she knew everything about herpes before going to the clinic anyway.

When she got back to school, Amanda blamed me for stressing everyone out and sending her to the clinic for no reason, and her boyfriend who is an old friend of mine, sided with her. She blamed me for stressing her out and said I didn't do any research, but I had and OC gave me information about it as well.

OC and I both wanted to make sure that everyone was safe, and I feel justified in my actions of making her get a test.

We were drinking, and just ranting about our lives. Later Ava had to use the restroom and when she left Mike had touched me inappropriately. I’m not going to go into detail, but that’s what happened. I told him to stop and he didn’t. I later left because I was uncomfortable, and I didn’t know how to handle it because something like this has never happened to me before.

Ricky and i have been friends for a few years now and in the time i’ve known him, he’s always actively been looking for a girlfriend (hinge, bumble, tinder u name it, he was on it). he came to me in june/july ish and told me he was seeing a new girl that he had dated in the past and it didn’t work out. he told me she was 20, too young to legally drink in the US (where we are) but “very cool and mature”. i was stoked for him, but i had my doubts bc he was notorious for moving pretty quick with girls, and 20 is kinda young imo.
cut to the end of August, Ricky asks my bf (26/M) and i to double date, so we decided to go to a farmers market. Ricky and i work at a bar so i asked Felicity when she would turn 21 so she could in. she said “in 3 months and a year” which in my mind put her at the age of 19, almost 20. she didn’t talk much, kept to herself and seemed uninterested. maybe i’m being too judgmental but when i watched them interact it felt like i was watching a highschool couple flirt with each other. (trying to trip each other, slapping hands away, pushing, etc.) it was sweet but also seemed a little juvenile.
cut to now, november, they have been together now for maybe 6 months and Ricky says they might be having a baby, and to me it feels like he’s trying to trap this girl into his ideal future. he’s always wanted kids, always wanted to be a dad/husband, always wanted something permanent. but from the conversations Ricky and i have had, and the few times i’ve talked to Felicity, she seems like she has a lot she wants to do outside of motherhood and marriage. he’s confided a lot in me regarding the relationship and i’m concerned he’s been grooming this girl for a long time. i asked him how long they had been together and he started with “well the first time we dated-“ (referring to the time they “didn’t work out”) and i cut him off and said “but that doesn’t count bc you guys broke up right?” he said, “yea you’re right, it doesn’t count.” and then walked away. he mentioned to me later, in a random conversation, that he first met Felicity when he was 19, and she was 16 BUT it got me thinking and the math doesn’t add up!! if she was “a year and 3 months” away from 21 when i met her in august, her 20th birthday would have been November (WE ARE CURRENTLY IN) meaning they have a FIVE year age gap. if he met her when he was 19 she would have been 14, if he met her when she was 16, he would have been 21. SO which is the truth?? why is he lying?? the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me feel like he’s a creep. should i call him out on his “bad math” and potential grooming or WIBTA who should just mind their business???",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4802578,public,top,self,WIBTA if i call my friend out on his relationship age gap?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yybyj1/wibta_if_i_call_my_friend_out_on_his_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,
