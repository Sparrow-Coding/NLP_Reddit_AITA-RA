I am an 18 year old female in my senior year of highschool. My mom and dad divorced a few years back and due to the fact that my dad did not have a very good upbringing or financial situation he could not take me. Thankfully he has been a huge part of my life ever since the divorce and has improved his situation greatly and become a much better person. Unfortunately my mom has done the opposite… she met this guy named Nate who has been the bane of my existence since he arrived. I’ve always been a heavier girl and he used to make suggestive/rude comments to me when my mom was not in the room but he would do this in front of of his son Jacob! thus comes the “little brother” in the situation. Anyways I told my mom and bio dad about this which led to a huge fight between her and Nate. They split and for a few days I thought I had my mom convinced of the seriousness of this…I was very wrong. She, claiming loneliness would kill her, took Nate back. My dad reached out to my mom for my sake to no avail due to her general upper hand in the situation. When I would be alone with Jacob, Nate’s son he would repeat many of the things his father said to me and in general just be a dick, in the house I grew up in! Well we ended up riding the bus together where Jacob decided to tell my peers many embarrassing things that my mom stupidly confided into my stepdad through text, he must have seen his dads phone or something and boom all of my info was out there. When I went home and tried to make a point about this I was totally gaslighted by everyone and made to feel like it wasn’t jacobs fault and I should lighten up. I had finally unplugged myself completely at that point and admittedly became quite a trouble maker. The reason I am here is because although I know I am in the right to be offended by this blatant disrespect, I need to know that what I did was the right thing to do. Anywho I began to plot the takedown of my stepdad and his little shit, I finally decided to break a few of my parents liquor bottles along with china cabinet on a night that I was “at a friends house” and my little brother was home alone with friends. I used the key and was able to do this without waking my brother and snuck out and back to my friends who was pretty close.

I'll accept my judgement.

I(29F) Have been married to my husband ""Neil""(29m) for two years. Very early on in the relationship we both shared the same strong opinion that we never wanted children. Neil did admit to me that he had a child but because he never wants kids he basically left his gf at the time when she wanted to keep it. I didn't care. Fast forward to now, his son is 4 and his mom went to jail, and her parents are old and not well enough to raise a kid, so they reached out to Neil. He came home the other day from work announcing news, he's taking in his son and finally being a dad to him. I was livid, because he made that decision without so much as a conversation with me and not having any children was a very big agreement when we were dating and got married. Also, he works away from home while I work remote, so he was expecting me to be mommy throughout the day, to which I said hello no. We've been fighting about this since, but he's expecting to take his kid here in a few weeks. I told him if he is dead serious on doing this then I will be dead serious on moving out and divorcing him, but now he and his side of the family are calling me an AH for rejecting this kid, some of my family members took his side too. 

I get why I look like an AH and probably a total bitch, but I never wanted a child nor did I want to raise one, and while I know it sounds awful I think I have the right to not be put in this position to be a parent when I have made it very fucking clear all throughout my life that I would never step into a parental figure.

Yesterday I asked if my husband if he wanted to talk about plans for my birthday since it’s happening soon. He looked at me and asked what I was talking about, I reminded him that we always make big plans for everyone’s birthday. 

He looked at me and said ‘you never asked me to request your birthday off’ for clarity, previous years he’s always had my birthday off as it aligned with his work schedule. 

I told him all was fine and maybe we could do something later in the week when he was off. I guess he noticed I wasn’t all that happy and we started arguing about how I should have told/asked him to take the time off for my birthday. I guess I never realized I had to ask him to spend my birthday with me and assumed he would have asked for it off when he realized he would be scheduled that day. 

He told me I was an ass for not telling him I’d want him to take those days off and if I wanted him to spend my birthday with me together I would have told him. 

I’m a bit of a mess because again I assumed it was a no brainer and I really don’t think I did anything wrong being disappointed, but I could be wrong, so I guess I’m asking if I should apologize and just start asking him from now on that I want to spend my birthday with him?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4839195,public,top,self,AITA for assuming my husband would ask for my birthday off?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8eusn/aita_for_assuming_my_husband_would_ask_for_my/,all_ads,6,,,,

We have made up at this point, but this is something that has bothered me because it was never directly addressed at this point with my friend. 

I was friends with this couple, we all went to the same high school together, and they started dating then (we are all currently early 20s). It was a pretty long term relationship, and they ended right before the COVID lockdowns began. From her perspective, she was blindsided by their break up, but he was feeling like they were more friends than lovers.  The break up seemed pretty amicable until he started dating this new girl the area he lived in a few months later. They stopped being friends and just didn't talk anymore. After a couple months, she ended up dating someone else too. So things seem cool. She's super happy about this guy &amp; they seem great together. (They're still together in fact, they've got a mortgage together and are talking about getting married now.)

So fast forward a couple months after they're both in new relationships, I'm friends with both of them still. Talking pretty regularly. My guy friend's gf posts a photo with my guy friend. I have met her at this point and she's actually pretty nice. I decided to comment on her photo ""aww &lt;3"" and that was it. 

A few days later, I get hit by a car while I was walking from school one night. My girl friend never reached out to me, even after I posted about it on social media stating that I had to get surgery due to this. I heard nothing.

I later reached out to her because I was so confused about this, and when I did she berated me for commenting on the new girlfriend's photo and explained that's why she didn't speak to me. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong, because she was in a new relationship and is happy with her new bf.. and I was still friends with both of them. But she says I was in the wrong because I wasn't supporting her by doing that.

Because of this, I always end up giving up everything for L. For example, when we were younger, the rest of our friend group and us wanted to do a couple of dances. We were split into groups, and for some reason everyone wanted to be in this one group with this girl, N. She lived in the apartment next to mine, and we were best friends, so I was in her group.

L's mother isn't much better. No matter what L or her twin brother do or say, she supports them, which isn't a bad thing, until they abuse that trust, and lie. It's happened multiple times.

Recently I found out the L had spread rumors about me, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. The rumors weren't that bad, it was probably something about me being annoying or ""sucking up"" (aka, being kind to people, and actually having people who liked me.)

So, I talked to some of my closest friends about cutting off L. N said it was a good idea, but I would still see L at family gatherings, etc., so it wouldn't be good in the long term. Another said that it would be assholish to dump someone I've known forever. I've also been told to give her a second chance, or to let it go, but I'm sick of letting L walk all over me. So, what should I do?

That included food, utilities and anything else I needed I didn’t have to pay for. And I was extremely grateful really, but recently a ton of drama has started and I was the one being blamed for everything. Basically, his son, my cousin 16M is a delinquent that always gets in trouble. Basically I ended up repeating things his Dad told me back to him thinking he knew the things his dad would tell me but he didn’t and that started a huge argument and basically I was told to not repeat things I’ve ever heard. Fast forward 3 months later I hear that my 18M cousin accused me of lying about something that happened to me and then basically made up a story about something I never said? So I was furious and yelled at my uncle about how it wasn’t true but both him and his son kept insisting I said that. So basically, I let it go and stopped talking to that cousin. Fast forward a few days later another fight almost happens because my (16M) cousin gets comforted by my (18M) cousin while we’re all watching tv and he basically asks him if there’s a problem mind you we were all upstairs just watching tv relaxing, and he lives all the way downstairs and doesn’t usually come upstairs. He basically says he feels weird tension in the room whenever we’re around him and wanted to know if there was a problem. At this point we’re a bit annoyed because the fight I mentioned previously was started because he asked me the same thing. Basically my cousin ends up going off on him telling him they’re not “friends” anymore and he hates him for turning me against him and how he’ll never trust him again. After that situation was over another thing happened that I had absolutely nothing to do with basically my cousin wanted to keep his cat upstairs with him and his brother wanted to take him downstairs so he got upset and called his step mom and begged her for the cat and she said yes and then the next day my dad comes over and tells me to get all of my things because apparently my uncle said he’s had enough of the drama but I didn’t understand because I had nothing to do with that cat situation but for some reason I was being blamed? I wasn’t even in his room when it happened. But yeah, so my uncle sent me back to my abusers household after I told him a psychology major with a masters degree that my parents were abusing me and he watched them do it and that was the reason he let me move in with him. But, he told me I had to go move in back with them and then I found out he told them some of the things I said to him about how much I hated them for the abuse.

She texts me back and said that’s fine, but to please order cheese pizza.

She said no that she just wanted plain pizza. I told her well if I’m buying it I’m going to get what I want on it and suggested that she could pick off the toppings if it bothered her that much or that we could do a sort of half and half deal where half was cheese.

Then she said that she could still usually tell or taste residual flavors or oil from the toppings when she did that and didn’t even want to do that, and said we could just order an entire other pie for her… neither of us are going to eat an entire pie so that just seemed frivolous to me so I said let’s just forget the pizza idea and scrap it as a whole.

When I saw him later in the day, I pointed out the missing consults and let him know why they should have been done referencing our department policy. I tried to be as polite as possible about it and keep it neutral. However, he got defensive and told me I was wrong and the supervisor told him he didn't have to do those and that there was ""wiggle room"" for which consults we have to do. I responded that I was just referencing the policy and if the supervisor changed the policy I was unaware of it. This coworker has been an ongoing problem and our supervisor made that policy 6 months ago, so I don't believe she changed it just for him. He spent 10 minutes telling me I was wrong and that he was going to talk with the supervisor when she gets back about it. I just left it at that and went back to working since I had so much to do.

C always excused himself about failing exams or missing homework bc ""he has to work"" (my parents used to have a bakery, we help sometimes but no always and specially no at night) 
So... L brided teachers so C can graduated from high school (this is Perú so yeah u can do it)

C doesn't have a job, he's lazy asf, he spends all the day in his room playing games and only gets out to eat. 
In 2018 we (C and me) participated in a work&amp;travel program (he went to Utah and of course I choosed a very far away state) - 3 months of him calling and always complaining about smt (the weather, the housing, the taxes lol, etc) this experience  doesn't count since it was only for 3 months...  C graduated last year from college (no an easy journey, he complained a lot about the college - he doesn't like the career L chooses from him, doesn't like the college, etc...

About the incident, I'm working in a hotel (administration) L always told me that I should help C to get a job, specifically one in my company -hell no! I always told her that I would never do it bc C was recommended for two jobs (one in a restaurant, in kitchen I was about preparing the mise en place and the other in a vet - he was receptionist) C didn't like it so he decided not to go anymore (less than 1 week in both jobs) 

Now L complaints everyday about C, she doesn't understand why he doesn't want to work, I told her: It's your fault, you always spoiled him - he's a lazy ass and he'll never do anything for himself and I hope u prepare him when u passed away bc I'm not going to provide for him (yeah Ik I was year of resentment, but C already ask my mom about heritage) 

So, AITA?

Edit1: in Perú, most of the colleges r private so  be able to enter the college depends most of the time about money / unless u chose a national college, the entrance exam is difficult.

So here recently I was looking for a professional to dread my hair. I found a place where they had locticians. So I randomly picked one off the list of names, not knowing anything about anyone. When I went in for my consultation, the random girl I chose didn't give me much info and it was less than 5 minutes, so I just did my own research. 

It took about 4 hours. Total was $340 for service and tip. I left the salon with my dreads looking like crap. I kept those in for a while despite hating the way they looked. The 2 maintenance visits totalled to $360 including tip. I ended up combing them out bc I was tired of them looking dumb. So that was $700 down the drain. Live and learn. 

Fast forward some. I decide I would get synthetic extensions for a while instead. I asked the stylist how many I would need and what kind. I already had it in my mind I wanted the single ended locs bc my hair is so thin already. I was gonna get like 20-25.  She told me to get the double ends instead to make my hair fuller, despite what I wanted to get. She also said for me to get 45-50, so I did, even though I thought that was way extreme. The locs were $550.  

I needed a color before the locs were put in. For some reason she only colored my roots. We were talking so it didn't occur to me at the time she didn't color the bottom. Like why? 

So $360 to put all 50 of them bad boys in them including tip. Lemme just tell yall, I looked ridiculous!! Just flip me over and let's go mop something bruh. I told her it was way too much hair and she told me to try it bc it looked good. No, it most certainly did not. So here I go again, spent all that money just to take them out the next day. They were out of control!!

So in total, I've spent $1610 and I have nothing to show for it except some synthetics sitting on my dresser.  The next day, I voiced my discouragement to her.  She then asked me if I would like her to make some single ended ones to try. I was like is this for real?   I can't buy any more, I'm tapped out now. And now u want me to try some single ended ones after I just spent $550 on some good quality double ended locs that I didn't think would work for me in the first place bc they're big.  I ordered what I was told to order despite going against my gut. 

She leaves on maternity leave next month and will be out until April. Would I be TA if I switched to the owner who is also a loctician and get established with her? I really want my locs but don't wanna step on anyone's toes at the same time for when she comes back and sees she lost a client to someone else.  Normally I would never do this. But the multiple times of miscommunication I've had with this chick has cost me so much more than I ever thought I'd spend on this, not to mention all the residue free shampoos, conditioner and tightening sprays I had to buy.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4839157,public,top,self,AITA if I switch my hair stylist to another one in the same building?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8eh4y/aita_if_i_switch_my_hair_stylist_to_another_one/,all_ads,6,,,,

Hello. So my 14F daughter has recently decided to change her way of diet to vegan and i have tried to cooperate with her habbit by buying vegan foods for her and all that. She has been very grateful for all we have done to support her.    


Recently we had a family BBQ that my family has been doing every year for the last 45 years and all of my family attends this. My daughter refuses to go, but I made a compromise to have vegan options as well so she could come along (her uncles and aunts haven't seen her in a while).  My daughter still REFUSES to go because she refuses to be around meat. I explained to her how it was unfair to not have meat for everyone else, but she says she doesn't care and if there's meat she's not going.  


I told her the world doesn't revolve around her and she runs to her room and starts crying. After she's done sobbing, I explain to her how she's being unfair to everyone else at the BBQ and that a lot of our family wanted to see her. She finally decides to go as long as she is able to stay away from any animal products.    


Later that week, we arrive, and everything is going well for a couple hours. I am smoking some briskets and my family is chatting at the table. When everything is ready for serving, I start giving out the briskets with my tongs.     


Then i go to give my daughter some of the food she chose to bring, and she starts screaming at me that i touched her food with the tongs that touched the smoked briskets. At this point I'm pissed. I brought special food for my daughter because she refused to go to the BBQ unless there was vegan food, and this was how she wants to act?  


Everyone at the bbq is looking at us and I feel extremely embarrassed in front of my family by the disrespect my daughter was showing.   I told her to just shut up and eat. I added that it wasnt a big deal and shes exagerating over nothing. Then she proceeded to start sobbing in front of everyone and I thought enough was enough and I pulled her aside to give her a very firm talk.

After that, she went to another room and continued to excessively sob. My brother 42M said that she was being too sensitive and I think she ruined our family gathering.

A few of her cousins, an uncle and her brother and SIL have been complaining about her and I leaving family events early, or being a bit checked out during those events. For context, she and I both started new jobs this year (same field) and bring a lot of work home with us, her more than I. Because of this she has been a bit preoccupied during these events and has had to leave a little early. I must say I also play a part in this, as I'm very introverted and long events drain me, and her family have LONG events and make it a competition around who can stay the longest, which Fiance thinks is normal and I think is a bit toxic.

Her mother (MIL) has relayed this to us, and her specifically, especially the complaints from her brother who is annoyed that we don't go to visit them more, and she ""isn't acting like a sister"". They however do not invite us over and don't exactly make Fiance feel very welcome. MIL has suggested that we just need to pop around every weekend or so to appease them, but we are both in the busiest part of our year and completely swamped over the weekends (especially with her family holding an event seemingly every fortnight.)

She wants to avoid drama and to sacrifice more of our free time to her family, where I have suggested that we let them learn to deal with it, this is going to be our lives going forward. Although apparently, I am an AH for suggesting that and she would do the same for my family (who wouldn't ask us to do that.) I like her family and don't want to upset them, but I feel like this is setting us up to be taken advantage of time-wise (especially with her brother and SIL expecting their first within the year.)

I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to be that annoying fish guy (also I don’t like confrontation.)

I (45m) used to be the legal father of ""June"" (23f) when my ex-girlfriend ""Cathy"" (44f) stated that I was June's father when she got pregnant. At the time I had no reason to doubt Cathy and readily accepted June, signed the birth certificate and worked the first decent job I could find and worked crazy hours so that Cathy to focus on June and going to school part time.

Shortly after June was born there was an expectation that Cathy and I would be getting married by Cathy's family, friends, and Cathy herself. At the time I truly did want to be with Cathy but I just wasn't ready for marriage and I basically for treated like dirt and Cathy would never stick up for me. Eventually, I gave in to the pressure and agreed to marry Cathy but then wanted to wait until after she graduated college. Literally the day after I came home Cathy took June and left. Cathy then later reached out to me and confessed that she cheated and moved in with her new boyfriend, who was a mutual friend of ours. 

I spent years and thousands of dollars fighting for visitation in court but Cathy almost never honored the court order. I tried to fight the best I could for June but Cathy's years of parental alienation paid off and by the time June was 16 she wanted nothing to do with me. That hurt still didn't compare to pain I felt when after handing over the money I saved for June's college expenses Cathy admitted that her husband was June's bio dad and that June and him were pursuing adult adoption in order to cut me out completely. 

I was too hurt and broken to fight anymore and just accepted it. I was in a hole that I didn't think I could escape until I met my wife ""Angela"" (39f). She was everything I needed and more and soon we had our daughter ""Lori"" (6f) into the world. When Lori was around 4 Cathy's sister Beth reached out to me and after the fake pleasantries she told me how June wanted to reach out. I asked why and she said that June regretted her past treatment of me and wanted to reach out. 

I didn't respond for months because I didn't want to reopen that chapter of my life but eventually relented. We would send emails to each other a few times but I never accepted June's friend requests on social media nor did I respond to questions about meeting my wife and daughter. Finally June confessed that it turned out her step/adoptive dad wasn't her bio dad at all and completely disowned her. Cathy stated that I was the only other possible candidate and so June wanted a DNA test. 

I honestly don't believe this and asked June what exactly does she hope to gain from a positive DNA test from me?

     Fast forward to October 10th this year. Our lease is up in less than 60 days (DEC 1)and I’ve been texting the husband for a week to give me an answer as to if we are gonna renew or not. He also has a “girlfriend” at this point. I finally get him to have a convo and he says he’s gotta “kick us out”. We had a trip to Hawaii planned in November that they knew about but decided to make us move anyway. I demanded our deposit back before we moved and I didn’t have us stay or pay November. We found a new place, moved, unpacked, and went to Hawaii within the span of a few weeks. I refused to let them ruin something we worked really hard on. 
    We recently returned from an amazing trip to Hawaii and are loving our new home. My marriage is the best it’s ever been in part I think because we aren’t around such distracting toxicity. About a week ago we were contacted not by either people who invited us to live at the house, but the girlfriend.

I perceive my GIL to be a quintessential busybody. Ever since we got married, she’s voiced her concerns about me (e.g that I don’t do all of the cooking, hosting and communication on behalf of our family) to my in-laws and to my husband but never directly to me. It was funny at first and then slightly hurtful after a few years. But since the birth of our daughter last December, I feel things have escalated (and I admittedly have become more sensitive.)

Brenda began voicing her concern that I wasn’t sharing baby pictures and bringing the baby to see her (again, to many people in our extended family but not to me) even though I’ve expressed travel is difficult for us. When we invite them to stay with us, she expresses that she would prefer not to. 

We were all visiting my in-laws over Thanksgiving and we brought our cat Boogs. He’s had nose discharge issues for years now (thus, Boogs); it’s a chronic condition and is easily maintained. In-laws are fine with him staying but Brenda began complaining loudly to the whole room (while I was in the bathroom and couldn’t participate but could hear some of the conversation) that our cat was sick and it wasn’t right that we brought him. (Even though we had explained his situation to her before.) She continued, saying that guests couldn’t visit our home with such a sick cat. AND that the cat would get my baby daughter sick. My RSD kicked into gear and I was shook. I then pulled an AH move and began typing up an email to express how she made me feel for the duration of our relationship with examples of her talking about me behind my back going back a few years. I know. Dumb choice. Well, she read the email that evening and she tearfully said to me (in front of my in-laws but not my husband) that she loves me and only wants the best for me and my family. That she thought the world of me and was blindsided that I felt this way for so long and would no longer talk to me if that’s what I wanted. 

I felt awful (and still do) and apologized immediately for the email, and then she 
left. Then, my in-laws asked us to take Boogs home. They said I messed up; Brenda deserved my utmost respect as an elder and that she would never talk about me maliciously. At first I felt apologetic, but then I began feeling outnumbered and upset. Last night, I told my husband that we need space from his side of the family. Low contact, no visits or babysitting, just calls and updates. He was not happy to hear that and feels I would be adding another AH move on top of the email. 

Maybe I would be the AH for being overly sensitive. But I feel like they all view me so poorly that regularly entrusting my daughter to them would negatively affect my wellbeing and impact my ability to have a relationship in the future.

The situation is that I am staying in the city on weekdays to easily commute to my work everyday. Some of my clothes are still at home which is an hour away from the city. My brother’s family is living at our family home together with my parents. Since, I left home, i allowed my niece to stay at my room because she liked sleeping there ever since she was small. So they have access to my closet and my clothes that was left there.

Going back, as I’ve said, I did not allow my sister in law to use my dress. However, I think it’s also on me that I did not explain why I did not want her to use it. But I was busy at that time with work. 

On the day of my niece’s (different niece, distant cousin’s daughter) 18th birthday, my brother’s family was invited to attend since their youngest daughter would be performing. I saw the post in social media where my sister in law was wearing my favorite white dress. I was so upset, since I was planning on going home the next day (it was holiday) to get the dress and get it ready for next week’s event. 

One thing about me is that i rarely post on social media, and it irks me to see those who post every angle of their outfit. Also if i knew that i would be repeating the outfit to an important event, I will be limiting my posted pictures or not post at all. 

My sister in law posted that she was wearing my favorite white dress, and so many people saying that the dress i very nice. So now, I can’t use it for the next event because people might say that I borrowed it form her instead of the other way around. Disclaimer, I let my sisters borrow my clothes sometimes if I rarely use them and if I knew that I will not be using it soon. To add, the dress is white and flimsy, I was very careful to not use it always to avoid being faded and ruined due to washing.

We are currently waiting for a third roommate to move-in, but it’s been a bit of a difficult process to find people who don’t drop out last minute. She hasn’t really been dating this guy for a long time, however whenever I try to have discussions with her regarding bills and other things pertaining to the apartment he always tries giving his opinion. I do not know him very well, and I feel as someone who isn’t paying the bills around here it’s not really his place. Also, he has been staying in our apartment for good chunks of time without my roommate even asking me if I was ok with it. I ran into him one day (when she wasn’t even home herself mind you) and he said “thanks for letting me hang here while I wait to move into my new place”…However my roommate never even told me he would be doing that. There have also been numerous occasions where they have both left the doors unlocked to our apartment and also made loud noise resulting in complaints from our downstairs neighbors. As I am typing this, they are currently out in the common areas playing music and being pretty loud. To me, it honestly feels like he is a bit too comfortable being in the apartment. I even came home today and knew my roommate was not home (She was actually leaving as I was coming in) but I heard noises coming from her room leading me to believe he was here yet again unaccompanied by her. I just find that to be pretty inconsiderate of her not to even ask me how I feel about this. Another thing that annoyed me a bit happened the other morning. I needed to use the shower and get to an appointment but couldn’t because HE was using it. I personally feel like that isn’t right because I pay to use utility and this isn’t his home to be getting ready in. Reading that sentence back seems a bit harsh, but that’s honestly how I feel.

Let’s start from the beginning, I was dating a guy, let’s call him M [M(15)]. At the time I identified as bisexual and all was well. M is an amazing, the sweetest guy you will ever see. We dated for three months. He was the reason I got out of an almost 5 month straight every night argument with my parents, realizing much later that I had Borderline personality disorder. And he saw me in some of my darkest times. I met “A” 10 months ago, via an irl friend who he later would end up dating. At the time I told “A” EVERYTHING, secrets no one else to this day knows/knew at the time. He was one of those people you talk to and just feel comfortable around. Around the end of the 2nd month of me and M’s relationship I started to doubt if I was Bi or a lesbian. The very first week of me and M’s 3rd month of dating I told “A” over a late night call that I was questioning if I was actually Bi, telling him I may be a lesbian because the question was eating me alive. And then telling him how hard it would be for me to break M’s heart. Knowing M would blame himself for me leaving. I was really struggling with the idea of telling him, how to tell him, and eventually seeing his reaction would break me. Keep in mind A and M have each other’s discord. “A” was telling me that I would have to tell him, and it was unfair to not tell M as soon as possible, I agreed and still agree that it’s unfair to M. The reason I didn’t right then is because this happened many times before me and M were a thing, and it always went back to Bi.

I told him what I wanted and didn’t want. Wants included: a photographer or close family/friend to capture the moment, a scenic and intimate location, my nails done, and for us both to be dressed up. Things I did NOT want: holiday proposal, large crowd, family gathering, beach, or restaurant. Once he mentioned proposing in Iceland under the northern lights and I told him I loved that idea. 

Well, here’s some of the backstory to leading up to the proposal. We go to South Carolina because my partner wanted to see family and interview for a new job. While driving, I mention some places we want to see and fight because, “the whole point of this trip is for work, not fun.” That killed the mood for the rest of the trip. We see one his friends who has seven dogs day of, so I wore older clothes I didn’t care about getting dog hair on and he’s wearing a stained grey hoodie and grey jeans that do not match. Somehow, he convinces me to get my hair done in that town, but the stylist did an awful job. I also had my natural nails that I stress bit. He takes me to the beach on a cloudy day, the outfits/look I described, asks a stranger to take a picture, and didn’t say or do anything romantic leading up to the proposal. At this point, I was heartbroken that I meant so little to him to have no effort put in to have a nicer proposal and so much went wrong, but said yes I’m hopes he would care about me enough to fix it. 

The next day, I asked if we could fix how I felt by maybe dressing up, fixing my hair, and having his mom take some staged proposal pictures to make it look nice. He told me he was, “too busy” to do that, but played video games for over 4 hours that day. 

We come home and he has made constant excuses as to why he can’t fix the proposal and how he doesn’t understand why I’m upset. I’ve explained to him that his lack of effort makes me feel like he doesn’t care about my feelings or that I’m not special enough to him to deserve something better. I suggested maybe, “reproposing” in a way that shows me how much he loves me. It’s been 10 months and still nothing, just excuses on why he can’t do anything and making me feel like I’m ungrateful for even wanting something better. I’m mainly upset because he knew what I wanted and how I felt, yet did the opposite. He also didn’t ask any of my friends or family for guidance.

For context, the ex in reference here is the only person I’ve ever had any sexual contact with of any kind, we never had regular sex, but we did do oral. I could not have gotten HSV-2 from anywhere else, I’ve never done drugs and I don’t have any tattoos so a dirty needle can’t have caused it either.

Last week, I(24M) had blood work done and requested an STD/STI panel. Today I got the results of my blood work, and it came back positive for HSV-2, more commonly known as genital herpes. Once I found this out, I decided I should send a message to the ex I got it from to warn her about it in case she’s never been tested or doesn’t know. I just told her that I wasn’t expecting a response and that I was trying to do a courtesy in case she wants kids(neonatal herpes is a risk), so she could talk to a doctor about it.

I thought that would be it, I didn’t expect her to respond, and I have no desire to have further conversation with her. A little over an hour after I sent that message, her father reached out to me telling me he was mad that I am “terrorizing a married woman” and that I’m making this up because she’s never had sex with me so she can’t have it, and he went as far as to claim that she has a negative test. He also said that he’s mad now and if he hears of me messaging her again he’ll “get angry and [I] won’t like that”. 

I was shocked at this. It came across to me as threatening, which pissed me off. However, I tried to keep my cool and responded by telling him I have no intention of ever reaching out again, that I was trying to do get a courtesy because of its impact on pregnancy, and explained that, while we didn’t have sex, “we did other things that spread it”[read: oral]. I ended by saying if she actually has a test with a negative result, then I’m glad because it means mine was a false positive.

I haven’t heard back from him again and I’m not sure that I would respond again regardless. No other messages have been sent or received by anyone involved.

Like I said in the context, she just got married last week, so my timing was bad, but I felt like that’s something that I shouldn’t wait to tell in case they try to have kids right away. I didn’t even consider that I did anything wrong until he sent that message, and I still don’t feel like I did anything wrong, but I am fuming because I feel like I just got chewed out and borderline threatened for trying to do the right thing.

Sometimes, like when I tell him something important, he will either remember me saying it differently or he won’t remember me saying it at all.

This has never caused any huge arguments or whatever, but it does make it difficult to communicate with him sometimes. He is aware of his memory problems, so he had the idea to start writing planned events in his calendar just in case he ever forgets. Admittedly, I took offense to this at first. I felt like he didn’t trust me at my word, but he insisted that it was just to help himself remember.

It’s been a few years since, and I have to admit that it’s really helped in our ability to communicate. Now, the only times when he forgets is when he doesn’t write it down.

We’ll fast forward to last Friday. 

Me and a close mutual friend of ours, my husband’s best friend in fact, had made plans for him to come over to hang out with us since it’s been awhile. 

I distinctly remember telling my husband that we needed to get stuff to make burgers and fries, and he said he would do so. I can’t drive so he has to be the one to get groceries.

Well, Friday comes around and he still hasn’t gone to the store to get any ingredients. I tell him this, and he acts like he has no idea what I’m talking about. I get confused and tell him to check his calendar and it’s not written down in there. I told him that he always forgets when he doesn’t write it down but he swears up and down that I never mentioned anything about our friend coming over, much less about needing stuff for burgers. 

This snowballed into a big fight in which I kept insisting that I told him everything and he kept swearing to god he doesn’t recall anything about it. 

I have to admit that I got very angry and said some things that I regret. He broke down in tears, something I only saw him do when his grandmother died last year, and kept saying he doesn’t remember anything. 

I felt bad and told him that it’s ok it happens and that I was sorry for being mean to him about it. I said I can order us pizza and that I’ll explain to our friend what happened.

Our friend came over and yelled SURPRISE at my husband, and he had a few bags of groceries with him. Which turned out to be stuff to make burgers with. 

I got confused and asked what that was all about and our friend reminded me that it was a surprise for my husband since the haven’t seen each other for over a month.

Then it dawned on me that I can completely forgotten that it was supposed to be a surprise and that I had, in fact, never told my husband about it.

My husband seems ok now, but our friend accused me of gaslighting someone with established issues with memory. But I feel like it’s not gaslighting if I genuinely remembered something incorrectly myself. 

I’ve already apologized for what I did but I don’t like being called a gaslighter when I don’t think that’s what I did.

We’ve been together for about a year and one month, and he’s given me a promise ring on our one year anniversary. 

There is a lady who is a friend of my grandpa’s, and she hired me over the summer to work at the local diner as a waitress. Four weeks after I started, my boyfriend applied because he needed extra money for band(he’s in marching band), and keep in mind it was his first job. Instead of him getting properly trained by a manager, the lady had me train him because well… of our relationship and she thought I could do it well since she thinks I did my job well. I know I didn’t train him well enough, but I didn’t know how the hell to train someone how to make every milkshake, work the register, clean, etc… Anyway, he struggled a bit, but did well when one of the managers could show him what to do. That apparently did not meet the lady’s expectations and she fired him after him working only 5-7 days. 

Once school started, I quit my job because I wanted to be able to focus on academic as rather than be stressed about work. A lot of time passed by and then I saw the lady again and she asked if me and my boyfriend were still together, and I said yes. She goes on a tangent about how he’s too immature for me and says it’s be better in the long run if I dump him.

Well that pissed me off because she doesn’t even know him. I know I’m academically ahead of him because I’m doing high school, taking college classes, and juggling a new job, but still. I do not know any teenage boy who is going to be ‘mature’

And I asked my partner and out some to PLEASE do the dishes. (We don't have a dishwasher and I've fallen behinde) I even offered to pick up dinner on the way home. 

Fast-forward myself and the girls come home and the dishes are 'done' but there's still silverware and a pot that is full of leftovers that needed to be dumped and washed...anyway I was obviously beyond annoyed but still served everyone their dinners....was stuffing it TF down. My partner could tell I was annoyed he kept asking after I said nothing 4 times. So I finally SNAPPED. I was like the dishes aren't done, there's this that the other. It's not done!! So he comes back at me yelling and screaming he works! And wanted to know what I did all week....I just wash a couple dishes and sit around.....I'm like completely heartbroken.

I love to decorate the outside of our house for Christmas with my daughter. Last year, my daughter saw the LED icicle lights that look like they’re “dripping,” and wanted to decorate with them this year. So we got them and put them on our front porch. I should also mention while we love to decorate, it’s not at all Clark Griswold level. Think icicle lights on the porch and some bushes and trees draped in colorful lights. We also have the lights on a time until 5:00am.

Our neighbor, E, is a single lady. E and I live across the street from a park, and there have been times where E will yell at kids at the park for being “too loud.” We are friendly with her, and my husband will often offer her a beer if he sees her outside. Other than that, we don’t really talk to her.

In the past, she has asked us to turn our twinkle lights on our back patio off at 9:00 pm because she can see them thru her bedroom window. We have obliged, but the one time I was in her house, I noticed that she didn’t have any curtains on her bedroom window. She only has blinds that let light get through.

Last night she told my husband that our Christmas lights look like police lights, and they come in through her living room windows, and shine light in her hallway and bedroom. My husband told her that it’s the holidays and we have a kiddo, so we thought she’d get the hint. Tonight she texted me and asked if we could turn the lights off when we go to bed. In order to try and keep the peace, I told her we could turn them off at 10pm which is when we go to bed. She responded, “Wow, okay, I guess it’s up to you then. I go to bed at 9 and wake up at 5. Have a good night.” None of our other neighbors have complained about the lights, and there are other people in the neighborhood with those lights.

I like this dog I really do, she has such a good nature and is fun having her. Except I've noticed that because I work remotely my gf has been palming alot of the responsibilities of caring for her onto me, eg feeding her, walking etc.

 Now I don't mind all this but currently it's been pouring down with rain and I hate the rain and don't like walking in it. She also says well you work from home and you can walk her during your lunch break. I don't like doing this because if I'm going to walk her I do it properly, a solid 45min walk/jog cause she's young. But then I get home and I'm all sweaty for the rest of the day and havent had a lunch break. 

She will say I'm lazy for not taking her and I'm only a parent when I want to be, thing is, it's not my dog! It's hers! If anything were to happen between us, it wouldn't be joint custody or anything it would be solely hers so I find it hard to believe I'm being lazy when I don't want to walk her in the rain.

Furthermore, my gf gets up super late every morning, I'll wake her up when I get up and ill get myself ready for the day and say to her, hey you should take the dog out before work. When I come back to the room she's still in bed sleeping and is always arriving to her work bang on time, sometimes without breakfast because she wakes up so late. So in the morning I'll take the dog outside for the bathroom and feed her and refill her water bowl, all that stuff.

Also the dog doesn't listen to me either as it's young and it's not very well trained. So walking it can be a chore, when the dog doesn't want to move she will not budge and will lie down and just stare at me.

I (26M) and my friend Paul (25M) work in a small local supermarket.  So Paul has a sister, lets say Janet (29F) who lives about 6 hours away.  She was coming home to spend the month leading up to Thanksgiving (she works from home so all she needs is a computer and wifi and shes good..lucky).  Paul bought a bunch of groceries at his parents behest (he still lives at home) but he wasn't off for another two hours and asked if I could drop them off.  I've known his family for a long time and they have no qualms about me alone in their house.  He told me no one was home (Parents at work and Janice wasn't due till the next day) and gave me his key.   

So I get to his house and walk up the porch steps and put the box down (heavy AF) and unlock the door intending to open it and pick up the box.  Well as I swing the door wide I am greeted by the image of a nude woman in the living room.  Janice is home.   We both freeze like deer in headlights.  In the span of a few seconds the Hamster wheel in my brain began working again and I said ""Shit I'm Sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry!!""  I looked down, miss the door handle twice as she bolts down the hall and back up quickly slamming the door...and forgot the box was behind me.  I trip over it, do a cartwheel on my head down the steps and land in a heap.

I'm trying to catch my breath and remember where the hell I am when Janice comes out the door (clothed) and rushes to me to help me up.  About that time her dad came home.  He runs over surprised to she Janice there and me on the ground.  When she tells him he goes silent..then bursts into laughter.   She begins to laugh too but I'm too shocked and in a daze to know anything.  They help me inside and get me settled.  After their mom comes home she finds it funny too.  By this point I'm laughing.  Well, when Paul gets home and hears the tale..he goes red.  It goes away though and he gives a light chuckle and blows it off.

Well this whole month every time I come over Janice will joke about it ""Hey, you still owe me for the show.""  Things like that.  I play along but Paul is always dour when it happens.  Well yesterday I was over there and Janice made another joke and Paul blew his lid.  He yelled at her it wasn't funny one of his friends saw her naked and then he points at me and says I should have knocked.  I said ""You gave me the key and said go in.."" and he yelled back ""Well that shits over..GET OUT!""   I was floored and Janice told him to shut up and not talk to his friend like that to which he cussed her out and stormed to his room.  I got up and told Janice I would go home and she nodded, walked me to the door, hugged me and told me she would try and calm him down.

So when I (f17) was 15 I got pregnant with my exes(then m17, now m19), even though we so was on birth control and used protection. I didn’t tell anyone about the pregnancy, and ended up having a miscarriage about 8 weeks in.

He gave me his condolences and told me if I ever needed to talk about it he would be there, so I thanked him and we fell out of touch for a bit.
A few weeks after that, (I was 16 and he was 18 as we both just had birthdays) maybe three months after the miscarriage, I was feeling really depressed about the situation, so I decided to contact my ex for some support. At this point I guess he had a new girlfriend, because when I texted him she was reading over his shoulder and even dictating some of his responses.
They both told me I was a bitch and that I needed to “get the fuck over it” and stop coming to him with this. I was confused because he had offered his support, and this was only the second time I contacted him. After them yelling at me for a bit, I blocked him and had a good cry.

But I try to stay out of it. I know he is waiting to introduce me to a “new partner”, I think I just have to fake surprise. 

My mom knows I still see my dad regularly and sometimes I stay at his place, I’m the only one who does, my siblings have rejected him for months.

Multiple times I’ve been praised for doing a good job and even got a promotion and a slight raise. 
When I first started we were receiving direct deposit for our checks, for these two or three months I received almost no pay stubs. Once the company switched back to checks and we started to receive paystubs with each check I noticed my federal withholding on my taxes was $0. Despite being a single mom with two dependents, I knew there was no way my taxes should be $0. I brought it up to the company owner (small business), he informed me to tell his daughter (in charge of most things) and she would address it with the CPA. Then he chuckled and said “or you can just pay it at the end of the year. You don’t make too much money it shouldn’t be that much”. This was the first thing that rubbed me the wrong way about a lot of things. Two months later that issue was sorted out. 
BUT upon reviewing my paystubs more closely I discovered they have been calculating my pay incorrectly ✨multiple✨ times as well and adjusting it to say I took longer breaks than I did(1hr lunch when I was only gone 30-45 minutes and I can see who was the one to edit it, the daughter). Again I brought it up to the company owner and explained to him where his daughter was miscalculating overtime pay and had adjusted my time cards without my knowledge. He consults the CPA and then later explains the same thing I told him like it was some revelation I would not understand on how pay periods and workweeks are done.  
I had let this problem go multiple times as they were giving me a bit extra money for gas (that I never asked for. I drive far af for this job that I’m apparently pretty good at and they can’t afford to lose anymore people). However they have not done that lately (2months+). I’ve brought it up multiple times and have been assured the issue was corrected, I received my check last week and discovered yet again another error(second since I noticed and told them). I’ve researched the technical state laws for overtime pay just to confirm I’m not an idiot. 
I guess my manager mentioned to either daughter or owner that there was yet again another issue with my check.

I average between $5 to $7.50 an hour, but it isn't bad for pocket money, and right now I have a lot to save up for. I recently quit a good job teaching piano and changed states to get away from an abusive husband who spent all of my savings, and I have a baby on the way.

My side hustle started when my mom posted a picture of my sister wearing a snowman hat I made for her on Facebook, stating what I was asking per hat and asking people to get in touch in the comments if they wanted one. (My mom is more active on social media than I am and has more friend). Most recently, a high school acquaintance of my mom's (whom I've never met or heard of before) commented, saying she wanted one because it was ""a perfect chemo hat."" I got in touch with her through messenger as I do all of my potential clients, giving her information on prices, sizes, colors, etc. She answered with her preferred size and color, and then sent me a second message saying, ""I don't know if your mom told you, but I have stage 4 breast cancer, hence the chemo hat.""
Later on when we were discussing shipping, she asked if it was possible to get a discount. I said I would try to get the cheapest possible shipping for her, but explained that I was already charging her $5 less than I usually charge (due to a misunderstanding) and was only making $5 an hour doing this. 
She answered that she understood, but money was just short ever since she was diagnosed with cancer.

We met when we were 13 on PS4, and from there we have crushed on each other up until we got together in May. In July, I visited him for a week! I ended up staying with his mother the whole time. Her &amp; I clicked, as well as his sister &amp; I. Mark also ended up giving me a promise ring those first few days. 

Just to add, Mark’s parents ended up getting divorced when he was in elementary school due to his father having an affair with a blonde bombshell that’s 20 years younger than him. His father ended up marrying her. 

Moving on, we planned to eat breakfast with his father and step mother. Noticeably, a few weird things happened. His step mother (Crystal) cooked a big lavish breakfast-  huge platter of buttered toast in the middle of the table kind of lavish. I’m not even going to lie, it was awkward. Mark’s father was very antisocial, &amp; was focused on a yankees baseball game playing in the living room. Crystal really only talked about herself. Her body language SCREAMED judgmental. I was counting the minutes before we left.

Fast forward, Mark’s grandmother hosts a family dinner every Sunday night. They are strict Catholic Italians. This tradition is required. So basically, we attend. Mark’s sister drove with us &amp; brought her boyfriend with her so It would be less awkward for me. We walk in, but it turned out everyone was already eating? We sit down and awkwardly start fixing our plates, the food is cold &amp; the room is SO silent. There’s chitchat here and there, and we really only had 5 minutes to eat before everyone started cleaning up &amp; leaving. As this was happening, it was only her, Crystal, Mark and I at the table. The silence was broke by Crystal, saying “What’s that!!” surprisingly. I had no idea what she was talking about, and then it clicked for me. THE RING. I awkwardly laughed and looked over at Mark, telling Crystal that it was a gift from him. I showed her my hand and then turned over to his grandmother to give her a look.

Grandma was not pleased. She sighed, and said “Oh. Wow. Okay.”  passive aggressively. She got up and left the table. Crystal smiled, &amp; followed up her original comment with “Oh i am so sorry, I had no idea!” proceeding to shrug her shoulders. 

Mark’s grandmother didn’t make eye contact with me for the rest of the night. I was the one that had to reach out to her to say goodbye. 

Now, I’m moving in with Mark. I’ve heard things here and there about Crystal and his grandmother telling his family how Mark and I will “never work”. Mark is wanting me to spend the Holidays with his fathers family now that Christmas is happening while I’m there. We have talked about what happened in detail &amp; I’ve expressed to him how Crystal’s actions were absolutely on purpose to sabotage me. He’s claimed that I “can’t keep wanting to run away from his family” &amp; how “I’m being unreasonable”.

So when I (f17) was 15 I got pregnant with my exes(then m17, now m19), even though we so was on birth control and used protection. I didn’t tell anyone about the pregnancy, and ended up having a miscarriage about 8 weeks in. I knew it would have been extremely difficult to have and raise a baby at the age, but I was still devastated about it. 
After a couple months I told my mom, doctors, and my ex. He had broken up with me a couple weeks before the miscarriage, and he hadn’t known I was pregnant so I don’t fault him for that. He gave me his condolences and told me if I ever needed to talk about it he would be there, so I thanked him and we fell out of touch for a bit.
A few weeks after that, (I was 16 and he was 18 as we both just had birthdays) maybe three months after the miscarriage, I was feeling really depressed about the situation , so I decided to contact my ex for some support. At this point I guess he had a new girlfriend, because when I texted him she was reading over his shoulder and even dictating some of his responses.
They both told me I was a bitch and that I needed to “get the fuck over it” and stop coming to him with this. I was confused because he had offered his support, and this was only the second time I contacted him. After them yelling at me for a bit, I blocked him and had a good cry.

So after I established that we were both screwed and had a ghastly bill, I called my close friend who has more money than me to come quickly as an emergency and something awful has happened. 
He came and saw that it was just that we wanted him to pay our bill, he did. On the way back, he accused me of running a scheme and doing this on purpose as I knew he would come. He tried to tell me I’m deceitful and that I put my new friend in an awkward situation (he was in the backseat with me). “I’ll be surprised if he ever speaks to you again”, which he did. He wasn’t upset, more-so, angry that I wasted his time and pulled a foul stunt as such.

I (20f) walked out of my CNA job on the spot after a year of unfair treatment. Ever since I started this time last year there has been this Charge Nurse who literally makes my 12hr shift a living hell.
 
She literally yells at me for no reason. I called out one day because I was sick (at the peak of covid) and the day I called in she wasn’t even scheduled. Next day I come in she stops me in the nurses station and starts yelling at me about missing work and how I need to be more reliable and not call out last minute and said I need to call her personally to let her know if I’m not coming in. Which my hospital policy stated I have to let scheduling know if I’m not coming in, I don’t have to let my charge nurse know. About a few weeks later I call out and she calls my personal phone asking where I was I stated I call in and she said I needed to tell her next time and begins yelling at me I hung up straight in her face. Next day rolls around I have a shift and she yells at me for hanging up on her in front of everyone saying how disrespectful I was, she was so loud patients came out of their rooms to see what the yelling was about. I starred at her after her rant and said “OK” and tried my best to avoid her for the remainder of my shift.

Charge Nurses are the ones who write out your assignments and anytime I worked I would have the most patients out of all the CNA’s. I’m talking I would have 15 patients while the others had 5 or 6 a piece. I would bring this up to her and she would always brush it off. It got to the point where I would actively try to not work the same days as her ( as suggested by my nurse manager &amp; supervisor). But it’s like she would pick up shifts she knew I’d be working just to fuck with me. 

I’ve reported her multiple times to HR with nothing. The HR lady even told me “oh we get a lot of reports about her all the time” reported her several times to my nurse manager &amp; supervisor with nothing ever happening. Apparently this Charge Nurse is mean to all the newbies starting out until you’re no longer a newbie which is so stupid why treat someone badly because you’re a “senior nurse”? It’s like high school behavior.

Well my breaking point was when I was scheduled and she didn’t give me any patients and wanted me to take care of the other nurses patients while they sit and chat in the break room for their whole shift and do lunch breaks which no one has ever had to do. I told her I’m not spending a 12hr shift doing everyone else’s work while everyone sits here and does nothing. She then begins yelling at me (no shocker) and I immediately work out of work and clock out I’m was tired of the treatment I’ve always endured from her.

Well my co workers think I’m an asshole for walking out of work and said “that’s just how she is with newbies” and I should just “toughen up” and no I heavily disagree who would be ok with talking care of 24 patients just because while y’all sit around doing nothing. No one!!

Aaron decided to order a piece of their reeses cheesecake after our meal, and Jeremy began driving us home after we paid the check. 

In the car,  I got a better look at the piece of cake. I can't lie, the cheesecake looked hella good. I asked Aaron if I could have a piece of the cake, and he had a slightly reluctant look on. He said, ""Sorry I'm not trying to be a dick, but I paid like over 10 dollars for this."" I said ""okay"" a tiny bit disappointed. Three minutes later, Aaron pulled out the piece and said, ""Why not?"" He cut off a small piece of it and gave it to me. I thanked him and Aaron said ""You're welcome"" before turning back to his seat. It was subtle, but I could tell he was a tiny bit sad. After Aaron was dropped off, Jeremy said ""I didn't want to say anything, but you shouldn't have asked Aaron for part of his cake."" 

I was pretty stunned. I didn't really think I was being a jerk just by asking for a small piece of food, and I didn't say this out loud, but Aaron comes from a pretty well-off family.

But then, just like out of nowhere, she started to undress herself and things got hot very quickly. So currently I´m dating her, but not even a single person knows about it. AITA for doing the D with her even if she is one of my friends ex?

The usual middle class family with 2 kids and a dog. Bought a 900k house last year and have other commitments.

I changed jobs recently and got a joining bonus of 20k (13 after taxes). We'll be married 10 years in December. My husband has zero wishes in life. Wouldn't buy tees that cost more than 10 bucks. Wants a full sleeve tee but his budget is 20 bucks. Rarely spends on himself.

I so want to buy him a Rolex. Should cost 10k. I'm worried he'll lose his head when he hears the price. But he deserves good things. They grew up poor and he struggled early in life. We still don't live like we have a household income of close to 500k before taxes. I'd like for him to pass it down to one of our kids and it become a piece of our family's heritage.

For the past 3 Christmases, I always give everyone fruit preserves. I make homemade marmalade and jam of all kinds, it's one of my hobbies and I even sell them online. I try to only give people one's that are made from fruits that they like. I only give them to adults I get the children different things.

Last year, my sister got engaged and married to a man, ""Kevin"".

Last Christmas, Kevin complained when I gave him and my sister a box of jars of different kinds of fruit preserves for Christmas. He said that it is tacky and trashy for me to give them as a gift in front of the whole family. It was very embarrassing.

However he still ate them ones, and my sister even mentioned to me that he really likes my jam and that it's better than store ones.

Not that big a deal as everyone loves cooking so we all pitch in.

Then, my sister who has a very very outgoing personality asks our host where to put a piece of China once it's been cleaned. There's no answer. There is a pause then she asks again raising her voice. Again no answer. A sister-in-law pipes in explaining to our host why it's rude not to answer my sister. The host explodes in rage literally stomping out of the kitchen and telling all of us to get out of her house.

Australian dish that is made from egg whites and sugar. Very fragile but tasty. 

Me and my group that we were assigned to for the year made our pavlovas with no conflict or anything going wrong, put them through the over and cleaned up our area. When they were finished we took them out of the oven after they cooled and put them on the bench. While we were getting our containers to put the pavlovas in, one of the girls in our group knocked over a jug (with nothing in it thankfully) and it landed on one of the pavlovas, breaking it. 

I told her that she had to take the pavlova that she smashed but she said it was an accident and took a non smashed pavlova, leaving the smashed pavlova for me. I thought that was completely BS and when she put the pavlova down to open her container, I took the pavlova back WITHOUT TOUCHING HER and told her she would have to have the smashed pavlova because she broke it.

She seemed to get pissed off at this and told me to give it back. I told her again that she would have to own up to her mistake of breaking the pavlova. She pouted off and then 2 minutes later she returned with 3 of her friends who got up in my face to tell me to give her back the pavlova. I told them she would have to have the smashed one since she broke it. They responded with ""it was an accident"" and I said ""that doesn't change anything, she has to own up to her mistake.
