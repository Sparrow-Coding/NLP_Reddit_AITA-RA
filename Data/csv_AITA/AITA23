But today I was talking with her and I was joking around saying how sometimes I zone out when I’m doing tasks other than registers and customers will sneak up behind me to ask questions and it’ll startle me a bit. She proceeded to tell me that I should always be aware of customers around me and to take it more seriously, in a really aggressive tone might I add.

Later today she overheard me and another  coworker talking and laughing and I said that sometimes when I’m doing registers and I’m waiting for customers I’ll mess around with the sensor tags in the drawer and she was all like “really? you have nothing better to do? like are you serious right now? I’m right here. I’m not paying you to slack off” which yeah it’s not the most productive thing but when it’s a slow day and there’s not a lot of customers, there really isn’t much to do. All my coworkers do the same thing and for whatever reason she had to scold me for it. It’s like that with everything.

Problem is - 'overnight' for them is not the same for me, I sleep at different hours, plus I am on my period and I wake up multiple times to use the bathroom. So obviously need to be able to flush + wash my hands after. This is impossible without water (and no I can't refill it manually, I checked). It is stressing me out to the point that I woke up worried about it at 3am and had to hold it for another 4 hours.

Also they say it's to save money, but I calculated and the leak is costing approx $1-2 for 8 hours. 

I told them I wasn't ok with this, that I need to use the bathroom at different times, and they were complete assholes to me - yelling and being horrible about it. It's not my fault there's a leak and I feel it's unreasonable to deprive me of water just because they don't need it during those hours.

It’s about 20-30 minutes to go to school. Since I don't have an extra car, it's my dad who's actually driving both of us. Finding a place to park over there is horrible, not to mention the cost of actually parking in the garages around the college. We currently only carpool two days of the week together, and it's just going from school back to home. 

For the first semester of college, my friend drove herself to school. In the second semester, she asked if we could carpool to school and from school, and I agreed. I asked if she could be the one to drive. I offered to split the gas money as well as the parking permit cost. However, she said her mom said she wasn't allowed to carpool, so it’s my dad sending/picking us from school.

I stayed an hour and half for the two days per week so that she could carpool back home. The carpooling also started with club events that didn't really line up with classes. At the end of the semester, she gave me a $50 gift card (and one milk tea). I gave the gift card to my dad.

Currently, it's the third semester, and I agreed to carpool again. We carpool from school back to home. Her dad is the one who drives her to school. I lost a bit of trust in my friend for reasons unrelated to carpooling. (main one was when we agreed to be partners for a project, but when the time came to actually pick partners, her friend put both of their names down. When I asked her to clarify, she essentially told me to find a new partner with no apology either. It may not be a huge issue, but it's still iffy for me).

This semester, we didn't go to school events. There was one club event where she said we could carpool. I (half-jokingly) said that she could buy me milk tea for the ride, but she told me that I could buy my own milk tea. She ended up deciding not to go to that club event in the end though. Another part of the reason I don't want to carpool in the future is the money. There wasn't any mention of splitting the cost this semester. Also, this week, our professor for a class said there would be no in-person classes. That meant that I only had to go tutoring (starts that week), and then I could go back home. However, my friend asked if I could stay back an hour and fifteen minutes, just so she could carpool home as well. I'll probably say yes.

Also, my dad is fine with carpooling, because it's a nice thing to do. I would've been totally fine with carpooling once in a while, like just to school events, but constantly carpooling for school is becoming tiring since I’m not sure if I’m being taken advantage of. If she asks about carpooling for future semesters, I'm planning to ask to split the cost or ask if her dad could pick both of us some days (alternating days of who picks up).

Would I be an asshole if I told my friend that I didn't want to carpool in future semesters if she doesn't want to split the cost or alternate who drives, even if I wasn't the one driving?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4807741,public,top,self,WIBTA Carpooling with Friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzu7m6/wibta_carpooling_with_friend/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Our program is held to a very high standard by the school-- if you don't show up on a day you're scheduled you're kicked, if you curse on air you're kicked, if you make a mistake the director has to point it out. There's this student in my class (16M). He's a good person, and he edits most of the videos we do. A few days ago, he was scheduled to run a camera. That same day, I was scheduled to be the director. 

We have some rules so our show looks good--one being that we should have our hands still on the camera at all times while we're live, no exceptions. I made sure all the cameras were perfect. We go live and the stream's intro video. 20 seconds before we have to cut to the camera that the person was holding, I noticed the camera was moved a lot, cutting one of our anchors off from the shot and exposing the wall off the set. Over the headset, I kindly asked them to move the camera back. Seeing nothing and hearing no response, I told the floor director to assist (they did).

We go live, and the camera starts shaking and moving. The camera only does this when the camera person's not holding the camera still. I said once more to fix their shot, tbey didn't. When we went to the Pledge, I told everyone with a headset to hold their cameras still. At this point, our floor director had this person and another student swap cameras. As the show progressed, it's noticeable that the camera was shaking like crazy. Now, I'm constantly, back-to-back yelling for them to hold the camera still (as our floor director has to manage the floor--they can't hold their camera and do their job at once).

We always have a brief meeting after the show. During this meeting, the director is supposed to call out any mistakes. I didn't call the person by name, but I said the following (and I quote): ""Just a blanket statement, if you're on a camera, please make sure you're holding it still. One of our shots looked wonky when you watch the playback, and people probably noticed.""

Then, one of the people in the room raised their hand and informed me that the person has a disability making it difficult for them to hold the camera still, was doing their best and that I shouldn't be mad at him. The whole class starts clapping, and I (very confused at first) start clapping too.

I agree that I shouldn't be mad at him, and I wasn't mad at him--I was mad the shot wasn't right and I had no awareness that he had trouble holding the camera (if I did, I would've asked if he needed any support). I bring this up, saying that I wasn't mad at him. One of the anchors backed me up, saying that if a director is yelling it isn't personal--it means something needs to get done and it isn't.

I think I responded the best I could, as people were discussing the show in the hall, but I also feel guilty for now knowing I yelled at someone for something they couldn't control.

For context, I'm a Female minor. I've never been a social person and had an overall rough childhood with limited friends. My friendship started with a girl who I'll call Jay when we were 8. We met in school, and it went from that to a many yearlong friendship group \*with two other girls I'll call Sarah and Lia\*. Lia, always favorited Jay. Jay was the ""leader"" of our friend group.

More context on Jay, she was mentally weird. She said she was bipolar from a young age, and her family life was not good either. She had 2 stepmoms, and her dad was divorced with her mom. She had also a really big ego, putting others down to make sure they wouldn't go against her. Up until last year, Sarah who I was closest to had moved schools, but we still kept in touch. Jay had gotten more and more rude to others, body shaming others, calling people really bad things, insulting people about their clothes, yelling at teachers, back talking her other friends, and was overall was to me a shitty person, yet she was popular.

I still hang out with her, why? It's cause it's overall really hard for me to speak to people, make friends, and overall horrible social skills, she also just uses me as a punching bag even if I don't try to talk to her. Jay though, degrades me, and reminds me of when I wanted to off myself purposely to try to trigger me. Recently, she made a rumor that liked Lia, \*other girl in friend group\* and since I'm from an area where kids will call you slurs/harass just for being different let alone being gay and spread this rumor across the school. Things like this were common for her to do to me. Everyone around me, other friends, family, or just advice people have given me had been telling me to get away from her.

Another detail, I know a lot about her. She talks about herself a lot, so she often says things that people would not like getting out. This means, I know a lot. She recently, had something that she yelled at me saying I ""never struggled in life"" and ""had taken advantage of her kindness"" and ""I should have offed myself back then"". I was pissed, and went off at her, saying low blows about her divorced parents, her brother, and overall things she wouldn't want others to know. I've made this clear to her, how I can tell everyone about this. I don't intent to use this info, just as a fear aspect. I don't mean to ever tell anyone these things, I would never do that, but I still feel shitty for threatening her.

Me and jimmy talked about having a 3some and jimmy said he was down and gave the green light. After I got the ok I talked to Adam about it and he said yes as well. We had the event planned out. 

Jimmy backed out but me and Adam decided do the do. 
The next day Adam an Jimmy went to the store together and Jimmy said to “Adam you know we’re good bro” and Adam told me and it seemed Gucci.

I asked Jimmy what the rule was like could me Adam do the do again or was it a one time thing. Jimmy said I don’t care just let me play my video games. So me and Adam do the do again. 

I order some more condoms and Jimmy opened my package and found them and that’s when Jimmy got weird.

Jimmy started calling me names and just being rude. He called me a joke and stupid. And when I would say good morning he would flick me off. 

He then messaged me and said what are the rules like if your allow to have sex with my best friend when ever you want I should be allow to have sex with other people what are the rules. 

I gave him the rules what I was ok with. I said the main thing is I want to know who and approve of the person like I did for Adam. He gave me the name “Brittany” which is Adam ex wife and just a horrible person. My response was haha not in my house. I thought he was joking cause in the past he said I would never touch that woman and he knew how much I dislike her like actively hate. 

I realize pretty quickly that he may not have been joking and he was very upset. He said if “Adam is going to have sex with my wife im going to have sex with his.” He wouldn’t let me explain why, an just assumed that I was trying to be greedy which was not the case.

In all of this I realized I wanted more from a relationship. I wanted a partner and not someone who sleeps and plays Video games. I was tired of being his mother washing is clothes, cooking food ,working full time, cleaning and taking care of the baby and him doing nothing but sleeping and video games.

A close friend (35m), whom I (37nb) used to date, is working on his Associate's degree at the local community college. No one in his family has earned a college degree, so he doesn’t have guidance or support from them, and for some reason, he doesn’t go to his other friends for help or even to just talk about how his classes are going. I used to be a professor and a tutor, so I have been happy to help him navigate assignments and other concerns (for example, registering for classes). At one point, I was helping him multiple times a week for several hours at a time. We've been friends for less than a year, in case that matters.

At the end of October, I had myself admitted to psychiatric inpatient treatment after a bad depressive episode. I came the closest I ever had to making a plan to end my life, which scared me, so I went to the hospital. In the weeks leading up to this, my friend started pulling away because my depression made him anxious and uncomfortable. I reached out more than once to tell him I needed help, specifically, someone taking the medications I might overdose on, and he refused. Bottom line: I got help, we had a productive conversation about how to navigate these situations, and things have been better (but still difficult because of medication changes). If it’s helpful to know, I have rapid cycling bipolar, anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. My friend has yet to be diagnosed but has severe anxiety.

To focus on my recovery, I set a boundary of only helping with his homework one afternoon or evening a week, but this hasn’t stopped him from asking for help every time he has a question or feels anxious about his classes, which has been about 10 times in two weeks. I also set an expectation that if I set time aside to help him, he will set time aside to hang out and do non-academic friend things (like watching movies). We’ve only had “friend time” twice over the period he asked for help about 10 times. I keep saying no and reminding him of my boundary, but I don’t feel like he’s respecting me or listening. 

My therapist pointed out that this is a one-sided friendship; I give him what he wants, and he gives me just enough that I’ll keep helping him. I’m tired of feeling taken for granted and have asked him to meet me to talk about boundaries and expectations tomorrow. The more I sit with my feelings, the less I feel like I want to continue helping him at all.

Right outside the clothing store was a kiosk run by a guy named Adam (fake name). Adam is one of those guys who always has many girlfriends and hits on everyone and is super friendly and personable (if a little creepy). His kiosk is always run by young beautiful girls and there seems to be an endless supply of new girls running the kiosk. 

Frequently he would come into the shop and talk to my manager as they were friends. One day I heard him talking about the new girl he’s dating and how they’re having sex. He kept bragging about how she was young and “wasn’t even 17 yet.” For context, this man is probably 32. 

I talked to my manager about what he said and she told me that he even owned a house where all the women who worked at his kiosk had to live while they worked there and most of them are underage. 

I was disturbed by what I heard and reported it to the local authorities by filling out a form online and then thought nothing of it. That was a couple months ago but this morning the police actually called me to follow up about the tip.  

I told them everything I had heard and was really honest with them about the fact that not all of this was first hand information and I didn’t know everything. The cop was really nice and thanked me for reporting it. 

I told my sister this happened and she got mad at me because  reported a rumor. I totally get what she’s saying but it’s the police’s job to investigate these rumors and I’d rather it turn out or be nothing than not have reported it and had it be something. Plus he was the one telling people about her age! She said that I may have ruined his life by telling the police this but like I said, I’d rather be safe than sorry

She never hides her emotions and will always be the shoulder to cry on for others, even when the other person is draining her. 

Gwen has been broken up with her ex, Steven (22 M), for the past year. He lives in another state, and as soon as he went back after visiting us at our dorm, he texted Gwen that he was still in love with his ex, and that he didn’t want to NOT tell her and cheat. Which, kudos to him for being honest. Regardless of his honestly, I told Gwen to block him and forget about him, bc that’s still a dick move imo. She said she wanted to remain friends. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago, where Steven sent Gwen a handwritten letter of all the reasons their relationship failed—most of the reasons involved Gwen (her addictions, her mental illness, her always trying to force him to open up). I, once again, told Gwen to block him. She didn’t end up blocking him, bc he ended up going on a spiel of how “things would be better without him here”. Personally, I thought it was emotional manipulation, but Gwen wanted to be the better person and comfort him in his time of need. 

Last night, Steven texted Gwen telling her that he’s going to propose to his current girlfriend. She broke down crying and came to me. I’ll be the first to admit I’m shit at comforting ppl, so I just nodded along and listened. But she kept asking me what she should do, so I finally said “block him”. I also told her that’s he’s been using her as an emotional punching bag and that he’s going to continue you to do this based on past behaviors. She got mad at me and said that I “always say that” and “that doesn’t solve the issue”. Which, tbh, yeah, but what else can she do?  I told her she needs to stop coming to me for comfort bc I’m starting to loose sympathy for someone who just refuses to remove toxic ppl from their life. She called me heartless and is now locked up in her room. I’ve been giving her space, bc I can tell she’s still mad at me.

We would have intimate late night conversations over text and I liked it because I was into her Josh knew it too and made multiple attempts to get her to cut me off but she didn’t, anyways eventually Lily started pitting me and Josh against each other, for example she would have flirty conversations with me over text then screenshot and send them to Josh and he would get pissed and start arguments, I defended myself and she always came out as the victim, I didn’t deny my attraction to her even if she was in a relationship but this kind of thing happening  led to me and Josh not getting along at all and fighting basically every time we saw each other and she kept doing it, again we were never friends anyway but still.
Now here’s what happened last night:
I got a text from her around 1 or 2AM and she said she couldn’t sleep and if I wanted to do something, I went along with it, one thing led to another and we made out, after a bit she started freaking out claiming I pressed her into cheating and how I have been trying to ruin her relationship for months and how I was a terrible friend, I thought maybe she just needed to calm down and went back to my room and to bed.
Anyways I woke up this morning and she had told OUR ENTIRE FRIEND GROUP that I had pressured her into kissing me and I got some nasty texts from both guys and girls, nobody except a girl named Mandy who knows Lily for the snake she is believes me when I claimed I didn’t pressure her to do shit and she just wanted to cheat.
Josh sent me a weird and long text calling me a pervert amongst other things and saying he and his friends are gonna beat me up if I ever go near Lily again and they might do it anyway to teach me a lesson, I tried telling him that she cheated on him with me but the just totally didn’t believe it and the dude is PISSED I’ll tell ya.

This guy (M29) and I(F22) slept together. Some things occurred where we both agreed we'll stop having a sexual relationship and continue as just friends.

It has been emotionally charged since then on my part where I find it extremely difficult to detach from him solely because I have never done the ""sleep with someone who aren't in a relationship with"" thing. Despite this I have been trying my absolute best to remain friendly with him.

He shared something in confidence about what his grandmother said about me. I agreed not to share.

I told my mother his grandmother wanted to meet me and she begun questioning me about if he'll be introducing me as his girlfriend. I told her ""No. We are friends."" She then asked what does his grandmother think about me just from what he has told him about me. I begun feeling pressured and didn't want to lie so I told her what she thought of me. She told me it wasn't nice and even proceeded to tell me to make sure I respectfully let her know the perception she held of me wasn't the case.

Prior to all of this, there has been incidents he spoke down to me, tends to make me think I lack experience in certain avenues in life and have even said he'll ""teach"" me some life skills. I told him before that I already have a father and I don't need him to ""teach"" me anything.

Anyway, we were talking and I completely forgot he wanted me to keep what his grandmother said about me between him and I so I casually mentioned that I told my mother and what she thought of it.

I immediately apologised and proceeded to explain what happened and why I even told her. I then told him me and my mother are close and she is like my best friend who I tell ""everything (exaggerated).""

He then proceeded to say I tell her things that are convenient to me.

I told him he does not know me well enough to base this judgement and that him treating me like if I am a child and not a grown adult is becoming very hurtful. I told him that it is very disrespectful to assume the reason why I told my mother is because relaying that information would somehow benefit me. Further to this, I mentioned how in previous occasions where he has accused me of similar on the day we slept together. He told me this before in a situation where I told him about being friends and then getting into relationship later on is best for us because I was fresh out of a breakup and didn't know him well enough to jump into a relationship with him. He accused me of 'friendzoning' him and when I said I did not he said I had ""selective memory"" and was using it to my conviniance. He used this as the reason why we should remain friends because that is what I ""said.""

I didn't let it bother me then but being told this twice by someone means they are perceiving me in a way which suits their narrative. I called him vile and nasty for doing that to me. He called me an asshole and proceeded to say that me calling him nasty for feeling betrayed is a huge asshole thing to do.

I’ve decided to get myself a build a bear plush, just trying to reclaim some childhood I lost to trauma basically. (This is just background/context) my grandmother is a therapist and dislikes my ways of ‘getting over’ my past.

My grandmother texted asking what I was going to be doing for Christmas and my birthday since we live quite far from each other, I told her my plans (minus the trauma part for obvious reasons) and she called me childish. 

She asked why in the world I would want something meant for children and I explained why, that I couldn’t remember my childhood and reclaiming with some plushies was cheaper than therapy.

She went on a rant about how she could be my therapist and I wouldn’t have to pay a cent, how she doesn’t understand why I hate her (idk where that came from either) so I asked if she really wanted to know or if she just didn’t want me to spend money on myself.

“I don’t want you wasting money on something other people could buy you.”

I let her know that if she wanted to get me a plush too that she’s fully allowed too, I have space for them but that I was still going with my plans as I want them to be.

She hung up after letting me know that I need to grow up and ‘let go of the past’. About an hour after my nan (grams twin) called and said I was being a dick for not listening to my grandmother, since she’s a therapist she knows more about trauma than I could ever.

I hung up on her after letting her know I know what my trauma needs to heal with and that her attitude wasn’t helping.

This guy (M29) and I(F22) slept together. Some things occurred where we both agreed we'll stop having a sexual relationship and continue as just friends.

It has been emotionally charged since then on my part where I find it extremely difficult to detach from him solely because I have never done the ""sleep with someone who aren't in a relationship with"" thing. Despite this I have been trying my absolute best to remain friendly with him.

He shared something in confidence about what his grandmother said about me. I agreed not to share.

I told my mother his grandmother wanted to meet me and she begun questioning me about if he'll be introducing me as his girlfriend. I told her ""No. We are friends."" She then asked what does his grandmother think about me just from what he has told him about me. I begun feeling pressured and didn't want to lie so I told her what she thought of me. She told me it wasn't nice and even proceeded to tell me to make sure I respectfully let her know the perception she held of me wasn't the case.

Prior to all of this, there has been incidents he spoke down to me, tends to make me think I lack experience in certain avenues in life and have even said he'll ""teach"" me some life skills. I told him before that I already have a father and I don't need him to ""teach"" me anything.

Anyway, we were talking and I completely forgot he wanted me to keep what his grandmother said about me between him and I so I casually mentioned that I told my mother and what she thought of it.

I immediately apologised and proceeded to explain what happened and why I even told her.  I then told him me and my mother are close and she is like my best friend who I tell ""everything (exaggerated).""

He then proceeded to say I tell her things that are convenient to me. 

I told him he does not know me well enough to base this judgement and that him treating me like if I am a child and not a grown adult is becoming very hurtful. I told him that it is very disrespectful to assume the reason why I told my mother is because relaying that information would somehow benefit me. Further to this, I mentioned how in previous occasions where he has accused me of similar on the day we slept together. He told me this before in a situation where I told him about being friends and then getting into relationship later on is best for us because I was fresh out of a breakup and didn't know him well enough to jump into a relationship with him. He accused me of 'friendzoning' him and when I said I did not he said I had ""selective memory"" and was using it to my convivence. He used this as the reason why we should remain friends because that is what I ""said.""

I didn't let it bother me then but being told this twice by someone means they are perceiving me in a way which suits their narrative. I called him vile and nasty for doing that to me. He called me an asshole and proceeded to say that me calling him nasty for feeling betrayed is a huge asshole thing to do.

For some back story, my girlfriend (19f) and I (21m) have been dating for 8 months, she has a more extensive and colorful sexual past then me, and she was my first for pretty much everything. As a jealous person this has bothered me, I never, EVER bring it out on her, and I make sure that I'm never blaming her or trying to make her feel bad, as a past is a past, and she's with me now. I believe the term is retroactive jealousy, and most of the time I just bottle it up. Every time I bring it up with her she starts crying and saying I'm making her feel bad for doing things in the past. 

So last night we said goodnight at around 1 am, and I fell asleep around 2. I woke up around 6 after having a terrible dream, one of my problems is imagining what her past sexual experiences have been like (and most of the time I'm overthinking it) but I've never dreamed about it. And in my dream, to see her having sex with another guy as if she was still in her past really bothered me. I couldn't fall back asleep after this, and I knew she would be up at 7:30 for work. So i waited for her to wake up so i could discuss my feelings with her. Every morning, without fail, I send her a good morning text, so typically i'm the one to text first even if she wakes up first. So, just to be sure she was awake when I texted her, i texted around 8 and just said ""good morning"", now typically I would say something like ""good morning babe"" with a heart, and be more affectionate, but this morning I was in a bad mood and wanted to let her know without just straight up telling her, not a very healthy thing to do, I know. So immediately she responded with ""what's wrong"", to which I responded by telling her I'm in a bad mood because I woke up at 6 from a dream I had and haven't been able to sleep since (today was my day off, so i was hoping to sleep in). She asked why I was in a bad mood and I told her that i had a dream about her past, she knew what I meant. She instantly apologized, I said it's okay, and then she reassured me she loves me and all that. Then later in the day after she got off work, I went to go visit her and she was in a super bad mood, so I asked her what's wrong and she went on this long rant about how I make her feel bad for having a past, and how I started her day in such a shitty way and it ruined the whole day for her, after fighting for awhile she pretty much just kicked me out of her house and now I'm left here confused and don't know where this relationship is heading, because it seems like she wants to break up with me.

She did all the cooking, cleaning and looked after my younger brother who has Asperger's.
When mum was dying and hospital offered to let her come home, his only concern was how he would look after her.
He is very active for his age and walks miles everyday. He argued on the phone with her whilst she was in hospital about why she shouldn't come home. I made sure she came home and she lived her final 3 months surrounded by family and loved ones. He had the audacity to tell everyone at the funeral that he had done so much for her when in reality he didn't do anything their whole marriage except argue, swear and upset her.
He then tried to blame my brother saying that it was him that didn't want mum to come one home. 
He wrote rude letters to all family members after mums death blaming them for her demise.
I've continued to help him but I keep thinking about how he treated my mother all those years. I'm married with kids of my own so it's just his and my brother now. He can barely use a mobile phone and uses my brother to read him his text messages instead of learning how to do it himself. He's so reliant on other people to do things for him, simply because he is a dumb fuck.
He's now moving house as he wants a smaller more manageable place. I find myself doing all the legwork, applications, phone calls, whilst he just complains and tells people I don't help him.

There's about 15 people. This is not exactly AA, but same idea. You're allowed to say your name if you want to. Everyone there is supposed to respect anonymity. Some people talk more in the meetings. Some people sit quietly.

Some of the girls and I talk more in the meetings, so we feel like we kind of know each other since we have had back-and-forth conversations.

Last week, three girls and I started a group text, and we might go hiking some time. Lol we won't bother with that ""friends of Bill W"" lie. No one would ever believe that haha.

Anyways, we started our group text. Later on, ""Ryan,"" who's usually quiet, asked if he could join too. At this point, one of the girls had left. I was uneasy about it, and the two other girls who were still there seemed uneasy about it too.

I said, ""um, I don't think so.""

Both the other girls backed me on that, so we have at least a 3/4 majority.

I personally feel like he crossed the line when he said ""why?""

And I was like, ""just because I think we want this to be between us four.""

He said ""that's not nice.""

I was like ""yeah sorry.""

I MIGHT be an asshole for sounding ""high school"" and cliquey. Maybe it would have been better if we started the group text in private.

Let me remind you though, that this is Alcoholics ANONYMOUS, so we don't see each other outside of group meetings until we agree to. This was our first time agreeing to. Ryan just happened to overhear us.

Back in July they told me I should take the opportunity to work with the top of our industry. I loved it but I always made it clear I was coming back to my boss.

I came back in early September and things were different. I didn’t have time to figure out why before my husband collapsed at home and was rushed to the critical ward. 

For the past 2 months he has been having multiple complex, life saving procedures, he’s had complication after complication. My boss told me that my work was being delegated and the other people I support (of lower ranking) told me “don’t worry about it you shouldn’t be thinking about all this right now” 

Even so I would take my laptop into the hospital with me to work, I would always be available to support people if needed. But work stopped coming. I would maybe get notified that work had been done after the fact. People stopped talking to me.

We were all permitted back to the office (lockdown) last Monday and I came to my boss to tell them I was concerned that I wasn’t getting work, that people seem to be actively excluding me. 

She responded that she didn’t know what I was talking about but that I had been unsatisfactory in my work and there were a lot of hurt feelings in the team. So if something were happening it was a two way street and I needed to fix it. She told me if I couldn’t handle that I could always find a new job. 

Since then I have started keeping record of our interactions and there’s pages on pages from 1 week alone of her degrading me with comments, of her actively ignoring me and my work related requests, of her rejecting things for me that she’s never rejected before and is still not rejecting to other team members.

That I will actually live a fun life, encouraging diversity and other cultures instead of forcing mine on others.” She makes some transphobic and homophobic comments so I say “I am going to get with a guy who doesn’t feel intimidated by things classed as girly because he knows he’s a guy and that he defines what he is not his actions or clothing or anything else.” She gets mad because I told her that I will always have more balls than any man she will ever get with lmao. And after that I simply kicked her out. I do not want to talk to her anymore. I am going to go no contact with that whole side now.

Ive told both my parents my plan and kept them updated on schools I wanted to go to. I have a rocky relationship with both my parents. They separated when I was 3 and I lived with my mom until I was 16 but moved in with my dad a little over a year ago mainly because of COVID (my mom has illnesses that put her at risk and cause her sensory sensitivities) but I was glad to move out because my mom was very toxic and emotional abusive for most of my life. I dont see her but she still tries to control what I do and where I go. Shes asked me to let her know every time I leave the house. I usually dont because I communicate with my dad when Im going out and forget to let her know. A while ago I heard from a friend, a college in our city was having a day they would pay the fee to apply to 5 colleges. So two days ago my friend told me she was going to the college and asked if I wanted to come. I thought we were going for a tour. My friend and I are very close and her mom will often bring me along on small things they do as a family. I told my dad where I was going and he was totally fine with it. When my friend and her mom picked me up I realized it was the day for applying and felt relieved that I could do it at the school instead of at home. We looked around at some programs and were there for a few hours. Her mom took a picture of me applying and sent it to my mom (she takes pictures of things were doing and sends them to my mom to help her feel included. My mom is usually very appreciative). A minute later my mom texted asking where I was. I told her I was at the college and that I applied with a smiley face. Didnt hear anything back. Then my dad texted asking where I was. I told him I was still at the college and I applied with a smiley face. Then he called and started yelling that my mom was freaking out on him asking why no one told her. He was mad that she was yelling at him and was essentially blaming me for making her angry (He does this a lot) and he asked me to call her to get her to stop bothering him. I called her and right away she said how embarrassed she was that she got this photo didnt know what was happening, she didnt know how to respond, she asked my dad where I was, he said something that triggered her, she was tired of being the bad guy just because people didnt follow her rules and that she could have taken me if she knew about it(which I dont agree with because of her disabilities)I told her that it was pretty spontaneous and I didnt intentionally not tell her. I apologized a bunch but she still kept yelling so I told her I had to go to work and hung up because my shift was soon and we were still at the college. My friends mom felt bad for starting the whole thing and my whole experience of applying for college was tainted. Its been 8 hours and I still havent heard from her. I feel bad.

I (f15) don't like obeying my mother (f51) after all the things she did to me. For e.g. she tells me to shower and I do it hours after she told me. You know when you plan to do a thing and someone tells you to do it and you instantly get demotivated? It's like that. I know I should shower before she tells me to but I'm just not motivated enough and end up doing it in the middle of the night. She complains to me that she loses sleep because the lights have to stay on and the heater has to be on so it's warm. 

Because I shower in the middle of the night, I fall asleep in the bathroom. Sometimes for hours. She knocks on the bathroom door and tells me to wake up. But after a few times, she insults me and says mean things towards me. She also bangs on the door. Sometimes I'm just using the toilet and she always asks if I'm sleeping and it's annoying. Maybe she has to use the bathroom too but in most cases not. Sometimes she just uses that excuse to get me out of the bathroom and that works. If she does need to use the bathroom, I instantly finish what I'm doing and exit the bathroom.

The reason I don't like obeying her rules is because of some things in the past. She used to abuse me physically but she's always emotionally and verbally abused me. When I bring up something that happened in the past she gaslights me and says it never happened. She has sexualised me, made fun of me and whenever I tried to get help she made me lie saying I don't need it. What she said in the past still affects me now. I have nowhere else to go so I'm stuck with her. If I had a nicer parent I would obey their rules, as long as they treat me with respect. She doesn't treat me with respect. Sometimes I shower late on purpose so she disowns me one day.

So basically I've been struggling with my dad's family for a long time. 

For context, my dad's family is F-ed up. There was a cheating scandal with my great grandparents which left a big strain on the whole family when we all found out 6 years ago. Turns out great grandpa was not the father of three of his kids. Additionally, everyone on my dads side has been divorced at least once except for my dad which means he and my mom get a lot of comments about how they ""shouldn't complain because your life is so perfect."" when we have our struggles too. It put a lot of unfair expectations on my mom and the family doesn't really talk to her because of her ""perfect"" life. 

My dad's family is also very country and as such they have decided that being misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, and drunk all the time is just what ""country folk do"" and thus it's ""not a problem"".

My problem started years ago when I would get made fun of for playing sports. My grandfather said volleyball wasn't a sport cause girls play it and when I said that was wrong and that I didn't like his joke, he said I needed to get over it cause if a girl can do it then it's not a sport. I didn't talk to him for two years until I was 16 and that was only because my mom said I needed to get over it and be the bigger person. 

Around this time I also came out to only my parents and brother and was considered old enough to hang out with the adults. That's when I heard that my cousins thought gay people were gross and used gay as a slur, found out my grandfather doesn't want hispanic individuals around him, and a few other things. The biggest problem happened when I was 18 and my grandfather got drunk and cornered me while saying ""gay people are disgusting and I don't want them touching me."" I cried and was told by my parents that he didn't mean it.

On to the main issue. I came out to them right before the pandemic hit and while my grandfather didn't really say anything until the end, my grandmother kept calling it a choice and the first words out of her mouth were ""but have you tried it with a guy?"". They said it was fine and they'll deal with anyone I bring home but that's when they practically dropped off the face of the earth. I never got a call or a text and was told to keep my gayness a secret because the other family doesn't need to know. I also kept hearing about different instances that made my mom cry through this time and I decided that enough was enough. 

I told my mom and dad I didn't want to see his family anymore. My dad keeps bringing the issue up and asking when I am going to see his family because he said he doesn't like my decision. My mom supports me and says that she understands but to try for my dad's sake. My brother blatantly called me an asshole. So I ask.

My mom and grandma decided to give me (18F) the room since I haven't had my own room in about 6 years. 

I LOVE my new room. Its nice and secluded, which helps since my family gets really loud and it causes me to get overwhelmed easily. The downside is that it's in the garage, hence why it's so secluded. 

I have really bad anxiety, and even when I was in my old room inside the house, I had this fear that someone would break in and kill everyone while we all slept. It wasn't as bad in the house, since there's a lot of people, but that fear is so much stronger now that I'm in my new room. Especially since the bedroom door won't lock and there's not enough room on the wall to put one of those chain locks on it. 

I also have this thing about sleeping in new environments in general. It takes me a while to actually adjust sleeping in a new house or room, and if I do manage to sleep, I don't sleep long and I don't sleep well. 

I've told my mom about my anxieties and my sleeping issue, but she just brushed me off. Even when I told her that I felt like I'd need a new lock bc the door doesn't close properly (my uncle built the room himself, and they had this issue with the door since he installed it about a year ago), she still kind of ignored me. I swear, it feels like she's trying to push me into moving into my room way too quickly, since she already started moving furniture in here even tho the walls aren't all taped/bedded or textured yet. 

I keep fighting with her about it bc I don't feel safe sleeping out here without a lock on my bedroom door, since I feel so isolated and vulnerable out here as is, but both my mom and my grandma keep saying that I'm just being dramatic and that I'll get over it eventually, and my mom has even threatened that she'll take the room away and use it herself and make me continue to sleep with my 6yo sister.

I was at work and texted him seeing if he was late and he didn’t respond. Side note: this is very uncommon for him and he is more of a clingy person. He shows up and I wave at him when he walks in which he completely ignores and doesn’t even look at me. I started thinking if I did something wrong to upset him. After hours of being ignore and pushed aside I managed to corner him and confront him. He said “My girlfriend doesn’t like you and doesn’t want me talking to you. I had no choice” then walks away.

In my engineering class we were required to form groups that we would work in for almost the entire semester, in which we would tackle a certain engineering challenge. 

Being an engineering class, it was largely male, so my group was 18m, 19m, and 28m. 28m is the primary focus of our current conflict. He is a veteran, ex-marine, oldest in the class by a lot, and he's pretty much fresh out. 

He is... a bit rough. He makes off color jokes, is quick to anger/frustration, etc. Basically exactly what one would expect from a fresh marine vet. Given the demographics of my home town, this is not my first run in with someone in his exact position. I certainly don't feel unsafe around him, he's not dumb, and is perfectly self aware. 

When I told my parents about my group they seemed uneasy. When i told them about this guy they said they wanted to meet him and make sure i was safe with him, or maybe have a discussion with my professor. I don't want this to happen under any circumstances whatsoever. I can already tell that my peers don't really see me as peers, and while  my professors are better, I  cant think of anything more embarrassing than my parents talking with my professor.

They said that I'm not allowed to meet with him outside of strictly class time under any circumstances untill they speak with him. That is rather devastating, as this class is all about independent problem solving and building stuff, so meeting with your team and physically working together is kind of the whole point. They told me that I and they cant trust him. They said they are afraid that he  will be a bad influence. They think its inappropriate for a man of his age to be with me alone for extended periods of time.

I think that they are being utterly ridiculous. I'm taking classes in uni, therefore I will be interacting and working with people from all walks of life. Its totally unreasonable to vet everyone who isn't also my age and gender that I interact with. 

I told them that they will not be doing that under any circumstances, and that i would rather just not be able to fully participate in this class.

Up until a few years ago, my SIL raved about her adoptive parents and said they gave her the best life. BACKSTORY- My brother is also adopted. My brother is really my cousin. My parents adopted him when he was around six because his mother was an addict and continued to put herself and him in very dangerous situations. Tonight, Abby and I were discussing mutual friends who had chosen to adopt a baby recently.

However, all of that changed about four days ago. after school, I went to this club which of my so-called other “friend” ran. Other friend is nice and all, but he becomes a total douche when his girlfriend comes. Which I was told she wasn’t gonna be coming this time. well, sure as shit she shows up and he immediately becomes an asshole. it all starts off fine for 30 seconds asking how each other’s day was going, etc. but all hell breaks loose. When I tell them, I’m going to my friend who happens to be a girl’s house. then, my other friend immediately pinned me down to the table we were talking around and ask what I was gonna do with her after.

After asking three times what I was going to watch her brother, I say, “touching second base because you could never”. he then let me go and laughed. I then left and didn’t think anything of it.

In total we had about 10 guests. We ordered my MILs favorite dinner from a take out restaurant so I didn’t have to cook the meal. I did however still spend the day purchasing and making appetizers, cleaning and decorating the house in preparation.  My husband spent the morning at the gym, did some vacuuming and then relaxing until our guests arrived. 

The party was going well with both of us sharing hosting duties until dinner time.  Once everyone finished eating my husband and I began to tidy up.  He helped with some clean up and then disappeared leaving me to host, clean up and watch our new puppy. 

While I was putting together dessert, one of the children at the party went to get the puppy a treat and dumped the entire bag of treats all over the room they are stored in. I called to my husband to ask him to help her tidy it up but got no response. I went to find him, and discovered him in the bedroom laying down browsing on his phone. I asked him to come back and help me. He lost it. He quietly and repeatedly told me to “go f&amp;$* myself and to shut the f&amp;$* up”. He did then get up and storm out of the room. He proceeded to spend the rest of the evening looking completely miserable making comments about how he was sick but must be helpful and make him self useful.

Obviously, I am aware it’s completely inappropriate for him to speak to me like that. I just can’t decide if I should have left him to lay down since he wasn’t feeling well. Before we got married every family event my husband would eat what he says is way too much and then would disappear to lay down and (his words) “digest”.  I’m almost certain the only reason he wasn’t feeling well is because he ate way too much but of course can be completely sure.

So I took my car and left my SUV at home.

I needed my SUV to pick up my EMS dogs that where at daycare. I couldn't use my car because it's a two door vehicle and I have a 80 pound dog that will be uncomfortable.

before because at one point they split up and he was essentially stalking her.

Anyways, tonigjt, I’m home sick with the flu really bad. I’m trying to sleep and I hear this super loud bang, loud enough that it shook the whole house. It’s followed by super loud screaming and more banging. I texted her to ask her if she was okay and she said she was fine and she apologized for the yelling. Then the banging started again, super loud. At one point my roommate got frustrated and started stomping on the floor back at them, at which point they banged on the ceiling back at us. 

The yelling and banging continued really bad for a few minutes until it went silent. Like, dead silent. I texted her and asked if she was still okay and got no response.  I called 911 at that point because it went from chaos to radio silence in like 2 seconds flat and that really scared me. I asked to remain anonymous which i’m hoping they honored. 

Cops came and left relatively quickly so i’m assuming she’s fine, but she texted me back saying that it “wasn’t my place” to call 911. I lied and told her I didn’t call. I don’t know why, I just didn’t want her to be mad at me. She still hasn’t texted me back since I said I didn’t call.

She is smart, does incredibly well in school, is well-behaved, excels at the violin, dances, etc. She attends a private all girl's school that is known for their academic programs. I always assumed when she began dating, she would be dating another girl at her school or a boy from their brother school, both of which are full of respectable young people such as herself. 

However, she's in the past few months begun dating the brother (also 16) of her best friend, a girl in her dance class. He is nice, but does not fit our standards for who our daughter should be dating. He does poorly in school and has no extracurriculars other than football. He treats our daughter very well (saves up money to take her on nice dates, brings her flowers and cookies, etc.) but seems aimless when it comes to the future. His family is also nice, but are very different than ours (their children attend public school, they don't value travel or other cultural enrichment experiences like we do) and we had a pretty tense fight with them over some of our parenting differences the last time they came over for dinner.

My daughter stood by her boyfriend. We've decided to put our foot down and tell her he is no longer welcome in our home. We understand the bond they have and that we can't force her to do anything, so she's allowed to go to his house two or three times a week and see him at school. I've also heavily suggested she end the relationship before college. She insists they'll be together forever even though they're 16.

They have two extra bedrooms and my MiL explicitly told our two boys that these rooms are “their “ rooms. Even went so far as to allow them to pick which rooms they wanted, pick out their own beds, bed set and decor behind my back while they were visiting. I’m livid because my children have a loving home with their own bedrooms and things. Their place is with me and I feel like she is crossing a line.  

At first my husband chalked it up to “making play rooms” for them. I let it go until now, after our kids have made several comments about “living with grandma” and constantly disappearing to her house to get soda and candy while they’re supposed to be playing outside (for context, we live in a very rural area and our children have many acres to play on our property. They are also old enough to be unsupervised outside.) 

I’ve tried to address this with my husband by asking him to talk to her. At minimum, I’ve asked him to tell her to not let them randomly come go in her house and pump them full of sugar. Or have free range access to the internet/cable. Which are all things that I do not allow at home. She lives a very unhealthy lifestyle and lays down no rules. She has even allowed them to destroy her house and finds its cute, even though they’re not small anymore. I strongly believe they go over there because of the perceived “freedom” they get while they’re there, not for some bonding time with their grandparents. 

When I was pregnant with them, she made several comments about how I shouldn’t do certain things because I would harm “her baby”. When I had my first child via c-section, she came to the hospital just as I was trying to take a shower and gave me no privacy or consideration while she saw my son. My husband didn’t stand up for me either, when I was at my most vulnerable and they chatted away while I was in excruciating pain and could barely walk. 

There is so much more she has done but with the culmination of the bedroom incident, I’m at the end of my rope with her. I don’t want my kids to see her any more than they would see my parents, special occasions and holidays only. I refuse to even consider asking them to babysit for date nights and what not, I would rather pay someone or not go anywhere at all.

I  teach multiple classes but one of them is getting me to rethink teaching alltogether. 
It is a Class 10 (we have 12 or 13 classes in Germany) and they didnt had physics lessons for a good part of their year 9 because a teacher got ill. I informed myself via the ill teacher and their folder where they stopped. From the first lessons I had problems to get the students to calm down in the first 10-15 min of the lesson of 45 min. They even walked over the desks and chairs, played music with their mobiles in Class. 
After a talk with the parents, which they wanted because of the situation last year and ne being a younger teacher, it got better, in the form of no mobiles and no more Walking on chairs. 
One regular instance is, that one Student ist asking  a question, I try to explain it, but the Student cant understand what i am saying because IT IS to loud. I remind the class to bei quiet, at first relativly quiet later louder If Nobody can hear me, but they Just laugh and carry on, or I am waiting for the class to cool down and get beraded by some students that i dont answer questions and dont teach them anything. 
There was even intances that teachers who werent near the classroom came in, because it was so loud they didnt thing a teacher was in there. 

Last week there was a Test, which I announced. When the students entered the classroom, they Said: "" WE dont weiter a Test because WE dont understand the Matter and didnt learn "" after I Said , that IT was announced and so the learning part was Not my Problem, they tried to convince everyone to Hand in a blank Sheet of paper, so the school would be forced to redo the Test.
But after correcting and a talk with the principle, we decided to Not Grade it because IT was really Bad.

This week the students requested a Meeting with the principle, where they talked about me and my Lessons: from I dont know where they stopped last year , over I dont answer questions to I dont dress right. In the Letter to the principle they said: they are afraid that I would Hit them in the Future, because I ""shouted"" in Class.

So this week I wrote another Test whith them  with the topic : rearranging equations, which we dicussed in an earlier lesson and should bei known in Class 7. When the students entered the classroom they called me an Idiot and asked If I was ill in the head.  

Now im debating If I should give up teaching this Class, or continue, which would be very difficult with this past.
But i am Not the only teacher having problems with this Class.

This year i am teaching multiple classes and i only have problems with this one, so It is becoming a real problem because all my Energy geht's sucked by this.

Numerous times. They don't clean up after themselves, so the house is alwayssssss dirty. At one point I used to cook for everyone, buy groceries for the house, buy everyone dinner when I went out, take the kids out on my dime. But I realized I need to stop spending so much and figure why spend my money on people that can't do what I ask.

Just today, and its just the principle of this I swear it is. Fuck a cake. So, normally I'd cut my name out of my cake and tell everyone they can have the rest of it, just let me eat this piece. And yet, the next day I go to look, and my fucking entire cake is gone, on top of the piece I asked them not to eat. And all my mother says is ""Oh, I'm sorry TinyMrKrabs, that must suck"" like no fucking shit. It was my birthday the other day, so I go to get my fucking cake today and ALL OF IT is gone. I didn't even get to eat the last piece bruh. I was so angry and everyone just sat around like they didn't care.

I ask my family, my mother for nothing. At all. Except to have pride in our living space and work together as a team to keep it clean, and don't touch my shit. But I'm the bad guy when I stop doing stuff and going above and beyond for this fucking family.

She yells at me, says I'm not her mom, and something in me clicked. You know what? You're definitely right little sister. I'm not, so I stopped checking for her like I was. And on top of that, my mom goes and COMFORTS her after this whole situation. But fucking preaches ""I'm the parent, if there's an issue you come to me,"" but if we do that then nothing gets done.

During the entire planning process, my mother has been very critical of all the decisions my future spouse and I have made. Critiquing decisions like rehearsal dinner venue, reception venue, not getting married at a church, inclusion of siblings in wedding party, and mostly, guest list. 

My family is not contributing to the costs of the wedding, with the exception of the rehearsal dinner. They have insisted on requesting 10-20 individuals be invited that are their ""friends,"" yet these are mostly folks I do not have relationships with/have some relationship with. My fiancé and I decided on the figure of no more than 110 people to wedding, which was the suggested seating amount for the venue. To invite their friends, it would take away the ability to invite people important to my fiancé and I, and make it a more social event for their friends. I have been against that entirely, but agreed to invite 8 of their suggested friends. This was not enough, I was supposed to invite an entire family of 6 instead of just the mother/father. My mother said she will ""have no friends"" if I don't do it the way she wants, and I have no care for her. I was told that I am ""going to embarrass her"" if I don't fix the invite from 2 to 6 for the specific family I invited. They have even offered to pay for anyone they've asked to invite, but it's not about the money!

My mom even took the step of calling the wedding venue to see if we could have more than 110... which we could, but are choosing not to.

My parents offered to give me back my highschool car  but the issue is that my siblings kinda drove the car into the ground. Now it has electrical problems, fuel line and pump issues, and the motor is basically held together by hot glue and screws not an exaggeration. I politely declined and when pressed about it I told them the truth it's a POS and they only want me to basically borrow it so that way they'll get it fixed for free.  Now apparently I'm being an asshole because they are trying to ""help"" me but it's actually the opposite they just want someone to fix it for free that way they don't have to buy another car for my siblings to learn on.

FOR REFERENCE: Jess kissed another girl on the mouth. I don’t know why. Im 17, the kids I’m working with are all younger than me. I heard Jess (12yrs, fake names) talking to Dylan (16) and ask him “Do you think Gabby(12) is gay?” He replied with “I think Gabby is 12.” He looked uncomfortable. I was torn on what to do, but I was talking to some of the other (older) kids about it and they said that I should talk to Jess and Gabby. They were currently talking in the girls dressing room. i pulled Jess aside and said “you can’t be asking people whether you think Gabby is gay.” She said, “No, I’m just trying to get Gabby with Dylan together and I’m trying to get Dylan to know she’s not gay.” I said, “that is not the way to go about it” and Jess said “No, I didn’t ask him if she was gay, I asked if she was pretty” I said “that’s not what I heard?” She insisted, so I dropped it, and I told her even if Gabby has a crush on Dylan, she needs to respect his boundaries. She left. We went on with the show. Later, I was told by one of the older kids I talked to that Jess and Gabby were talking about how I talked to Jess and they were using “harsh words.” I said okay, and then someone told me that Dylan had “assigned” Jess to “protect” Gabby? I assume without knowing Jess and Gabbys master plan to set home up with Gabby. We did the next number and Gabby is up on the scaffolding with me and a couple other people, and Gabby was JUMPING (the scaffolding is very unsteady). I looked at her and jokingly said “it’s gonna fall and smush us” and she laughed and said “yeah, exactly.” I don’t know if that was just pure anger towards me. As I’m writing this I’m listening to a group of kids whispering about how Jess kissed another girl, and then blah blah…then they said something about the stage manager.

(For reference I’m 16)

 for the past year ( 2 years?) my moms been going through a lot. She comes home from work crying everyday. It hurts to see her so upset. To be honest, it’s exhausting. Everyday she’s sobbing and crying and it stresses me out. I love her, and seeing her so upset is upsetting , especially knowing I can do nothing about it. I feel really bad because I can’t help her, so I just sit and listen to her yell about her life and her job and how much she hates my dad and brother. I’m so tired. Last night we were talking and she was crying and drinking and ranting, and I passing I mentioned that I don’t really like being home anymore. She asked me why, and I tried to play it off as a joke so I wouldn’t start an arguement, but she kept pleading for my honesty.

So I was honest, I  said it was because of all the drama. She then a told me I didn’t get to be upset  about that because she had it so much worse. While I agree that she’s going through more than I am, and I sympathize with her, I should still be allowed to be stressed out and have feelings. As selfish as it is, being around her is so emotionally draining. I tried to sleep it off but I’m still mad at her for invalidating my feelings like that. She asked me, honestly, why I felt the way I did, and when I told her, she made me feel like crap.

 I feel like I can’t tell her anything I’m upset about because she just makes it into a competition. Am I being entitled?

I knew the ballet would start after 8:00pm although wasn't sure about the hour. The mother asked us to be ready to leave at 7 and insisted that we must be on time.
I had to iron my shirt which I started doing by 5:30. I am not skillful at this so I took a long time at it I have to admit. I also had some issues that I had not foreseen like the shirt missing a button Wich I had to stich and my shoes missing their laces wich I had to lace. While everyone was getting ready the mother was repeatedly saying that we must be ready and that at our current rate we wouldn't be. I dismissed those worries because I started preparing early.
My girlfriend was ready before me and also started insisting that I was going to be late. At 6:45 I realized my girlfriend's parents had left. She said they went to get the car and her grandmother and that they were upset because of me being late.
We went after them shortly at 6:56 still buckling my belt. When we where at the car they were all saying I was late. I told them they said we were going out at 7 and we were on time. They kept insisting so I asked for the time. It was 7:00pm.
They keep insisting that IATA and that I should have been ready at 6:45pm. I say I had no way of knowing that. They say that I should know the family better. My girlfriend and I have been together 6 years. I haven't observed them being ready earlier than said on usual basis. From my girlfriend's POV she says that I should have known that her mother hurrying us since 6 meant she actually wanted to go out before 7, and that I am too literal.

We’ve had each other’s backs through thick and thin and trust each other with everything. It was one of the first times I had an awesome guy friend that wasn’t close with me just to get in my pants. Well, a few months ago, he got a girl and completely changed. Ever since I’ve tried to get with a guy, he gets defensive, as if I’m trying to have a “better partner” than him. If I mentioned a new dude I was talking to (which has been a normal topic since we became friends), he’d reply with how much better his new girl is. It got old fast. Once, when I tried to get with a mutual friend, Eric shot it down so fast. He told this guy things behind my back and I got ghosted. Recently, I got a guy’s snap and told Eric about it. Turns out, this guy and Eric’s girl are cousins. Because I didn’t want anybody getting into my business and trying to screw up things for me, I told Eric not mention it to his girl so she doesn’t announce it to the world. He promised he wouldn’t. Well he ended up telling her, she said I was crazy, said what I assume were some rude things about me, and the guy ghosted me. Take note Eric’s been with this girl for a month. I was beyond pissed, so I told Eric how I felt and that he betrayed my trust. In response, I got blocked by him. He ran his mouth to my friends and some of them have blocked me too. Even when I’ve kept secrets that could probably ruin his relationship, he blabbed his mouth so fast to his girlfriend. Is it wrong of me to get mad that he spread my business, even if it was to his girlfriend? I get that it’s his girlfriend, but I think I’m entitled to my own privacy. May I add, I’ve never had a problem with his girl and I thought we were on good terms. Not once have I ever said a bad thing about her.

I don’t even have my own account. Last night we went to a burger place we’ve wanted to try for awhile now. The food was great, but they forgot the cheese on her sandwich. It’s no big deal, but she goes up to the register to ask them to add the cheese. They say we can keep it and they’ll give us a new one. 

She comes back to the table with her original (now free) sandwich and I reach for the knife and begin to start cutting it in half. She looks at me and goes “what are you doing?” And explains that its hers and she’s going to save it for later. Then I ask why she gets the free sandwich when we both paid for it. We went back and forth for a couple of minutes and I said it was fine, but i was pretty salty about it the rest of the night.
