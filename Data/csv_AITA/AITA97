We did it last minute, we were going to have a wedding but only since his mom talked us into it. We both wanted to elope, and decide two weeks in advance to elope. 

We invited immediate family members only besides my brothers girlfriend. (She has been around for years, she watches my son per her request, she owns a house with my brother, comes to family events, invites us over for weekend dinners, owns a dog with my brother. My husband and I love her.) We wanted a small intimate elopement with people we both know and love. 

Neither of our dads came. His isn’t around. Mine was out of town. 

My husband has two sisters. One is single. The other got pregnant after two months with her boyfriend. (No judgement! Same happened to me with my son.) But they at the point of my elopement have only been together for 6 months. We only met him three times. I literally haven’t spoken to him more then hello and goodbye. My husband has had one conversation with him. And outside of that we only know things that his single sister and mom have told us. None of it is good. So we have a negative thought on him because of that. 

So since he is a stranger to us and we believe he isn’t good for his sister or nephew (she has a son from a previous relationship) we didn’t invite him. 

This pissed his sister and mom off. They blew up my husbands phone the day before the elopement and the night of the elopement. His single sister was defending us during that time. But then after that night she switched sides. 

Then they three started messaging me. And brining up other unrelated things about me and him. Accusing me and him of things. Lying about me and him. I blocked them. I didn’t reply. 

This went on for several more days. My husband with every message was angry and hurt. He was crying. I kept getting mad and more mad. So I sent a very long angry message to the three of them with my husband’s permission. Then blocked them again. I brought up things they have done. Defended myself and my husband. 

They got so mad at me. They went off on my husband for it. His single sister cut him off. He cut his other sister and mom off. 

So now he works with his mom, they are cordial at work. But I know he misses them. He’s hurt and angry over everything. He said they owe us an apology and we aren’t apologizing to them. They are demanding an apology from us. They told him that before they stopped talking. 

This past week I messaged all three saying I want to fix things. (I want to fix things for my husband.) I didn’t get a reply from any of them. So I emailed his mom. Sent a nice long message saying I could meet up with her to fix things and hope we can have a good relationship in the future. No reply.

(20f)my family began really struggling financially right before my parents split up when i was 13. it became very hard so my maternal grandma had to step in to help us survive. idk in depth details of all this so bear w me— growing up, my grandparents set up a college fund (529 plan) for me and my three siblings and put it in my dad’s name and excluded my mom’s name from it. i wanna take a sec to recognize how incredibly privileged i am for having had that given to me and how lucky i feel that they were able. my grandpa expected my dad to contribute to the fund as well so that it could cover the majority of my eventual tuition. when my parents split, my dad took everything out my siblings and my 529 fund without consulting any of my family. at the same time as we found out all of this, my grandma found documentation in our house that my dad had left behind showing that he was giving segments of $3000 to the woman he had just at that point met online, which i suspect is where a lot of my money went. 

im at my dad and his girlfriend’s apartment for thanksgiving. last night, i heard them both on the phone with someone from customer service for a company. i overheard them being vile/ rude. so i already had this awful taste in my mouth that reminded me that often times neither of these two are the best of people.

i was looking at my email today and there was an alert i had missed from a few days ago about needing to deal w student loan shit, i was so fed up w my dad specifically today bc of the shit w him being an ass to customer service (i think that says a lot about a person lol). i told him i wouldn’t have to worry about this if he had not stolen my college money. he told me it was not stolen but “borrowed” and that he plans to one day give it back. he IMMEDIATELY shut down the convo and i begged him to have a civil convo w me. i told him you cannot just take money that isn’t rightfully yours with claims that you’ll eventually give it back without consulting the people you’re taking it from. he refused to say he stole it and was so mad. i said i highly suspected he gave it to the woman he had just met online (the person he’s now dating) &amp; he told me that wasn’t true. 

my dad has a history of lying and doing manipulative shit. he put thousands of dollars of debt in my mom’s name bc he used a credit card under her name to do stuff w the new woman. he copied down my grandma’s credit card information right before my parents officially split and used it to pay for a ton of shit. i feel so guilty and like this shit daughter for grilling him on the college money situation. he has said he will pay my college loans and has helped here and there but is super all-talk-no-action. i got amazing financial aid so i’ll be ok regardless but i don’t think this is all very fair.

I was traumatized by some well meaning but ultimately harmful psychologists when I was younger. 

My husband's niece is currently having a hard time. I don't know about what specifically, but she's showing some indications of serious emotional shit. I am told she has ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder. Thing is, back when I was younger I knew a lot of headstrong, intelligent kids that got labeled with oppositional defiance (""ODD"") by idiotic or unscrupulous psychologists due to my time in that world. In my opinion, niece is in that later camp. While talking to her she does not show any indication of ODD, IMHO.

 Now:

A) I am statistically MUCH more likely to know such folks due to my background.

B) I definitely knew some folks with that diagnosis that were clearly suffering from it and not misdiagnosed (IMO)

C) I don't have a degree in this.

D) I don't know niece &amp; fam super well and am probably sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong (husband &amp;I have been together roughly 7 years, and we see each other on holidays but that's about it). So it's totally possible that she's just good at holding it together when she's around us.

Thing is, I feel like I'm betraying my past self if I don't say anything? Kinda? I wish someone ""adult"" had stood up for me when I was younger, and I definitely suffered because no one did. 

So I'm split here. Would I be the asshole if I mention something about how I knew kids that were wrongly diagnosed?  Or am I dumb for even thinking about saying anything?

I’m a nice person but I can only put up with so much before I say enough. That was 10 days ago. Flash forward to today. I got called in on 3 of my days off and each time I told my manager that I could. Today I was called into her office and told me I needed to be more flexible she reliable as they often need shifts covered and I need to pull my weight and since I’m a nerd with no social life I should be able to do it. I told her that I have worked every weekend since I started. I have given up so many days off for them and that they should find someone else to cover shifts as I am a human being who needs a break occasionally as I’m not a robot.

I (16f) have a lot of allergies. This can make holidays awkward at my house, especially after my steps Parker (18m), Christy (14f) and Caty (14f) moved in. My steps don’t seem to have any allergies and it gets brought up and used against me.

Yesterday, my mom realized she didn’t have enough ingredients to make a couple sides which would be for me, although she makes enough for everybody. She asked Parker if he could go to the grocery store and pick up the items, and he said yes. Mom told me I should go with him, even though I didn’t want to. She reminded me that last time Parker picked up items from the store, he brought home stuff he knew I would be allergic to. Mom gave Parker money, and we went to the store.

While there, he kept going down aisles I can’t. He thought it was funny, but I stayed near the frozen section and met up with him. I noticed he had peanut butter in the cart and reminded him I’m allergic. He told me it’s not all about me but took the peanut butter out. This happened a couple times with different items until we got to the frozen food section. He picked up 4 things of shrimp and dropped them in the cart, laughing that it would make a cool Thanksgiving side. I said, “Great, something else I’m allergic to.” He responded back with, “Not everything’s about you, Danielle.”

I said okay and walked away. I walked out of the store, and all the way home. When I walked in the door, my mom said that was fast. Then she noticed Parker wasn’t with me and asked what happened. I told her. My mom hugged me and said she’d call Parker. My mom called Parker and told him not to bother picking up anymore groceries, just to come home. He walked in the door 15-minutes later screaming at my mom about how it was just a joke, how I couldn’t take a joke, everybody babies me, and my allergies aren’t that bad.

Mom told him we’d talk about it when my stepdad got home, and Parker slammed his bedroom door. Mom called my stepdad and had him pick up the few groceries she needed, and he came in with them when he got off work. Mom tried to get Parker to come out to talk to my stepdad, but Parker wouldn’t leave his room. My stepsisters had heard what happened by this point and started calling me an a-hole saying I make everything about me, and they always get in trouble for it. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, and my mom and stepdad seem to be on my side.

This morning Parker’s mom showed up to take him to her house for Thanksgiving. My stepdad wasn’t expecting her and there was a fight over it. Parker’s mom insists that the family has a golden child and that it’s me. She claimed I cause problems in their life. My stepdad told me since Parker’s 18 he can stay wherever he wants, just not here, and now I feel even worse. My stepsisters kept bringing it up during dinner and they got sent to their rooms. I feel like crap.

She told me about a month after we moved in together. When she was dropping off some of her ex's stuff, she said she felt bad they were in a bad depressive episode and unable to get off on their own, so after some complaining she offered to get them off without receiving in any way. It broke my heart, but I believe this is the truth. She has been my best friend for a decade now, and we have been together for almost 3 years. When she told me this I was shattered, but I could not stop loving her. We communicated, I told her what I needed to help heal and she did everything I asked without complaint. She wouldn't see her ex anymore, she doesn't talk to them now, I could see all her messages, etc. I wanted to make it work because she is the love of my life, and she felt similarly.

It's been over a year now, and we both acknowledge that it still hurts me. But now I can't help but not trust her around other people, sspecially if they are flirting with her (though she does not flirt back). She told me all her reasoning for what she did, and not once did I come across her mind while she cheated on me until after it was done. I can't help but think if she were to get close to another person, and if they tried to initiate anything, how easy it would be for her to forget to think about me again. I've mentioned this to her briefly, but I don't want to tell her that I just don't trust her making close friends that I don't know or that I suspect might be into her. Sometimes when I hear her laughing with other people that I am not involved in I get jealous, or I shut down, or I get so incredibly anxious it will happen all over again.

I feel like I should be over it. She seems to be over it now, and whenever I try to express my pain that hits me from time to time, she ends up getting upset and I need to counsel her instead of me being able to express my pain to her.

Before starting with the story, I just wanna mention that my boyfriend has been very jealous in the past. He has not crossed the line by looking at my phone or anything like that, but the things he gets jealous over sometimes are absolutely ridiculous and I tell him this. The most annoying part is that he keeps bringing up incidents that happened over a year ago (!), and that still make him feel jealous and somehow are still my fault even though so much time has passed.

I (21f) have been with my boyfriend (22m) for about a year and a half now.
About a month ago, he woke me up during the night and asked me if I believe black guys have bigger d*cks than white guys. I don't remember exactly what we were talking about before we slept. I said that black guys are bigger on average, but race doesn't really determine your size. He got very quiet and sad. This is so weird to me, if he told me Dutch people are taller than my country's people on average I would be like ok cool. For the next few days, he could not get that thought out of his head. He said that he could not stop thinking of me saying that, and that he did not expect that answer. According to him, I believe black people are superior (which is not true, I don't believe in race superiority). Tmi but he is bigger than average in size, I don't understand him. Sometimes he says things like ""I wish I were black, then I would have been better, I would have had a bigger d"". 

I thought we were past this. Then today we were watching a football match, and one of the teams was full of black players. He was like ""no way this is X country's team"" (a European country) and I was like ""all teams have black players, I don't know why you are surprised. Black people are everywhere in football"". He got sad again and brought up the d incident. Apparently, he is still not over it. It seems that once again I'm the villain, I think black guys not only have bigger dicks, but are the best at football too. So they are all around superior. I told him that he should stop blaming his insecurities on me. He got sad again and left my house. He asked me for a relationship break. I don't want a break, we took one some months ago bc of his jealousy issues, and it did help, but imo if we keep relying on breaks this is not a relationship anymore. 

I really don't know what to do. I don't think he will ever stop thinking about this, and this is the biggest issue. This will definitely be a thorn in our relationship. I have encouraged him many times to visit a psychologist, and he has, but he really doesn't wanna bring this up to anyone and tbh I understand him, how do you even bring this up? I hope this is not our end. I'm very worried that this will stay at the back of his mind forever.

I love it but there’s one problem. Due to the fact that I live really close to work I am often called in on my days off if they’re short staffed. At first I said yes. But it got to the point I would never have a day off. A few weeks back I worked for 2 weeks straight without a break because my biggest fault is being a people pleaser. My breaking point was last week when I suddenly felt unwell at work and ended up throwing up in the bathroom. I explained this to my manager and asked if I could leave an hour early. She told me no as work had to be done. After that I decided enough was enough and I’d no longer come in on my days off as it was clear I was not respected or valued at work. I’m a nice person but I can only put up with so much before I say enough. That was 10 days ago. Flash forward to today. I got called in on 3 of my days off and each time I told my manager that I could. Today I was called into her office and told me I needed to be more flexible she reliable as they often need shifts covered and I need to pull my weight and since I’m a nerd with no social life I should be able to do it. I told her that I have worked every weekend since I started. I have given up so many days off for them and that they should find someone else to cover shifts as I am a human being who needs a break occasionally as I’m not a robot. I then got up and left the office. I am now sitting in my room wondering if I could of handed it better.

It was hosted by my dad’s aunt who raised him and had us, her step-daughter’s family, and her bio son and his family. I call her my grandma and her bio kids my aunt and uncle. My mom and I have a very strained relationship with this side of the family. They have always been awful to my mom, have humiliated her at every opportunity for the past 40 years, and since I’m her daughter, they don’t think too much of me either. My dad has never stuck up for her because he feels like he owes my grandma for raising him and in his words, “doesn’t want to make waves.” This is the only point of tension in their marriage. My mom finally went off on my aunt earlier this year, and we haven’t talked at all since. However, we got an invitation for Thanksgiving and since my grandma is planning to move across the country to live with her bio daughter, my dad wanted to go. 

At meal time, my uncle started “teasing” me about still living at home (I just got a good paying job and am planning on moving out in the springtime.). He was saying he would be embarrassed to have a child my age still living at home, basically called me a failure, and at one point alluded to the fact the reason I still live at home is because I wasn’t raised right, and I swear he looked my mom dead in the eyes when he said it. Everyone at the table was laughing the entire time. I got up with my mom, basically told them all to stuff it, and left. 
 
My dad followed and while he agreed that what my uncle said was wrong, he asked why I had to cause a scene, that we would probably never see them again and I should’ve just keep the peace. He said he just wanted a chance to tell her goodbye and now he didn’t get that. I’ve been getting texts from family about how disrespectful I was all night, some who I didn’t know even had my number.

Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they’ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely.

He asked his parents and they said no because they wanted to keep the number of people low due to Covid. I said okay and have instead spent my thanksgiving largely alone, occasionally getting plates thrown at my head by angry family members, and getting yelled at.

This morning he called to tell me all the “concerns” his family had about me and to act different around them, so I doubt they’re going to be letting me over for the holidays even next year when we’re engaged. He had told me he had a similarly unfun time at thanksgiving and I asked if he would stay home with me next year to which he said it depends. (Which means no.)

I just am worried about how it will be when I am married to him, if I will never be allowed in his family circle (which I suspect I won’t be), and if I’ll have to spend every holiday away from him like this.

My wife works in academic medicine and would have to work Thanksgiving every other year. We also had two children in the mean time. And then Covid happened. Consequently, over the last eight years we were never able to make it to Thanksgiving with the rest of my family. (We did sometimes make it for Christmas.) This year we moved back within driving distance (8-10 hours depending on traffic and stops) and made plans to join the family for Thanksgiving. 

My wife had to work overnight call Wednesday to Thursday and wasn't able to get home until Thanksgiving morning. We made plans to leave as soon as possible and stop at a hotel a couple hours out for the night and make it there the next day.

We had discussed over the family group text what time of day on Friday to have Thanksgiving meal, and whether to have turkey or something else. (We decided on ham.)

While driving there on Thanksgiving day my sister sent a picture of the entire family together celebrating Thanksgiving dinner with a full spread. I was immediately confused and sent a message to my parents asking if I misunderstood that we were having Thanksgiving. My wife immediately broke down in tears. We were both upset and hurt.

I angrily called my parents, who were both surprised we were upset, explaining that we're still going to have a full meal tomorrow. They also said Thanksgiving dinner is ""like \[my brother in law\]'s Super Bowl."" They explained that they always had Thanksgiving dinner Thursday together, and so they just naturally did that. My brother in law's father and brother also don't have anywhere else to go. My dad said I was overreacting and everyone was excited to all finally be together, and it wasn't a big deal since they'd be doing another full meal Thursday. My mom said she was hurt that would be upset. 

Am I unreasonable in assuming that my family would wait for us an extra day when no one had ever mentioned another meal, or at the very least inform us of their plans to have a full meal?

Liam's birthday party was just a day ago, And I went becuase, why wouldn't I? Anyways, It was a pretty awesome party, lots of others there and almost his whole class, But I never saw violet there. I didn't think much of it until it was almost the end, and I saw her in the window of her bedroom.

He has multiple pretty intense mental health issues including autism, anxiety, developmental delays, etc. and though he's usually fine at our house or when we go somewhere outdoors like the park he tends to act up in public especially when he doesn't get his way and WON'T chill for anything. His anxiety riles him up and then he gets mad at being anxious which in turn makes him more anxious. Him JUST getting back on his meds (and trialing new meds) is making it even worse.

Now I have NO issues at all with him spending the day with us gaming at our apartment, taking him on a hike with our dogs, and taking him through a drive-through for lunch/dinner, etc. but I really don't want to take him to a sit-down restaurant and a movie theatre because the second he doesn't get his way he starts screaming and with my own mental health issues I simply can't take it. Especially when everyone starts staring at us. Just thinking about it makes me feel sick. 

I suggested we postpone our date night so that we can spend the whole Sunday with Phat but he got very angry and insisted we just bring him along so I suggested just dropping them off while I go to the bookstore or park but that just upset him more since he wants me there too.

I referred to this one person during the conversation, and the person interrupted me to inform me they go by “they” since they’re non-binary and not a girl.

I just kept talking, and didn’t bother to ask why the hell they’re here at *girl’s night* if they’re non-binary and not a girl. Or why they’re in female housing if they’re not female. After they left, some other girls mentioned it. “Why the fuck is that person here if they aren’t a girl? This is girl’s night.” If a guy had come, he would’ve been thrown out, and that’s what everyone thought should’ve happened since the person said they aren’t a girl.

A few days later, I’m sitting with some girls and our guy friend. This person, (apparently not a girl), comes and sits near us. They insert themself in our conversation, and when the topic of dating comes up, they brought up that they went on a date and bemoaned the fact that the guy didn’t pay.

I said “why you think he would he pay for you?” 

They said “because I’m old-fashioned and I like when the guy pays for the girl.”

I said “Ok. And you’re not a woman, remember? You said so a few days ago when you came to *girl’s* night.”

They got confrontational then. And our guy friend pointed out “so you’re a woman when you want free shit from guys and to insert yourself into girl’s night and to live in girl housing. So whenever it’s convenient for you, then?”

So I've had this online friendgroup for like 2 months now (we meet and talk to each other in this rpg game called habboon) and about a week ago i met this new girl who joined the group (I will call her Anna here). We got along quickly. I realized that I had grown fond of her too and I enjoyed her company. I really liked being friends with her.

Then 4 days ago stuff got complicated. I saw Anna use the n-word while telling a story to the other members of our friend group. (she is white like me).

I was a bit bothered about this. Me and most of my friends are white and we never use that word, I mean, it is a racist slur.
I did talk to my her about it but she didnt seem to understand. Anna said it wasnt wrong since she was just telling a story where someone else had said that word.
I acknowledged that it might have just been an accident. But while talking about it, she said it again, on purpose. To piss me off maybe. This time I didn't stand for it.

I waited for her to say something like ""That was stupid, I'm not going do that again"", but instead she just said that ""in her mind it isnt wrong to say the n-word"". At least not when there are no black people to hear her say it.

I told her that I can't be friends with someone who takes pride in saying a racist slur. She did say she wasnt racist, but I can't be friends with a person who can't take responsibility for the stuff they say either (like, if the n-word was an accident, i thought she would at least take responsibility for the stuff she said by admitting shes wrong).

Anna said that we should probably part ways cuz we have different opinions on the matter. I agreed.

Just a few minutes later I logged in to habboon and our other mutual friends started to shame me. Apparently I had made Anna cry.
I tried to explain to our mutual friends the situation. That Anna had made the choice. In Anna's eyes it was more important to be able to say the n-word and not get in trouble over it than to be friends with me.
They didn't see it that way. They said that I was playing the victim for no reason and that I should just make up with Anna.
But I don't think I'm playing the victim. It's just my preference to not be friends with people who say that word casually- even if they weren't racist. 
And, the thing is, I did try to make up with Anna. It was up to her and she decided not to herself.
Anyway, after a long time of my friends gish gallopping me and telling me that I'm the one in the wrong, one of my friends told me that maybe I really shouldn't have friends. He said that I was whining for no reason and that I didn't consider Annas' feelings.

I really don't know anymore if I am being the asshole or not.

I have not talked to my parents about this and don't know what else to do. So let's start with why I resent him.

My younger brother is the favorite, it's plain and simple, he gets what he wants and he knows it. My brother has diagnosed ADHD so it's hard for him to control or regulate his actions and emotions, while I understand that makes things hard for him but my parents use it as an excuse for most of the things he does wrong. If he hits me and I maybe smack him on the arm a little, not enough to hurt, I'm the one who gets told off first even though he hit me first for really no reason, but it's my fault because he has problems and he's younger. This happens almost daily if not more than once a day among other things.

He's also the reason I don't get to do things or I have to leave places early like today for example. Me and my family were at my Grandma's house for Thanksgiving and my younger brother wanted to stay over but my grandma told him no. He kept asking and asking but after he realized that it wasn't going to happen he started screaming, crying and throwing things because he wasn't going to stay. We had to leave extremely early because my parents couldn't get him to calm down.

My parents also get mad if I step in while he's hitting or throwing things at my other younger brother (M9), who I'm going to call L, by telling him to go to another room or trying to diffuse the situation. They say that's it's not my place even though I only do this if they aren't in the room. The only time I'm allowed to step in by their standards is when they aren't home and I'm watching my siblings. For example today I yelled at my brother because he hit me while I was trying to get him to leave the room because him and L were fighting and hitting each other. My dad (M41) then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault that I got hit because ""you know that it's going to happen"". Like are you kidding me.

It has been like this for years and I'm so sick and tired of everything being my fault. I'm also not the only child in my house who feels this way, my younger sister (F12) and me have talked about this extensively. But I feel so bad for resenting my little brother whom I love dearly and would kill for. I don't want to feel this and I hope that your feedback will give me a sense of whether or not I'm right in my feeling or if I'm being overdramatic.

I asked if we could move the date to February and he responded with ""It's too close to *half sister 1*'s exams"". She is in high school and the exams are in January, not February.

 ""Okay how about March?"" ""Too close to *half sister 2*'s midterms""

I went to the bathroom upstairs and there was faeces on the seat (regular occurrence), so I had to go into the kitchen for the supplies. As I was getting them, he asked me if I was even a member of the family passive-aggressively. I answered with yes and left after telling him to wait as I had to go upstairs hinting at the supplies.  
When I got down, I saw that he had left so I went to make myself food (I didn’t need to cook for everyone due to take-out). I kept thinking about what I did as my dad only asks questions like that when he is doing chores, or I have done something wrong (in his books). I couldn’t think of anything, so I uneasily decided to ignore it.  
I came back to the table, and as soon as he finished praying, he started hovering above me and shouting all kinds of things about how it was disrespectful of me not to follow up on that conversion and he repeatedly kept asking me if I was the parent and he was the child. This outburst took me by surprise, and I felt a mixture of both fear and sadness and just gawked at him in shock. Looking back now that must’ve motivated him to continue. I finally registered what happened and tearfully asked my mom how that was disrespectful plus I genuinely did not want to follow up a ‘conversation’ that was just an argument. She kept calmly justifying his actions and thought and to her calm manner he kept angrily shouting why she was begging me (as in she should be shouting too). After a while of back-and-forth debating how I was disrespectful, he changed the topic to how I didn’t even ask them how they were doing. (I see my fault) but then he accused me of doing nothing but sitting behind my laptop screen. I admitted my wrongs but told him the way he intimated me hurt me and he said that I did not understand how angry he felt then inferring how he should’ve even used physical v.  
I honestly don’t know why I didn’t ask them how they were.

Recently my husband told me he wants a divorce. Apparently he met another woman three years ago and only waited with divorce until our older daughter finished middle school (he said that he didn't want to cause her additional stress when she had competence exams at the end of school and had to choose how does she want to continue her education). I agreed to have a divorce, after all I'm not going to beg him to stay. Both our daughters are hurt of course but all in all took the news surprisingly okay. Husband moved out and the girls see him on weekends and some school/family events until we'll sort the custody at court.

Recently I learned from my husband that some of the toys my daughters received in the last years supposedly from my husband actually are gifts from his lover. (They never met her, as far as I know.) When I confronted my husband about that he said that his lover ""understands that the girls are an important part of his life so wanted to give them something for occasions like Christmas or Children's Day"" and didn't thought it a big deal, especially since the girls didn't even know that the gifts are from her.

I was upset and decided to throw away the things from husband's lover. In my opinion she had no right to give them anything, especially given that they don't know her and she stole their father. Most of these gifts were small (glittery pens, stickers etc.) but there also were two plushies and a boarding game. 

It was hell. Both girls were furious. Younger daughter was crying for her cat plushie which apparently she ""loved"" and when I tried to explain to them why I threw it away, she even said ""who cares, I want it back"". Older daughter went as far as to go to the dumpsters and look for the toys and eventually brought the plushies back. I explained to them that I'll not tolerate gifts from that woman in my house and they called my husband and asked him to hide the toys at his place. To be honest I feel betrayed by them since they choose some toys over me. 

Husband told me that I'm crazy and both daughters are mad at me (the older one refuses to talk to me). I think that I had every right to throw these things away. It was my husband who cheated not me and his lover only wants to groom my daughters into liking her, so I have every right to be upset about it.

In Feb 2021 one of our coworkers was struggling and we offered for him to move in with us since we had a spare bedroom. He declined but one of our other coworkers, P, (25f) overheard and asked if she could move in when their lease expires with her husband, J, (28m) We agreed. 
I got pregnant in May of that year and had a difficult pregnancy so I had to quit my job. Initially we were all going to contribute 1/4 rent since we were all employed, but we asked if they were willing to each contribute 1/3 rent since i was unemployed and they agreed.
They moved in Oct As soon as they moved in we realized they didn't have much things.
It turns out they don't even have a car and they would use the extra car that J's family had since they lived with his distant family. 
Since my husband and I had 2 cars we would lend them mine.
Everytime P made food, she would never clean up after them. They wouldn't even throw the toilet paper in the trash, they would kinda just toss it to the side. They would use everything that's mine without permission. 
I bought all the groceries and they ate everything. My husband and I bought a mini fridge without telling them and place it in our walk-in closet. one time I asked them not to eat something and P said, ""why don't you just put it in the fridge in your closet.""
P and J have family in a little border town in Mexico and one time they left in my car without telling us for a whole week, we live in AZ. I was obviously mad and from that moment I told them they couldn't use my car anymore.
After our baby girl was born in January, we decided to move back home to Texas starting next year. We bought a house for when we move.
We then found out that P was going around work telling all our mutuals that we don't pay rent and I don't contribute anything. My husband confronted her and they said we should be embarrassed that they're pulling in all the weight and we're basically living for free. It turned into a big argument and J told my husband we shouldn't have gotten a house if he wasn't going to go half and half on rent. my husband was over it and told them to start buying new furniture because we're going to move out as soon as we can.
Well now, they left all week due to thanksgiving and my husband and I started packing EVERYTHING that was ours from the furniture, dishes, shower curtain, even The bed that they used. We’re leaving tomorrow. We didn't tell them ahead of time because we're still salty about the argument so they will be getting here Sunday to a completely empty apartment.

So today is Thanksgiving, an American holiday where we eat our feelings and snap at our loved and unloved ones about sensual policits. Don't wag your finger at me! Call me Santa if you need a name because I'm not saying my real one (I'm female surprisingly).

Yesterday was not Thanksgiving, but it was our Thanksgiving Pageant at the private elementary school I teach at. It was not going to be formal at all, just children dressing up as Pilgrims &amp; Indians and recreating the Mayflower voyage and eating a pretend meal. We have a fairly diverse school racially, so I had the whites be the pilgrims, since the pilgrims were white, and the others be Indians. Obviously, since we don't have any real Indians anymore, I chose the closest races (blacks and Asians), and the remaining Latinos got to play the food.

Long story short, it was a travesty. I only wanted to make it accurate as possible, yet that is precisely what parents took issue with. We hadn't even started the pageant, and parents were coming up to me and letting their invalid feelings be heard. Mr. Jamal got up and made his kids leave because they're vegan and were wearing real Indian feathers. Ms. Ching claimed she had actual ""indigenous heritage"" but don't we all when it's convenient? Mrs. Latina wanted to know why her daughter was dressed as a pesseguinho, after which I called her a putinha. Other POC parents were being similar, and even some of the whites betrayed me.

The pageant didn't end up happening after so many kids were pulled, but that's not what made me mad. The parents didn't trust me, the teacher, to do what I thought best for their children. When they're at school, they're my kids. That's just how it works around here. I am wondering if it would have been better to just use teachers as ""Indians"" to avoid the unnecessary offense, so maybe I could've done better from the start, but I don't think I did anything wrong.

I kept asking him what he wanted to do, and he would say things like ""nothing"", ""I hate my birthday"", ""I don't want to do anything."" Eventually he said his friends were taking him out for dinner. My cousin was having his annual Thanksgiving Eve party and my cousins were coming in from out of town. I only see these family members once a year and I look forward to my cousin's party so I can hang out with them. I told my bf that I was going to my cousin's party so I wouldn't be making it to his birthday dinner, but he could come over to my house after his dinner and stay over, I was buying him a cake and we could celebrate and open presents.

So yesterday I had to work. My boyfriend kept texting me asking when I was leaving the office, if I was getting out early, etc. etc. I said I didn't know, on the days before holidays my job always tells us last minute. He asked when did I think I would be showing up to his dinner? I told him I was going to my cousin's party and didn't know (I was confused why he was asking me this but I was busy at work and didn't have time to be texting, I wanted to finish and leave).

I got to my cousin's party at around 5:30pm. Boyfriend's dinner was at 6pm and it was in my neighborhood so he wasn't far from my house. Throughout the party my bf kept texting me asking if I was coming to dinner with him and his friends. I was like..I don't know, I can meet up with you after, keep me posted where you are. They finished dinner in an hour (and here is when I started to panic, what birthday dinner is that short?) and he said ""guess you aren't coming"". Then he said they were in a doughnut shop eating dessert and ""we are sitting here waiting for you"". I said I was still at the party. I was getting upset that I was constantly on my phone at my family's party and felt pressured.

At around 8:15pm I said I was in a cab on my way home and to meet me there. My bf said ""too late, I am going home. You never showed up."" Now he is not speaking to me and was being pretty cruel before that. Long story short of his chastising, he thinks I stood him up for his birthday. So I spent $60 on a cake for nothing and overall feel like crap. He is making me feel like I am the crazy one, did I fuck up here and not communicate better like he keeps saying?

Am I the asshole for asking Son to stop bringing increasingly difficult  board games(to our home when they come down for vacations) to teach us?

Son, DIL and 3 grands (5, 8, 11) come to our home at the beach in Florida whenever they vacation. We love having them come HOWEVER our Son has begun bringing down ever-increasingly complicated  board games to play.  We were fine  learning  Flying Burritos and Exploding Kittens.  Then it was the Donnor Party  which took about 3 days for us to learn (Papa is in early stages of dementia,  so it takes him longer and he forgets the rules) but we really enjoy Donnor Party.
 
However this visit he brought Mansions of Madness. We, Mimi and Papa,  found it incredibly  complicated. Papa gave up and went to bed. Every time I asked could we please play something else he gets ridiculously  defensive about it.  ""I just won't bring any games"" or ""put them ALL in the car because they don't  want to play this game"" or "" if you'd  just give it a try you'd  love it"".

So next morning over coffee he wants to play M-of-M again. I say ok I'll  try, PaPa stayed in bed so he didn't  have to participate in the nonsense.  Son, DIL, Mimi, and 11 yr Grand  play this game again. I still don't like it...

Here's the additional  problem, we are going up to their house for 30 days around the New Year. He's  talking about wanting to teach me Gloomhaven(I think it's called that). It sounds extra EXTRA complicated  and time consuming. 


Will I be the AH for telling him I don't  want to even try Gloomhaven or play Mansions of Madness again? What do I do/say if he gets ridiculously defensive again?

Am I missing something  about his desire to do these things or have I raised an AH?

This is a new development  in our interactions and I have ZERO intention of screwing our  relationship but I need help understanding.

A friend invited me to her wedding and allowed me two plus ones, L and J (F). We are brazilian and it happened in Brazil. Her husband is American, many of the guests were too. Despite showering first, they made me get late to both the welcome party and the cerimony/ wedding party (the bride texted me saying that I was going to miss her entrance).  
At both parties I constantly switched up between speaking in English and Portuguese to include everyone in the conversation and L and J both kept mocking/teasing me, bad mouthing Americans in general and sometimes even acting pissy to be there. When I asked them to get off my back L said “We are just joking; can’t you take a joke?”. I didn’t answer and enjoyed the party. L and J hooked up with two American friends of the groom and wanted to go with them to to continue drinking after the party. I was tired and wanted to sleep so I called an uber and asked another friend and her husband to ride with me because I was afraid of going back alone and L and J didn't wanna come with.
The next day we were traveling back home and I was quiet and avoidant. L kept pushing me to talk about it. I blurted out ""I just think it is fucked up that I got made fun of so much for trying to be accomodating and friendly to the Americans, but in the end you both seemed quite comfortable sitting on their Ds"". Laura got very mad and said she didn't like what I just said and I continued ""I'm am just joking; can’t you take a joke?"".

She was diagnosed recently and it’s been really hard for my uncle (36m) d their young child (1 year old). 

All of my family live in one town but I moved away and live about 1 hour 20 mins away. I try and visit home when I can but it’s not always feasible since I have to pack all my stuff plus I’m married. I do however visit at least once a month and stayed over in October where I helped my uncle out by either going to their house to help with chores, or cooking for him or picking up groceries using my own money. 

Recently the situ with my aunt has gone really bad and it’s taking a huge toll on my uncle. My sister (25f), who lives at home has been amazing and she’s helped out with my cousin a lot and helped my uncle out with things like giving our cousin a bath and just generally things for my aunt and uncle whilst she’s in chemo. 

Honestly it kills me that I can’t help out more and I’ve even cried to my husband about useless I feel. 

So recently I was at a family gathering and my uncle (jokingly) mentioned that my sister is his child’s fav cousin and that I’m useless. I KNOW that he was joking but it upset me a little because I’m not trying to be useless, it’s just that I don’t live at home anymore so I’m not always around. 

So my uncle needs help doing up the living since my aunt isn’t in the right state of mind and he wants to finally finish it. He asked my sister to send sofa suggestions, and she asked me to help. I sent one, and when my uncle saw it he text my sister saying that “tell her your *cousin* fav and her suggestions are meaningless”. And to send the screenshot to me. 

Again, I KNOW it was a joke on his part and he prob didn’t meant anything by it, but it was upsetting. 

So I text saying that that was mean and that fine I won’t send any more suggestions. My sister then asked wtf is up with me and that it was a joke and that he’s stressed. Then she went on to say that no one can joke with me and I’m getting pissy. I explained to her that if I was in my home town I would help, but I don’t live there anymore so it does get hard. I’ll be going in December and so I plan to help them. I explained the above to her and how upset I am that I can’t physically help much. 

She said that she didn’t know how I was feeling and that I should’ve told her. I said I’m glad I didn’t die to how she behaved cia text just now. Then she decided to add that she’s lucky she’s not like me because she doesn’t use things I tell her as an attack and that my mother would say the same.

She then referred to an argument we had last month where we both attacked each other but then apologised (me first as usual). It was an ugly fight but we were both in the wrong. 

Then I blocked her from everything.

Anyways that was just some backstory to the impending argument, eventually we mentioned my brother who is a low functioning autistic (even more so than sibling A who can still hold a job and what not) and how our parents were mentally abusive and how he needs serious help. In response I told her he needs to take accountability and take the final steps into cutting off mom and dad if he actually wanted to get shit done in his life, which I admit is harsh but come on. she tells me he can’t take accountability because he is autistic, I told her to not twist my words and at this point she was writing to me in all caps basically implying I was dumb. I told her that how is he going to even be able to do anything if he doesn’t have a true sense of what being and adult is and that he needed therapy.

I (18M) have an online friendgroup (age range 17 - 24) I've been friends with for years and we like to have occasional game nights. I've bought party game packs for these game nights. Many of these games include inputting an answer and players voting on each answer given. This is where the problem begins.

For a while now, many of my friends have been *obsessed* with Minecraft YouTubers/Streamers. I can't go one day without hearing about them, which is fine. Many of my friends have ADHD or Autism and can hyperfocus on certain media, which I also do, so I understand. Personally, I don't like MC and just mute whichever Discord channel they're talking about it in.

During game nights, though, it's kinda isolating to have all your friends laughing at references that you don't get and to constantly lose games because you can't make the same jokes. I probably sound like a sore loser but it really blows when you think of a funny answer but lose by a landslide because of a reference you and one or two other friends don't get at all.

Tomorrow is another game night, I'm honestly thinking about requesting my friends keep MCYT out of the game or else I don't want to play. But if I don't play, no one gets to play because I own all the game packs and I feel like that's holding the fact that I bought all these games we like above their heads.

So my children absolutely HATE each other. Like blocked each other and refuse to talk to one another. They are also late twenties to early thirties so if they haven't figured it out by now, they never will.  (I have zero idea why, when asked both give vague answers and they always change.) I now keep both of my relationships separate. I don't talk about the other one to the one I am talking to. This has created a tense free life for them but for me it can be a bit much. 

One child is pregnant and I'm not allowed to say anything to anyone (including family) for fear that sibling will find out. Okay their pregnancy their rules. 

Spoke to other kid, who is out state, today and they informed me that they have cancer. Early stages but still cancer. They've kinda let me know what was going on throughout the process but they let me know what it is and they have appts next week to discuss options. Not gonna lie, I knew it was a possibility but hearing it broke my heart and I am not okay today. 

Today was going to be my alone day anyway. Pregnant kid was eating with her baby daddy's family

Pregnant kid comes over tonight, unannounced, to discuss them telling the fathers family today at dinner. She is further along but has been able to keep it a secret because she doesn't visit his family often. She is mad she didn't get the reaction she wanted.  I am cooking because our holiday meal will be tomorrow and I have things going on in my brain. I only hear partial of what is going on with pregnant kid. Pregnant kid asks me what my deal is, I say that I've talked to other kid and just thinking about what they said. PK starts going off about what they think the issue is and all kinds of just crap. I looked at them and told them that they don't want me to discuss things with other kid and other kid doesnt want me to discuss with them, everything they said was wrong and to just stop. I refused to discuss other kid.  Pregnant kid got pissed and left slamming doors and now they don't know if they will come tomorrow.  Because I apparently  just dont care. 

AITA for not really caring about what their other family has to say about pregnancy. 

Just a side note I am planning a trip to see out of state child. Pregnant child wants to come and just show up with a child. I have shot this down multiple times and especially now. Pregnant kid thinks it'll be funny to just show up and tell other kid to suck it up. 

I am also not upset at kiddo for letting me know their diagnosis on a holiday. I was supposed to be alone, they knew that. They also needed a day or two to deal with this with their spouse.

Last year, we spent all of our time together, though most of our days (about 8-10 hrs a day) were spent studying. This year, however I have fallen extremely ill, and this has depleted to about 5 hours.

I recently got diagnosed with severe depression, and am getting assessed for ADHD and autism this winter which could correlate. However, I was prescribed some medication that I had a severely negative reaction to, resulting to me being severely ill and needing constant supervision under medical orders. My boyfriend willingly insisted on supervising me during this time without me asking. However, it's been 4 weeks and I still haven't fully recovered, and have gotten even worse depression as a result, alongside losing a lot of weight. However, my boyfriend has insisted on looking after me this whole time, and has developed sleep apnoea in this time, likely from the stress, but we're not sure. He's having a physical examination next week. He had depression last year, and has relapsed, though we think as a symptom of sleep apnoea.

However, here is where the issue lies. His professor emailed him the other day to say that he's disappointed in his standard of work this year, and threatened to contact his other professors and write him bad reference emails. They had a meeting about it today, and even though he seemed empathetic to my boyfriend's circumstances of sleep apnoea and depression, he essentially told him to man up and work harder. I feel so guilty since I know that the reason my boyfriend has been working less is because he has been looking after me because I've been ill, and I also feel awful because I think this could have caused his depression.

I feel like the main reason I may be the asshole is that I didn't put my foot down and tell him to work when he was looking after me, and the one time he told me he wanted to stay in the library, I asked him if he was okay to walk me home because it was night-time and it's not safe for girls to walk home alone in the dark here. He worked in his room but I still feel awful. I just feel like I am the cause of all of his problems because his illness has been wasting his time, despite the fact he volunteered to look after me.

I’m Dasha (f19) and one of my close friends is Nemesis “Sissy” (f18). For the past few years, Sissy has been dealing with body weight issues. She has tirelessly tried various diets, workout programs, binging, and even weight-loss surgery (she was ineligible due to previous pregnancy complications) along with a paranormal exhibition which ultimately proved useless as I expected. About four months ago, she finally found a diet that could bring her size down to where she wants it to be.

This past week was when Sissy planned to reach her goal weight and could go back to a regular, healthy meal schedule. Remind ya, I’m kinda we…ll forgetful, so I didn’t think she was planning to reach her goal weight until next month. We only meet up with each |other every or every other| week due to conflicting schedules, and I make sure to always tell her she’s doing good with her weight loss. I’d hope Sissy’d do the same. We just got to support our friends’ endeavors, yeah? Girls supporting girls!

So… when we met up last week, I “greeted” (we don’t greet, but you get it) Sissy and told her that she looked like she was almost done losing weight! She paused a few seconds which made me confused, and then she revealed to me that she had in fact reached her weight loss goal. Please know that I don’t mean any harm and I didn’t tell it to her this way, but she didn’t *look* like she was done losing weight. I know that fat distributes itself in different ways on different people, but sometimes you just have to change your weight goals when you realize how it looks on you (is that not an Ariana Grande song?). I changed the subject for convene, and we didn’t talk about her weight loss journey again that day. Instead we talked about my newfound fascination for Dr. Pepper (my college professor), and I thought it was all good.

But the next day, three or five days ago (depending on time zone \[I left for a world vacation yesterday\], it’s hard for me to determine due to my self-diagnosed dyslexia), I googled about weight to try to continue to support Sissy after the comment I made. I texted her a screenshot of a weight chart that showed she could drop 20 more pounds and still be very healthy. To my shock, this really upset her and she insisted that she didn’t want to lose anymore weight because she felt like she was done. Which, perse, made me feel bad I feel like if my intentions weren’t in the wrong place, then I’m not wrong for saying what I said, but do you intend to judge me differently?

Hi guys,

I am 23 years old, husband is 37. We have a 4 year old child together. I met him when I was 18.

He’s barley spent any time with our son and has played video games all day. When I ask him about it, he said “this is the only time I get to really play before I have to work”. He works from home. He has played since this morning and spent no time with us at all, we’ve been in the same room and he’s barely spoke. This is by far one of the worst thanksgivings I have ever had. I’ve felt so lonely I ended up crying in my car. 

When I say all day, I mean all day.. with an exception to use the restroom. I thought today was supposed to be a family day. I seen families outside going for walks and cooking, laughing and talking.  He’s barely spoke to me all day.

I was on break eating my lunch in the break room a long with a couple of my female coworkers.  They were talking about something to do with one of their ex boyfriends and how they behaved, and would regularly throughout the conversation tie it back to him being a Taurus.  Whatever, I don't care.  I just want to eat my food.  After a while of this they turn to me and ask me to confirm that all Taurus men act a certain way (Im one of the few men who work at this facility so I regularly get asked to weigh in on this kinda stuff).  I just flat out say ""I don't really believe in that kinda stuff so I cant say."".  The girl who asked me immediately kinda laughs and scoffs and says ""Oh you're one of THOSE guys"" in a teasing tone.  This really kinda bothered me, but I still held my tongue and just said ""Yup."" and tried to go back to eating.  Before I could even get the food in my mouth she of course asked what my sign was.  Just to try and get her to stop talking I just tell her it's Cancer.  She and her friend immediately look at each other as if they had it all figured out and laughed while the other girl loudly exclaims while clapping ""I so knew it omg"".

This is where I just couldn't help myself anymore, I shoot back with ""So you're able to tell so much about me just by my sign?"", which she replies with ""Well yeah, most cancers tend to be super stubborn and skeptical about stuff like you."".  Then I said the line ""Well I think it's kinda messed up how you think I must act and behave a certain way based purely on something I can't control like the month I was born in, that's basically space racism.""

They immediately change their tone and one of the girls immediately launches into a rant about how that's super insensitive and how im trivializing the struggles on minorities.

But the one closest to my home, which is also the most impressive-looking one to have on your CV in this particular city is VERY competitive to get into especially the course I want to do. The minimum requirements is 2 Bs &amp; an A, but priority is given to those with the highest grades &amp; most volunteer experience. 
My school asked everyone on the head student team to take a day each &amp; give up a free period to spend time with the first years who haven't made friends yet. I feel sorry for these kids and I know 1 free probably sounds so insignificant that you probably already think I'm an asshole. But let me explain: 
When I'm in school, I'm very studious, I always meet deadlines &amp; get probably more revision than necessary done in the weeks before test week. But whenever I am at home, it's a different story. I'm what you might call an immersive daydreamer. 9 times out of 10 I can switch this of in school, but at home, I can't. I don't think I can help this, as I got it from 1 of my relatives. This is why I'm so reliant on free periods to get all that revision done &amp; meet deadlines. I keep school life &amp; home life separate in my mind. When it gets dark out &amp; I can't continue with my exercise, music &amp; daydreaming, all I want to do is sleuth and listen to true crime. I can revise religiously in school 4 months prior to the exam, but I can't effectively revise at home, unless it's a few nights before exam. 
As much as I sympathise with the 1st year pupils, because of the way my brain is wired, I need to make use of all my free periods. I can't be anywhere near as productive if I'm made to work at home. I've already given up 1 free period a week to help the junior school with math even though I dropped math as soon as I could. 
I told my dad &amp; he took my side. Saying that I had to put myself 1st &amp; I wasn't a member of staff, so it shouldn't be my duty. My dad has the same mindset as me of whenever you're in your work environment, be as productive as possible, get everything done and out the way within work hours and the come home and live your life. More than 99 times out of 100, I manage to do this no problem. But I'm now having more of my productive time taken.
I know I said earlier I needed volunteer experience &amp; I'm getting plenty of it - outside school, after dark or on weekends. But for me, school needs to be a place solely for the acedmeic stuff.
Am I the asshole for being reluctant to do this? FYI, If I don't get into this university my only 2 options are to go to the other university which offers the course, which is about 4/5 hours away in a city I have never even visited, where I know nobody, or take a gap year and try to get into this university again next year, when I would end up being a year behind all my peers.

One of my friends who had parrots when they were younger offered to take two of the birds. I told them sure as I'm confident in their ability to care for them.

He said he’d get it for me as a gift if I bought it that day and he promised he would pay me back when he got his paycheck. He didn’t use his paycheck to pay me back saying he had other debts and lost his job after. 4 months later he hasn’t paid me back and I’ve asked for the money a total of 4 times only when I’ve needed it. 

My bf is currently moving houses. He told me he had £500 and the council was giving him another £500 for furniture. He also said he’s been given things by family so he hasn’t had to buy things he thought he would need to pay for. I have even asked my cousin to use him van to move my bf’s furniture and save him £280 on moving costs.

I recently gave a large sum of money to my family because of the cost of living rising. I had to buy clothes for myself unexpectedly and quickly as I just got a new job starting soon and had no suitable work clothes. While shopping (only free time I had to do it before starting work) I realised my select account didn’t have enough money but I needed 1-2 more tops. 

I asked my bf can I have the £16 he borrowed back thinking he may have it but if he didn’t it would be fine, I didn’t demand anything. 

He then called me Scrooge and inconsiderate and that I spend too much on rubbish and i should have known I would have no money and I shouldn’t be asking him for my £16. 

I apologised if he thought I was being inconsiderate. I genuinely didn’t know he didn’t have £16 or think it was bad to ask but he doesn’t believe me saying I knew he had no money. He just replied that ‘he’s alone with everything and accepted it’.

He turns 18 in March 2023. I (21) was told I have 3 months to find a place to live or I'd be kicked out too. I've already made my mind up that I'm going to buy a place instead of renting. I’ve always wanted to live by myself due to growing up in a very dysfunctional family home. Somewhere along that decision my brother and I decided we would live together. I wanted to make sure my brother wouldn’t be on the streets in 5 months, I want to give him a home until he was stable enough. However, I put some ground rules in.

My brother is still considered a minor and I've already expressed I don't want him moving with me unless he got a job. Obviously, this is so he can contribute towards bills, council tax, and other stuff. We’ve already agreed to go half for these sorts of things because of the cost-of-living crisis happening right now. 

I’d be applying for a mortgage in my name, and he’s recently expressed he wanted to be added to the mortgage once he’s 18. If his name is on the mortgage, he would get a share of the property with me. I don’t want this. But he’s already expressed he wants to move out after living with me for 4 years to another country leaving me alone with the property. I’ve already told him I’d like him to go half on the mortgage with me too, his name wouldn’t be on it though. I see it as a low form of rent. 

I told him in the long run it wouldn’t be a good idea because it would mean messing around getting a joint mortgage just after getting the first one sorted then having to take him off. It would also mean paying more a month for the mortgage. For example, if it was just me it would be £390 a month, split halfway £195 each. He’d only be paying £195 extra on top of other things, which is very cheap for rent. But if his name was on it the price would jump to £680 a month, aka £340 each and if he was to be taken off the mortgage after 4 years. The amount I would have to pay would be much higher than it was in the first place, potentially leaving me struggling financially. I told him this and I said I didn’t think it was worth it.

He then said he wouldn’t pay anything towards the mortgage and would only pay towards what he must. I’ve discussed this already with my grandparents, and they agree he should pay some rent on top of bills because I’m already having to up my budget by 20k (£120,000) so I can afford a 2-bed property so he can live with me. They also agree his name shouldn’t be on the property because he’s not contributing to the mortgage deposit, which is already £12,000. This not including the other fees that come along with buying a house. They listed a bunch of other stuff too, only strengthening my wish for him not to be on the mortgage.

I (17f) had a large group of friends, about 13 of us, and we had a group chat that we all commonly use. We are all juniors in highschool, so old enough to know common sense and the difference between good and bad. For context about how the joke was brought up; my school district changed our absences-per-class-per-credit rule over the summer and I had discovered it this afternoon when I got a letter from my school. They changed the amount of days you can miss from 10 and lowered it to 8 days per semester. It irritated me so I sent a picture to the group chat. Well, the very first response from that message was a message from a (now) Ex-friend saying “I’m going to sh**t up our school.” We live in the urban areas of Texas. Earlier this year we had a bomb threat and SWAT team at our school sweeping the campus with bomb dogs, causing us to not be dismissed from school on time and having to wait two hours for the go ahead. ALSO, there was a shooting at one of our neighboring schools and a shooting at a near by restaurant all in the year of 2022. Needless to say, a few friends did not find this joke funny. Me included. A different friend, C, was the first to say it wasn’t funny. Which was apparently offensive? Another friend, G, said “I guess we’re not allowed to make jokes anymore.” Which was followed by the original girl saying, “I cant with this generation.” Literally the group chat broke out in a fight. Shit was said both ways. The original girl got upset and compared making “kms” jokes to her joke. Which I see her point, but I don’t think those are comparable? Her joke was about harming other people? Over something our school had no control of, it was our district’s choice. After like an hour of a cat fight, the group chat sorta chilled out. Literally it was stupid how these girls were trying to defend the joke. But I told my sister about the joke my friend had made. My sister knows people who have had their schools shot up, and she has had to deal with threats at her highschool. So immediately she told me to report this girl for the joke she made. I know it was “just a joke” but it was still something completely wrong to say with how our state is looking right now. But I also know this could ruin her life. However, our school doesn’t really care about threats anymore because of how many “threats” there have been. My brother had shooting threats when he was at my highschool, I’ve had to go to school on days when kids said they were going to shoot up my school. I’m conflicted. I think I should keep quiet but my sister and a few other friends say to report her? Would that be an asshole move?
