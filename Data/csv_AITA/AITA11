After he left I sat it down and tried to connect it to my router only to realize ""Wait, I just use my phone now.""

He picked it up today and messaged me around an hour later saying ""Hey man, I appreciate you letting me bring the ps4 over but you lied when you said around 3 were done. 1 downloaded and 2 was a little over halfway done so I don't think I'm gonna be able to rely on you to get stuff like that done anymore."" 

When I tried to explain to him I tried to get it done on my phone he simply said ""You don't need to lie, I would've understood if you just told me you didn't want to do it."" then blocked me.

My dad’s family lives in the US, and we lived overseas with my mom’s family. She was my mom’s friend before she married my uncle. 

She moved here with him after they got married and did not get along w the family. When I moved here for uni before COVID she felt more like family to me than my dad’s family cuz I rly didn’t know them at all. So we spent a lot of time together. 

During midterms I was at my school more than 2 hours away from them and got a text from my sister saying that my aunt blew up at my grandma (F85) in front of the whole family over something stupid. 

My aunt then texted my sister and I asking to let her explain herself and didn’t respect our choice not to get involved in any of it despite us reassuring her that we love her but simply don’t want any part in this. 

I was studying for my exams at the time and had my phone on silent on the bed, and when I went to check it hours later I had more than 60 texts from her about the situation. She had left her husband and daughters and was staying at a hotel in their city. The texts had some really scary context so I screen shotted them all and sent them to my mother(F50) who lives on the other side of the world, brother (M30), and uncle along with her location that we had on for one another for safety reasons. 

My brother told me she had done this before and to not respond as my uncle is headed to her to handle it. 

A week later my cousin (M19 their son) and I were headed back to town, and I had managed to avoid her while dropping him off at their house. I wasn’t as lucky when I picked him up at the end of the weekend. She approached me and asked to speak to me while I waited for him in my car outside their house. She then proceeded to break down in tears in front of me and tell me how much I hurt her and how I let her down and how I know better than to see her as the villain like the rest of the family does. 

I was genuinely terrified. I’m absolutely awful with confrontation and the whole situation had already scared me shitless. I told her she was in the wrong this time and that the situation escalated quickly and unnecessarily. And that she should have spoken to her husband or sister for support instead of a mentally ill girl half her age that was more than 2 hours away in the middle of exam week. 

She just said that I let her down and thanked me for “letting me know I truly have no one in this world” and left my car sobbing.

Mg gf and I (both 29) are from Singapore. Here most of the construction worker and road sweeper are foreigners like Bangladeshi and Nepalese. My gf is kind of racist. She would avoid places with a lot of dark skinned foreigners. She said she doesn't like dark skinned people and would avoid countries like India or Bangladesh because they are dirty.

I tried to change that. Everytime she said something racist, I would tell her (very politely) don't be racist. I told her Bangladeshi/Nepalese came to Singapore to earn better wage. They took on a job that otherwise she wouldn't do.

Yesterday, while inside the train I took a picture of Bangladeshi construction worker digging something under the hot sun. I sent it to her with caption 'Working under the hot sun'.

They always have been to controlling and destroy my self-esteem since I was a kid,so I don't really have a big relationship with them.

However, my mom passed away 8 months ago and his last wish was that her family protect us and see for us, but they been breaking that promise a lot.First of all, they start suggesting that my sister was stealing the money they ""send"" to help us,saying that the heritage my Grandparents left didn't exist and then saying that was ""only for emergency"" (my mom died due to cancer), they start deciding what I'm going to study or were I'm going to study and many things more. 

My sister recently move to another city with her boyfriend and I have to find a job to maintain the house along my dad.My job is far from my home and my shift start at 7:30 a.m., one of my cousins (let's call her Jess)  offer to drop me to work since it was in her way, I accepted and we start making a schedule for the days I changed shift.

So, this week Jess was out of city and asked her sister (let's call her Mary) to drop me off to work all the week. We arrive earlier and start talking a little about my job, before I have to leave Mary ask me if I know when I have a day off, I didn't know so I tell her and that was all.

Yesterday, I'm waiting for them to call me and that never happened, it was 7:20 and any call from them, so I decide to take a taxi for work. That days was 6°C (like 42°F) and it was raining, I have to walk under the rain during 5 minutes until I find a taxi (also my job is a very cold please). I was kinda mad at the end but let it go.

Today, my sister ask Jess if they could drop to work tomorrow and Jess start telling her that I wasn't responding, my sister replied that I was mad because they left me waiting for  yesterday and Jess start telling her that they get confused because I didn't response the message they send, I show my sister that I don't have any messages and that they don't have to lie; so Jess start claiming that I'm making things up and that they know I have a strong personality but that I don't have the right to be mad.

And that was like my breaking point, I told her that they don't have the right to decide if I get mad or why I get mad, that if they are so worried for me they would care when I was freezing yesterday. The she told that they were just doing me a favor and making a lot of sacrifice for me to treat them like this and then they were doing this not for me but because they promise my mom. I explode and told them that they don't expect to see me ever again and that the promise they refer has been broken so many times that they have to beg on their knees in my mother grave.

Later my sister call me and tell me Jess send her a message crying.

I'm glad however that we have a great relationship now.

Onto to the main topic, my second eldest son who I'll call 2nd, moved in with his friend, his friends brother and sister, friends sisters boyfriend and friend brothers friend in a house at Colorado Springs 4 months back. I knew from the get go that it was going to be extremely hard for all of them since this is 6 people with 2 bathrooms, all the boys excluding friends sisters boyfriend (I'll shorten it to FSBF) shared one bathroom, my son had a dog whole everyone there excluding friends brothers friend and FSBF (I'll shorten to FBF) had a cat, in a mid tier crime rate area with 3 nice cars. And only my son, son's friend (I'll shorten to SF) and friends brother (I'll shorten to FB) only had a job while FSBF and friends sister (I'll shorten to FS) didn't have a job while FBF was on injury comp, and they had to pay a grand total of 10k I think? I didn't want to discourage my son however since this is his decision, but I did tell him some alternatives such as getting a place with just SF since it'll cost way way less and be much less of a headache. But to end it off, they did move and while I really did miss him slot, we talked alot over the phone and visited them at least once each month.

1 week ago, my son told me that he couldn't take it anymore and wanted to move back. I didn't ask him why and I respect his decision and he can tell me whenever. So I drove to Colorado springs to pick him up with all of his stuff and his dog. When I picked him up, I saw my son arguing with FSBF and FS but couldn't tell what. He got in my car angry, and didn't ask him what since he'll tell me when he's ready. I drove him home and he hasn't told me yet but I am fine with that.

However, I overheard my son on the phone with FS, she was screaming at him that he needs to pay their side of the rent or else they'll be evicted. I told my wife about and she said that he needed to pay them because we don't know the circumstances there, which could be true, she could ask her brothers to pay. It lead to an argument with my wife and I haven't slept in the bed with her since.

I (15M) don't have any issues with the new vacuum, and I am satisfied with it.

When I told him he complained too much, he objected, saying he was offering ""suggestions"" and that I viewed every situation too negatively. And I confess that I am a big pessimist and have gained a reputation in my family for being a ""nitpicker.""

Her SIL is trying to reach out again, lying about how she was hacked and that she didn’t know she had blocked my sister. But blocked in all her socials? Weird.

She has the right to block her back, but using her sons’ accounts is a little too much IMO. I asked her why she has to go that far and if her SIL did anything really bad. Aside from getting blocked, my sister reasoned that it was also because she didn’t want her kids to be influenced by their SIL’s annoying baby talk. She calls the kids a lot and she doesn’t like it.

That’s pretty much it.

I told her she can monitor her kids talking on the phone and that she can talk to her SIL to confront her about the blocking. But my sister’s making up theories one after another. “What if she thinks we’re okay? What if she visits again whenever she wants? I don’t want her here. She’s still gonna call anyways. My kids won’t listen.”

Instead of just pulling the truth out so she can finally be at peace, she resorts to these so many what ifs. I understand her annoyance of getting blocked, but IMO her kids just shouldn’t be involved, especially since her SIL didn’t really do anything deserving of being completely cut off.

I live around the corner from my ex in-laws (BIL 40m) still. After everything went to shit (his brother having an affair with my friend while I was doing fertility treatment) things got complicated because my ex and I owed BIL money for the house I now own. It got a bit ugly because of the house and ex BIL was being unreasonable/ rude by demanding what was owed despite my ex husband and I not having settled the financial aspect of our divorce.

However, sometimes I’ll bump into my ex BIL in the neighbourhood and I always try be polite but short, especially after everything that happened. The times we have chatted, he has mentioned to me how he sees my little brothers’ car parked on my street sometimes for long stretches at a time. How he sees my friends’ car parked on my driveway sometimes.  He mentioned how my new female tenant comes home around 9:30pm most nights and asked if she goes to the gym as she’s usually in gym wear. I told him “I don’t know as I don’t pay attention.” He states “She drives a white blah blah right?” I told him I didn’t know what car she drives. He will periodically ask me random questions via text and sends me videos of random shit to which I barely respond to. 

Now today, he messaged me and asked if I still go to the gym. I told him yeah. He says “oh really I thought you quit as I don’t see you post gym Instagram stories anymore. How many days do you go?” I said “A few times.”  I got annoyed and felt like he was prying and paying way too much attention to my life and what’s going on around my house when we are clearly not close. He’s not picking up on my short responses as an indication of my disinterest in continuing any sort of relationship with him every time he initiates contact. I decided to make it clear to him where my boundaries are. I texted him this. 


“Look (BIL’s name), I dont have anything against you but we don’t have that type of relationship anymore for you to be creeping around my house and prying into my life. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. I wish you and your family all the best but it’s best for me to minimize contact. I’d appreciate it.”


To which he replied 

“I don't understand what you mean by creeping? I didn't do anything that would warrant you saying that. I just asked if you still go to the gym cause I go to the gym too. Wow chill I'll leave you alone. I'll just message you if I ever need to go-to the basement to grab my items I left inside the closet by the kitchen”
 

I just iterated the general things I just mentioned above. 

To which he replied 

“I just notice cause I walk by that's it we live in the same neighborhood. Yea I'll grab it when I can. I don't know what's gotten into you now, take care”

I (23f) have a good friend (24f) who I've known since high school. We'll call her Kathy. For context, I come from a lower middle class family while Kathy comes from a lower class family. My family isn't rich, but I was fortunate enough to have my parents support me so I can focus on school while Kathy's parents weren't able to do the same so she had to support herself.

I can't remember when it started, but Kathy would make comments about how super lucky I was to have my parents pay for my things. I didn't mind the comments at first, but recently her comments became more passive aggressive and snarky. I just assumed she was stress from trying to find a job after graduating. She would say things like ""I'm glad I didn't have to rely on my parents like (my name) did"" or ""finding a job is hard since I didn't have it easy like (my name)"". She would say these things around my other group of friends and put me in an awkward spot since they would agree with her sometimes.

The other night I was hanging out with Kathy and the rest of our friends, and we were talking about how we wanted to raise our kids in the future. Right away I had an idea of where this was going. Kathy started saying that she was going to make her kids work for their own things and learn how to be independent. I had no problem with what she was saying until she said something like ""people who were given everything by their mommy and daddy their entire life don't know how to be grateful for things and wouldn't survive in the real world""

I immediately responded that my parents supported me and I turned out to be just fine. I'm ""surviving in the real world"" and also repaying my parents through gifts, helping them pay bills, and so forth. Kathy laughed and said that I had it easy my entire life so I had no say in the conversation. That's when I called her out on her passive aggressive behavior and told her that while I do respect her for not relying on her parents, she needs to stop her comments because it's not my fault my parents were able to support me and hers weren't. 

Things got awkward for the rest of the night, and Kathy and I haven't talked since. One of my friend said that my comment was insensitive while another friend said it was okay to call Kathy out since she's been doing this for a while now.

Then his mom bursts out &amp; says ""Ok that's enough, this is exactly what I'm talking about. This is what makes everyone uncomfortable, the touching. Idk what you guys are doing under there…"" bf &amp; I went silent, completely shocked &amp; embarrassed. We couldn't stop shaking, I felt the heat in my face trying to hold back tears. After the waiter came she apologized for her outburst but justified it by saying it was from the POV of a parent. After ordering food I couldn't look up &amp; she eventually calls my name &amp; asks for me to look at her. She tried to apologize but I couldn't hold my tears back any longer &amp; didn't want to cry in the restaurant so I walked out. I was completely sobbing outside, humiliated &amp; annoyed because it wasn't even 5 minutes that we arrived &amp; she’s already making issues. My boyfriend came out to console me, his other parent came out to say we’re gonna take the food to go to eat at home separately. They also ranted saying ""This is what she does, when she doesn't understand a situation she tries to control it""

My boyfriend went back in to see if his mom could explain herself. He also confronted her bc this isn't the first time this has happened where she ruined a major event bc of our affection. She said she was afraid of losing him. When his parents came back to the car his mom said something along the lines of “I just want to say there is nothing wrong with you, this is about how fucked up I am.

Going back to the previous week, we were learning about naming chemical compounds or whatever. I was having a hard time understanding and asked a question, in which she rolled her eyes, sighed, and then tried to explain. Even after explaining, I was even more confused, and I impulsively said ""Why do we even have to learn Chemistry,"" and I think she took offense to this. When she ended up coming over to help me, she talked about how it was in my notes, and I was looking at the notes I thought she was referencing, and couldn't find it, so I asked her about it again, and she showed me where it was on another set of notes. I tried my best to follow along but ended up more confused, but pretended I understood because I knew she couldn't help. In the email I feel like she exaggerated a lot, and my parents were pretty upset.

I also think that it is important to note that I have not met one person who took her class and actually understood what was going on. The few people that understand it are those who are learning from an external source, not the teacher. Most of the kids in there think she is a terrible teacher. Also, I feel like whenever someone asks a question, she rolls her eyes and seemingly thinks that we are stupid and we should know this, which really makes me not want to ask questions. Also, she said that I was disruptive, but there are several others in the class that scream, throw things, and do other stupid things, and they never get in trouble.

Another side note with me is that I have ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, and possible/probable autism (Awaiting doc appt.) I've been really struggling the past week with several things going on in my life, but this is the first time that any of my teachers have had a notable problem with me. I have straight As, EVEN IN CHEMISTRY!!! I try my hardest, and most my teachers love me! I'm also exploring options for after-school help (With a different teacher ofc) and I am pretty upset at this whole situation.

I know that I might have had a negative tone of voice, but I was fed up with that class and the fact that nothing ever made sense and she was just a crappy teacher, so please give me a third opinion. (ALSO: I will appoligize for it b/c I don't want this to affect my grades even though I don't mean it)

His best friend has autism and once he became an adult it didn’t seem like it was good for him to live on his own especially because he had lived with my husband most of his life. They were roommates when we first met but when we got engaged and started looking for houses he moved with us. He’s lived with us for about 20 years now and he has like his own little apartment in the 3rd floor of our house. 

On Saturday night I drove out to do some errands before coming home to pick up my kids and him to go to the show and I called out for him and he didn’t answer so I went up to tell him we would leave in 5 or so minutes. When I went up he was laying in his arm chair motionless and very slow breathing. My daughter called an ambulance for him and they picked him and drove him to the hospital.

My kids and I drove behind to the hospital and debated telling my husband. I voted not to because I didn’t want him to miss out on this huge opportunity that he was having, he was going to walk out at the end of the show and all that. I decided not to tell him until he was done with the show.

 He came to the hospital after and was very upset he wasn’t the second person I called after the ambulance. I understand his anger completely and would be upset if the same thing happened to me but I think he should appreciate that I was trying to think of how important this show was to him and how long he’d been working on it. And that no matter the outcome, his friend was surrounded by his family that love him even without him being there.

My husband said it was wrong of me to make that decision for him and rob him of being there for his friend.

My girlfriend wants a lot of attention

Read the entire post before commenting please 

My girlfriend of 1 year and I have been going happily. We’ve have our ups and downs but overall we’ve been strong. One lingering thing however is how needy she can be for attention. And normally I can give her alot of attention, especially recently, and I give her attention all day every day I can, when I have the energy to because I love her. However, recently Ive started working and it’s made me realize how needy she is. She gets upset on a somewhat regular basis and it’s usually because I won’t give her the attention she wants. And the thing is that despite the fact that work makes me tired, I still give her attention all the time including after work even when I only have a few hours to myself which I also really wanna spend just playing video games and decompressing. However, the few times where I can’t give her attention it leads to her being upset and me apologizing but telling her that I just can’t give her attention all day every day. I have other things I want to do and sometimes I just can’t do it. Just now I’m back from work and she wants to play a game even though I need to decompress from a long work day. I said yes since I knew she would get just as upset if I said no, so we played the game. However, between it being late, me being tired, and having work tomorrow for just as long, I just wanted to play some battlefield and turn my brain off. Because of this I ended up just kinda being low personality with her and she gave up with the game cause she noticed I was out of it anyways but truth is I wasn’t really in the mood to entertain it and I just gave in since I love her and also to not make her upset.

All I know about this friend (22F) is that her and my bf met two years ago at uni. I wasn’t aware of any history between the two, but skimming through this letter, it seems like they may have casually dated/both had feelings for each other at one point. 

I’ve been with my bf for a year, and we’re both in uni together and haven’t ever had big issues. We communicate very openly when spending time with friends of the opposite sex and have never had issues in the past. He hung out with one of his friends (let’s call her Bella) a few months ago and when I asked how it was at the time, he said it was a nice hang out and didn’t elaborate (which he normally does unprompted), but I didn’t think much of it as I trust him. 

Yesterday, I was looking for this box I sent my bf full of letters when we were doing long distance. I wanted to surprise him with more letters (I sent him letters in the template “open when you’re … and I wanted to write some more), when I found a letter in that box that I didn’t recognize. I assumed that all the letters in that envelope are from me so I opened it trying to remember when I had sent him this one and realized it wasn’t from me but dated three months ago. I looked at who signed it and it was from Bella. 

I feel incredibly guilty for doing so but I skimmed through it. I can’t even remember what exactly it said but it started as an apology for having ghosted him, talked about how special the time they spent was, how Bella talked about him to her mother, and it seems that they had some type of relationship that was beyond platonic, and there was (I’m pretty sure) even a confession of “I love you” (I can’t recall for sure because I’m in so much shock). 

I have a pit in my stomach, and I have no idea what to do. Am I horrible for having read something that intimate that wasn’t for me? It’s one thing for a girl you don’t know to have written a five page letter to your boyfriend during your relationship, but it’s killing me to think he didn’t tell me anything about her. We’ve talked about how both of us would be uncomfortable with keeping contact with those we have pasta with, and though it doesn’t seem like they officially dated, am I wrong to expect him to have told me more context with this girl if he was hanging out with her during our relationship? It hurts me that in this special box alongside all my love letters to him, he has a letter from another girl received within the bounds of our relationship. What do I do? Please help

EXAMPLE: My other niece whos small EXTREMELY nice and timid was over to spend the night with my mom (her grandmother) and they invited my 8 year old niece over so she would have someone to play with.

I was already nervous about this considering my 8 year old niece is extremely bossy and doesn't like when people don't wanna do what she wants and my other niece doesn't like bossy people. And so as the day carries on the arguments start.

My mom cant walk very well so I had to watch them to make sure they didn't burn down the house so when I noticed 8 year old niece calling my other niece ugly and saying she had a pig nose I said something because she's really timid and sensitive and doesn't like telling on people (cuz shes so friggin sweet).

So I told her if you don't like it when people talk about you, you shouldn't talk about other people (you know classic kindergarten stuff) and ofc she didn't stop bullying her and so I told my other niece to just ignore her and that she would leave her alone if she wasn't reacting to what she was saying (AGAIN KINDERGARTEN STUFF).

And so 8 year old niece goes and tells grandma who like 8 year old niece more than every single family member she was (pretty sure she would let her own sister die for that child) she tells me to leave her alone and that im ""too old to interfere in kid stuff"" guys...its not like i'm 25 years old it's literally my job as an AUNTIE to help my nieces.

PLUS its common sense shes CRYING i'm not just gonna watch that happen but basically how every situation regarding 8 year old niece goes is ""your too old to be messing with an 8 year old so she's right and you're wrong""

My (21M) gf (21F) have been dating for a bit over 2 months and she recently texted me that she saw me through my parent's window house watching tv.

The thing is that they live a 25 minute drive from me and we recently had a snowstorm making roads hard to navigate. I then told her that it was weird behaviour. She then tried to de-escalate by joking that it was her psychopathic tendencies and that it was a common activity she did with her father. I then told her it was borderline stalker behaviour and that I was creeped out.

Her father in the past has shown disturbing behaviour towards her and her family. However in the last months or so she wanted to rekindle her relationship with her father. I then told her it was incredibly weird behaviour that her father wanted to know where I live and that I wasn't comfortable with the situation. She answered by saying that she and her father often drove around and checked houses of people they knew and that she drove to my friend's house after driving by mine and that it wasn't meant to be creepy.

Myself and my mother are at an Irish bar in NYC. It's not classy, nor is it gross. An average bar. There are no napkins or tissues ANYWHERE available to grab. All of a sudden, I start sneezing. Small sneezes, ones where you make no noise. However, one sneeze makes... a bit of a mess when I bring my hands to my face. I now have my hands over my face holding quite a bit of ""nose goop"". No one is looking or paying any attention. I'm already quite embarassed though. 

I ask my mother to hail the bartender so I can wipe my hands and face before going to the bathroom without any further embarrassment or attention. My mother continuously says no, repeating it over and over. I'm not raising my voice, demanding or being rude. I'm just asking if she would politely hail the bartender as I'm currently holding my hands over my face. After she raises her voice and begins to swear at me, I give up and am forced to go to the bathroom with snot all over my hands and face, unable to clean up beforehand. 

I return and she claims it was embarrassing for ""her"". She says I was being childish and it ""wasn't her problem"". She continues that I shouldn't have asked her to hail the bartender as I cannot pick and choose when I need her help; she ridicules me and berates me for behaving like a child. She is now shouting and swearing at me, almost telling me off like I'm 5...I'm 21.

I am keeping my voice low, refraining from swearing or being rude, or even being argumentative in any way. I say things like ""I was only asking for your help"" and ""anyone else I asked would have just grabbed the bartender's attention"". To which she replies with ""fuck you"" and ""you're a child"". Everyone in the bar is now staring at us. Apparently, comparing this with a similar situation with my friends is inappropriate (same scenario, except I DID ask the bartender for a tissue).

I am now staring at the TV screens at the bar trying to ignore the situation, yet she continues to berate me, swear at me, be extremely unpleasant and cause a big scene, finishing her speech with ""I knew this holiday was a mistake"". The evening ended with us walking back to the hotel in silence.
This was our first conflict of the entire holiday.

So i and my friend 26 F are going to the same university and have same major(post graduate studies) We are pretty good friends more than that actually. She is a great friend and I love her BUT she’s too competitive. FIERCELY competitive. Although we were never at the same class before I sometimes heard her complain about her other friends scoring higher than her. We were just casual friends at that time so I just brushed it off. She was friends with my other closer friend, We got closer while working. After working for almost a year I now know how fierce she is at competing and comparing.. I mean a healthy competition is good but it is on the next  level. I have never been in the same situation before and I feel very uncomfortable about it. She once got mad at me because I completed MY task before her. She doesn’t like anyone to do anything before her. And hates it when seniors gives us attention. Because she is a good friend of mine I was willing to accommodate but obviously other colleagues won’t. She has been complaining about it constantly. I asked her what she did during her college years coz I knew she was not top of her grade and it was another set of never ending complains. At this point I was really annoyed. Before entering our university, We decided to share an apartment and register in the same class. But I wasn’t sure anymore. Being a good friend I confronted her about it and told her to take it easy. Everyone has there own pace and you don’t need to compare with other. She interrupted me and   Told me not to say this to her again because she will be pissed hearing such things. She said that she was fully aware she was wrong but she can’t help but feel that way and promised to try look on the positive side. A month has passed but it’s still the same. I know people don’t change overnight but still I am annoyed. I once asked her if she will get mad if I scored better than her. She didn’t even pause and said yes. I am very troubled by this. I told her that I will not be registering in the same class with her because I didn’t want that comparison between us. She regarded this as a joke. But I really scheduled it different from hers.

So basically I (20) and my mom (43) each have a favorite artist that we consistently go see in concert whenever they go on tour. Everytime that happens we go together and it’s been our little ritual for the past 8 years!! In my case, my favorite artist is Taylor Swift and unfortunately since she never comes to where I live (I live in a small town in Canada), the recent shows have either been out of province or straight up out of country (in the U.S). For your info, we’ve also travelled for my mom’s shows so it has never been just MY shows we would travel long distances for. 

Now here’s the deal. Taylor Swift announced a tour recently and as you may have heard on the news, the whole presale has been a total shitshow. Basically the whole tour sold out during presale, general sale was cancelled and TONS of fans were left empty handed, including me. I was heartbroken at first but have since then decided to just buy resale.

Yesterday I found a face-value priced resale ticket for a show that would be a 9 hour drive. I would be paying absolutely 100% of the ticket (obviously), gas, hotel stay, food etc. But the thing is this is a SINGLE ticket. It’s second row from the stage and would be an incredible experience for me but that means my mom wouldn’t be seated at the same spot as me. So I asked my mom her opinion and she said she couldn’t care less since Taylor is not HER artist anyways and this show is for MY happiness and MY experience not hers. She even said that since concert tickets are so expensive, she could just drive me there (I don’t have my drivers liscence yet) and not even attend the show and that although she would’ve been happy to see me have a good time at the show, it’s no big deal and to save money she doesn’t mind not being at the actual show and just accompanying me through the rest of the experience.

But I’m HIGHLY uncomfortable with this!! Yes sure, I’d be paying for the entire thing but even just having her waste her time and come there with me without actually being able to have her come with me at the show makes me feel awful about this situation! My other option would be to wait it out and hopefully find a pair of tickets to either this show or another one but it’s so hard to find good tickets that are in pairs! I’ve either been finding nosebleeds in pairs or tickets in the front rows but that are not in pair.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4814162,public,self,AITA for having my mom come with me to an out of country 9 hour drive Taylor Swift concert she won’t even be attending herself?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1ix8c/aita_for_having_my_mom_come_with_me_to_an_out_of/,all_ads,6,top,,,,,,

Last year I was the quiet kid and had no friends but I’ve been slightly improving on that this year and have a couple of friends, one of them being S. I also want to add that S is extremely sensitive and cries over a lot of things that don’t matter.

So a couple of days ago, Me, S, and a couple of other friends were eating lunch and S said the C slur (the one that’s used against Chinese people.) This made me uncomfortable because she’s Pilipino so me and my other friend who we’ll call 6,3 said that she probably shouldn’t be saying that. She disagreed with us and said that she could still say it because she was Asian. I didn’t really wanna keep on talking about it so I tried changing the topic and said that she was Asian fishing as a joke. It was completely random and stupid of me, I know, but the way she reacted made it a lot worse, she started yelling at me and crying, while trying to hit me. Another friend of mine, who we’ll call Stink tried defending me by holding her away from me and she screamed at him too, having a tantrum in front of the whole lunch room. I apologized to her but she wouldn’t listen and ran away crying. 

I was really shocked at this because I didn’t think of it as a big deal but thought she’d forget about it by the next day. I was wrong. She sat at a completely different table at lunch, and I found out that had completely changed the story around and told all her friends about it.

I [28M] have a friend Sam [24NB] who I've known for a decade now. We're close but life has gotten us a bit distant for the past few years. Sam is half-black. I am 0% black. We aren't from the USA and don't have that same history in our country. We're both LGBT+ people, and have a small but close LGBT friend group we're a part of.

For most of the time I've known them, Sam has barely used the N word before, only odd times. Other people in our LGBT friend group would only say it if we were quoting someone who said (or sang) that word, never on our own out of the blue. Never the full -ER ending either. Anyway, we used to have this one friend in our group (who I'll call Dana) who was rather liberal with using that word, and she wasn't black. Sam wasn't angry or annoyed by it but they still felt super awkward hearing Dana say it constantly. We tried to get Dana to stop, but she didn't. Eventually, she had a fight with people in our friend group (about something else) and left the group. A week after that, Sam sent a text message to each of us in the group formally asking to not say the N word again. I supported Sam 100% on this, and to this day I haven't heard it said from anyone in our friend group.

Except Sam.

I read online that people who historically might be called an N word are free to use it, and it's their word to use, similar to gay people owning that F word rhyming with ""maggot"". So hearing Sam say it isn't as bad as Dana saying it for fun, but idk, somewhere along the past couple years Sam has been using it a LOT more, to the point of saying it more than that Dana did. I can't hang around Sam for more than several minutes before hearing it, even in text messages too. There's just something about someone using a word CONSTANTLY in your company that you can't use yourself.

On a similar note and what is bringing me to think of the title of the thread, everyone in our friend group is LGBT+, but nobody uses the gay F word. Again, except Sam. I can tell people aren't too fond of hearing that word a lot, so I was thinking of at least bringing it up to Sam to not say the gay F word since convos get quiet or redirected everytime that word is said. And I can ask Sam this because I'm LGBT I have the ability to ask them that without prejudice and stuff.

But can a non-black person like me ask them to also not say the N word? Sam wasn't brought up in ""black"" culture so to speak, so I'm not sure why Sam only started to really say it repeatedly the past 2 years, especially since Sam doesn't have any other black or half-black friends, but it's only now starting to get to me a lot to hear it constantly. I would never say the gay F word in the company of majority straight people. Even if I did, if a straight person asked me not to say the gay F word in their presence because they couldn't say it, I wouldn't take offence to that. Idk if my friend would or not.

22M, I’m in college and traveling back home for thanksgiving. I still have my room at home (thanks mom) and there’s a very nice, new guest room that my parents renovated very recently. Thanksgiving is normally a small affair but my dad decided to invite his mom/my grandma this year. I have anxiety even around extended family that I know and going to my room helps plus I really like my room, I know it’s not gonna be my room for long so I treasure what time I have left there when I’m home from school.

My dad brought up that he invited people and asked/told if that was fine to which I said ok, as long as I have my room still. He said don’t worry and it wouldn’t be a problem with the guest room so I agreed to extra people and to come back home for thanksgiving. Now the day before I fly out, my brother let me know that dad said I’ll be bunking with him while my grandma takes the room (he wanted to keep the guest room open to watch tv in.)

I was upset and texted him to confirm to which he said to me that he never said “my room” specifically just that there will be “a room for me”. In our text conversation before, I specifically said the family nickname for my room to refer to it which he said “don’t worry, you’ll have your (room nickname).” So I know that he knew exactly what I meant and still did it. It feels like he invited me under false pretenses and is now making me feel selfish and immature for being upset about my room when it’s not just about the room, but also him being deliberately misleading and giving other family comfort over my own (kind of a pattern). At the same time, I feel selfish for being upset that my older grandma (60s) gets my room because she does need a good bed which my room has.

She went off to join the Navy, but didn't pass basic so she's floating around home. Lately she's been spending long amounts of time at my house, more accurately my room. I'm very comfortable in my own personal space but for the past month I haven't had access to it and it started to drive me nuts.  


Playing a game at my computer across the room last night, she mentioned something that I couldn't understand. This is a common thing, I have to pause what I'm doing to ask her to say it again. Which normally is alright. I love talking with her. But after a month of that happening repeatedly I started to get annoyed. After I took off my headset to ask her to repeat what she said, she said never mind. I asked again because I genuinely wanted to hear what she was saying, but she said never mind again. Finally I just said ""Alright, fine."" and went back to my game. She started texting my phone, I guess in a way to talk to me without talking to me. Eventually she wanted me to sit with her on my bed because she was upset.  


After a while of talking and her apologizing for things she shouldn't, and my repeated reassurances that she's not doing anything wrong, I finally said: ""We're only 7 months into this relationship, but it's like we're living together. We're only 19, its normal for couples to need space. And I'm kind of losing mine."" Well that set her off, and 30 minutes later after her holding back tears and packing her things, (several clothes of hers she stashed in her clothing area because she's been over so much) she said her parents were picking her up. I said okay, but I'd like to wait with you until they get here. Her parents rolled up in their car and took her home.   


I feel like a lot of these issues will be solved once we both have jobs and she has some friends to hang out with. Because currently I'm her only social outlet.

I’m not including ages to avoid unrelated input. 

My bf and I needed to leave at 3a for a trip. We’re not morning people. Our alarm didn’t go off, he got out of bed suddenly and immediately turns the main bedroom light. A minute later he says that we need to hurry, i drag myself up and go “that was a little rude”. He got pissed. Like throwing his bag around, slamming the door, pissed. I was at a 2, he went to 10. I told him it hurts my eyes, gives me anxiety and asked him not to next time. We got into an argument. He goes “what do you want me to do?! wake you up and then turn the lights on?!” yelling at me. I yell back “YES, you sleep next to me”. i’m very easy to wake, sensitive to talking. 

His side points: • we were running late 
• he wouldn’t have been mad 
• it doesn’t bother his eyes 
• i’m an asshole bc i called him rude when “he wasn’t trying to be” and then later “inconsiderate” bc he couldn’t fathom the curtesy of warning or why i was bothered 

My side points: • it’s vastly uncomfortable and he is invaliding that feeling 
• he could’ve given me a warning 
• i don’t know anyone who is cool with being blinded awake 
• he refuses to apologize at all for it, i’ve apologized for calling him rude and inconsiderate as i believe that was unnecessary of me 
• he’s an asshole bc he said i was “over-reacting” and “trying to start something” and won’t say he’ll try not to 

This shit ruined my morning, i wasn’t trying to start anything. I frequently hold myself back from asking him to ‘keep me in mind’ more. ie also grabbing me a towel when we shower together, saving me food when i work late, parking further up the drive so i have space to park, grabbing my damn toothbrush bc he remembered his RIGHT NEXT TO MINE. I decided that these are all technically my issues and responsibilities. I don’t understand but i’ve accepted that our brains don’t work the same. This morning made me feel crazy

G’s bf’s (M) family were getting rid of him and I really wanted a cat.

I was told that Theo was aggressive and had attacked the new baby biting and clawing it up. 

When we got Theo he came in a too small kitty carrier with a towel that was so caked in cat hair that we had to wash our washing machine after trying to wash it. (We came to the conclusion they had to have kept him in it ALOT as Theo doesn’t shed much). 

Theo WAS aggressive when we first got him, our vet said it was likely because Theo was declawed in the front by his previous owners and was trying to protect himself.

Theo was known to bite and be aggressive from the time we got him in 2017 until years later. Everyone who came over was warned that Theo was aggressive. 

In 2020 I adopted a kitten, Winona, from the shelter. Theodore became a whole different cat with Winona. He doted on her and still does. He claimed her as his baby and became much less aggressive and more playful. He also stopped being as solitary as he had been. 

Back in August (2022) I moved states and moved in with my boyfriend (Z). Yesterday Z’s cousin came over with her baby (S) who is around the age of 2. S was fascinated by Theo and kept following him and wanting to pet him and play, and Theo had no problems with him. Theo let S pet him, touch his belly (usually a sure fire way to get attacked), and didn’t even react badly when S got a little too rough with him(something I corrected by telling him to be gentle). 

I posted on my Snapchat story about how proud I was of how far Theo had come from being an aggressive scared kitty to a sweet older baby. This might be where I’m the asshole. 

I have G on Snapchat, G has always denied that Theo was abused or treated poorly when with M’s family.

It’s been a great time so far and a nice bonding experience with designated rooms. Me and my boyfriend have one room and his step sister (15f) is in the room next to us. 

Let me tell you how creepy it gets. We caught his step sister watching us fondling in the cabins near the main house mid day. We saw this because the door creaked even though we closed it. She then ran away and we got creeped out but thought she didn’t know we were in there and accidentally walked in.

Until on the same night, when we were fondling again around midnight, she started to bang on our walls through her room. Which again, we thought was bizarre and I got quite scared.

Then yesterday morning, me and my bf were conversing about something personal and she repeated it during dinner in a vague way, which no one would really understand without knowing the context. She proceeded to laugh it off but as a whole she is creepy. 

I told his step mother (her mother) and she said that her daughter can be quite “nosy” at times. I informed her of these incidences and told her it was very creepy. 

Her mother told us that it was just her character and to leave her be. “We are making the situation worse” is what she said at last.

I (18f) recently left home for college, but I visit a few times a year. On one of my visits, I learned that my mom (38f) had taken in a homeless kid (17m). He was my sister's friend, and he was kicked out for smoking weed, something my mom doesn't care about. They had all gotten close enough that he was calling her Ma.

I saw firsthand how sweet, respectful, and un-burdensome he was. He made his bed every morning, cleared *my* plate after I ate breakfast, used manners constantly, and knocked before entering every room. He even made sure not to eat my sister's gluten free food (she has celiac disease). 

I visited for a doctor's appointment and to catch up with my family. On the third day, I woke up to yelling and found out she was kicking him out, because he was ""distracting"" my sister, who had a messy room and had fallen behind in her grades. My mom blamed it on him, even though my sister has always had a messy room and bad grades, and she's going through really difficult therapy right now. It was just one of the moods my mom gets in, which is the main reason I left home in the first place.

Secretly, my boyfriend and I started loading his stuff into the back of my car so I could take him to my dorm for a few days. My mom saw, and she immediately went off on me, telling me she'd cut me off her car insurance and phone plan, and get all 3 of us kicked out of my dorm and homeless. She kicked me out of her house, telling me I was uninvited from Thanksgiving and Christmas, and she didn't allow me to go back in for my phone.

We left, but trailed him and managed to take him anyway without my mom knowing. He was a wonderful house guest. My mom ended up mailing me my phone, and when I got it back, I was appalled to find she had gone through my photos, apps, messages, history, and settings, even updating it and tracking my location. I told her that it wasn't okay to do that, and removed the settings. She immediately replied with ""I do what I want. You're uninsured now, and your phone plan ends on the 20th.""

This was a few days ago. I've since bought a new phone plan and insurance, but I'm a part time worker and full time student. I can't afford to do this, and now she's threatening to get my boyfriend and I kicked out of my dorm because he isn't supposed to be there, and she needs leverage to make us do what she wants.

I told my grandma, and she's cancelling a $17,000 loan that was going towards a house my mom can't afford. She's already placed a $150,000 down payment, and she's going to lose it and go bankrupt. (The household, with 4 children to support, makes $120,000 a year, and they're trying to buy a $850,000 house). I feel that getting cut off for trying to help a homeless kid was a fucked up move, and now I can't afford to eat, let alone buy insurance.

He tends to get angry over small details of things and never seems to understand the whole picture or other's perspectives/feelings on issues.

Me (19f), my brother (17m), and my dad (50m) are all going to a warmer part of the country for Thanksgiving this year (my mom and dad split custody of my brother so I usually stick with him for holidays). Because of this and the fact that I am currently at college and a few summer items are at home, I am having my mom and dad pack a few items for me which I am grateful for (I FaceTime, they put it in a suitcase). I have most items, however, there are a few things at home that need to come with as well (swimsuit, beach bag, etc.). Though this has already caused tension with certain items, the one that has caused an actual fight is my tennis racquet.

We spend time in a community where I can usually borrow a tennis racquet, however, every time I do it is never my size, has a weird grip, etc.. I have my own racquet that I use a lot in warmer weather so I thought it would be a good idea to bring it as when I am down there I tend to play A LOT (note: we do have enough room to bring it). My dad said no as it is not a necessity and I was originally ok with that. However, when I talked to my brother later that night, he said he was bringing his and that our dad was fine with it as they had talked about it earlier that day. I later asked my dad why I couldn't bring my racquet and my brother could, and he responded by saying he isn't (he doesn't know I know my brother actually is).

This seems to be a recurring event with my dad where my brother will get/do things (even on the small end like this) and I cannot. If I take offense to these things, I will be told to suck it up and not make a big deal. Though I love my brother, stuff like this is upsetting, even with super small issues like these.

I recently realized that my racquet is actually with me (it is in a corner of my dorm I didn't notice until this morning when originally I thought I brought it home a few weeks ago). This gives me the opportunity to pack it in my suitcase as I know I have room. However, I am worried that my dad will take offense to me disobeying him even though my brother will have brought his anyways.

That being said, I knew he had voiced concerns to his grandmother (my MIL) around the time so I was comfortable being honest. With 10, he hasn’t voiced any such concerns despite my efforts to be obvious. Since they were small, Santa presents were marked with their initials stamped on white card stock on top of red card stock as gift tags. (I obviously made these).  Anyway, as a ‘hint’ to 10, I left the stamped card stock out and his assumption was that I was going to give them to Thomas (their elf on the shelf) to take to Santa.

In all honesty, I didn’t want him to go to school and talk about Santa and get teased/bullied. He’s a smart kid and in the GT program in our district. When I say he’s smart, he blows my mind with what he knows. I really was worried he’d be teased/bullied for still believing in Santa.

Issue is - Max is a prick. I know he's only 16 and he's immature, but good lord... the kid is a complete twat. He's the first one to call others out for a mistake. He's always complaining.

My roomate doesn't have a driver's license or car as they are an international student. The complex we moved into is a bit of a far walk (45min) from campus and is not within walking distance of the preferred grocery store we shop at (Walmart is close but neither of us like going there). However, there is a transit bus that goes straight from our apartment to campus, so it was convenient in that sense. Part of the agreement of us moving in was that I would drive us to the grocery store each week so they wouldn't have to Uber. I was more than happy to accept. 

The trouble is that my life circumstances have changed since we signed the current lease last December. I have been with my partner for over a year and we are hoping to move in together soon. My partner wants to move into a new place sometime in the spring. I do too. But I am worried about leaving my roommate alone in our current apartment for potentially several months until the lease ends next July. I of course would continue paying my half of rent, but all of the furniture in the common spaces is mine (living room, dining room) and would thus move out with me. My roommate will still have a dining space at the kitchen island and all of her kitchen supplies/appliances, but no living room furniture or TV.

I guess I'm worried that I would be the asshole because my roommate might feel like I am leaving them hanging. I could see them being upset that I'm taking most of the furniture away, so they would have to buy all of their own to replace it. Given how little our working stipends are, I'm not sure they could afford that right now. I have considered offering to continue taking them to the grocery store each week until the lease period ends. My partner and a few friends have said that I don't need to offer that or worry about taking away the furniture because I already helped my roommate move twice (no family or friends in the country who could help) and went above and beyond the expectations of friendship. I don't agree because I was raised by a family that prioritized being helpful and giving to others. I'm just worried that me moving out early could put strain on a relationship with one of the few friends I have. 

I've already talked to my roommate about the fact that I will not renew our lease so that I can move in with my partner. However, I haven't pitched the possibility of me leaving early yet.

When we got separated, I rented a different home, took everything that belonged to me, and left. This was a huge thing for me, because he always used to say that the previous house belonged to him, and held it over me when we argued. I didn’t want to be a guest in a home that is supposed to be shared, so I took everything and left. 

Now, when we divorced, we agreed that our daughter would come first before anything, and that she would spend an equal amount of time at both our houses. Of course this didn’t happen.

My dad is still working with some mortgage to pay off. My younger brother is sort of the unspoken taboo in the family.

My younger brother has a degree and Masters from an Ivy League university which he got on a scholarship. Worked in consulting for a few months before suddenly quitting, talking about things being too stressful, not wanting to be part of the rat race etc. That's ok. We were supportive and tried to encourage him until it turns out he didn't really plan on working anymore. He would pick up an odd job (some entry level stuff or part-time gig) every now and then and quit soon after, saying it's not for him, too stressful etc. He has no criminal convictions, no mental illness that we know of.

The reason why he's able to have such a lifestyle is that at the end of the day, he still lives with/off my parents. He eats all 3 meals at home, almost doesn't go out, doesn't have a social life, so you can imagine how little he spends. It's to the point where he wanted to tag along when I brought my parents for their medical checkup not because he cared (he was playing mobile games throughout), but because he needed a free lunch.

We've gone from supportive to shaming to just flat-out ignoring him. My mother will offer him meals if she's cooking for the family but nothing beyond that. I've also made it clear he's no longer welcome when I bring my parents out for meals.

So now, I have bought a bigger house for my family and we are planning to do extensive renovations to it. Wife and I have decided to invite my parents to stay with us. This allows for more care given their increasing mobility issues and also to allow them to sell their house and retire. The elephant in the room is my brother of course.

My dad and I were in agreement that my brother is on his own now, but my mother is hesitant. My brother's first reaction upon hearing the news was to assume that he's moving in with me. That all changed once he found out and he accused me of trying to punish him for his lifestyle choices, stating that he was happy and comfortable and I had to ruin it all for him. I told him that the renovations would be done earliest end of next year so that was enough time for him to get his shit together.

I thought all was done and settled until my mother presumably started getting cold feet and thought about keeping the house till my brother is self-sufficient. She also asked me to consider letting my brother move in and to use my contacts/network to get him a job, all of which I declined. When he left his first job, I was able to ask some friends at another bank to set up an interview for him but he ghosted that. I am no longer willing to help or do anything that will put my reputation at risk. My mother has now changed her tone and is accusing me of being extremely cruel to my brother.

I was anxious because we had a bunch of friends over and I was already dosed up on what we were all planning to take that night (let’s say a nice dose of wine). My girlfriend was very late and I was in a rush to get her downstairs to dose up since this wine takes about an hour to hit.

GF and I were wearing these cute matching shirts and our friend wanted to get a picture of us. We were already a couple stairs down when they grabbed my gf to keep us from going down any further. I held my hand out and said, “we can do a picture after she takes her dose, we have all night!” or something to that affect.

They then lashed out and smacked my hand that I was holding out (which was holding my vape mod) and smacked the mod to the ground and it tumbled down the stairs. It had little damage, but has been short circuiting frequently since then. I don’t respond well to physical aggression, which I have previously expressed to this friend more than once. As soon as they smacked my hand I lashed out in response and smacked the phone they were trying to take the picture with out of their hand. The phone was previously cracked (across the whole screen, but only a couple cracks) but it cracked a lot more due to the fall from my knocking it down.

It is now months since this event and this friend is planning on doing a trade-in to replace their phone as the cracks cause a “ghost touch” in the top corner of their screen. They’re asking me to pay in full to replace their phone screen ($140).

I’m having a hard time with this because it’s a friend and I don’t want what happened to ruin our friendship.. but at the same time: THEY struck first after I had already voiced my non-consent and their phone screen was already cracked, (from a simple google search any crack reduces trade-in value the same, no matter the size).

EXAMPLE: My other niece whos small EXTREMELY nice and timid was over to spend the night with my mom (her grandmother) and they invited my 8 year old niece over so she would have someone to play with.

I was already nervous about this considering my 8 year old niece is extremely bossy and doesn't like when people don't wanna do what she wants and my other niece doesn't like bossy people. And so as the day carries on the arguments start.

My mom cant walk very well so I had to watch them to make sure they didn't burn down the house so when I noticed 8 year old niece calling my other niece ugly and saying she had a pig nose I said something because she's really timid and sensitive and doesn't like telling on people (cuz shes so friggin sweet).

So I told her if you don't like it when people talk about you, you shouldn't talk about other people (you know classic kindergarten stuff) and ofc she didn't stop bullying her and so I told my other niece to just ignore her and that she would leave her alone if she wasn't reacting to what she was saying (AGAIN KINDERGARTEN STUFF).

And so 8 year old niece goes and tells grandma who like 8 year old niece more than every single family member she was (pretty sure she would let her own sister die for that child) she tells me to leave her alone and that im ""too old to interfere in kid stuff"" guys...its not like i'm 25 years old it's literally my job as an AUNTIE to help my nieces.

PLUS its common sense shes CRYING i'm not just gonna watch that happen but basically how every situation regarding 8 year old niece goes is ""your too old to be messing with an 8 year old so she's right and you're wrong""

AND NO IM NOT BIASED I'm a FAIR person the only reason people say I'm always on the other kids side is BECAUSE she's always the person in the wrong i know it's hard to believe but this is so TRUE

Some bg info, I'm 21, college junior, and my mom died last year so since then I've been living with my uncle and his wife. Never been super close to them at all growing up. Mom and uncle had conflicts so he was never really an active part of my life till recently, and the wife is well rumored to be two-faced (tbh I've seen it myself and there are also some family stories of what she's done). 

Also, I have the apartment that my mom and I shared and its much closer to the school I go to. I'm now the only person on the lease and I'm also paying rent there. According to my uncle, I'm not allowed to live back in my apartment until I graduate, but there's a lot of work that needs to be done there.

My mom dying hasn't been the easiest for me and I'm still having trouble connecting and feeling comfortable with my aunt and uncle despite them being really pushy about wanting me to be comfortable and communicating with them. I fully admit that in general, communicating is a weak point for me and it's something I'm actively working on. I've made progress with friends, but with my family, it's a completely different story. I still don't understand why they push so hard for me to open up about things I'm not comfortable with sharing. I've even told them this but I'm hit with the ""family comes first, family should know everything"" talk.

Main issue is this, recently, I've been overwhelmed with schoolwork and having my first job at the same time so I haven't been able to call them as much and haven't had the time to return many calls (mainly my aunts). I have however texted and called my uncle a few times to let them know that I'm completely fine, just overworked. Today I called my aunt back a few days before thanksgiving break and she completely stonewalls me. Keeps the conversation to a bare minimum, and it's clear that she's not interested in talking to me at all. She's done this before, she usually stonewalls me right before letting me have it but this time I just got straight-up animosity. Not even giving me the chance to really explain what's been going on besides letting me say that I've just been busy.

I know where I messed up in not sparing a few minutes to call them more often but I've just been working this whole time. Taking care of my mom and dealing with her death put me a semester or 2 behind so I've been trying to pick myself back up and learn more about independence.

My son was found dead from an obvious overdoes October 23rd.  While it is still suspect I cannot even get past it.  Three weeks and two days later my mother passed.  Yes, we were expecting this to happen, but could not predict it.  My daughter asked me to watch my youngest granddaughter because she wanted to gather up my son's belonging with the Sheriff where he was found.  My heart aches for him.  However, during this time I told her I could not commit to watching my little one, as my mother was in her last few days.

My  mother passed on a Tuesday and my sister and I had only 3 days to put together a service for as, we did not want it to go into the Thanksgiving season, and allow family members  to attend.  While we set up the funeral home, we still had much to do, in little time.

Being the eldest of our family (for our parents) I felt that it was my duty along with my sister to put something together for our mother.  We knew her request and did the best we could.  Scrambling to get her celebration and viewing together, we only had two days.  With my son, I had a week and was able to delegate some of what was to come  out.  He had no insurance, and it was a shock, while my mother did and we knew it was coming.  However, we did not know when.  Because my son's passing was suspect, my daughter and daughter in law tried to meet up with the Sheriff handling the situation.    The two of them bullied me and said that I was not compassionate about my son's death because I could not commit to watching the youngest grandchild so they could get his belongings.  I told them from the beginning that I could not commit as my mother was in her last days.

We plan on going to a state about 12 hours away for thanksgiving every year. We borrow a family members van and pack a family of four in it. We stay with my sister in law and her husband. She is the kind of person that has to be the center of attention yet at the same time is an airhead so I can’t stand to be around her. She’s just fake and tries so hard to be act like some rich celebrity that she’ll never be. I told my wife that I don’t want to go about 24 hours before we were supposed to leave. I was supposed to tell her earlier but the timing was never right. We work opposite hours. If I go, I will be giving up about $1900 at work and spending 6 days on this trip.",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4814069,public,self,AITA for not wanting to spend a week with my sister in law,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1i4xr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_a_week_with_my/,all_ads,6,top,,,,,,

In school she didn’t talk to me until my late teens. When she broke up with her first boyfriend. 

We’ve had the most amazing relationship ever since. Fast forward 9 years Until she met this new guy, very quickly moved in and have a child within 1.5 years. Since being with him she’s never really left the house unless it’s with him. However she let me stay with her for a few months and helped me move all my stuff to a new city. 
however when she fell pregnant everything became about her, she hadn’t visited me once. She’s told me I can’t go her to about our past anymore. 
And feels as If I’d be nothing without her and holds it against me that she’s helped me out.  I feel like I’ve had to jump through hoops just to stay in touch and she somehow feels like I need her more than she needs me. 
I haven’t met her child yet because she’s done nothing but make it difficult when I’ve tried to arrange a visit. 
I’ve given us some space for a month and explained how I felt and she’s cut me off completely when I tried to explain how I feel. She told me she hasn’t got time for a back and forth with me, after me asking how she is, she gave me her perspective and so I gave mine. 
I feel used. 

She feels like I’ve been half arsed about my nephew. She’s asked me to be her birthing partner at one point and then all of a sudden I’m being tossed to one side. After I’ve sent gifts, and been to visit her so many times drug her pregnancy. I’ve done so much for her to but would never her use it against her. 

I feel hurt and so does she.

My aunt (Susan, 46 female) Came home yesterday to congratulate my sister on her straight A's, but it happened that Arielle was over. Susan asked the couple if they were best friends, to which my daughter replied ""No, shes my girlfriend"".

Susan snapped. She began screaming at them saying stuff like ""you are a failure to god"", to even ""There is a very nice guy in my church, Im going to present you to him"". When my sister tried to protest and tell her she is lesbian, Susan screamed even more. 

I went to the supermarket, so when I arrived and heard the screaming, I rushed into the living room to find Sophie in tears and Susan screaming at Arielle.

I asked what was happening and Sophie told me. I said to Susan; ""Leave and never come back, you bitch."" She had a shocked expression in her face when she called me a whore and left shutting the door.

I told my boyfriend about this and he thinks that I should have been more calm and try to explain to Susan that how Sophie identifies is none of her buisness, so I feel bad.

She had people In throughout the night that looked methed out and mostly young teens when she was well into her 20s.

We live in a decent place but smoke and smell would pore into our living room stinking the apartment up and making my son cough. I Asked them nicely to please smoke on there balcony and pleaded my sons case , just to have the door slammed in my face. Well little did she know the landlord is a close family friend so I called him, he warned her. So then she it out for us and would have her kids stomp up and down the stairs . Smoke with the door open. Play music and her son would play guitar with the door open. He still dint mention to her that we were close and after she kept smoking and the landlord came and told her she needs to be out in a month. Now the trouble begins, she screamed at us through our door at night , same antics but louder. Then I caught one of her crackhead friends started messing with my trunk , confrontation happens. Cops get called before a brawl happens as me and dude are in each other's faces after he lit a cigarette in the hallway ontop of what just happens. She post pictures of my son on social media. She eventually leaves and all neighbors are happy, just felt bad about kicking her and her children to the curve , but did I even have a choice?
