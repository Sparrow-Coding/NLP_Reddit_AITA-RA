Still, he's trying to help buy them stuff, but with Charlene now in an expensive college and Sara saving up for a car, I'm doing the brunt of their gifts, and also buying something nice for Gracie. 

Now David has much more money than I do. He's pitching in for my three girls, as we agreed upon. However, he was appalled that I said that I'm not buying anything for his daughter from a previous relationship, Mackenzie (4F). 

Unlike my daughters, Mackenzie doesn't primarily live with us- she lives with her mom. Both her mom and dad have plenty of money to buy her something nice. 

He also suggested that I not spend as much money on my girls if that's what it takes. He claims that I don't have buy anything expensive, and that I could take a few dollars for her- but then I'll be criticized for not spending enough on her, I'm sure. 

Despite me not having much- and already having three girls at critical stages in their lives- David is mad that I couldn't buy his four-year-old something.

My fiancee, ""Camille,"" and I have been together for almost 5 years. We actually got engaged a few weeks ago, and I am so excited to marry her. 

When Camille and I started dating, my mum did not like her. She couldn't even pretend to tolerate her. She would incorrectly pronounce Camille's name and then claim that it was too ""ethnic,"" make fun of Camile's accent and yell, berate, and insult Camille for no reason. Because of this, I didn't speak to her for a year. 

After blocking her out for a year or so, my mum apologized and started acting a lot nicer towards Camille. It took us a bit of time to accept her apology, but it's been okay ever since. 

When we reconciled, my mum started to learn French to ""connect with Camille's culture."" It's a nice gesture; my mum has been learning French for about a year and she's slowly improving. Camille is from Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). 

About a week ago, Camille and I invited our families for dinner at a nice restaurant to celebrate our engagement. It was Camille's parents and her brother, my sister and her partner, and my parents. Camille's parents speak very little English, and no one in my family, speaks fluent French. We knew there would be a bit of an awkward language barrier, but I thought everything would be alright. Camille, her brother and I could act as translators and my mum knows enough French to hold a simple conversation. 

It was, at first. 

Camille's mum was making a toast. Her English is not very good, and she kept looking at Camille for help. You could tell that she was trying. I thought it was a sweet gesture. 

Camille's mum makes a small mistake and my mother starts immediately bursting out in laughter. Everyone stops to look at her, and she starts insulting her (Camille's mum) in French. Camille's family looks shocked. Even I was left speechless. 

Camille's brother makes an ""under-the-breath"" comment about how my mum's French is atrocious. My mum, when she hears this, starts ranting about how righteous she is for learning French when they (Camille's family) couldn't learn English. 

At this point, I'm disgusted. I stand up and tell my mum to leave the table.

It was very awkward after that. 

Later that night, I sent my mum an invoice with her portion of the bill. I had already paid for everyone's meals that night, but I wanted my mum to reimburse me for her food. Not only had she spent the most (by a ridiculous margin), but she also embarrassed me in front of my in-laws and I wanted her to pay. 

My sister thinks I'm being extremely petty and wants me to let it go.

We became friends in college and are still friends today. I don't want to say I am over the friendship because of a cat, but I think if we don't stop being roommates soon the friendship might end over a cat.

J got a cat the first year we started being roommates. I have never lived with a cat before, and thought it wouldn't be a big change, and said I would support her getting the cat as long as she cleaned the litter box out every day and would keep him from destroying stuff. 

She got the cat, R, when he was a kitten. She cleaned out his litter box every day for about a month. Then it was every other day. Then longer. Now I think she cleans out the litter box about once a week. Sometimes I need to ask her to do it because the litter box smells really bad. We live in an apartment and she she puts the littler box in the kitchen/living space, even though she has her own room, own bathroom, and own walk in closet. I have asked her to put the litter box in one of her private spaces but she refuses, because when she leaves for work she closes her doors so that R is contained in the kitchen/living area. It took years for me to convince her to at least get a litter box that has a lid so that the smell is slightly more contained and so that I and guests don't have to see the cat droppings while we eat food. Now because of the lid on the box R will often drag litter out of the box and around the apartment. I sweep up litter almost every day. There is even litter all over my couch.

R has destroyed all of my furniture. When I graduated college my dad got me new, nice furniture as a gift. R has scratched up the couch and often drags litter onto it. R has torn up the box spring to my bed so that he can hid in it. R has torn up my chair and my foot stool. R is obsessed with water and has knocked over a glass and ruined a book collection that to replace would cost 100s of dollars. R also knocks over water bowls, so sometimes you just walk into puddles of water, and it isn't good for the floor. Anytime I have asked to be reimbursed or for something the cat has ruin to be replaced, J just tells me that's part of living with a cat and that I should know better. She has never offered to replace anything or even apologized that her pet ruined something that wasn't hers. 

I try to keep the cat out of my bedroom as much as possible but sometimes he slips in.

Also I work better hours than my roommate and end up cleaning up and feeding the cat multiple times a week. 

So aita? Do I actually have too high expectations for living with a cat? Is it just a thing where I don't like cats? Or is my roommate a lazy cat owner?

This year, I’ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me.

We split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can’t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I’m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see.

I asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won’t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.
Mid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him.

He said that he thought I wasn’t being serious and told me there’s no way he’d do 100% of chores because he’s working too. I said fine, don’t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That’s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don’t make much mess anyway.

He wasn’t happy but dropped it.

We haven’t seen each other much because I’ve been working so much but he’s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores.

He said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office.

He called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn’t have time for arguing and went back working.

He stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn’t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him.

I have my works Christmas night out coming up.  It is about an hour's drive from where I live and I will be drinking, so I can't get back.  I booked a hotel room in the area for the night.  Everyone else lives local bar a couple of people.  

I'm a massive lightweight with alcohol and this is a big drinking crowed.  I'm very paranoid about saying or doing something stupid.  So I thought great you have a room, you can check in early, unwind, join the others and then when I think it's time for me to leave I can just retreat to my room and feel sorry for myself in the morning. I'm someone that really like my own space.  On Friday I saw my team in the staff room and was ambushed ""you have a hotel room don't you?  We are telling Ben to not worry about getting home and just crash with you"".  I felt really uncomfortable because it was like the entire team had decided this and I was put on the spot.  I think I must have come across quiet negative to it, just replying ""well if it comes to that I'm sure I wouldn't stop anyone crashing on the floor"" (room is a small single btw).

Today I got messages from Ben saying he had booked a room for the night close to mine.  Random to message me that and I think it must be because he picked up on my vibe.

I just feel like I look like an a hole to everyone now and that I should be like of course everyone is welcome to stay in my room.

We are both in our mid-20's, close to or at the point of being starters and being done with university.  


I think it's important to point out - I'm a local and she's an expat. We've had quite a few arguments in the past where I'd conclude that the source of the issue is our cultural difference, and the inability to (at first) grasp each other's customs and worldview. In addition to that, she's highly sensitive and I'm usually not  


  
This afternoon, I was on the phone with my father, with my girlfriend in her studio. During the call, she suddenly let quite a big one rip. Quite unusual for her, as usually, she tells me to stop being such a pig and such (you know how it goes) as a joke. 

&amp;#x200B;

So while on the phone with my dad, who she knows and is very friendly to, I make a comment about the fart. My dad laughs for a second, and that's it. After the phone call, she seems upset and I walk up to her, telling her it's okay (as my dad laughed about it as well, it was a quick joke, forgotten about in seconds). She continues being mad, actually not responding to my attempt at conversation (from my POV), and continues scrolling her phone and occupying the whole couch (so not giving me an opportunity to sit down next to her).   


As I was supposed to leave afterward anyway, I get my stuff and she starts becoming more upset. We have an argument, in which she mentions that I should have just consoled her right away and apologized instead of ''defending'' my comment. At the very end of the argument it becomes clear that this is clearly a cultural difference. What seems innocent to me actually ''hurt her pride'', no matter what my dad would think, and harmed her. She said I'm acting too rational and not considering her emotions enough by not consoling her right away.   


  
In my opinion, it's an innocent joke, and if she's angry about it, she should tell me why it makes her angry instead of just stonewalling me for a few minutes and being angry. I have no reason to take responsibility for her emotions (I think this is the key point in the argument) within reason, and she should be clear what exactly she is mad about, as otherwise it's very easy to just use ''I'm angry/sad'' as an excuse to get me to admit fault and be on my knees every time something happens. I understand I ''invalidate'' her feelings by saying it's okay and not a big deal, but is there any other way I can convey that it's extreme to react this way to such an innocent joke?

&amp;#x200B;

It's quite a small, stupid altercation but actually quite defining for our relationship. We've been running into similar issues and I think it's actually a pretty big difference in values that causes quite a bit of harm to the health of our partnership.

Jack then came over to me and said “is it okay if my friends come over and play this game with me” I said of course! I’m not gonna bother you guys, i can be in the other room doing my own thing.

Mind you he didn’t even ask me to join them. He just asked me to leave and then at the end he said i can come back in a few hours when they’ve left.

So i did just that. I was getting ready to leave and stay with a friend to later come back. He then told me his other friend wanted to bring his GF (it was his first instinct).

When my BF told me this i told my bf “this guy seems to be a much better boyfriend…unlike you just throwing me out, at least he wanted to include his GF you didn’t even try” He called me an asshole and i left.

After a year I moved country and after a few months she asked if I wanted to sell my car as it’s just collecting dust at home. She said she would put the money into an account so that when I next want to buy a car, I have this money.
I agreed and the sale went through, that’s the end of that. 

Fast forward 2 years, I’m preparing to move country again, March 2022 I asked if when I get to Canada, can I take this money out to buy a car, she agrees.

Today, I ask about getting the money and she says “when I said it would go into an account I meant I would pay off the finance first and you can have whatever was left” (£1000) 

I’m a bit angry at her cause I’m planning on buying a van to travel around in, and was totally relying on this money for the van. She knew this. 
If she has known for 2 years that I was only getting a fraction of the sale money, why wasn’t she honest about it?
I could’ve been saving slowly over the 2 years for this.
Even in March when I asked to use the money when I move, she said all good. 

Now I’m living in a tourist destination where cost of living is crazy high, so there’s no chance I can save up money now.

Tonight we were going to celebrate my birthday a week in advance since I won't be here on my birthday so we were going to have a nice family dinner. My younger brother (M19) was very reluctant to be there and he complained about the food. This turned into an argument about him and his reluctance to help around the house and reluctance to do his chores. He pays a very low rent and thinks that he therefore can skip doing anything he doesn't want to do. He also knows our parents won't kick him out so he gets away with everything.

When he left the kitchen I told my parents that they need to do something about him. They complain about him to me all the time and I am tired of hearing about it when they refuse to do anything. My dad got mad at me for ruining dinner and told me that I'm being immature because I don't just fake happiness and ignore everything that bothers me. I asked him to clarify and he said that the definition of ""mature"" to him is an ability to fake happiness and pretend as if everything is fine when you are in a social setting. 

He then went on to say that crying is illogical (I was crying at this point) and immature because if you can't do anything about it there is no reason to cry. I asked him if he'd cry if I died and he hesitated too long before he said yes. And I asked him why and he said that if someone close dies it's just different and didn't elaborate further. I told him that he's a shitty father for discouraging showing emotions and speaking out when something bothers you. 

I realize that it wasn't the best timing for this argument. But I still feel like I just had to say something because I am so fed up with the passive aggressiveness that is present in every conversation I listen to at the dinner table.

I’ll call her Rachel. Rachel and I really hit it off from our first date and talk daily. 

Rachel is a single mother with a 2 year old. We both work in careers.

For the past 2 weeks or so we have attempted to make plans for a date. 3 different times Rachel has initiated the date, asked me to plan to come over, and 3 different times she will have a reason to cancel the date. 

I work a full time job and I’m exiting the corporate world to run my own company, it’s also a 45 minute drive for me to meet with Rachel. I can’t just meet her whenever she’s free because I have to plan accordingly due to my schedule and generally need a few days notice. I can make myself available but with employees, it’s not so easy. 

The excuses why Rachel cancelled have been:

1) She has a flight out the next day and needed to clean the home. She initiated the invitation. 

2) She had a last second meeting with her non-profit and had to cancel. 

3) Her child got sick. 

This last instance with her kid happened and she cancelled that morning. 

I told her that her child is her priority and she needs to take care of her kid but that this is starting to become a pattern of her making plans and then cancelling. I told her that if she wants to date me, that we both will need to compromise to see each other but I can’t keep making plans with her if she’s going to cancel over every little thing that happens in her life. 

Of course, I said this when she’s been up all night tending to her sick kid and she retorted that it was incredibly selfish of me to say that. 

She ends up sending this text to me saying that there are 1500 men lining up to see her and that a man needs to earn his place in her life before she will compromise on anything. 

I ended up apologizing because I initially acknowledged it was bad timing of me to say what I said but I don’t think I was necessarily unreasonable for asking her to keep her word on plans she makes with me. It just so happened that the excuse this time was her child (a legitimate excuse but still).

Further, I think it’s telling that her reasoning is that “there are 1500 men in line” as a response to a concern I raised. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

I work days, so at this time of year we hardly see each other, its not easy.  

Yesterday I came home from work early,  with the flu (coughing, sneezing, aches, fever). but I got to see my husband when I otherwise wouldnt. It felt good when he kissed my head and gave me a hug before he left.  At 1am I woke up sweating from the fever coming down so I took a shower, hoping it would help me feel better, it did. then let our dog out briefly  (our yard is fenced so no need for a walk).  I let him back in after 5 min and I was hit in the face by the fresh stench of skunk.  So I corner the dog in the bathroom and proceeded to scrub him.  Since I was stuck in a small enclosed space with the smell my body started reacting in a way to signal me to get out: eyes watering, throat constricting, lots of coughing.  I finished the bath, dried him off and proceeded to clean up the bathroom.  The residual burning in my throat and lungs made it hard to fall asleep because I kept having coughing fits.  So while I was laying there, trying to calm my breathing I texted my husband to tell him, about the whole ordeal.  It had been nearly 3hrs since my shower, I was exhausted and I wanted him to know why I wouldnt be awake like normal when he got home.  

He didnt see the text.  He came into our room when he got home and started talking to me like it was any normal morning?""  I told him to check his texts as I rolled over and put a pillow over my head.  I thiught it would be obvious (knowing Im sick, seeing the pillow over my head) that I wasnt ready to wake up.  instead he turned on the lamp and TV and left our room to go find his phone.  This irritated me, I really needed more sleep.  He returned to our room lauging, wanting to hear all about it.  I started crying and said i just need sleep.  He told me to lighten up. instead of having a conversation I had a temper tantrum that ended with me leaving the room to go find somewhere else to sleep.  This made him feel bad so he came and got me and told me to get in bed and he'll, just go sleep on the couch ""even though he has to work again tonight""  I realize he is now mad.  so I make him talk to me since we cant again for another 24 hrs.  He said sorry for waking me up and the noise but criticized me for not having the ability to just laugh things off, said something about it being because I'm a middle child and not developing a sense of humor.   He said it was shitty for me to make him feel bad when he didn't know how bad it was since he didn't read the text before coming home, and I need to learn to laugh to lighten the mood when things are hard and out of our control.

I (F23) started working at a reference lab after graduating with my bachelor's. My coworkers were lovely, and the one I had the most interest in was Tom (M26). He was polite, really helped me not to feel like an idiot at my first professional level job, and importantly here rather lean. Tom went together with the other techs to drink on Thursdays, and I asked to come along. We had drinks, we talked, and it was pretty nice. This kept up for a few months, and I developed feelings for him. I asked him out, and he seemed a bit hesitant, but he did agree to go out for coffee.

The coffee date went well, and a week later we went for brunch. He admitted that he liked me, but he wasn't sure how much further he wanted to take this. He showed me a photo from a few years ago, and he was very, very obese. He was 340 pounds, and honestly a little disgusting looking. I didn't believe him at first glance, but he assured me that was him.  He told me he didn't want to be 'a big bag of lard anymore', but is still having trouble moving past that point in his life. I assured him that was behind him, and that he did great to get this far, and Tom seemed happy with that. We continued dating, and I can't remember anything being terrible at all.  

Eight months later, we're at his apartment, and things get frisky. This is the first time I see him without his shirt, and I'm not proud to admit it was pretty unsighly. He had stretch marks under his arms, on his stomach, he was sagging in places and his skin was pretty loose at some points. He wasn't like a damp sack, but it was like cuddling an old man. I hadn't thought about his picture up until now, but it kind of killed my mood then and there. I said I wasn't feeling that great, and Tom put his shirt back on and put on a movie.  

A couple days later I wanted to talk. I told him that he was a great guy, but I didn't think it was going to work. He asked why, and I was just honest with him, and that he just wasn't very attractive like he was. I know he let his body go, and he worked hard to get where he was, but I just couldn't get past that. He kind of just left, which was fair I guess.  

It's been a few weeks, and Tom doesn't really talk much anymore. He's not mean, but he only answers questions about the job. He stopped going out on Thursdays, and the group kind of dissolved. No one's said anything to me about it, but nobody really smiles when they see me. I'm feeling unwelcome.  My friends are on my side, but my mom thinks I could have worded it better. I probably could have, but I really think I'm entitled to like what I like, and I don't think I should have to apologize for my personal preferences. I feel like I'm being guilted about this.

I’m fine with that, and I’m pretty open about my problems too. for backstory to this, most all of the people in my family are homophobic, my parents are divorced, a ton of pressure is put on me to keep everything working for everyone in my family, and my parents fight all of the time, putting further pressure on me. Now again, I share this openly.

Continuing to the story itself though, I was at a friend of mine’s house. They didn’t explain anything to me on how to act around their family, so I was just open and nice like I normally am in these situations. I talked to a lot of their family and they were all very nice. My friend seemed agitated while I did but I’m bad with social cues and they had a lot of history in not explaining things even when I made an effort to understand, so I didn’t say anything to them. Once we were alone away from their family, they started complaining a lot to me. I was very receptive about it like I normally am and just let them talk. They told me that their house was very “quiet,” that they didn’t really talk to each other and that was why they were weird about it earlier. they were then upset with me because I didn’t sit and tell them how horrible that was. They complained to me, knowing I have family trauma, about how “nobody ever says it’s that sad” when they tell them about it, and got mad that I didn’t either. 

they’re still upset with me because I didn’t respond how they wanted, even though they didn’t tell me to do anything, and I’m openly bad with social cues and need them to tell me what they want from me.

Before this job is worked at a 4* hotel as a kitchen porter (I was supposed to also be front of house but they kept giving me excuses as to why I had to stay in the kitchen full time) and it was the hardest time of my life. I went deep into my depression, cried myself to sleep over it and actually made myself physically sick over the anxiety of going to work. I finally quit and got my current job in a different field.

I considered the Christmas night out as I had no negative feelings towards anyone working there, then I found out it was hosted at the hotel I worked at. I didn't fully write it off at first until I remembered all of the things I witnessed there which made me never want to eat their food.

I also now have very negative views on most of the women going and everyone I truly get along with refuse to go as well so it would be very uncomfortable and it's the complete opposite idea of a good time for me.

Thankfully I have a trip to Berlin when they booked it for but the best part is my boyfriend is still a server at the hotel.

She was really focused on guys most of the trip, but I wasn't &amp; made that clear. One night she got to flirting with a guy and he and his friend invited us for drinks. I didn't really feel like going but she didn't want to go alone, so I said fine. Afterward, they offered to show us around the city. I didn't want to, but she did, so again I agreed.

They offered to drive (a small two-door car). We both got in the back. I'm claustrophobic, so I started having a panic attack and kept saying get me out. The guys did, and I took a minute to catch my breath. My friend didn't even seem to realize what was going on. The guy she liked offered to sit in the back instead - I asked if she was ok with it and she said no. So he said he'd take his own car.

While we were waiting on the sidewalk, she asked me to look up the emergency number there because her phone's battery died. I was confused &amp; asked her why, and she said just do it, so I said ok I will but why, she got annoyed and said ""I'll do it myself"" as she tried to grab my phone from my hands. My natural reflex was to pull my hand back and she got pissed and stopped talking to me. I told her that if she doesn't feel safe then why the hell would we leave with them? And that we should just go. I looked up the number and told it to her, but she still insisted we go with them, and then in the car told the guy ""Drop ME off at the hotel so I can charge my phone."" At the hotel, she invited them into the lobby to have coffee.

After they left, she went off at me saying I was being a shitty friend, that she couldn't rely on me or feel safe with me because she didn't have access to my phone if she needed it. I was annoyed because she didn't make any sense - we had plenty of chances to leave them.

It was a horrible night but I still apologized that I made her feel she couldn't rely on me. I'd like to add that she continued to text with the guy the rest of the trip and meeting other guys.

On another day, her phone died again and mine was at low battery. She asked me to use it to take photos &amp; I gave it to her. She was walking around with the camera on, so I said can you try to conserve the battery and she basically threw the phone at me, yelling at me that I was acting like a bitch that was possessive of her phone and that she doesn't want anything from me. She demanded I apologize and this time I said no because I didn't do or say anything hurtful while she was the one calling me a bitch. For the sake of the trip, I made up with her but honestly just felt like going home.

After the trip was done, she said it was the trip of a lifetime despite our ""small arguments"" and wants to plan another one.

Our family dynamic is a little different. I’ve been in the girl’s life since she was 5. Her bio dad has another family, I know that is hard on her. She calls him by his name and calls me dad. Her father and I don’t get along, I truly believe he thinks I turned her against him. Now that’s been said, I don’t see much of her bad behavior. The things she’s done and said have been told to me by her school, mother, and even the police. I don’t dismiss these claims, I know something is going on with her. 

The day after Thanksgiving I flew out of town on business. My wife was dreading me leaving, since it seems I’m the only one that can calm my stepdaughter down when she’s upset. My wife had been dealing with the brunt of things, so I understood when my stepdaughter was sent to stay with her dad while I was gone. I arrived back on Wednesday, my stepdaughter was blowing my phone up to come get her early. The original plan was for her to stay with him until this weekend. Her dad, my wife agreed so I picked her up right after leaving the airport. 

She jumps in my vehicle and completely unloads on me how her dad made this rule, no dinner while she’s there. She was to sit in her room hungry and think about her behavior. Before she left, he told her just because she’s going home early doesn’t change her punishment. We arrived home and my wife was already aware of the no dinner rule, she was sent straight to her room. That’s when my wife and I had it out, as I told her that is a completely bullshit punishment that will give her an eating disorder. She said I was overstepping her father’s authority, to which I said it’s our house and the rules here are different. She pretty much went off on me, blaming me for being ‘friends’ with my stepdaughter and thus creating her bad behavior due to the lack of respect for authority. 

As my wife was cooking dinner that night, I took both girls out to dinner. Of course, she was livid and pretty much screamed at me as we left. The following nights, to avoid an argument I brought her dinner in her room. Last night my wife was out with friends, I ordered takeout. My wife arrived home to find the three of us eating dinner, she went off on me again and said I have no right superseding her authority like that. She again, blamed me for everything and went as far as saying she shouldn’t have given me another child to raise cause I’m incapable.

But I don’t think my life would be empty without them

Currently my household consists of 2 dogs (German shepherds) me, my husband, our two children (5 and 2) a few quail, chickens and rabbits, and the cats. 

I work from home most days (in the office twice) so I handle most of the animal care apart from those two days.

We adopted the cats after MIL had a health scare, I didn’t want to but she begged my husband…they’re ok.

Except; they don’t use their litter tray, we couldn’t risk them ruining our new flooring, they were meant to be indoor cats but they run out between our feet; I’ve had to clean up the remains of several birds and mice, it’s gross.

They rush under my feet into the kitchen and there’s fur on my kitchen sides; it’s gross, I don’t want this mess in my house when we’ve got small children, and even if we don’t have children I don’t like it.

So I got my BIL (my sisters husband) to build a cattery while my husband was visiting his mother last week, it’s essentially a warm shed with space for them to exercise; they’ve got like quarter  the garden which isn’t a small space by any means.

My husband said it was sneaky, underhanded and MIL was gutted when she got home that the cats were outside (they still get attention, not that they like it…they’re not people friendly tbh) they’ve got toys too.

I told my husband I’ve said several times I was unhappy but when I’d got home to find a dead bird where I prepare food they needed out.

They’re happy, but my husband is still upset so is MIL.

him,

We became roommates 3 years ago when we were both single. We are now both in committed relationships.
I have been scared of dogs my entire live. I have gotten better around dogs when they are on a leash (I no longer always cross the street just to avoid them) but I still really don't like entering a house or other confined space that has a dog in it. I know most dogs are really sweet but I really can't help feel very uncomfortable.

Problem:
Last summer we booked an upcoming family vacation (my parents, my youngest sister (S, 25F), A and her boyfriend (D, 30M), and my boyfriend (L, 29M) and I). We changed the usual (annual) date to accommodate A and D's travel plans for the next year.

The vacation is early next year. D's mother wants to travel in the same week and asked D to watch her dog. D is really fond of the dog and his mother doesn't want somebody else to watch the dog because it is very old.

A now wants to bring the dog on our vacation, to our shared rental, because D wants to watch the dog. Just thinking about  sharing the house with a dog stresses me out and I have told A this. She doesn't want to come on the vacation if D can't come. And D won't come without the dog.

I have mentioned to my family that I feel really uncomfortable with this situation, as I feel that I am being made to chose between being comfortable and having everybody there. My sister A is now mad at me, because I shared this with them (she was there, it wasn't behind her back). Because nobody else really opposes the dog being there, she feels like I am being difficult. She says that I only want the family to accommodate me and not her.

And that I knew she didn’t like eating fast food, so that I was a bad friend for allowing G to stop at McDonald’s. I told her that after G payed for our tickets plus drove us to the musical, she had the right to stop for a quick meal somewhere. I also said she could have ate one of the healthy snacks she packed instead. She kept calling me a bad friend and hong up, she is not replying to any of my calls or text ever since.

Last year, my brother lucked out and got a PS5 for regular price. Soon after, he bought PlayStation plus, which gave him some free games, due to owning a playstation.

Naturally, the new console was really cool, so I asked him if I could buy my own controller and my own games to play, if he wasn’t using it. He agreed, and peace reigned over the house. Now, he’s going to university soon, and taking the PS5 with him. I don’t have any objections, it’s his console.

However, some might know that PS+ has now separated into several tiers. We were defaulted to essential, the “lowest” tier. I want to get extra, which would give access to a huge catalog of games, many of which I would love to play. Because my brother already bought plus beforehand, I wanted to get essential with my own money, and place it onto his account. That way, we wouldn’t have to pay 2 separate fees. 

He thinks that this is dumb. He doesn’t want me to get plus, because; “I want full control over what is on the PlayStation.” It makes sense. It’s his console. However, I bought my own things for the console, including games, a controller, and a controller dock. Also note that I’m thinking of getting extra storage for the console, out of my own money. so, WIBTA if I got PS+E for Christmas?",True,False,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,4853902,public,top,self,WIBTA if I got PlayStation plus for Christmas?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zci0u0/wibta_if_i_got_playstation_plus_for_christmas/,all_ads,6,,,,

I am in internal medicine, he went into psychiatry. The incident in question happened on Thanksgiving. I did not get Thanksgiving off since I had a shift in the ICU this year, he had the day off for a holiday.

My grandma, who I was very close to, passed away last week the night before Thanksgiving. I was devastated. But since I found out at midnight, it was really late to look for someone to cover my ICU shift the next day, and I didn’t want to take someone who was supposed to have the holiday off to spend with family and then drag them in to cover my shift. So I managed to haul myself into work the next morning and kept it together. (I did ask my boss for the next day off to grieve and was granted it.) I had texted my boyfriend the night before to let him know she was not doing well and that she had agonal breathing (meaning she was about to pass away). The next morning at about 11:45 am I texted to let him know she was gone. I got no response from him. Literally everybody else I let know about my grandma got back to me, but nothing from him.

I called him after my shift ended at about 8:00 pm. He answered the phone like nothing happened. I actually asked him how he was doing, and he said fine. After a few awkward moments I asked if he had gotten my message, because I wasn’t sure if he had. He said he had, but hadn’t responded since he was at Thanksgiving dinner with his family. I clarified that he was at thanksgiving meal with his family for over 7 hours and couldn’t find the time to even send me a one liner message that he would call me later. I was so upset I told him i could not talk to him at that moment.

I called him back a few days later to discuss. He was not at all sorry. He said “you know I’m a bad texter.” I told him that I don’t accept incompetence as an excuse, especially not for something like this. He said he had intended to call me later that night. I asked him why he couldn’t have sent me one line to tell me that, he had no answer, said he “probably should have.” But would not apologize and stuck to the dinner with family story. Then he told me that now he’s pissed at me for being pissed at him.

            So this started yesterday when my SD (step dad) called me and ask to bring the reusable bags to him. Since no one would be home and I don't have a key I was a bit concerned over the safety of the house, but he told me about the houses slam lock so I can lock the door behind me. So I got lightly dressed and was omw. I gave him some bags and he asked for help so too most of them down with me. I was walking a bit slow so he complains about that and says I failed to be useful when we got there. He bought the wrong things and asked me to return them for some cookies. I go and customer service is closed so I just get the stuff he said he wanted and headed back. I forgot about the coupon and he complained about the coupon not being used. I own up and say I forgot and tell him we have tomorrow so I can do it in the morning. We agree and morning rolls around.


In morning I ask mom if any adjustments have been made she says she doesn't know so I ask SD. He now says he just want 1 milk to come back which. The CS (customer service) window is open so I go to and for the returns she returns everything except for 2 milks and says that 1 of the orders was bought on a visa I knew nothing about. (Because fuck me amirite?) I just grab the milk and try to pay with the coupon this time. However it was a 3 day sale (again I had NO knowledge of this coupon or when it expired) so I was just gonna pay retail l price this nice old guy pays it for me :D.

Kyle doesn't have much to do with with Mila. He takes her one weekend a month and he does pay child support. Here, child support is based on income, and if someone can't meet their own needs very well, they're not forced to pay much. I get it though, if he can't meet his own needs then he definitely can't meet the needs of a child. He pays £25 a week. It doesn't stretch that far. 

I work part time, for a small family restaurant where I'm paid under the table. Usually 1-2 days a week, but last week they were busy so I worked 4 days and got paid with a cheque. I got paid on a Friday evening and banks aren't open on a weekend, and it could take up to a week for the cheque to clear. 

My parents aren't in a position to help out with it being so close to Christmas so I decided Kyle would be the best person to ask. That ended up being a whole issue. I asked him would he mind just covering Milas food for the week, so not even asking him to send me hundreds, just a tiny bit extra so that the child he helped create is fed. 

He's saying no, that I should have a job that pays on a regular schedule like he does, and I'm trying to explain to him I do get paid regularly, just in cheque when it's over a certain amount. He tried telling me I should have savings for situations like this.

So now, I'm being a bitch to Kyle and reminding him that Mila is his baby too, and he's an immature prick if he's choosing going out and getting high over his child eating. He told me he doesn't care how I do things, but I shouldn't expect an extra penny off him when I ""trapped him"".

We're all in highschool and we've been a quartet since 8th grade and we have a group chat together and everything. 
Ever since school ended in June, I barely hung out with all 3 of them and we didn't really hang out as a group until a week before school started. I'm a swimmer and swim is a fall sport in my school so right after school, I'd have 2 hard hours of swim and then I'd go home. Sometimes I'd be home by 9pm because of a meet or whatever, but my schedule was very packed. 

During this time, the 3 of them hung out a ton. I wasn't bothered because I was busy, but as the season ended it kept happening more and more. They never invited me to anything and it wasn't just them. They'd plan to go places or hang out together with other mutual friends of ours and never invite me and I was really hurt. 

I had a really bad week around the beginning of November and I told a mutual friend, L, about everything I felt. L started drifting away from P and E and doesn't really like them for a similar reason, feeling left out. I told her everything and she had study hall with P later that day and L was talking pretty loud about what I told her and P heard everything.

M, E and P texted me ""hey ____ are you okay?""and I told all of them ""I'm fine"" and M and E were like ""okay lmk if you need anything"" but P really seemed to care and kept asking so I let her in on everything too and she was really sincere with an apology. Then I thought okay, now it's done. Nope. Now slowly, apparently people started talking about it.  E was VERY upset though. She was being short with me, wouldn't look at me and ignore me. Which was weird because I was the one who was upset. So I told P about it too.

She said she had been talking to E too and she had problems with me never telling them when something was wrong, and it's true and I accepted it. They ended up having a call with me and the 2 of them (M was pretty chill about it, she kinda just forgot whatever happened and was normal with me so she wasn't in the call). They said I get mad, get over it and act like everything is fine when they're still getting over it and I said sorry for that. but every time I brought up different places I felt left out, they had some excuse. but then we got everything off our chest and we were fine. or so I thought.

E is still being so short and it feels almost worse. they don't hang out without me but she always gives me these weird blocky smiles, never happy to see me anymore (we don't have classes together so we kinda drifted) and when we're in a group of people she ignores me. The other 2 are fine though so I'm still confused. At the end of the day, even if she was the main one doing wrong, I had to apologize and she never really did. I feel awful. 

I feel scared because I'm supposed to hang out with them in 3.5 hours (with a few other people too) so I hope it gets better but I'm not sure.

I have a male friend who's black, mid 20s, tall and athletic. I'll call him Tony. I don't know If this information is important, but I'm a white woman.

Tony, like every black person in our very mixed country, suffers from racism. People changing sidewalks when they see him, holding their belongings more tightly, glaring when he's wearing a hoodie. He is always obliged to leave the house well dressed and even so he has already been stopped by the police sometimes. Real crazy shit.

He has a great internal anger stored up because of this and I totally understand him.

But one thing he's been doing lately is stalking white people on the street, specially in the night. He thinks that all white people are necessarily racist, so when he sees a white person walking down the street, he follows them around for a while just to make them scared. He doesn't do anything else, he just ""accompanies"" the person. Occasionally he tells our friends of a girl who burst into nervous tears, and another who he swears on his feet wet his pants when he got too close.

I said that he is not wrong to feel all this anger, but it is wrong to do what he is doing. He can traumatize people that way. Not to mention that he can also get in trouble if he suddenly do this with the wrong person. I also told that he needs therapy to work this internalized feelings he have, it's not healthy.

Tony laughs and says that women are too coward, that he doesn't see a problem doing that, if they were scared without knowing him it's because they are racist and deserve to be traumatized. Since people feel fear without knowing him, then he wants to give a reason for it. He says I'm an ahole for not supporting this behavior, and that white people really needs to f*ck off.

I think I'm not being an asshole, I'm a woman and I'm afraid of anyone who follows me, even if it's another woman. I feel bad for him, but also for those poor girls he follows and scares around. I'm also considering dropping being friends with him because of this.

My mom is getting a new car, so I’m buying her old one from her with savings and once I do, I’m going to find a new job. 

Since the wreck, I’ve been pretty much laying in bed watching movies and relaxing. I haven’t been eating much because I really haven’t felt like it, I’ve just wanted to sleep and enjoy this impromptu time off. It feels like the first time I’ve gotten to breathe in months. My grandma and two of my aunts were all diagnosed with cancer within the last four months, and my grandma is pretty bad off. Additionally, I’ve been driving an hour and back every day to a job that sucked for at least the last five or six months. I’ve also been commuting 3 hours and back every other weekend to see my boyfriend because he lives in another state and his license is suspended. Honestly, all of this has drained me and when I wrecked I felt like I didn’t have anything left in me so I decided to just make the best of this time. I quit my job as I can no longer commute there and it was horrible anyway, my grandpa has agreed to come get me if I wish to visit my grandma or she needs anything, and my boyfriend is getting his license back this week.

But my step dad came to me and told me I was being lazy and good for nothing, and I needed to get up. He said that I should’ve been helping him fix his boat or clean his yard all week instead of laying down watching movies, and that I’m selfish for trying to enjoy this time when I should be doing something productive instead of just sleeping and eating. He told me that my grandma needs a caretaker and I’m a selfish brat for letting my grandpa do it on his own when I have nothing else to do. And that I’m taking the easy way out buying my mom’s car instead of financing a new car and learning the struggle of paying it off. He just went on and on, and I’m starting to think he’s right.

I (38M) like the yolk unbroken in my eggs. I like to dip toast into them and with an egg sandwich I like to use the bagel or English muffin to scoop it up.  

My wife Amy (34F) always breaks the yolk in the egg. That's her preference. She said she likes it neat, and I understand that.  

We have two kids, Derek (8M) and Tina (5F). When I make breakfast, I ask the kids how they want their yolks, broken or unbroken. They always say unbroken because they like dipping toast as well. I break Amy's because I know that's what she wants.  

When my wife makes breakfast, she breaks all four yolks. I've never said anything to her because I'm grateful that she makes breakfast. Last weekend, my son asked her to do his yolk unbroken. She raised her voice and told him she's not running a restaurant and doing special orders for one person. My daughter piped up and said she liked hers unbroken. She replied that was how we did eggs in this house.  

I later spoke to her privately and pointed out she was the only one who liked it broken so maybe she could just break hers. She told me that if I don't like it, I can cook breakfast myself (note: I cook breakfast 9/10 times). She posted a rant on Facebook about how I was encouraging our children to criticize her breakfast and just about everyone, reading her skewed version of things, sided with her.  

So yesterday, I made egg sandwiches and I left all 4 yolks unbroken. My wife picked hers up, went to take a bite, and yolk shot out all over her shirt. She looked and me and yelled, ""What the hell, Dave?!""  

I smiled and replied, ""I'm not running a restaurant and taking special orders for one person."" Both kids started laughing hysterically. Amy stormed out of the kitchen. She posted another rant on Facebook about how I had served her undercooked eggs, I knew the texture of yolk made her sick (10 years of marriage, and this is the first I've heard her say anything other than it's too much work to keep them intact), and I had booby trapped her sandwich to undermine her in front of her children.  

I told her to take it down and to stop refusing to accept any reality that doesn't paint her as a victim. She said that I was disrespectful to her and I owed her an apology in front of our children. I told her she was being ridiculous and we both did the exact same thing. She folded her arms and said, ""Except I'm right and you're wrong.""  

She has not taken down the post and there are dozens of comments calling me abusive, cruel, and manipulative.

After one day, he still wouldn't talk to us. Since we were scared of him if we tried to talk to him we ignored him instead. He has a habit of getting mad once we apologize. 

My mom tried to force us to talk to him but we refused and my dad said that we were ""disrespectful bastards"" and ""mother fuckers"" 

My brother slammed the door at them because he got pissed off with my mom forcing him to apologize while it was my dad's fault, according to him. My dad opened the door and said:

I was diagnosed as Bipolar when I was a teenager and the last two years have revealed that my mood swings have been intentionally triggered by my family. It all started with my decision to reach out to them via group chat. I sent my first text to the group January 2021 and my last December 2022. During this time, I was finally able to put my Psychology degree to use by appointing myself as the unsolicited group chat counselor. But it didn’t go as planned. I started off begging for us to get family counseling, but throughout this whole experience my family has been consistent with their claims that my efforts to heal our family unit is the result of my ‘manic episodes’. None of them know that I have an audio recorded memoir detailing my side of the whole experience.

I started my Spiritual journey a few years ago and shortly after that my Dark Night of the Soul began. At the time I didn’t know much about Spirituality, but at some point during our group chat my twin sister randomly told me I would never be the ‘Chosen One’, and that opened up a Pandora’s Box. I had never heard that term, in that context, before then. I’ve heard the term ‘Spiritual Warfare’ but until now I never had proof of its existence. My experience includes an unbelievable amount of narcissistic projection, gang stalking and it exposes several unsuccessful sacrifice attempts (for those who are Spiritually inclined). In my opinion, this was all done as a way to silence my voice. I’ve suffered in silence for 20 years, due to the belief that I was ‘crazy’, and I have finally found my voice. I’m using these experiences as a case study and I am choosing to share my findings in the format of a blog diary.

I know we live in a world that promotes the mantra of ‘what goes on in this house, stays in this house’. But that is an outdated ideology. And as embarrassing as it might be to speak my truth, I’ve decided to use my life as proof that there is a Spiritual aspect to mental health ‘disorders’.

So my 10 year old daughter confronted me on the truth about Santa. I kept trying to deflect, I asked her what she though? To which she kept saying I just don’t know, just tell me the truth! This went on for awhile, I kept just trying to turn it back on her. I told her I wasn’t going to lie to her. Eventually I cracked and just kinda made a face like yeah it’s true… it’s been me and dad.
She was pretty upset. Especially as the dominoes in her brain began to fall and she realized all the magical creatures she believed in were most likely not real. The Easter bunny, the elves, the switch witch.
Oddly she was most devastated about the leprechaun on St Patrick’s day, because her and her dad always make a trap to try to catch him.
I felt terrible. I feel like I just ripped away her innocence and belief of magic in the world.
But I do still think I did the right thing.
She is a super inquisitive kid, and she WOULD NOT let it go. She wanted the truth.
Also she’s 10, not 6.

So when my husband found out about this, he was super upset with me. He thinks first, I shouldn’t have caved… I should have just kept dodging the question. Left it a don’t ask don’t tell kind of thing. Two, I definitely shouldn’t have done it right before Christmas. And finally, he is the most mad that I didn’t include him in this conversation. He thinks I should have cleared it with him, and we should have talked to her together.

I feel bad about the whole thing. I was not prepared, and I’m heartbroken she doesn’t believe anymore. But I also think given the circumstances I did what I had to. She trusts me and comes to me when she wants answers. I don’t want to ruin that.

My grandpa was an abusive alcoholic. He was abusive to my grandma and his children growing up. Now all he does is sit in his room for all family gatherings or holidays. Yet I was always expected to help make him a plate or go say hi to him when he wouldn’t even care if I was there or not. Just an overall crabby entitled man. I have literally zero memories of this man doing anything for me or any of my other family. Unless they need to borrow money, of course he’s got a running tab. At the end of the day I hardly even know this man. 

My grandma. Oh my grandma. She has 6 girls 1 boy. We are a girl family. That meant gossip, comparing each other, the beauty Olympics, it was like mean girls except my grandma was Regina George. Everyone valued her opinion. And her opinion on me? “Oh honey, you’re too pretty to be fat.” A NINE YEAR OLD girl doesn’t need to hear that. Every time I showed up at her house it was “oh you lost/gained weight!” And I wasn’t doing anything except being a kid. And in hindsight, if you see a child’s weight fluctuate that much, it should be a health concern, not a vanity concern. (I have PCOS) I was always being compared to my cousins. “You don’t wear makeup like Sally* to school? You should.” “Oh Susie* is so talented she’s a greater singer, what about you, where’s your talent?” I had been a musician since before I could even read words. I went to college to be a music educator on scholarship. Everyone else got fancy toys and shoes and laptops and games for Xmas one year. My brother and I got a wall map. And even now that I’m older and pursuing my dream career it’s “well…that’s a lot of standing are you sure?” I NEVER. Got encouraged by my grandma ever. But everyone else puts her on a pedastal. She plays favorites all the time. My school is right by her house and my family gets mad I don’t see her more often but I feel no need to. She has never had anything positive to say to me and I have these things called boundaries now. And now that she’s getting worse I keep getting guilted by my family but they don’t understand how I see her and I don’t feel bad for not wanting to.

So I (13F) have been crushing on my friend ""Brian"" (14M) for almost a year and a half now. We have a great relationship, and we get along really well. He has a girlfriend (15F) who I haven't met but mutual friends have.

It's not like I outright hit on him or say anything about his girlfriend, but I've always been kind of flirty with him, and he does the same. Not like outright flirting, but slightly flirty in the relationship's nature. We definitely talk in a way that's different from my other guy friends. I don't really even think about it anymore, it's just how I talk to him.

Our mutual friend ""John"" (13M) has met Brian's gf, but believes that Brian likes me anyway. No one has any proof of this, nor has Brian actually said anything. I'm not sure I believe it. (You know I'd love to believe that, but I don't want him to dump her for me, or anyone- wouldn't want to screw up a relationship.)

I'm definitely slightly flirty, but not in a way that feels like it could be harmful to their relationship. I know that I'm definitely in the friendzone for now.

He's probably about 4 years old and has lived with my family for the majority of his life with just a short half year stint living in a different house. This staffy is not very well trained, he barely listens to them, sits under the table begging for food at dinner and jumps all over you, even at your face when you are at his level. But they think this is all fine even though we have told them he needs structure and boundaries for a safe, healthy life.

Anyway, he got into the sheep pen and grabbed a sheep by the leg, the family managed to get him out and technically the sheep died because the family didn't handle the injury properly so it succumbed to infection due to the injury. They decided this wasn't a problem and got a shock collar for the dog so he wouldn't get into the pens again. Fast forward a year or something and he gets into the pen again and this time he bites a sheep around the neck. The sheep survives, luckily because the family actually got a vet in straight away this time. Still fine, did nothing with the dog.

Now, I am fed up due to this latest incident. They have three dogs; The staffy, a rescue which seems to be a mix between a whippet and something else, and a pug x griffin. They went out and left the dogs alone at home, which is completely normal, and when they got back they found the pug x griffin lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood, the blood having been spread all over the floor. The little dog was in shock so they thought he was dead but saw he was still breathing. They took him to the vet and they tried everything they could but the poor thing ultimately died. They knew it was the staffy because when they bathed the dogs, his coat was saturated with blood, the other's was not. This staffy grew up with the pug x griffin from a puppy and they had lived together virtually his whole life. The only time they ever had snaps was at dinner time over food. This was so unexpected and we have no idea why it happened. So what did they do now that the dog has attacked two sheep and killed their family dog? Nothing. They did nothing. They said they didn't want to lose two dogs. I said they should put him down and my wife agrees. They said they wouldn't. So we told them we would not be bringing our little dog over anymore for his safety. It is sad because our little dog also knew the staffy from a puppy and they always enjoyed each other's company but I still have no idea why the dog snapped at the family dog so it doesn't seem safe. They seem to be upset over this and I do not understand why they think they have the right to be upset that I don't want to see my pup's blood staining the floor.
